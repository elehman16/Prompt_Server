The types of packing vary, with a wide range of individual preferences based more on tradition than evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is believed that packing of the EAC has several functions such as: adaptation and fixing the canal skin flap and skin grafts, prevention of adhesions, granulations, blunting or lateralization of grafts and maintaining the shape and volume of the fibro-cartilaginous part of the ear canal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Conversely, adverse reactions to ear packing have also been reported, namely patient discomfort, infection, hypersensitivity reactions and deformity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, patients having ear packing need a follow-up outpatient visit after surgery for removal of non-absorbable packs.</p><p>A study performed in children suggests that packing after ear surgery may be safely abandoned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In our practice we have seen many patients (particularly children) who remove the pack themselves almost immediately after surgery presumably due to discomfort with no adverse outcome noticed.</p><p>This raises the question of whether ear packing after middle ear surgery is beneficial. We performed a pilot study into the difference in recorded symptoms, clinical findings and audiometric outcomes between patients who have and do not have ear packing after major ear surgery as there were no comparable studies on which power calculations could be based.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Patients who gave informed written consent were recruited after obtaining the approval of the Southmead Hospital Research Ethics Committee. Ethical committee approval was given to recruit a total of 32 patients in this pilot study to provide data for a power calculation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria</title><p>Adults undergoing primary middle ear surgery with preservation of the posterior bony canal wall&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;closed cavity mastoidectomy were included. This specifically included patients undergoing myringoplasty, ossiculoplasty, stapedectomy or canal wall-up (combined approach) mastoidectomy. Surgical approaches included permeatal, endaural and postaural.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included patients with grossly abnormal ear canal anatomy, history of otological malignancy, immunosuppression and those unable or unwilling to return for follow-up. Patients undergoing meatoplasty, canalplasty or operations where no packing is currently used, e.g. grommets, were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomization</title><p>A column of numbers in the uniform random numbers table generated by the Numerical Algorithm Group routines quoted in Machin and Campbell&#x02019;s Statistical <italic>Tables for the Design of clinical trials</italic> was used in sequence to allocate consecutive trial recruits either to no pack when the column number was odd or pack when the column number was even for a total of 32 potential trial applicants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Surgical technique</title><p>A layer of absorbable gelatine sponge (Spongostan) was placed over the tympanic membrane and tympanomeatal flap, once these were positioned at the end of the surgery. The surgeon was then informed of the study decision whether to pack or not. The allocation was revealed by telephoning the study coordinator. Patients randomized to having ear packs had a 4&#x000a0;in. length of 1.25&#x000a0;cm wide ribbon gauze impregnated with bismuth iodoform paraffin paste (BIPP) inserted into the operated external ear canal at the end of the surgery. BIPP was chosen, as it is still one of the most widely used ear packs after middle ear surgery in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the other group, no ear pack was inserted. Ear packs were removed 3&#x000a0;weeks after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Three weeks following surgery, patients were asked to complete visual analogue scales (VAS) quantifying each of the three main symptoms: pain, discharge and itching (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Appendices 1</xref>, <xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">2</xref>&#x0201d;). The &#x02018;ear pack&#x02019; group patients were also asked to quantify the pain on pack removal. The clinician reviewing the patient completed the visual analogue scales, which quantified each of the three main signs: discharge, granulation tissue and erythema (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Appendices 1</xref>, <xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">2</xref>&#x0201d;). Clinicians also recorded their findings about the integrity and position (lateralized or not) of the tympanic membrane and the shape of the EAC (deformed or not) along with any evidence of meatal stenosis. Meatal stenosis was defined as a significant narrowing of external ear canal opening post-operatively impairing self-cleaning of EAC.</p><p>All patients were further reviewed at 3&#x000a0;months when the patients and clinicians again recorded visual analogue scores as above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Audiometric assessment</title><p>All patients had audiometric evaluation pre-operatively and 3&#x000a0;months post-operatively. This included air-conduction (AC) thresholds and bone-conduction (BC) thresholds with masking according to the British Society of Audiology guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. AC and BC obtained at the same time were used for calculating the air&#x02013;bone gap (ABG). AC and BC were checked at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3&#x000a0;kHz according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. When thresholds at 3&#x000a0;kHz were not available, they were replaced with 4&#x000a0;kHz.

Though ear packing has been suggested to help avoid ear canal deformity or external ear canal stenosis post-operatively by stabilizing the grafts and skin flaps, one might argue that there is also a risk of inadvertently disturbing the graft during the packing process with a subsequent chance of graft displacement during pack removal. In our pilot study, two patients in the no ear pack group had persistent perforations after surgery. One patient had a subtotal perforation, which was closed using tragal cartilage with perichondrium. The other patient had a butterfly inlay cartilage graft for a small central perforation. The size of the perforation has been reported as an important factor influencing the success rate of the procedure and is better in patients with smaller perforations than those with large perforations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The success rate for butterfly graft myringoplasty is also variable and lies between 43 and 100&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, one might argue that the persistent perforation seen in these two patients might be related to the size of the perforation and technique used for closure rather than the absence of a BIPP pack. The patient in the ear pack group who had a persistent perforation post-operatively underwent the procedure using temporalis fascia graft with underlay technique.</p><p>The three most commonly used surgical approaches to the middle ear and mastoid are: transcanal, endaural and postauricular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Soft tissue dissection in and around the external ear canal opening is an important surgical step to achieve access with both endaural and postaural approaches, thus raising the possibility of an adverse outcome like narrowing or stenosis if no post-operative ear pack is used. In our pilot study, patients in both groups were operated through permeatal, endaural or postaural approaches with no significant difference seen in either post-operative ear canal deformity or meatal stenosis between both groups. Hiroven et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] study of patients undergoing stapes surgery via a permeatal approach also found no significant disadvantage to not packing the ears.</p><p>There are various types of ear packs used in middle ear surgery. Non-absorbable packs include pope wick, silastic sheet, ribbon guaze mixed with antibiotic and/or antiseptic ointments or creams and the time-honoured BIPP packs. Absorbable packs can be in the form of either gelatin sponge (Spongostan) or Tri-Adcortyl/Polyfax ointment. Non-absorbable packs are usually removed in the first 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;weeks after surgery. This is usually done in outpatient clinics without any anaesthetic. The procedure can be uncomfortable. Other risks include bleeding and displacement of grafts if it is tethered to the pack. In a study by Zeitoun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], BIPP packs were found to be very uncomfortable for patients post-operatively. They were also fairly painful to remove. In our small study there was an expression of pain measured on the VAS score during pack removal, however as there was no control, the significance of this cannot be ascertained from our trial.</p><p>Borgstein et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] retrospective paediatric study of 107 patients did not report any significant adverse findings related to not packing the ears. They had an infection rate of 7.5&#x000a0;%, all of whom were managed successfully with topical antibiotics. In our pilot study, two patients from the no ear pack group presented with ear infection before their intended 3&#x000a0;weeks outpatient appointment. Both were managed successfully with topical eardrops and did not have any adverse outcome recorded at their 3&#x000a0;month appointments. One patient in the ear pack group also had a high clinician VAS (cumulative VAS score: 238&#x000a0;mm) recorded after his pack removal at 3&#x000a0;weeks indicating that there was an external ear canal infection, but as his ear canal was occluded with an ear pack, no external ear discharge was noted by the patient. Therefore using ear packing does not abolish the risk of a post-operative ear infection.</p><p>We used cumulative VAS in our pilot study as this has been shown to be reliable in determining the extent of post-operative symptoms. This has been used successfully by one of the authors to assess ear blockage, pain, itch and discharge in patients with otitis externa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>When packing is placed in the EAC, a unilateral hearing loss due to blockage of sound transmission and loss of external ear resonance is expected. For most patients, this is usually not concerning as it is accepted as a temporary effect, but when the operated ear is the only hearing ear or better hearing ear, this might be a more significant problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Whilst a degree of hearing impairment is likely to occur as a result of blood clots and exudates, this is likely to be exacerbated by placing packing in the ear canal. Cho et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] in their study on the effect of ear packing on hearing have reported a significant increase in AC and ABG (&#x0003e;40&#x000a0;db) with ear packs in situ. We did not study the effect of the ear pack whilst in situ on hearing.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Weakness of the study</title><p>As this is a small pilot study of 32 patients, there is a risk of type &#x00399;&#x00399; error, i.e. failure to demonstrate a difference in the outcome measures between both groups when such a difference may actually exist.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Power calculation</title><p>Analysis of quantitative variables, i.e. clinician VAS scores at 3&#x000a0;months using the independent samples <italic>t</italic> test (assuming equal variances) shows that the observed differences in mean changes is not significant.
