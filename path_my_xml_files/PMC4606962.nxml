Narrative communication may provide an enhancement to traditional smoking cessation interventions like NRT, medications, or behavioral treatments for this audience. After extensive pilot testing of stories and personal experiences with smoking cessation from African-Americans from a low-income community, we conducted a randomized control trial using stories to augment routine inpatient treatment among African-Americans at an urban Southern hospital (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;300).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Differences in smoking cessation outcomes between the intervention (stories DVD&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;routine clinical treatment) and control (routine clinical treatment) arms were compared using self-report and carbon monoxide measurement at 6-months. Compared to control, individuals who viewed the intervention stories DVD reported greater intentions to quit. Although continuous quitting marginally favored the intervention, our main result did not reach statistical significance (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.16).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Narrative communication via storytelling to promote smoking cessation among African-Americans in the South is one method to communicate smoking cessation. Results suggest this may not be sufficient as a stand-alone augmentation of routine clinical treatment for continuous smoking cessation. Smoking cessation efforts need to continually assess different means of communicating to smokers about quitting.</p><p>Clinical Trials Registration: The ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier is NCT00101491.

Although more than 70&#x000a0;% of African-American adult smokers indicate that they want to quit smoking, prevalence of cessation is still higher among Whites than among African-Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, compared to Whites, African-American smokers are less likely to report having been told by their doctor to quit smoking and less likely to have resources to aid in quitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, smoking rates increase for African-Americans at lower educational levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and rates are higher in the South (21&#x000a0;% in 2010) compared to other regions of the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is important to understand interventions that can motivate African-Americans to stop smoking to reduce these disparities.</p><p>An increasing body of literature suggests narrative communication, or storytelling, may be an effective means to promote behavior change in African-American communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and sharing of peer experiences can be effective for smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Storytelling is a critical part of the African-American oral tradition and culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and the difficulties associated with smoking cessation among African-Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], lend to the potential to use narratives as a way to enhance traditional smoking cessation interventions. This study represents a randomized control trial of personal stories and narratives to increase smoking cessation behaviors previously piloted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] among African-Americans and offers considerations for the effectiveness of narratives for cessation interventions.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Narrative communication for behavior change</title><p>The persuasiveness of narrative communication lies in the extent to which it can engage the viewer through realism and homophily, or similarity between that which is portrayed and the viewer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The underlying assumption is hearing a person&#x02019;s story or experience is considered credible and trustworthy, therefore can potentially motivate and persuade individuals towards behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. By sharing stories that feature someone to whom the viewer can relate, it reduces counter-arguing and resistance to the message [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Stories can add meaning to health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and help viewers visualize themselves engaging in actions taking place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The use of narratives in traditional health intervention is being used frequently in health promotion and interventions for African-Americans. In a previous randomized trial, Houston et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] found DVDs of African-Americans sharing their stories managing hypertension resulted in significant improvements in blood pressure for patients with baseline uncontrolled hypertension. Further, rural African-American women exposed to stories of hope from African-American cancer survivors increased their use of breast self-examination and mammography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In a separate, smaller study, African-Americans with diabetes who received a culturally sensitive intervention including storytelling showed a trend towards improvements in self-care, goal attainment, and empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Thus, narrative communication provides a way to discuss health behavior changes among African-Americans. However, we found no published research trials using storytelling for smoking cessation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Modeling of behavior for smoking cessation via peer experiences</title><p>As smoking cessation can be a hard and arduous process, hearing from African-Americans with similar experiences and struggles with smoking cessation may be beneficial to other African-American smokers towards behavior change. Narrative communication can provide the personal and peer experience that is valuable in helping others learn and make life decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recently, the CDC is using peer experiences on smoking as part of a mass media campaign to increase awareness of government smoking cessation resources; preliminary results show the effort and focus on peer experiences to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>An added persuasive element of narrative communication is the ability to show others, or model, experiences associated with a behavior. Following the tenets of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] that individual behavior is inherently situated in social interactions and that observational behavior can lead to behavior change, narrative communication lends itself to enabling modeling and observational learning to occur through the telling of personal experiences. Given the difficulty in smoking cessation for many African-Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], SCT can help identify key concepts that can contribute to the modeling of smoking cessation behaviors. In particular, self-efficacy and outcome expectancies are important towards intentions to quit smoking. Viewing stories by fellow African-Americans can offer others a way to enhance expectations that they are capable of quitting, or increase perceptions of self-efficacy as well as increasing expectations that a positive outcome will occur such as maintaining a quit rate (outcome expectancies).</p><p>In addition, peer experiences can address culturally relevant experiences for African-Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In 2008, clinical guidelines on smoking cessation interventions included a recommendation for increased attention to augmenting routine clinical care with the development and evaluation of smoking cessation interventions for racial and ethnic minorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A key aspect of these interventions focusing on racial and ethnic populations is ensuring the cultural relevance of their studies for the population. Narratives by peers that have successfully quit smoking are one way to address cultural norms and sensitivities that may be important challenges and barriers to smoking cessation. For instance, a culturally tailored DVD intervention reported higher rates of smoking cessation for those who both viewed the tailored intervention and identified with the race of the storyteller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Taken together, we hypothesize:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>African-American smokers receiving the Storytelling DVD intervention in addition to routine clinical treatment will be more likely to report positive intentions to quit compared to smokers in a control group receiving routine clinical treatment and an attention control DVD.</p></list-item><list-item><p> African-American smokers receiving the Storytelling DVD intervention will be more likely to quit smoking at 2-week and 6-month post-intervention, compared to those patients in the control DVD group at 2-week and 6&#x000a0;month follow-up.</p><p>To present an ideal time to present a smoking cessation intervention, we focused on patients with chronic illness at an urban Southern hospital. Individuals hospitalized may feel more susceptible and vulnerable to negative outcomes associated with smoking, and therefore more open to smoking cessation efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We therefore hypothesize:</p></list-item><list-item><p> Success of the smoking cessation intervention will be modified by self-reported health status in the hospital.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>A randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the impact of an interactive storytelling DVD on processes of change and 6-month cessation rates for these low-income, low-literacy, African-American smokers with chronic illnesses. The DVD was provided as an augmentation of standard medical care. As the majority of these smokers were not preparing to quit or actively quitting, this Storytelling DVD trial can be considered a cessation induction intervention designed to motivate patients to quit, regardless of their readiness to quit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p>Medical teams from the inpatient wards at an urban, safety net hospital in the Southern U.S. referred African-American smokers to the research team from April 2006 to December 2008.

After providing consent, participants: (a) completed a baseline survey; (b) received tobacco cessation information via brief counseling based on their responses to readiness to quit; (c) were provided a DVD player to use in the hospital room and to take home to assure access to the DVD after discharge; and (d) viewed either the intervention DVD or control DVD as determined by block randomization. The face-to-face baseline survey determined smoking habits as well as general health status and a pre-behavioral self-reported assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomization</title><p>For randomization we used blocks of 10 to balance allocation. Randomization was concealed for the patient as all participants received an interactive DVD. Only half received the one with Stories. We did not reveal that the goal of the intervention was to study storytelling, so all participants received an &#x0201c;intervention.&#x0201d; Further, the DVDs (intervention and control) were ordered in the order of the randomization table, and the intervention or control DVD placed inside and sealed. Thus, randomization status was concealed for the research staff until the seal on the DVD was broken. The staff conducting follow-up calls was different than recruiting staff, and these staff were blinded to intervention or control status.</p><p>The DVD intervention was provided as an <italic>augmentation</italic> of standard medical care in the hospital (and follow-up outpatient care), including smoking cessation counseling and treatments including nicotine replacement therapy. The inpatient clinical providers and teams were responsible for choosing nicotine-replacement therapy and other pharmaceutical treatments, and could also provide brief counseling and patient education materials. We monitored the care received by patients using chart review.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data collection</title><p>The research assistant administering the baseline hospital survey was blinded to intervention or control status until the DVD was opened. After patients viewed the intervention or control DVD, a follow-up survey was immediately conducted to assess participants&#x02019; level of engagement with the video, as well as the influence of the video on intentions to change smoking behavior. For completing the hospital interview, patients received a DVD player and a copy of the intervention or control DVD. Participants were not required to view the entire DVD, but were asked to explore the interactive menus for as long as they wished. The protocol was approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board and the review board of Cooper Green Mercy Hospital. The entire study procedure took approximately 60&#x000a0;min.</p><p>Patients were followed-up by phone at 2&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months after the baseline hospital interview to assess self-reported smoking status. For each survey, patients received a $15 gift card. After the 6-month telephone interview, patients who reported quitting were asked to confirm cessation by carbon monoxide validation at the hospital for which they received a $15 gift card for their time and transportation costs. Additional patient data was abstracted from the medical record by blinded, trained abstractors with a structured medical record review instrument using the publicly available MedQuest software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>The intervention DVD</title><p>A DVD-delivered intervention was developed that included current and former smokers discussing their stories of smoking cessation. Participants featured in the DVD were recruited from the same urban, safety net hospital that was used for the subsequent randomized trial. Details of the development protocol have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The four storytellers, or stories, included in the DVD represented clear messages linked to concepts from SCT, including direct verbal persuasion, outcome expectations, outcome expectancies, and direct experience. After each 5-min story, a &#x0201c;Learn More&#x0201d; didactic segment harkened back to the story and emphasized the key persuasive content. The &#x0201c;Learn More&#x0201d; content branched into ready to quit and thinking of quitting content to maintain smoking cessation guideline-concordant information and designed to augment the information highlighted in the stories (e.g., talking to your doctor, family, motivation, using patches, identifying reasons to quit) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Following the stories and &#x0201c;Learn More&#x0201d; segments, viewers could choose between two further educational videos targeted to their readiness to quit smoking (one entitled &#x0201c;Thinking about Quitting&#x0201d; and one &#x0201c;Ready to Quit Plan&#x0201d;).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>The control DVD</title><p>An attention-control DVD was developed that included five brief health-related mini-lectures (e.g., non-culturally tailored, non-narrative, and non-tobacco-related).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Measures</title><p>Immediately after viewing the DVD, smokers&#x02019; level of engagement with the DVD was measured using a Video Transportation Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], a modification of the original Green and Brock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] scale (5 of items). To measure the delivery and dose of the intervention, participants were asked to report how many stories, &#x0201c;Learn More&#x0201d; segments, and quit plans they had viewed.

While the intervention did not increase quit rates at 6-months, results do suggest that patient narratives delivered via interactive DVD combined with current cessation treatment in a hospital setting may be an effective means to move the needle on intention to quit among hospitalized African-American smokers.</p><p>Immediately after watching the storytelling or control DVD, participants were asked a set of seven behavioral intentions that we predicted might be motivated to perform, and would be influenced by the DVD. The questions allow us to understand the proximal internal behavioral motivations of the patients, and understand the comparative impact the DVD may have had on these motivated processes. Uniformly, patients expressed higher endorsement of all seven intentions immediately after watching the DVD. Thus, looking into the &#x0201c;black box&#x0201d; and trying to understand how the DVD is working, we find that engagement in the stories increased initial motivation, and intention to quit was sustained at 2&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Compared to participants in the control group, participants in the intervention group had increased intention to quit smoking and readiness to quit at 2&#x000a0;weeks. In this study, the brief intervention was designed to come from African-American community members in the form of a story. Several studies provide evidence for narrative communication as a mechanism of behavior change, ranging from prevention and cancer screening to chronic disease management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Taken together, the results from the current study and others suggest storytelling can produce change in theory-based constructs linked to behavior change, although difference in 6&#x000a0;month cessation was not found.</p><p>Results from this study also support and advance previous literature suggesting that capitalizing on a teachable moment, in this case hospitalized smokers who perceive themselves in poor health, may enhance the likelihood of success in a smoking cessation intervention. The phrase &#x0201c;teachable moment&#x0201d; has been used to describe &#x0201c;naturally occurring health events thought to motivate individuals to spontaneously adopt risk-reducing behaviors&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A recent Cochrane review demonstrated that when smokers are hospitalized, for example, intensive counseling plus 1&#x000a0;month follow-up increased the odds of smoking cessation by 65&#x000a0;% 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months after hospital discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, these findings held up regardless of the reason for hospital admission. While hospitalization may generally represent a teachable moment for smoking cessation, the results from the current study nevertheless suggest that assessing how a patient self-rates their own health status may help identify those for whom the teachable moment may be particularly salient.</p><p>All studies have limitations. As we report, we had some loss to follow-up, and were not able to carbon monoxide verify every smoker. There is the possibility that participants did not relate to the storyline or the characters presented on the DVD which may then have affected quit rates. Because both intervention and control smokers received high levels of brief advice and educational materials, the standard care may have been stronger that the relative impact of the DVD intervention. Also, our study was only powered to detect a difference of 13&#x000a0;% of 6-month cessation. A larger sample size would have had more power to significantly detect the four percent difference in carbon monoxide verified cessation in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This intervention used narrative communication and storytelling to create a smoking cessation intervention for hospitalized, low-income African-Americans living in an urban setting in the South. While the results suggest this approach may be insufficient as a stand-alone intervention, it may, nevertheless, be a step in the right direction by increasing intention to quit, particularly among those who perceive themselves to be in poor health. While the intervention was specialized to a specific population, this did allow us to develop a locally-targeted intervention to enhance potential effectiveness for a specific community. It was designed to be brief, and interactive to increase viewers&#x02019; engagement and to avoid being overly didactic. However, brief interventions aimed at smoking cessation tend to require some follow-up counseling or support in order to effect change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Future studies should explore whether a brief storytelling intervention for hospitalized smokers could be augmented by subsequent outpatient behavioral counseling and support to improve smoking cessation rates long-term. In this study, the intervention&#x02019;s brevity and low intensity may have been a significant limitation. Also, the use of carbon monoxide to indicate sustained abstinence and the limited self-report measures may have contributed to the non-significant findings.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Practice implications</title><p>Results from this study offer further evidence towards smoking cessation programs and augmenting current practices with additional communication means. Storytelling, and specifically the sharing of peer-experiences, highlights an additional avenue to pursue for smoking cessation program. The difficulties associated with smoking cessation, and maintaining a quit rates, indicate that peer experiences may benefit others in long term success. Smoking cessation programs may want to investigate the use of peer experiences in future endeavors.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviation</title><def-list><def-item><term>SCT</term><def><p>social cognitive theory</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AC, PF, CK, JA, CK, &#x00026; TH contributed to the conception and design, acquisition of data, and analysis and interpretation of data.
