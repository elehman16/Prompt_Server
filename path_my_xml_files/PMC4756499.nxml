Femoroacetabular impingement can now be better treated by hip arthroscopy but it is unclear what postoperative rehabilitation of hip arthroscopy should look like. Several rehabilitation protocols have been described, but none presented clinical outcome data. These protocols also differ in frequency, duration and level of supervision. We developed a rehabilitation protocol with supervised physical therapy which showed good clinical results and is considered usual care in our treatment center. However, it is unknown whether, due to the relatively young age and low complication rate of hip arthroscopy patients, rehabilitation based on self-management might lead to similar results. The aims of this pilot study are (1) to determine feasibility and acceptability of the self-management intervention, (2) to obtain a preliminary estimate of the difference in effect between physical therapy aimed at self-management versus usual care physical therapy in patients who undergo hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Thirty participants (aged 18&#x02013;50 years) scheduled for hip arthroscopy will be included and randomized (after surgery) to either self-management or usual care physical therapy in this assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial.

In particular, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) has been recognized as common cause of hip pain and dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The incidence of FAI in the general population has been reported to range from 4&#x000a0;% in healthy women to 24&#x000a0;% in healthy men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, 23&#x000a0;% of people with radiographically confirmed FAI complain of hip pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. FAI occurs when the proximal femoral head does not permit normal range of motion in the acetabular socket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This impingement can be based on abnormal morphology of the femoral head (cam impingement), acetabular rim (pincer impingement) or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. FAI can cause other intra-articular hip pathology, such as labral pathology and chondral damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is also thought to lead to development of secondary osteoarthritis of the hip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. One of the most commonly used options to treat FAI over recent years has been hip arthroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This arthroscopic technique is often performed to treat intra-articular hip pathology and the number of procedures performed has increased considerably over the last 10&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Due to the development of hip arthroscopy, FAI can now be better treated with fewer complications and a faster rehabilitation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>It is unclear which type of rehabilitation is most beneficial for the postoperative FAI population. Several postoperative rehabilitation protocols have been described which all include physical therapy treatment and exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Yet, therapy goals, frequency and duration of these protocols differ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. More importantly, the studies describing these rehabilitation protocols provide little to no information with regard to clinical outcome data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Only a few case studies have described clinical outcome data for postoperative interventions in hip arthroscopy patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. So, the clinician can choose from different rehabilitation protocols, but there is little information on the effects achieved. Based on the differences in existing rehabilitation protocols and the lack of clinical outcome data we developed a rehabilitation protocol for hip arthroscopy patients. This protocol combines information retrieved from the available medical literature on postoperative rehabilitation with the clinical experience of the lead researcher (MT) and orthopedic surgeon (EV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The protocol has been satisfactorily used as usual care in clinical practice over the last 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Current results of this protocol show that at a mean follow-up time of 2.3&#x000a0;years after surgery, 81&#x000a0;% of patients reported improvement on the Global Perceived Effect (GPE) Scale and 84&#x000a0;% returned to sports activities. A full recovery of hip functional performance, as measured with balance and hop tests, was established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The majority of the available rehabilitation protocols (including our own) are based on supervised physical therapy with a small, additional home-based exercise program. A self-management strategy (i.e., increasing the home-based exercise program and decreasing supervision) would lead to a more cost-effective and widely applicable rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Rehabilitation based on self-management might be adequate as hip arthroscopy is often performed in a young to middle aged, healthy population with little risk of complications. Until now this has not been prospectively investigated. Currently, one randomized controlled trial into the efficacy of postoperative physical therapy for FAI is underway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, these authors compare physical therapy versus a control group (one in-hospital physical therapy visit combined with an information brochure) instead of a self-management group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A comparison between physical therapy aimed at self-management and usual care physical therapy in patients treated for FAI by means of hip arthroscopy seems warranted. Because of the lack of earlier randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this field executing a pilot controlled study into the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness is necessary before planning and conducting a larger-scale RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The aims of this pilot study are (1) to determine feasibility and acceptability of the self-management intervention, (2) to obtain a preliminary estimate of the difference in effect between two rehabilitation strategies, self-management versus usual care physical therapy (according to the developed protocol), in patients who undergo hip arthroscopy for FAI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study protocol describes a parallel-designed, two-arm, assessor-blinded RCT. Outcomes will be assessed at 6, 14, 26 and 52&#x000a0;weeks after surgery in which the 14-week assessment will be the main outcome assessment. The study protocol has been developed based on the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The study design was approved by the local ethics committee; Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek (CMO) Arnhem-Nijmegen (2015-1730) and registered with the Dutch Trial Registry (NTR5168) on 8 May 2015. All participants will be asked to sign informed consent before start of the study (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 30 participants (18&#x02013;50 years of age) scheduled for hip arthroscopy at Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem, The Netherlands, and living in the near proximity of this hospital (less than 50 kilometers) will be included in this study. Participants are eligible if (1) they have experienced hip/groin pain for at least 3&#x000a0;months, (2) are diagnosed with FAI by one of two orthopedic surgeons (ET/MW) based on symptoms, clinical signs and imaging findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], (3) are willing to sign informed consent, and (4) are willing to participate in the rehabilitation program at Sports Medical Center Papendal (SMCP), Arnhem, The Netherlands.

This is part of usual preoperative care. At the preoperative intake assessment all participants will be informed about the study (including information on both interventions). Two weeks after this assessment participants will be contacted by the lead researcher (MT) in order to inform the researcher whether they want to participate in the study. If so, they are invited for a baseline assessment 2 to 4&#x000a0;weeks before surgery. At this assessment (BD) they will also receive instructions about direct postoperative treatment and sign an informed consent (MT). Surgery will be performed by one of two surgeons (EV/MW) at Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem, The Netherlands. Randomization will occur directly after surgery. Participants will be divided into two groups (self-management group versus usual care physical therapy group) which will both be treated by the same physical therapist (MT). The self-management group will receive physical therapy treatment once every 2&#x000a0;weeks (weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14) leading to a total of seven sessions in 14&#x000a0;weeks whereas the usual care physical therapy group will receive physical therapy treatment twice a week over 14&#x000a0;weeks (24 sessions). The self-management group will be asked to perform an additional home-based exercise program three times per week. The usual care physical therapy group will be asked to perform a similar program once a week. Participants in the self-management group who report a deterioration on the International Hip Outcome Tool 33 (IHOT-33) at 6&#x000a0;weeks after surgery compared to the baseline/preoperative measurement or who experience complications from surgery, as described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, will be offered a transition to the usual care physical therapy group. In case of (serious) adverse events further participation of the study will be decided on by consultation with the responsible surgeon and participant. No adverse events or serious adverse events are expected. In case of (serious) adverse events the responsible surgeon will be in charge of treatment immediately. All adverse events will be documented by the main researcher (MT). Re-assessment will be performed by one blinded assessor (BD) and will occur at 6, 14, 26 and 52&#x000a0;weeks after surgery. A flow chart of the study procedure is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of study procedure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1222_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Blinding and randomization</title><p>The surgeons (EV/MW) and assessor (BD) executing the assessments will be blinded to group allocation. The statistician (ST) will be blinded to group allocation until completion of the statistical analysis. However, it is impossible to blind the physical therapist (MT) executing the rehabilitation protocol and the study participants. Participants will be asked not to reveal group allocation when visiting the orthopedic surgeon postoperatively as well as when undergoing follow-up measurements by the blinded assessor (BD). Before randomization, participants will be asked to state group preference. This information will be used to later investigate whether group preference influenced study results.</p><p>Randomization is done on the individual level through a computer-generated random-sequence table. Pre-stratification is applied for gender. Opaque, sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes are prepared for each stratum (that is, gender) by a researcher (RC) who is not involved in enrolling the participants, in assigning them to their groups or performing follow-up measurements. Every envelope will contain a paper indicating the treatment allocation. Participants will receive their envelope during the first consultation with the physical therapist after surgery (2&#x000a0;weeks postoperative).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Hip arthroscopy procedure and immediate postoperative care</title><p>Arthroscopy will be performed by one of two orthopedic surgeons (EV/MW) with respectively 10 and 3&#x000a0;years of experience in this field of expertise. Spinal needles are placed under image intensifier control to mark the anterior and anterolateral portals. Guide wires and cannulated trocars will be used to introduce cannulae, arthroscopes, and other instruments. A 70&#x000b0; arthroscope will be used to adequately visualize the acetabulum, acetabular labrum, ligaments and the anterior, superior, and posterior aspects of the femoral head. These areas of the hip will be inspected and also probed to assess labral attachment and articular cartilage softening. Pincer-type impingement is typically found in the superior anterior quadrant and will be identified when there is bone overgrowth, a pincer projection causing labral displacement or a crossing sign to be seen over the labrum with fluoroscopy. In order to establish cam-type impingement, traction will be released and the peripheral compartment will be investigated. Cam-type impingement will be defined during arthroscopic physical examination, especially during flexion and internal rotation and by the presence of local abnormalities coherent with cam-type impingement, such as chondral lesions. In all cases in which surgically treatable pathology is identified such treatment will be performed arthroscopically. Immediate postoperative care will be the same for both groups. Participants will stay in the hospital for one night. They will receive a visit from the physical therapist in the hospital in order to improve gait function with crutches and obtain initial advice for the first postoperative week at home. A follow-up visit with the orthopedic surgeon will be scheduled 6&#x000a0;weeks after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study interventions</title><p>Physical therapy treatment at SMCP will start 2&#x000a0;weeks after surgery for both groups.

The IHOT-33 score consists of 33 questions, regarding hip disease and quality of life, each scored on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with 0 representing the worst and 100 representing the best score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A final score is calculated by summing up the scores of all questions answered and dividing it by the number of questions answered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Earlier studies have shown that this a reliable and valid questionnaire specifically developed for use in a young population with intra-articular hip pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The SLST consists of a squat task in which a subject stands on one leg on a 20-cm box with arms folded across their chest. The subject then squats down to a 60&#x000b0; knee angle five times at rate of one squat per 2&#x000a0;seconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This performance is scored based on five criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and has shown good inter- and intra-rater reliability in a population of subjects with hip pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Other outcomes</title><p>Other outcomes consist of patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires, functional performance tests and general patient information. Three PRO questionnaires will be used, namely the Modified Tegner Activity Scale, the Hip Sports Activity Scale (HSAS) and Global Perceived Effect Scale (GPE). The Modified Tegner Activity Scale measures general physical activity level based on a 0 to 10 scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The HSAS measures sports activity level on a similar 0 to 10 scale and is specifically developed for hip patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Both questionnaires have been shown to have good reliability and validity in populations with lower extremity injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The GPE will be used to measure the participants&#x02019; perceived change. This scale measures perceived change following treatment on a six-point ordinal scale. It has shown good validity in monitoring individual improvement after interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>In order to establish functional performance the following quantitative measurements will be executed: hip ROM measurements, hip strength measurements, the Single Leg Hop Test and the Star Excursion Balance Test.

The primary aims are to establish feasibility, acceptability and to obtain an estimate of the difference in effect between the self-management and usual care physical therapy group. A testing strategy for difference in effect of the primary outcomes IHOT-33 and SLST will be pre-specified as follows: first, IHOT-33 will be tested at the 0.05 level and if statistically significant (and only then) SLST will be tested (hierarchical testing at significance level 0.05). The pre-specification allows for valid inference on the primary endpoints. The other endpoints will be analyzed descriptively. An explorative analysis for the effects adjusted for age and subgroup of FAI (as diagnosed perioperatively) will be executed. Changes from baseline to different time points will be analyzed with analysis of covariation (ANCOVA) (baseline as covariate) providing an estimate of the effects and its 95&#x000a0;%-confidence interval. Descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations (SDs) at each time point of each outcome will be reported.
