Study outcomes included the duration of diarrhea, the recovery from diarrhea, and the tolerability and acceptance of the treatment. The proportion of patients without diarrhea over the study period was greater in the synbiotic group than in the control group at all study time points, showing a statistically significant difference on the fifth day (95% vs 79%, p &#x0003c; 0.001). The duration of diarrhea (median and interquartile range) was reduced by 1 day in the synbiotic-treated patients (3 [2-5] vs 4 [3-5], p = 0.377). The tolerability of the treatment regimen, as evaluated by the parents, was significantly better in those receiving the synbiotic than in the control group. Overall, 96% of the parents of children receiving the synbiotic reported being satisfied to very satisfied with the treatment regimen. The results of this study indicate that the addition of the synbiotic Prodefen&#x000ae; is a well-tolerated and well-accepted approach that provides an additional benefit to the standard supportive therapy in the management of acute viral diarrhea in children.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acute diarrhea</kwd><kwd>probiotic</kwd><kwd>synbiotic</kwd><kwd>Prodefen</kwd><kwd>children</kwd><kwd>tolerability</kwd><kwd>efficacy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2333794X16679587"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a common illness that occurs worldwide. It has been defined by the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) as a decrease in the consistency of stools (loose or liquid) and/or an increase in the frequency of evacuations (typically &#x02265; 3 in 24 hours), with or without fever or vomiting. The most common cause of acute diarrhea is a viral infection, most frequently caused by rotavirus. It usually lasts less than 1 week and not longer than 2 weeks and occurs throughout the year, with a fall and winter predominance. Acute viral diarrhea accounts for most bouts of diarrhea in developed countries, with an incidence of 0.5 to 2 episodes per child per year in healthy European children younger than 3 years of age<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and is associated with substantial health care costs.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The aim of treatment is to prevent or reverse dehydration, shorten the duration of the illness (important for preventing progression to persistent diarrhea, which is associated with adverse outcomes such as malnutrition), and reduce the period during which a person is infectious. The standard recommended treatment is based on diet and rehydration therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Probiotics have been defined as microorganisms that exert beneficial effects on human health when they colonize the bowel. They have been demonstrated to be efficacious for the treatment of diarrhea of suspected viral origin<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr5-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> as well as for antibiotic-associated diarrhea<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> by reducing the duration of the diarrhea and, additionally, as demonstrated in recent systematic reviews, reducing stool frequency.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr5-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Although less well-demonstrated, some randomized clinical trials suggest that probiotics could also be effective for the prevention of nosocomial infections.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Over the past few years, an abundance of probiotic-based products has appeared. Because probiotics are live microorganisms, the mere characterization of the strains contained in the product, independent of the evidence available of such strains, is insufficient to claim a beneficial effect. As such, it is well accepted that the efficacy of the specific strains, doses, and formulations in a certain product should be demonstrated. Consistent with this information, some clinical guidelines support the use of certain probiotic strains for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Synbiotics (a combination of probiotics and prebiotics) may be used for the management of acute viral diarrhea. However, it was concluded in the 2014 Guidelines for the Management of Acute Gastroenteritis in Children in Europe<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> that none of the synbiotics studied at that time could be recommended until confirmatory data were available.</p><p>Prodefen&#x000ae; is composed of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> colony forming units (CFU) of the probiotic strains <italic>Lactobacillus casei PXN 37, Lactobacillus rhamnosus PXN 54, Streptococcus thermophilus PXN 66, Bifidobacterium breve PXN 25</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>
<italic>acidophilus PXN 35</italic>, Bifidobacterium <italic>infantis PXN 27</italic>, and Bifidobacterium <italic>bulgaricus PXN 39</italic>, in combination with the prebiotic fructooligosaccharide. It has been suggested that multistrain and/or multispecies probiotics may be more effective than monostrain probiotics because multistrain probiotics would have the hypothetical advantage of broad-spectrum coverage of possible enteropathogens and, furthermore, the advantage of multiple mechanisms of action. It has been suggested that the synergistic effects of different strains with specific properties may account for more than the sum of the separate health-promoting properties.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Prodefen&#x000ae; has already been evaluated in a randomized clinical trial in a group of young children and has been shown to be beneficial in producing a significantly shorter duration of diarrhea and a reduction of the number of watery stools compared with placebo.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, as this study was performed in a very specific context (Iranian hospitalized children younger than 2 years of age), a new study was proposed to evaluate the benefits of the synbiotic Prodefen&#x000ae; in our ambulant pediatric population.

In addition, they were asked to note the time of the first normal stool.

These findings are in line with current scientific evidence on the benefits and safety of probiotics in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and provide new evidence on the benefits of a synbiotic in the management of children with this pathology.</p><p>In this trial, the efficacy of Prodefen&#x000ae; was studied by analyzing the duration of the diarrhea after the beginning of treatment, evaluated by the number of days with diarrhea and the percentage of patients without diarrhea at various study time points. The children who received the synbiotic in addition to the standard therapy with diet and/or oral rehydration showed a more favorable clinical evolution than those who received the standard therapy alone. The addition of the synbiotic accelerated recovery from diarrhea by approximately 1 day, as evidenced in the percentages of children receiving synbiotics without diarrhea after 4 and 5 days, which matched those in the control group after 5 and 6 days of treatment. Notably, practically all children receiving Prodefen&#x000ae; recovered in 5 days, whereas this happened 2 days later in the children receiving the standard treatment.</p><p>An important question arises as to whether these differences in the evolution of the diarrhea are clinically relevant. In this study, by day 4, the difference in the proportion of patients who did not have diarrhea was 15%, which is equivalent to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 6.6, and by day 5, the difference between the 2 regimens was 17%, equivalent to a NNT of 5.9. These figures represent a clinically relevant effect. Although these study outcomes are subjective and, therefore, subject to an evaluation bias, the excellent results attributed to the synbiotic by the parents regarding the perceived efficacy and satisfaction support the clinical relevance of the objective diarrhea-related outcomes.</p><p>From a clinical standpoint, this reduction in the time to resolution is of relevance not only because of the more direct impact of the diarrhea episode in the children&#x02019;s health and well-being, but also because of the impact that prolonged episodes might have on intestinal dysbiosis, which could lead to eventual intolerances and malabsorption that, although transient, would have a negative nutritional influence on the patients. Treatment with the synbiotic, apart from accelerating children&#x02019;s recovery, might palliate potential adverse consequences of this pathology.</p><p>Significantly, Prodefen&#x000ae; reduced the duration of the diarrhea by 2 days in children younger than 2 years. These results are particularly relevant in infants because this is an especially vulnerable population, often debilitated when affected by this condition and more susceptible to dehydration and related symptoms than are older children. In this scenario, the social impact of this 2-day difference for parents and caregivers (earlier school attendance, less day care and parental absenteeism, etc) should also be particularly valued.</p><p>The results obtained in this study are consistent with those reported with this preparation in a different setting. Allahverdi et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial undertaken in Iranian children between 1 and 5 years old with acute viral diarrhea, found that the addition of this synbiotic to dietary and hygienic measures was associated with a reduction of 2 days in the duration of diarrhea compared with placebo. Yala et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> evaluated the addition of a similar synbiotic to a standard treatment with oral rehydration and zinc supplementation in Philippine children aged between 2 months and 2 years with AGE who were admitted to the hospital. These authors did not report the impact of the synbiotic on the duration of diarrhea, but it is inferred that it was shortened because the synbiotic significantly reduced the frequency of stools compared with the standard treatment alone as early as the second day and reduced the hospital stay by 1 day.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The results of our study are also consistent with those reported with probiotics in recent meta-analyses.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In a study carried out within the Cochrane Collaboration that included 56 trials undertaken in young children with acute infectious diarrhea who received a wide range of probiotics and dosages, the duration of diarrhea was shortened by 1 day compared with placebo or no use of probiotic.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Similar results were reported in another meta-analysis of studies undertaken with <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic> in patients with acute infectious diarrhea of various etiological causes, where the patients receiving the probiotic had a difference in the duration of diarrhea of 1 day compared with the placebo group.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>We did not find a significant difference between the 2 study groups in the frequency of stools or in their consistency. Some meta-analyses have found that the use of probiotics for acute diarrhea is also associated with a reduction in the frequency of stools,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> but others failed to find a difference in this outcome.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2333794X16679587" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> On the other hand, the number of stools in our study was relatively low (a median of 5 [IQR = 3-6] at baseline); therefore, the limited effect of the synbiotic on the number of stools in our study could be a result of a floor effect.</p><p>No safety concerns arose during the study. The synbiotic was very well tolerated, as shown by the low frequency of adverse events or related symptoms, and its efficacy was highly rated in the overall evaluation of the parents. Notably, the children who required additional visits to their pediatrician were almost halved (in percentage) in the synbiotic group compared with the control group, which indirectly indicates the benefits of the synbiotic in the management of the pathology, because usually additional visits occur when children do not recover in a reasonable period of time, usually perceived by the parents to be 4 to 5 days.</p><p>Our study has a number of limitations, with the major limitation being the lack of blinding for the investigators. As stated above, although the evaluation of the diarrhea is an objective measure and is not in principle affected by the investigator&#x02019;s bias, this lack of blinding could have overestimated the effect of the synbiotic regarding the more subjective outcomes, such as the parents&#x02019; perceived efficacy, tolerability, and satisfaction. In addition, including a placebo was advised against by the investigators, who considered that most parents would not accept the administration of a placebo to their children. In contrast, the major strength of our study is that it was carried out with a specific product under similar conditions to usual clinical practice, increasing the applicability of our results.</p><p>Overall, the results of this study indicate that the addition of the synbiotic Prodefen&#x000ae; is a well-tolerated and well-accepted approach that provides an additional benefit to standard supportive therapy in the management of acute viral diarrhea in children. Because diarrhea accounts for a significant quantity of pediatric outpatient visits and hospitalizations as a result of poor disease resolution, besides obvious health benefits to the child, a reduction in the time to resolution may have important public health implications in terms of missed work and lost revenue, and school and day care absenteeism.</p></sec><sec id="section12-2333794X16679587"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>EG-M: Contributed to the conception and design of the study, acquisition and analysis of data, and writing of the first draft.</p><p>FG-M: Contributed to the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data</p><p>RV-L: Contributed to the acquisition of data.</p><p>GH-M: Contributed to the acquisition of data.</p><p>M-JIG-E: Contributed to the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data.</p><p>PG-G: Contributed to the acquisition of data.</p><p>SV-O: contributed to the analysis of data and critical review of the manuscript.</p><p>JS-A: Contributed to the conception and design of the study, analysis and interpretation of data, and critical review of the manuscript.</p><p>CN-M: Contributed to the conception and design of the study, analysis and interpretation of data, and critical review of the manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Note:</bold> Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.
