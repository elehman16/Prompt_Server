Since then a number of publications have appeared related to its practicality and methods of application.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The use of a rubber dam has significant advantages in operative procedures especially in children. It protects the patient&#x02019;s oropharynx from aspiration of medicaments, instruments etc.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, the use of rubber dam alters airflow in both the oral and nasal cavities depending on the method of application. This could result in a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) which may cause serious problems in medically compromised patients. Any significant reduction in oxygen supply causes impairment of vital organs such as the brain, heart tissue. The pulse oximeter is a reliable, non-invasive instrument that measures hypoxia at its early stage.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Good-day and Crocker evaluated the effect of rubber dam on SpO<sub>2</sub> in dental patients and found no change in SpO<sub>2</sub> before or after rubber dam isolation.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Very few studies have been done assessing effect of rubber dam on SpO<sub>2</sub> in children.</p><p>Hence, the present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of rubber dam placement on SpO<sub>2</sub>, while carrying out operative procedures in children of the 6-12 year age group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study consisted of 60 ASA Class I patients of the 6-12 years age group.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Informed consent was taken from the parents and patients. Ethical clearance was obtained from Ethical Committee of Navodaya Medical Institution Raichur, Karnataka, India. Totally, 60 children with Class I caries lesion on second primary molars were selected and randomly allocated in two groups: Group A: 30 children had rubber dam isolation of maxillary primary second molar and Group B: 30 children had rubber dam isolation of the mandibular second primary molar. A pulse oximeter was used to detect arterial blood SpO<sub>2</sub> at every 30 s in both the groups. To establish a baseline, each patient&#x02019;s SpO<sub>2</sub> was recorded every 30 s for 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). A rubber dam was then placed which extended over the nose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Operative procedure of Class I cavity preparation and glass ionomer cements (GIC) restoration were performed. Throughout the operative procedure patients, SpO<sub>2</sub> was recorded every 30 s for 5 min.

It is a sensitive tool in identifying low blood SpO<sub>2</sub>, which is useful for continuous monitoring of the patient&#x02019;s status. Mueller found pulse oximeter to be more sensitive to hypoxic changes than measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate or visual observation of cyanosis.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>In children, SpO<sub>2</sub> of 90-95% is considered as safe level for adequate oxygenation of vital organs.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Hypoxia will commence when SpO<sub>2</sub> falls below 90%. Medically compromised children with diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, congestive heart failure are prone for hypoxia. The dental procedures like rubber dam application which alters airflow may induce similar situation. Bello and Darwish investigated the effect of restorative dental treatment on blood pressure, pulse rate, and SpO<sub>2</sub> in children and found some insignificant desaturations below the pre-operative baseline and found that the maximum decrease occurred during rubber dam application.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>In this regard, very few studies have been performed in children. Hence, in the present study children of the 6-12 years age group were selected. To standardize the procedure, Class I cavity preparation and GIC restoration were performed on second primary molars in both maxillary and mandibular arches. The statistical analysis showed that, after rubber dam application in the maxillary arch-Group A, the SpO<sub>2</sub> dropped by 1.3% i.e., to SpO<sub>2</sub> of 96.9% at 3.5 min (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) and in mandibular arch-Group B, the SpO<sub>2</sub> fell by 2% i.e., to SpO<sub>2</sub> of 95.37% at 1.5 min (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and recovered to SpO<sub>2</sub> of 96.75% at 5 min. In both the groups, the SpO<sub>2</sub> did not fall below 95%. Therefore, the use of rubber dam with nose covered or uncovered showed no statistically significant effect on the SpO<sub>2</sub> in children of the 6-12 years age group. The results of the present study are in accordance with the study done by Good-day and Crocker.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Furthermore, Poiset <italic>et al</italic>. showed no significant effect on the SpO<sub>2</sub> and heart rate when routine dental procedures were performed under rubber dam application.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In case of medically compromised patients who are prone for hypoxia, further studies are required to evaluate the effect of rubber dam on SpO<sub>2</sub> with due consideration to ethical aspects.</p></sec><sec
