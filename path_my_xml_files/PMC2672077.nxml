For some physicians they must be done independently of the brace (e.g. the same exercises are performed for patients whether or not the brace is worn),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] while for others specific exercises should be designed to help the brace action. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] According to the latter, during brace treatment specific exercises are recommended as the means to avoid collateral effects of bracing such as spinal stiffness and muscular strength loss, as well as to improve brace efficacy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] Exercises are specifically designed and proposed in order to reach definite goals during different phases of treatment: For example, mobilizing exercises performed continuously for two months in preparation to brace wearing showed better results at five months than non-specific exercises,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] while exercises performed with the brace-on allowed adjunctive forces to be applied.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] Until now no results have been ever published on the effectiveness of exercises in avoiding correction loss during the weaning period.</p><p>The effectiveness of exercises during brace weaning can be (at least partially) the reason for the poor results reported by Dolan in her recent metanalysis of the English literature on bracing alone (without exercises).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] In fact, using the same inclusion criteria,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] the papers published by some members of the international Scientific Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] but also presented in the English literature with the inclusion of exercises, gave totally different results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] It is then possible that exercises play a major role in brace treatment, or that they play a role in increasing correction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] or limiting the loss of correction.</p><p>Brace weaning is a critical phase of AIS treatment that has not been standardized. Some experts use to reduce the daily hours of brace in a somewhat rapid way, shifting from full-time wearing (20 or more hours per day) to the point that the patient was totally free from the brace within a period of six to 12 months. Others progressively and slowly reduce the hours of brace use, with a mean reduction of two to three hours every six months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] During this phase the trunk's ability to bear itself without any external device (the brace) could be relevant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] Therefore, exercises could play a role in training the spinal muscles and reduce the sort of postural collapse[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] that can erase part of the results achieved during brace treatment. A loss of correction during brace weaning in AIS treatment is, in fact, quite frequent and could be related to the aforementioned factors. Nevertheless, at the moment no data is available regarding a better way to wean a patient from the brace, or about the effects of exercises during this step.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to verify the efficacy of exercises in reducing correction loss during brace weaning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This is a retrospective controlled study on the prospective ISICO database, including all patients treated by the institute since 2003.

It was coined about 30 years ago, but it was continuously updated due to scientific advancements that were achieved over the years. Individually adapted exercises are taught to the patients in our institute during a single session of 1.5 hours every two to three months: An expert physiotherapic evaluation is performed in order to develop a customized exercise protocol, a TV record with physiotherapist's suggestions is given to the patient together with the exercise protocol, and family counselling is given in regard to scoliosis treatment and management. The patient continue treatment by himself or herself at home or at a rehabilitation facility near home twice a week (40 minutes) plus one daily exercise (five minutes). The SEAS exercises during brace weaning are progressively similar to those performed in order to avoid the brace according to the hours per day allowed without the brace.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] At 18 hours of brace wearing, half the exercises are still performed with the brace on, while at 12 hours of bracing nearly all of them are performed without the brace. With the brace on, exercises are done in order to increase the pushing of the brace and recreate the physiological kyphosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] Contrastingly, those without the brace are based on Active Self-Correction (ASC), which is an active movement performed to achieve the maximum possible correction and thereby activate neuron-motor reflex corrective answers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] In all phases, therapists avoid increasing the spine's range of motion (while in any case maintaining it), as instead they focus mainly on spinal stabilization.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]</p></sec><sec><title>OTH sub-group</title><p>The participants performed many different exercise protocols at a local facility according to what was preferred by their particular therapist.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] In most cases these were in a group context, while in all cases the exercises lasted 45 to 90 minutes and were performed two or three times per week.

At this stage an initial x-ray without the brace within six hours was made and, according to our bracing protocol, weaning started if Risser 3 stage was reached despite the patient's age. All the patients gradually reduced the daily hours of brace usage by two to three hours (according to clinical and/or radiographic evaluations) over six-month intervals until the prescription reached eight hours nightly, and then stopped after six months. An x-ray evaluation without the brace after 48 hours (final x-ray) was made. The mean duration of the brace-weaning phase was two years and seven months, with no differences evident among the groups and sub-groups. Complete brace weaning was defined as the first visit in which the brace was no longer prescribed.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Cobb angles and ATR (angle of trunk rotation, Bunnell degrees) of the major curvature were evaluated at the start and after complete brace weaning, and we considered the mean values of these parameters.

Patients performing exercises according to the SEAS protocol were able to achieve the best results in clinical terms, with the lowest percentage of patients worsening (only one patient exceeded 5&#x000b0; Cobb). Those patients who never performed exercises (NO sub-group) had the worst results, but continuity also proved to be important (DIS sub-group). In five cases, (all in the NO and DIS sub-groups) an impressive loss of correction was seen, over 10&#x000b0; Cobb, and in one case even of 18&#x000b0; Cobb was achieved. The effect on the prominence (ATR) was less evident, and it appears this is driven more by the brace than whether exercises were performed or not.</p><p>According to these results, we can assume that exercises can prevent a sort of postural collapse[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] becoming evident when the spine is progressively released from the passive support of the brace. Wearing a brace for many years can cause progressive muscular atrophy and loss of strength.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] If the spinal muscles are not constantly and specifically trained throughout the treatment and particularly during brace weaning, this postural collapse could be more dramatic. Our results support this hypothesis, even if more studies are needed to understand whether an increase of compliance (that was not possible to test accurately in this study) can be implied[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]</p><p>The benefit of exercises on ATR stabilization is less evident. ATR is a measure of the deformity. We can aesthetically model the trunk in general and the prominence with braces by pushing on prominences, and the results on aesthetics at the end of brace treatment are significant and persistent[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] Apparently, exercises are not able to influence the possible (in any case reduced &#x02013; on average 0.5&#x000b0; ATR) loss of correction of ATR. It seems that exercises are not as effective on this bone remodelling as they are on other parameters that could be more related to posture (i.e. loss of correction).</p><p>Exercises have already been shown to be effective in the preparation for bracing, during the correction phase and while the brace is worn[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] All the exercises studied in association with bracing in our previous papers have been developed to help the brace action function properly (in a way confirming the importance of specific developed exercises, as proposed by our and other schools,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] while in this case exercises during the brace-weaning phase are similar to those performed without the brace, in order to avoid postural collapse.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]</p><p>This is the first study that has documented the efficacy of exercises in reducing loss of correction during a truly relevant phase of treatment, namely brace weaning.
