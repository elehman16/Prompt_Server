different nonparetic foot positions in stroke patients. [Subjects] Thirty-six subjects who
experienced a stroke (21 males, 15 females) participated and were divided into the
symmetric foot position (SYMM), asymmetric foot position (ASYM), and step foot (STEP)
groups. [Methods] Each group performed repetitive sit-to-stand training 5 times a week for
6 weeks. The timed up-and-go test (TUG), functional reach test (FRT), and F-mat system
correcting the anterior/posterior (A-P) and medial/lateral (M-L) distance of the center of
pressure (COP) were used to measure the static and dynamic postural balance pre- and
postintervention. ANCOVA was used to analyze differences among groups, and preintervention
variables were used as covariates. [Results] The TUG, FRT, and A-P and M-L distance of the
COP in the ASYM and STEP groups were significantly decreased after intervention compared
with the SYMM group. All parameters in the STEP group were lower than those in the ASYM
group, without a significant difference. [Conclusion] The asymmetric foot position during
STS is a good intervention to improve the static and dynamic postural balance in stroke
patients. Especially, using a step to change the foot position is effective in improving
STS performance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Foot position</kwd><kwd>Sit-to-stand</kwd><kwd>Postural balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Sit-to-stand (STS) movement is a common daily activity that consists in a person rising
from a chair<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>; however, the ability to
accomplish STS is diminished after a stroke<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous studies, patients who experienced a stroke were shown
to perform STS with a longer duration<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>,
due to the modification of both the anterior-posterior (A-P) and medial-lateral (M-L)
displacement of the center of mass (COP)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and due to an asymmetric weight-bearing pattern<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Patients with stroke have a compromised ability to use their paretic limb during the
transfer from sitting to standing<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. They often become acclimated to
compensatory strategies and bear less weight on their paretic lower limb<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>;
however, their predominant use of the nonparetic lower limb during STS transfer results in
an asymmetric pattern<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, studies involving trunk restriction for reach
and grasp<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, foot positioning during
STS<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and lifting the nonparetic foot during quiet standing<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> have shown that patients with stroke can
achieve a better performance with their paretic limb.</p><p>The asymmetric weight-bearing pattern in patients with stroke can be improved by altering
the foot position of the nonparetic limb during STS<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, patients with acute stroke who support their nonparetic
lower limb on a 10-cm-high step during STS tasks can improve the weight-bearing rate of
their paretic limb by about 20% when compared with the symmetric foot position<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, few studies have described the effect of the nonparetic foot position during STS
in patients with stroke. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate postural
balance after STS training with different nonparetic foot positions in such a
population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-six subjects (21 males, 15 females) with stroke participated in this study. The
subjects were divided into three groups according to the nonparetic foot position: (i)
symmetric foot position group (SYMM, n = 10), with both feet placed side by side at 10&#x000b0;
dorsiflexion; (ii) asymmetric foot position group (ASYM, n = 13), with the nonparetic foot
dorsiflexed at 10&#x000b0; and placed backward at a distance corresponding to 50% of the subject&#x02019;s
foot length; and (iii) step foot position group (STEP, n = 13), with the nonparetic foot
placed on a step and the paretic foot placed at ground level and both feet with 10&#x000b0;
dorsiflexion. The size of the step was 40 &#x000d7; 20&#x02005;cm (length &#x000d7; width), and the height of the
step was adjustable from 50 to 20&#x02005;cm, allowing it to be adapted to each subject by
normalization to 25% of the knee height<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The participants completed a survey, and those with either cognitive impairments or
cerebellar involvement were excluded from the study. Before participation in this study, all
subjects signed an informed consent document that was approved by the Institute Research
Board of Kyungsung University.</p><p>Each group carried out repetitive STS training 5 times a week for a total of 6 weeks. The
timed up-and-go (TUG) test was used to measure the dynamic balance ability. The TUG test
measures the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk 3 m, turn around, walk back
to the chair, and sit down.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> A
functional reach test (FRT) was used to measure the functional balance before and after the
interventions. The FRT measures the distance between the length of the arm and the maximal
forward reach in the standing position while the person maintains a fixed base of
support<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. An F-Mat (Tekscan Inc.,
Boston, MA, USA) was used to compare the A-P and M-L distance of the COP at pre- and
postintervention<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The COP distance
was measured for 5&#x02005;s while each subject maintained the static balance position. All
variables were measured at pre- and postintervention.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were used to represent the general characteristics of the subjects.
ANCOVA was used to analyze the differences among groups, and each preintervention variable
was used as a covariate. The SPSS software (version 21.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used
for statistical analyses. A value of p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The characteristics of the subjects are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Subjects&#x02019; characteristics (mean &#x000b1; SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Variable</th><th colspan="3" valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1">Group</th></tr><tr><th colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SYMM (n = 10)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ASYM (n = 13)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">STEP (n = 13)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.20 &#x000b1; 12.73</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.23 &#x000b1; 7.35</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.92 &#x000b1; 9.23</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time since stroke (months)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.40 &#x000b1; 20.53</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.85 &#x000b1; 17.00</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.00 &#x000b1; 13.11</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type (ischemic/hemorrhagic)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Side (L/R)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11/2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex (M/F)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.80 &#x000b1; 8.49</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">162.92 &#x000b1; 8.89</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.00 &#x000b1; 8.46</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.50 &#x000b1; 14.33</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.23 &#x000b1; 10.70</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.15 &#x000b1; 8.65</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>SD: standard deviation, SYMM: symmetric foot position, ASYM: asymmetric foot

STS tasks in patients with hemiparesis have been conducted usually to investigate the
asymmetric foot position<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, we examined the effect of the asymmetric and step foot positions during STS
training on the postural balance of patients with stroke. Patients with stroke who underwent
repetitive STS training with the asymmetric foot position and step foot position improved
their static and dynamic postural balance in comparison with those with the symmetric foot
position. Particularly, STS training with the step foot position was better than the other
foot positions.</p><p>These results are similar to those of Brunt et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, who reported that manipulating the foot placement of the
unaffected limb may be a beneficial strategy in STS tasks for patients with hemiplegia, and
to those of Rocha et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, who suggested
that using a step is a relevant therapeutic intervention to lessen the asymmetric loading
during rising to stand. The predominant use of the nonparetic lower limb during the STS
transfer results in an asymmetric behavior that may lead to learned nonuse<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of this study show that using the step foot position during repetitive STS
training is effective in improving the static and dynamic postural balance in patients with
hemiplegia. Moreover, these results are also similar to those of a previous study that
reported that the STEP condition can benefit the balance training of patients with
hemiparesis<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is likely
that the asymmetry of weight bearing by using a step during STS training could spontaneously
help load the affected limb in such a population.</p><p>In conclusion, the asymmetric foot position during STS is a good intervention to improve
the static and dynamic postural balance in patients with hemiparesis. Especially, using a
step to change the foot position is also effective in improving the ability to perform
STS.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Riley</surname><given-names>PO</given-names></name><name><surname>Schenkman</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Mann</surname><given-names>RW</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Mechanics of a constrained chair-rise</article-title>.
