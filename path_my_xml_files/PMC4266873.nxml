Calculation of the mid-parental height allows for detecting the genetic background of the child's growth.

It has been suggested that in children with intermediate GH responses to pharmacologic stimuli (between 7 and 10 ng/ml), a pretreatment with sex steroids priming may be of value in enhancing the GH response and in helping to clarify the diagnosis, particularly in children with delayed onset of puberty.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Nevertheless, GH testing in peripubertal children is confounded by the lack of consensus on the use of priming with sex steroids before assessment of the GH-IGF-I axis.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] A survey among 235 members of European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology conducted in 2001 showed that 50.2% of the respondents used sex steroid priming in boys and 40.9% in girls.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The aim of our study was to give some contribution to the controversy for priming with sex steroid before GH testing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>P<sc>ATIENTS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>Ninety-two prepubertal children between the age of 9 and 13 years (58 boys) and 32 children below 9 years were referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic of Hamad Medical Center (HMC) from June 2010 to June 2013 were evaluated for short stature or growth retardation.

On the other hand, the core argument opposed to sex steroid priming targets the possibility of under-diagnosis of true GHD in peripubertal children, as well as the controversial use of GHSTs themselves in the diagnosis of GHD.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Some researchers pointed out that both GH provocative testing and sex steroids priming are unphysiologic methods for assessing GH activity in child.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In our study, sex-steroid priming did not appear to enhance GHSTs enhances diagnostic efficiency of in prepubertal short children older than 9 years of age because 48% of sex-steroid primed prepubertal children and 53% of non-primed children did not mount normal GH response to GHSTs.
