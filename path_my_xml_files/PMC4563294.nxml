groups: motor muscles and local stabilizers. Motor muscles, such as the erector spinae and
rectus abdominis, are involved in movement and load carrying between the spine and the
pelvis. Local stabilizers, such as the transversus abdominis and multifidus, play a role in
stabilizing the spine during postural movements when a weight or load is placed on the
spinal structure<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Body trunk
stabilization exercise is generally used for stabilization of the spine and pelvis, are
important for maintaining posture. The purpose of body trunk stabilization is to increase
the stability of the spine and pelvis, reinforce muscle strength, and restore muscle and
balance control<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscles that are
activated in body trunk stabilization exercises include the transversus abdominis, internal
obliques, external obliques, quadratus lumborum, multifidus, and pelvic floor muscles.
Multifidus muscles and the transversus abdominis, in particular, control body trunk balance,
as they are stimulated before other muscles when the body moves. The bilateral internal
abdominal obliques are also important in maintaining the spine&#x02019;s lateral stability and
flexion ability<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Excessive lumbar
lordosis or pelvic anterior tilt can occur during the modified wall squat exercise. The
abdominal drawing-in technique can reduce the occurrence of this by inducing simultaneous
subtraction of the transversus abdominis and internal abdominal oblique muscles during the
trunk stabilization part of the exercise<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Squat exercises focus on developing both lower and upper body muscles<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and they can be performed relatively easily in any setting.
Hence, they are commonly used in many sports to enhance athletic performance, as well as in
postsurgery rehabilitation programs<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Despite the many advantages of squat exercises, there is a potential risk than an unstable
posture during the exercise could cause damage to the lower back or place undue pressure on
the knees<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Wall squat exercises are a
modified version of squat exercises aimed at overcoming these potential risks. To prevent
possible lower back or knee damage, the subject supports his/her body weight against the
wall while squatting. This wall squat exercise is easy for beginners to perform. The
modified wall squat exercise in the present study puts more emphasis on lumbar stability
than on reinforcement of lower body muscle strength by including motions aimed at
reinforcing neck and shoulder stability.</p><p>Recent studies of body trunk stabilization exercise have utilized a variety of tools, such
as unstable ground, balancing boards, therapy balls, and sponge pads<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. O&#x02019;Sullivan et al. argued that stabilization exercise can
maximize the improvement in balancing ability when it is performed in a dynamic environment,
such as on a therapy ball, rather than in a static environment<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Page also suggested that exercises using unstable tools are
effective for postural maintenance or somesthesia recovery<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although the effects of the modified wall squat exercise on deep abdominal muscle thickness
and lumbar stability have been studied<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>,
no study has specifically examined the impact of a modified wall squat exercise executed on
an unstable support surface. Therefore, the present study investigated the effect of a
modified wall squat exercise performed on an unstable support surface on posture. The aim of
the exercise was stimulation of somatosensory receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty female students enrolled in college at the time of the study were selected as the
sample. They were randomly and evenly divided into an experimental group that performed
unstable modified wall squat exercises and a control group that performed stable modified
wall squat exercises.</p><p>The selection criteria were as follows: no structural abnormality of the spine before
participation in the experiment, no pain in the spine (such as low back pain), no
medication, no neurological diseases, no drinking during the experiment, and not overweight.
Those who performed weight training, which can affect posture, and those who performed
regular exercise were excluded from the experiment. This study was approved by university&#x002bc;s
institutional review board, and the safety of the subjects was protected during all of the
processes of the experiment. All of the subjects understood the purpose of this study and
provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study in accordance with the
ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The age, height, and weight of the participants in the experimental group were
21.6&#x000b1;3.6&#x02005;years, 158.0&#x000b1;6.3&#x02005;cm, and 52.7&#x000b1;3.1&#x02005;kg, respectively. Those in the control group were
22.2&#x000b1;4.3&#x02005;years, 157.4&#x000b1;5.6&#x02005;cm, and 51.3&#x000b1;5.5&#x02005;kg, respectively. A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used
for analysis of gender, and an independent t-test was used for the analysis of age, height,
and body weight. According to the results of the analysis, which showed no statistically
significant differences (p&#x0003e;0.05), homogeneity was not a problem between the two
groups.</p><p>In this study, the subjects in the experimental group performed the modified wall squat
exercise on an unstable support surface using the abdominal drawing-in technique. The
control group performed the exercise on stable ground. An Airex Balance Pad (Alcan-Airex AG,
Sins, Switzerland) with a width of 50&#x02005;cm, length of 41&#x02005;cm, and height of 6&#x02005;cm was used as an
unstable support surface while performing the modified wall squat exercise with the
abdominal drawing-in technique.</p><p>Abdominal drawing-in can decrease excessive lumbar lordosis or pelvic anterior tilt by
inducing simultaneous subtraction of the transversus abdominis and internal obliques during
lumbar stability exercise<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the modified wall squat exercises, the subjects stood about a foot from a wall with
their legs spread shoulder-width apart. With their fingers spread out, one hand was held
with the palm end upward from the chest, while the finger ends of the other hand around the
belly were held downward, and pulled the chin was pulled in pushing the head toward the
wall. The pelvis and the lumbar spine were in the neutral position. During the squat motion,
the soles of the feet did not leave the ground, the knees were flexed up to 90 degrees,
where they remained for 5 seconds, and then the knees were extended back to 10 degrees which
was maintained for 3 seconds<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. One set
consisted of 10 repetitions of the movements described above, and the subjects had a 15-sec
of rest between each set. Ten sets were performed 15 sec of 30&#x02005;min, 3 days a week, for 6
weeks.</p><p>A three-dimensional spine diagnosis system (BackMapper, ABW, Frickenhausen, Germany) was
used to measure postural change. The BackMapper system relatively accurately measures and
analyzes the shape and location of the spine and the severity of pelvic distortion. It
provides front and back images of the spine, as well as images from above, beneath, and the
left and right. The device provides data on trunk inclination (TIN), which indicates the
spine&#x02019;s inclination in a sagittal plane; trunk imbalance (TIM), which indicates the spine&#x02019;s
inclination in a coronal plane; pelvic position (PPO), which indicates horizontal tilt of
the pelvis; pelvic torsion (PTO), which indicates the extent of hip bone rotation; pelvic
rotation (PRO), which indicates the rotation of the pelvis in a horizontal plane; the
position of the scapulae (PSA), which indicates the height of the left and right shoulder
blades. The system also analyses the distribution of muscle and fat across the body, as well
as the location of the body frame, using diverse variables.</p><p>The measurement data were analyzed using the statistical program SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA). The mean and standard deviation of the data are presented. A paired
t-test was used for verifying the significance of individual group differences before and
after the experiment, and an independent t-test was used for verifying the significance of
between-group differences. The significance level &#x003b1; was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results revealed a statistically significant difference in TIN, TIM, PPO, PTO, and PSA

functional efficiency of the body but also a person&#x02019;s appearance. The pelvis is of central
importance for correct posture. The pelvis supports the abdomen and connects the spine to
the lower extremities. In a standing position, it delivers body weight from the spine to the
lower extremities and maintains a correct posture, enabling liberal movement of the upper
extremities<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Trunk stability exercise
is receiving increasing attention today due to its effectiveness in postural control. Trunk
stability exercise training focuses on the pelvis, which contributes to the balanced
activation of the abdominal muscles and back muscles, which play an important role in
maintaining stability and controlling body trunk posture<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kinesthetic senses are essential in recognizing correct alignment
of the trunk of the body<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. These senses
are largely influenced by sensory inputs from sensory receptors distributed throughout the
skin, muscle, and joints<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Correct
posture is very important in activities of daily living. The literature includes a number of
studies reporting changes in deep abdominal muscle thickness and lumbar stability after
trunk stability exercise or instant posture change after pelvic correction. However, there
have been no previous studies of the impact on posture of modified wall squat exercises on
an unstable support surface aimed at stimulating the sensory receptors. Hence, the present
study investigated the effect of unstable modified wall squat exercises on the posture of
female college students.</p><p>Lee et al. performed selective trunk stability and lumbar exercises targeting two groups of
deep abdominal muscles for 5 weeks<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
They reported that both exercises were effective in increasing deep abdominal muscle
thickness and argued that such exercises are essential for patients who require posture
control for lumbar stability improvement. Endleman measured the muscle thickness of the
transversus abdominis and internal oblique abdominis following Pilates core training in 18
female adults and 8 male adults for 6 months<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. They found a significant difference in the muscle thickness of the
transversus abdominis, indicating a positive impact of core training on reinforcement of
abdominal muscles and body trunk stabilization. Brill reported that core stabilization
exercise was effective in enhancing muscle strength and lumbar stability because it
maintained spinal balance due to the contraction of the transverse muscle of the
abdomen<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cho evenly divided 30 female college students into a pelvic adjustment group and a
stretching group that performed pelvic adjustments using the Gonstead technique and examined
the effect on postural change<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
results showed that the exercise had a positive impact on postural change. In a study
involving modified wall squat exercises, 30 female college students were evenly divided into
a modified wall squat exercise group and a bridge exercise on a stable support surface
group<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study reported that the
modified wall squat exercise had positive effects on deep abdominal muscle thickness and
lumbar stability.</p><p>Comparing the results before the intervention and after the intervention in the present
study, TIN, TIM, PPO, PTO, and PSA showed a statistically significant difference in the
experimental group. In contrast, the control group showed a statistically significant
difference only in TIM and PPO. This finding can be attributed to the unstable modified wall
squat exercise, together with abdominal drawing-in, activating the deep muscles related to
maintaining posture. Performing the wall squat exercise while trying to maintain the
stability of the body trunk on an unstable support surface enhanced postural changes
compared with performing the modified wall squat exercise on a stable support surface.</p><p>In summary, the modified wall squat stabilization exercise, in particular, unstable
modified wall squat exercises with abdominal drawing-in, can be recommended for correction
of posture.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Standaert</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinstein</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Rumpeltes</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Evidence-informed management of chronic low back pain with
