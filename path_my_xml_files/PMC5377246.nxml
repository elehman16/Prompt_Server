Individual-level preventions are proposed to complement regulation in reducing the global burden of PM<sub>2.5</sub>&#x02013;induced cardiovascular diseases. We determine whether B vitamin supplementation mitigates PM<sub>2.5</sub> effects on cardiac autonomic dysfunction and inflammation in a single-blind placebo-controlled crossover pilot trial. Ten healthy adults received two-hour controlled-exposure-experiment to sham under placebo, PM<sub>2.5</sub> (250&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>) under placebo, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (250&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>) under B-vitamin supplementation (2.5&#x02009;mg/d folic acid, 50&#x02009;mg/d vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, and 1&#x02009;mg/d vitamin B<sub>12</sub>), respectively. At pre-, post-, 24&#x02009;h-post-exposure, we measured resting heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) with electrocardiogram, and white blood cell (WBC) counts with hematology analyzer.

In the presence of air pollution, adequate B vitamin intake ensures proper epigenetic status of leukocytes to warrant proper immuno-regulation, and prevents excessive oxidative damage to the cardiovascular system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Although the results of randomized controlled trials on supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B<sub>6</sub> and B<sub>12</sub> do not support benefits of B vitamins for either primary or secondary CVD prevention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, the mentioned interactive biological properties of B vitamins render it a promising preventive strategy to minimize the cardiovascular damage due to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution. However, no prior clinical investigation has tested whether B vitamin supplementation can be used to guard the cardiovascular system from the adverse health effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub>.</p><p>Our findings of a primary autonomic effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> are consistent with previous human controlled exposures studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, showing that short-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure perturbed cardiorespiratory autonomic function as reflected in increased HR and reduced HRV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Immediately following two-hour exposure to ambient concentrated PM<sub>2.5</sub>, we observed a substantial increase in resting HR and a reduction in LF power. These results indicate a consistent reduction in HRV across five measures &#x02013; which reflects the adverse pathophysiological modulations in cardiac autonomic control by PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure.</p><p>PM<sub>2.5</sub> is a potent trigger for leukocyte-mediated inflammation, which is proposed as the key mechanism underlying the pathological modulation of the cardiovascular system by PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Our data support this hypothesis by showing that two-hour PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure triggers increased total WBC count and lymphocyte count at 24-hour post exposure. In healthy adults, PM pollution increases the number of neutrophils and lymphocytes in alveolar lavage and peripheral blood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. While the underlying biological mechanism remains unclear, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies suggest that PM stimulates bone marrow via alveolar macrophages-mediated cytokine signaling, leading to accelerated release of immature leukocytes in to the circulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p><p>Twenty-four hours after exposure, the effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on HR and HRV weakened. However, PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure remained significantly associated with higher numbers of total WBCs and lymphocytes. Taken together, although the acute physiological responses due to PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure peak might be reversible, the pro-inflammatory effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> appears to be sustained beyond 24&#x02009;hours and represent a biomarker that could have clinical relevance to sensitive individuals in a community setting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>For the first time, our trial provides evidences demonstrating the unique preventive benefits of B vitamin administration in the context of air pollution: B vitamin supplementation can diminish the acute effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on cardiac autonomic dysfunction and inflammatory markers. These findings are in agreement with our results from the Normative Aging Study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> &#x02013; a population with average B vitamins intakes well above the standard dietary references &#x02013; in which short-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure was associated with lower HRV (7.1% reduction in SDNN per 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and the adverse effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> was limited to subjects with lower (&#x0003c;median) intakes of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, or methionine.</p><p>This study has several strengths, including its crossover design with controlled exposure experiments &#x02013; which simulate conditions similar to urban air pollution peaks, while allowing for control of exposure and treatment at the individual level. The Harvard ambient particle concentrators do not affect the concentration of gaseous pollutants, therefore, minimizing the confounding due to gaseous co-pollutants such as ozone and sulfur dioxide. All exposure experiments were conducted at the same time of day to eliminate impacts of diurnal variation. We adjusted for time-varying factors including season, chamber temperature and humidity to minimize their influence on the observed associations, while time invariant factors are controlled by the crossover design.</p><p>We acknowledge several limitations, however. We determined the number to recruit in the current study using power estimates that are penalized by conservative Bonferroni&#x02019;s adjustments for multiple HRV indexes. Although our sample size is comparable to previous controlled CAP exposure studies, which succeeded in demonstrating health effects of CAP exposure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, our study is evidently limited in power to detect small effects with only 10 subjects (30 controlled exposure experiments).</p><p>Further, treatment sequence could not be randomized due to the long half-life of B vitamins, therefore might be subject to confounding by period or ordering effects. For example, the first exposure experiment is likely to produce more distress on volunteers because of psychological effect. We intentionally provided medical air as the first exposure experiment; therefore the psychological effect is expected to bias the effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> towards the null. The short study duration with four-week intervals between exposure experiments also reduced the impact of temporal trends. In addition, we contrasted the post- <italic>vs</italic> pre-exposure status to ascertain all outcome measurements, which is expected to be less prone to confounding due to temporal trend than the absolute values. While residual confounding is possible, considering the magnitude of our effect estimates and the consistency across different HRV index, it is unlikely that the observed association reflected bias from confounding. The crossover design of the present study was not complete, as we had no arm of B vitamin supplementation with sham exposure. Therefore, separating the direct effect of B vitamins on cardiac autonomic dysfunction and inflammation (i.e., in the absence of air pollution) from the combined effect of both B vitamins and air pollution can be statistically challenging and requires strong assumptions. In addition, our study was limited to healthy adults from lightly polluted urban environment, therefore our findings might not be generalizable to populations that are at higher risk for pollution-induced cardiovascular effects (eg, children, older adults, individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and individuals residing in heavily polluted areas).</p><p>Apart from avoiding exercising outdoors at peak pollution times, sensitive individuals have limited options to reduce exposure and associated cardiovascular risk. While regulation is the backbone of prevention, residual risk remains for those who are sensitive, and high exposures are, unfortunately, the rule still in many megacities throughout the world. The present study provides novel experimental evidence showing that an ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure peak has unfavorable effect on cardiac autonomic function and the immune system, which can be counteracted by B vitamin supplementation. Our project inaugurates a line of research for the development of preventive pharmacological interventions using B vitamins to contain the health effects of air pollution. Future studies will identify the precise pathophysiological processes of PM-induced cardiovascular responses and inflammation, as well as the mechanistic pathway underlying the protective effect of B vitamins.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study population and sample size</title><p>We recruited ten healthy, 18&#x02013;60-year-old, non-smoking volunteers who were not on any form of B vitamin supplementation or other medication, from the University of Toronto St. George campus and surrounding area (downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.
