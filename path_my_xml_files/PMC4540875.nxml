using a reaching task between a sitting position and a standing position in the elderly.
[Subjects and Methods] The study included 30 elderly women from D city. The subjects were
divided into the following two groups, according to the training position: the sitting
group (n = 15) and standing group (n = 15). Both groups performed training for 20&#x02005;min,
thrice a week for 8 weeks. The short form of the berg balance scale (SFBBS), timed 10-m
walk test (10MWT), timed up &#x00026; go test (TUG), and falls efficacy scale (FES) were used
before and after training. [Results] SFBBS, 10MWT, and TUG values were significantly
different between before and after training in both groups. However, FES values were
significantly different in only the standing group. [Conclusion] Balance training in a
standing position is helpful for improving activities that mainly use the lower
extremities, such as gait, and training in a sitting position is somewhat helpful for
improving balance ability. In addition, balance training in both positions can help
overcome the fear of falling.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Postural balance</kwd><kwd>Falls efficacy</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the elderly, even a small injury can be fatal owing to decreased physical ability with
age. Falling is the most frequent accident experienced by the elderly<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the elderly, there are multiple reasons for falling, and
one of them is the inability to cope with environmental risk factors such as a slippery or
uneven road because of reduced balance control ability caused by decreased physical
ability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>One method to reduce the risk of falling in the elderly is removal of environmental risk
factors from their living spaces as much as possible<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, this method only reduces the risk of falling during
household activities, and the risk of falling during outdoor activities still exists. In
addition, staying in the house all day is very difficult; however, even if it is done,
social participation will decrease, lowering quality of life<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the elderly, one method to reduce the risk of falling during outdoor activities is
improvement of balance ability through balance training<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies are being performed on reducing the risk of falling
through balance training in the elderly; however, the risk of falling exists during
training. A change in position, for instance from standing to sitting, can considerably
reduce the risk of falling during balance training<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. If little difference exists in the effectiveness of balancing
training between a sitting position and a standing position in the elderly, safe training in
a sitting position would be ideal.</p><p>This study hypothesized that the effectiveness of balance training in a sitting position is
similar to that in a standing position, and balance training may be performed in a sitting
position to reduce the risk of falling during training. Therefore, this study compared the
effectiveness of balance training using a reaching task between a sitting position and a
standing position in the elderly to determine whether the effectiveness of balance training
is greater in a sitting position (the safe position) compared to that in a standing
position.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 30 elderly community-dwelling women in D city. The selection criteria
were as follows: (1) at least 65&#x02005;years of age; (2) no falls in the last year; (3) no
diseases that might affect gait. Those who had visual impairment, hearing loss, or nervous
system or vestibular organ problems, or those who were unable to understand the nature of
the experiment were excluded. All subjects were informed of the purpose and methods of the
study, and written informed consent according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki was obtained from all subjects prior to their participation. All the subjects
agreed to participate in this study.</p><p>The mean age, height, and weight of the subjects were 73.2 &#x000b1; 3.1&#x02005;years, 156.1 &#x000b1; 4.1&#x02005;cm, and
55.5 &#x000b1; 4.6&#x02005;kg, respectively. The subjects were divided into the following two groups
according to the training position: the sitting group (n = 15) and the standing group (n =
15). They performed training for 20&#x02005;min, thrice a week for 8 weeks. The subjects bent over
stretching both arms out in front of them, then bent over stretching their right arm out
from the right side of the body, and finally bent over stretching their left arm out from
the left side of the body as far as possible. They maintained each of these postures for 3&#x02005;s
and returned to their original position after each posture. The short form of the berg
balance scale (SFBBS), timed 10-m walk test (10MWT), and timed up &#x00026; go test (TUG) were
used to measure balance-related ability and the falls efficacy scale (FES) was used to
measure the fear of falling before and after balance training. All data are presented as
mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. The subjects rested when they felt fatigued.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows (version 20.0). The paired t-test
was used to examine differences between before and after training, and the independent
t-test was used to examine differences between the groups. The statistical significance
level was set at &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>On comparing the results between before and after balance training, SFBBS, 10MWT, and TUG

standing position and a sitting position in the elderly. The SFBBS, 10MWT, and TUG were used
to measure balance-related ability, and the FES was used to measure the fear of falling
before and after the 8-week training program in order to determine the effectiveness of
balance training. The SFBBS evaluates overall balance ability, 10MWT evaluates gait ability,
TUG evaluates dynamic balance ability, and FES evaluates the fear of falling.</p><p>Previous studies have used the SFBBS in the elderly; Karthikeyan et al. reported a score of
20.6<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Hawk et al. reported a score
of 22.3<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study noted higher
scores compared to those in previous studies both before and after training. This difference
may have occurred because the elderly subjects in the present study were healthy and lived
independently. Balance training using the reaching task appeared to be effective, as the
subjects showed better balance ability after the training compared to that before the
training. However, the SFBBS values appeared to be similar with training in a standing
position and training in a sitting position.</p><p>Previous studies have used the TUG in the elderly; Hofheinz et al. reported a result of
8.39&#x02005;s<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Shumway-Cook et al.
reported a result of 8.4&#x02005;s<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present
study noted results similar to those of previous studies before the training. In the present
study, the TUG values significantly improved in both groups after training compared to those
before training. However, the TUG values appeared to be similar with training in a standing
position and training in a sitting position.</p><p>A previous study by Bohannon using the 10MWT reported a mean 10MWT speed of 1.27 m/s for
healthy elderly individuals in their 70s, which was faster than that in the present
study<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the 10MWT
speed significant increased after training compared to that before training in the standing
group; however, the sitting group showed a decrease in the 10MWT speed. This may have
occurred because training in a sitting position involves lower stimulation of the lower
extremities and lesser use of the lower extremities compared to those in a standing
position. Therefore, training in a sitting position did not significantly improve movements
that largely involve the lower extremities, such as gait.</p><p>The FES is a survey that evaluates the fear of falling by determining the level of
self-confidence in conducting daily activities against falling<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. A high score indicates a high fear of falling. The FES
score significantly improved in the standing group after training compared to that before
training, and the score improved in the sitting group but not significantly.</p><p>On comparing balance training using a reaching task between a sitting position and a
standing position, the standing position was found to be very helpful for improving
activities that mainly use the lower extremities, such as gait, and the sitting position was
found to be somewhat helpful for improving balance ability. In addition, balance training
can help overcome the fear of falling.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>HF</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>HD</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Fall mechanisms, bone strength, and hip fractures in
