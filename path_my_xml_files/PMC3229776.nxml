It is characterized by dyspnea, cough, chest tightness, wheezing, variable airflow obstruction, and airway hyper-responsiveness. The clinical diagnosis of asthma can be corroborated by suggestive changes in pulmonary function tests. Chronic asthma is defined as asthma requiring maintenance treatment. When patients complain of symptoms more than once weekly but less than once daily with normal or near normal lung function, it is called mild persistent asthma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>The prevalence of asthma has increased in most countries since the 1970s. About 300 million people worldwide have asthma and by 2025 it has been estimated that a further 100 million will be affected.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] There is a noticeable increase in health care burden from asthma in several areas of the world. There is also a global concern on the change in asthma epidemiology and clinical spectrum.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Well-controlled asthma reduces the burden for patients and health services. Control of asthma may mean minimal symptoms and freedom from exacerbations for patients, normal peak flow or low scores on standard questionnaire for doctors, or composite measures in clinical trials. The aims of pharmacological management of asthma are the control of symptoms, including nocturnal symptoms and exercise-induced asthma, prevention of exacerbations and the achievement of best possible pulmonary function, with minimal side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Salbutamol, the most widely used short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist, consists of a racemic mixture of equal amounts of two enantiomers, (R)-salbutamol and (S)-salbutamol. The bronchodilator effects of salbutamol are attributed entirely to (R)-salbutamol (levosalbutamol), while (S)-salbutamol has been shown to possess bronchospastic and pro-inflammatory effects both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] R-salbutamol administered as a single enantiomer has a better therapeutic ratio than racemic salbutamol. Handley <italic>et al</italic> reported that nebulized levosalbutamol, in doses yielding comparable bronchodilatation, had fewer &#x003b2;-agonist-mediated side effects than nebulized racemic salbutamol. Salbutamol is metabolized in human tissues by sulfation mainly in liver, and inactive metabolites produced are rapidly excreted in urine. Rates of metabolism for two isomers are different; R-isomer is metabolized about eight times faster than S-salbutamol, leading to a longer half-life and increased accumulation of S- salbutamol in tissues. In outpatient studies, asthma patients who were treated with levosalbutamol experienced a significantly greater increase in FEV<sub>1</sub>, a longer duration of action, and fewer side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Mild persistent asthma is usually treated with daily use of low dose inhaled corticosteroids along with short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist. The use of regular short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists without concurrent inhaled corticosteroids is now considered to be associated with increased exacerbations while it is relatively safe for a short-term treatment. In this study we desired to explore the possibility of short-term monotherapy with levosalbutamol in mild persistent asthma. The justification of this study was the theoretical argument that levosalbutmol may cause less tachyphylaxis in comparison to recemic salbutamol and hence it may have a valuable role in persistent asthma. The aim of this study was to explore and compare the efficacy and safety of levosalbutamol and racemic salbutamol, both administered by a pressurized meter dose inhaler (pMDI) in subjects with mild persistent bronchial asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Patients</title><p>The study was conducted on 60 patients of mild persistent asthma attending the outdoor department of Pulmonology of our institute. The study population included patients irrespective of sex, aged between 18 and 70 years suffering from mild persistent asthma with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 80% or more of the predicted value before administration of a bronchodilator; and a reversibility of airway obstruction by 12% or more with the use of a &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist. Smokers, patients having an acute asthma exacerbation 4 weeks prior to the start of the study, patients already received steroids, and pregnant and lactating women were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Study Design</title><p>The present study is a 4-week, randomized, open, parallel group comparative clinical study between racemic salbutamol and levosalbutamol in patients with mild persistent asthma conducted at a single centre. The study was approved by Institute Ethical Committee and procedures followed in this study are in accordance with the ethical standard laid down by ICMR's ethical guidelines for biomedical research on human subjects (2006). A written informed consent was obtained from all the patients who participated in the study after explaining the patient's diagnosis, the nature and purpose of a proposed treatment, the risks and benefits of the proposed treatment (salbutamol/levosalbutamol), alternative treatment and the risks and benefits of the alternative treatment. Randomization was done by using computer generated random list. After randomization, the patients were divided into two treatment groups. A total of 30 patients were allocated in the salbutamol group who received salbutamol 100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g twice daily via pMDI and another 30 patients in the levosalbutamol group who received levosalbutamol 50 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g twice daily via pMDI for 4 weeks. As use of pMDI is technique dependent, the inhaler technique was taught to each patient. At the first visit, after detailed history on baseline symptomatology, clinical evaluation [asthma symptom score and mini asthma quality of life questionnaire (MiniAQLQ) scoring] and laboratory investigations (pulmonary function test) were done. After 4 weeks, pulmonary function test was repeated and clinical improvement was assessed in terms of change in pulmonary function test, asthma symptom score and MiniAQLQ scoring.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Efficacy and Safety Variables</title><p>The efficacy variables were change in the severity of asthma symptom score, pulmonary function test and MiniAQLQ scoring from baseline to day 28. Asthma symptom scoring has been considered as the primary outcome of this study.</p><p>Improvement in the five most important asthma symptoms (shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheeze, cough, mucus production) was scored on a scale of 0--3 depending on severity to assess the efficacy of the candidate drugs. The symptom severity was defined as follows: 0 = No symptoms; 1 =Mild (symptoms are present occasionally and patients can continue with daily activities); 2 = Moderate (symptoms are present most of the time but patients can perform daily activities); 3 = Severe/Incapacitating (symptoms are severe and affect daily activities or patient cannot do things that they normally can).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>The asthma quality of life questionnaire was designed as an evaluative instrument that would be sensitive to small within subject changes overtime and therefore appropriate for capturing the effect of an intervention in a clinical study. The shorter and simpler MiniAQLQ, with 15 questions, was developed to meet the need for greater efficiency in clinical studies, group patient monitoring and large surveys, where the measurement precision of the AQLQ is not quite so important. MiniAQLQ consists of four domains: questions related to symptoms, activity limitations, emotional function, and environmental stimuli. Scoring is done according to response options on scale of 1--7 (all of the time, most of the time, a lot of the time, some of the time, a little of the time, hardly any of the time, none of the time for question number 1--11; totally limited, extremely limited, very limited, moderate limitation, some limitation, a little limitation, not at all limited for question number 12--15).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>A pulmonary function test was done by a Maestros spirometer where flow measurements were done by using Terbium followed by computerized analysis. FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), FVC (forced vital capacity), and PEFR (peak expiratory flow rate) were assessed at both visits.</p><p>Tolerability was assessed in terms of reported adverse experiences and vital signs, which were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. All reported adverse drug events were graded according to The National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) and compared between the groups.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The statistical calculation for the paired <italic>t</italic>-test, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, and Fischer's exact test were performed with statistical software Instat+ version 3.036 (Statistical Services Centre, University of Reading, UK). <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

In this study shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheeze, and cough were significantly decreased in the levosalbutamol group in comparison to the salbutamol group. The overall asthma symptom score improved significantly with levosalbutamol than salbutamol. Improvement in all four domains of MiniAQLQ was found with both the drugs. A comparative study revealed that improvement in symptoms, activity limitations, and environmental stimuli-related questionnaire scoring was significantly greater in the levosalbutamol group in comparison to the salbutamol group. Overall MiniAQLQ scoring was increased in the levosalbutamol group and the improvement was superior to salbutamol. The changes in three most important parameters, i.e., FEV1, FVC, and PEFR, were found to be significant in both groups. Percent reversibility of FEV1, FVC, PEFR was found to be superior in the levosalbutamol group in comparison to the salbutamol group. Both the drugs were well tolerated and there was no significant difference in incidence of adverse events.</p><p>The superiority of levosalbutamol over racemic salbutamol found in our study has been supported or explained by many clinical studies. Large, well-controlled clinical studies performed in adults with asthma have shown that nebulized levosalbutamol 1.25 mg produces greater bronchodilation than the standard 2.5 mg dose of racemic salbutamol. Lower dosing of the R-salbutamol isomer to patients with the use of levosalbutamol provides comparable or superior bronchodilation as racemic salbutamol, with the potential for fewer &#x003b2;-receptor mediated side effects. Both clinical trials and preclinical experiments have suggested that the inclusion of S-salbutamol in racemic salbutamol provides no clinical benefit and may oppose some of the therapeutic benefits of the R-isomer (levosalbutamol).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Until recently S-salbutamol was considered inert filler in the racemic mixture; but animal as well as human studies have shown that S-salbutamol is not inert, rather it may have some deleterious effects. R-salbutamol is metabolized up to 12 times faster than S-salbutamol. Thus enantioselective metabolism of salbutamol leads to higher and sustained plasma levels of S-salbutamol with repeated dosing. There have been concerns that chronic use of racemic salbutamol may lead to loss of effectiveness and clinical deterioration. Formulation of salbutamol containing only R-isomer (levosalbutamol) has been available in international market since the last few years. Clinical trials in acute as well as chronic asthma in adults as well as children have shown that it has therapeutic advantage over racemic salbutamol and also is more cost effective.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>Several mechanisms may explain the superior efficacy of levosalbutamol over racemic salbutamol in asthma. It may be due to competitive inhibition between the enantiomers at beta-adrenoceptors or it may be attributed to additional anti-inflammatory properties of levosalbutamol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Many <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies proved that levosalbutamol suppresses pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., peroxidase, superoxide, IL-2, IL-5, IL-13, IFN-&#x003b3;, and granulocyte-macrophage - colony stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) in human eosinophils, T cells, and airway smooth muscle cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] It also increases intracellular cAMP levels and inhibits cell proliferation by activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway with simultaneous inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3&#x02019;-OH (PI-3) kinase and nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B expression in human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] It increases inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and decreases GM-CSFmRNA and protein release in human airway epithelial cells;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] and amplifies the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids on suppression of GM-CSF in HASMCs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, from the results of the present comparative clinical study of racemic salbutamol and levosalbutamol, levosalbutamol would be a better choice in mild persistent asthma compared with recemic salbutamol owing to its better efficacy and safety profile. Because the study had the limitations of being nonblinded and conducted in single-centre, the findings of this exploratory study should be confirmed by multicentric, randomized, double-blind, large population studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to Elizabeth F.
