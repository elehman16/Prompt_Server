Time constraints, patient overpopulation, and complex guidelines require alternative solutions for real time patient monitoring. Rapidly evolving e-health technology combined with clinical decision support and monitoring systems (CDSMS) provides an effective solution to these problems. The purpose of the study is to develop a user-friendly, comprehensive, fully integrated web and mobile-based Clinical Decision Support and Monitoring System (CDSMS) for the screening, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of DM diseases which is used by physicians and patients in primary care and to determine the effectiveness of the system.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The CDSMS will be based on evidence-based guidelines for DM disease. A web and mobile-based application will be developed in which the physician will remotely monitor patient data through mobile applications in real time.</p><p id="Par3">The developed CDSMS will be tested in two stages. In the first stage, the usability, understandability, and adequacy of the application will be determined. Five primary care physicians will use the developed application for at least 16 DM patients. Necessary improvements will be made according to physician feedback. In the second phase, a parallel, single-blind, randomized controlled trial will be implemented. DM diagnosed patients will be recruited for the CDSMS trial by their primary care physicians. Ten physicians and their 439 patients will be involved in the study. Eligible participants will be assigned to intervention and control groups with simple randomization. The significance level will be accepted as <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. In the intervention group, the system will make recommendations on patient monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment. These recommendations will be implemented at the physician&#x02019;s discretion. Patients in the control group will be treated by physicians according to current DM treatment standards. Patients in both groups will be monitored for 6&#x000a0;months.

A study from the National Burden of Disease reports that cardiovascular diseases and diabetes rank first and ninth among causes of death, with mortality rates of 47.7% and 2.2%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In 2009, The World Health Organization reported that the top three risk factors for mortality are, in order, high blood pressure, smoking, and high blood glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Diabetes has a high prevalence and continues to increase worldwide over time.</p><p id="Par10">According to a study by TURDEP II, 13.7% of the Turkish population has diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. HbA1c is accepted as a marker for glycemic control criterion. Ratio of diabetic patients whose blood glucose is regulated is very low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to a study, the rate of diabetic patients whose HbA1c value is &#x0003c;7% were found only 30.1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Diabetes is one of the highest cardiovascular disease risk factors. If the disease is taken under control, morbidity and mortality rates of society reduce. Despite the high rate of DM prevalence, diagnosis of the disease is still around 13.7%. The diagnosis rate should be increased first to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by the DM disease. DM prevalence studies in Turkey have shown that halves rule is valid for the awareness, treatment and control rates of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Today, the purpose of treatment of chronic illness is not to heal the patient, but to enhance the adherence of the individual to the treatment program and to promote the life quality by cooperation. For this reason, the importance of protecting, maintaining and developing health has been emphasized over the treatment of disease, thus nurturing the concept of &#x0201c;self-care&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Diabetes is a chronic health problem. Diabetes patients often face challenges throughout treatment, including emotional instability and difficulty adapting to lifestyle changes. Except for the natural distress caused by symptoms, complications and treatments, the patient&#x02019;s future worries affect his cognitive and emotional functions and social life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Self-efficacy beliefs play an important role in individuals with health problems like diabetes that require complex treatment and care, taking steps to make lifestyle changes and learning new skills to cope with the disease process. It is expected that diabetics should have sufficient self-efficacy to cope effectively with complex diabetes care and treatment. Diabetics&#x02018;self-care behaviors can be improved by increasing their self-efficacy levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Guidelines used for DM management are prepared on the basis of evidence based studies conducted by experts both at the national and international level.</p><p id="Par15">In DM management guidelines, the standards for diagnosing are specified and the requirements for differential diagnosis are systematized. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Then the disease is classified according to the patient&#x02019;s history, physical examination and laboratory data.</p><p id="Par16">The guidelines suggest which patient risk factors should be evaluated and which tests should be completed. After diagnosis and differential diagnosis, treatment alternatives are suggested to the physician based on the guidelines set forth by the evidence-based studies. These guidelines include systematical treatment and follow-up process according to the diagnosis and prognosis. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Physicians&#x02019; guideline use rate in Turkey, as well as internationally, is very low. A study conducted in Turkey showed that diabetic patients are not treated according to current guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Periodic health care is a monitoring program formatted by risk factors, through screening, examination and testing of healthy people, counseling and health education. The program is evidence based, effective, feasible and acceptable. In this evidence based program, screening, case detection, immunization, chemoprophylaxis and counseling are defined clearly according to people&#x02019;s age, sex and risk factors. Institutions that provide primary care carry out periodic health care services. Established guidelines require healthy adults to be periodically screened for health risk assessments. For example, the HbA1C test must be applied once every three to five years to patients with a high risk score, and once a year to those with a very high score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Primary care providers play a vital role in the diagnosis, treatment and control of DM disease. The World Health Organization states that primary health care has a key role in reducing the morbidity and mortality of chronic diseases. Strengthening primary care is on the agenda of all countries for ensuring the control of chronic diseases. Therefore, adapting the physician&#x02019;s approach to current DM management guidelines and developing a standard approach will provide significant gains in diabetes control. Control of diabetes will increase the length and quality of patient life. This will allow patients to apply less to primary health care providers. Thus, the time that physicians will allocate per patient will increase.</p><p id="Par20">There are several computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSS) developed for management of chronical diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There are a variety of uses of CDSS in primary care such as depression, hypertension and medication reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, various rule based and artificial intelligence based decision support systems have been developed for diabetes diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Mobile technologies are becoming important for providing individual-level support to health care users and promising platform for health interventions. In recent years, researchers have been using mobile phones as tools for encouraging physical activity and healthy diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], for symptom monitoring in asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], reminding patients about upcoming appointments, supporting smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and for a range of other health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, various kinds of m-health applications were developed for other purposes such as enabling users to log and chart data about their diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], blood glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and other health-related behaviors and measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Examples included patient terminals for tele-monitoring of conditions such as hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and chronic heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and applications that receive data from pedometers, blood pressure monitors and other devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. On the other hand, some researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] developed a diabetes support system using mobile phones, in which the user inputs information regarding his/her daily measures rather than using sensors.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study aim</title><p id="Par22">The purpose of the study is to develop a user-friendly, comprehensive, fully integrated web and mobile-based Clinical Decision Support and Monitoring System (CDSMS) for the screening, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of DM diseases which is used by physicians and patients in primary care and to determine the effectiveness of the system.</p><p id="Par23">The clinical decision support system is developed based on the rules obtained from evidence-based guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

The scale has 25 items. The answers to scale items are gathered with Likert type quintile rating scale. ISO/IEC 9126&#x02013;1 (2001) defines usability as the capacity of the software product to be included/understood, learned, used and attractive to the user, when it is used under specified conditions. It characterizes the four attributes of usability as understandability, learnability, operability, and attractiveness of the software product. Understandability assesses whether new users can understand whether the software is suitable and how it can be used for particular tasks. Learnability assesses how long it takes users to learn to use particular functions, and the effectiveness of help systems and documentation. Operability assesses whether users can operate and control the software. Attractiveness metrics assess the appearance of the software, and will be influenced by factors such as screen design and color [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

Through mobile application, patients can receive individualized therapy as well as alerts and notifications such as the amount and frequency of use of medicines on their monitoring process.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Tele-monitoring system</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12911_2017_558_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par47">The second is using a transfer device developed for this study. The transfer device will be developed for especially elderly patients who are not able to use smart phones. It is specialized for data collection and transferring. This device will read data automatically from sensors which have communication ability (e.g. Bluetooth) or measured values will be entered manually via large buttons for the ease of use for the elderly.</p><p id="Par48">These options will allow patient data to be transferred to the system periodically from either a mobile application or a transfer device. Regularly collected data will be used for physician&#x02019;s evaluation. Notifications will be sent via web and mobile application to the physician and/or patient when deviations from the normal state occur. Notification messages will be in the form of reminders, including reminders to take medication, follow the diet, and complete exercise. It will also notify the patient when blood sugar is high, and will notify both the patient and the physician if the patient is experiencing a risky situation such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. The CDSMS will generate the notifications according to the patient&#x02019;s input, processing the algorithms defined in the system according to the evidence based guidelines. In accordance with the patient data in the system, notices and short reports will be created for physician and patient in certain periods of time.</p><p id="Par49">For patient security, personal information will be kept encrypted. In addition, technologies such as https, VPN will be used during the secure access to the system.

The physician will make his/her own decision on the patient considering the system&#x02019;s suggestion and his/her clinical experience. Both the suggestion of CDSMS and physician&#x02019;s own decision will be saved in system and compared later. Physicians will take suggestion of CDSMS but implement their own decision for each case. The application is designed in this specific way in order to avoid any harm on patients.</p><p id="Par51">No side effects are expected depending on the intervention.

Moreover, this clinical decision support and monitoring system using evidence-based guidelines will pave the path for other medical specialties providing health services to diabetes patients. In addition, remote monitoring of patient data and alert mechanisms are also implemented in this study. Patient adherence to treatment in medication and lifestyle changes will be provided.</p><p id="Par62">Using CDSMS based on current diabetes guidelines and telemonitoring systems will provide patients a means to receive effective treatment and regular monitoring. This will reduce possible complications, hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality caused by diabetes while also reducing the cost of treatment.</p><p id="Par63">Electronically monitoring period screenings will provide early diagnosis and protection from potential diseases. This will enable patients to live longer and healthier lives, reduce treatment costs, and prevent the labor loss.</p><p id="Par64">In CDSMS, patients actively participate in their treatment by regularly inputting measurement values and receiving motivational and reminder messages. Constant communication will increase the patient&#x02019;s self-efficacy, thereby reducing emotional stress and increasing the patient quality of life.</p><p id="Par65">Information technologies are integrated to patient care and monitoring in primary health care services with the proposed CDSMS based on predictive modeling. This new comprehensive and integrated approach will contribute to rapidly evolving e-health technology in the world using national information and technology savings. In addition, patient data will be collected when using rule based CDSMS. As a future study, an intelligent clinical decision support system will be developed using machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies on collected data.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CDSMS</term><def><p id="Par6">Clinical decision support and monitoring system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DM</term><def><p id="Par7">Diabetes Mellitus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par8">Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par66">This study is part of a project currently funded by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey for the design of the study and collection, analysis, and interpretation of data<strike>.</strike>
