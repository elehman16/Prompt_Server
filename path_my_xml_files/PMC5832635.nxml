Celiac disease patients administered fixed intradermal doses of Nexvax2 become unresponsive to the HLA-DQ2&#x000b7;5-restricted gluten epitopes in Nexvax2, but gastrointestinal symptoms and cytokine release mimicking gluten exposure, that accompany the first dose, limit the maximum tolerated dose to 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g. Our aim was to test whether stepwise dose escalation attenuated the first dose effect of Nexvax2 in celiac disease patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at four community sites in Australia (3) and New Zealand (1) in HLA-DQ2&#x000b7;5 genotype positive adults with celiac disease who were on a gluten-free diet. Participants were assigned to cohort 1 if they were HLA-DQ2&#x000b7;5 homozygotes; other participants were assigned to cohort 2, or to cohort 3 subsequent to completion of cohort 2. Manual central randomization without blocking was used to assign treatment for each cohort. Initially, Nexvax2-treated participants in cohorts 1 and 2 received an intradermal dose of 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (consisting of 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of each constituent peptide), followed by 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, and then eight doses of 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g over six weeks, but this was amended to include doses of 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and 9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and extended over a total of seven weeks. Nexvax2-treated participants in cohort 3 received doses of 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 450&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 750&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, and then eight of 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g over nine weeks. The dose interval was 3 or 4&#x000a0;days. Participants, care providers, data managers, sponsor personnel, and study site personnel were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was the number of adverse events and percentage of participants with adverse events during the treatment period.

For cohort 1, seven participants received Nexvax2 (two with the starting dose of 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and then five at 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) and three received placebo. For cohort 2, 10 participants received Nexvax2 (four with starting dose of 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and then six at 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) and four received placebo. For cohort 3, 10 participants received Nexvax2 and two received placebo. All 36 participants were included in safety and immune analyses, and 33 participants completed treatment and follow-up; in cohort 3, 11 participants were assessed and included in pharmacokinetics and duodenal histology analyses. Whereas the maximum dose of Nexvax2 had previously been limited by adverse events and cytokine release, no such effect was observed when dosing escalated from 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g up to 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g in HLA-DQ2&#x000b7;5 homozygotes or to 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g in HLA-DQ2.5 non-homozygotes. Adverse events with Nexvax2 treatment were less common in cohorts 1 and 2 with the starting dose of 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (72 for 11 participants) than with the starting dose of 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (91 for six participants). Adverse events during the treatment period in placebo-treated participants (46 for nine participants) were similar to those in Nexvax2-treated participants when the starting dose was 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g in cohort 1 (16 for five participants), cohort 2 (56 for six participants), and cohort 3 (44 for 10 participants). Two participants in cohort 2 and one in cohort 3 who received Nexvax2 starting at 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g did not report any adverse event, while the other 33 participants experienced at least one adverse event. One participant, who was in cohort 1, withdrew from the study due to adverse events, which included abdominal pain graded moderate or severe and associated with nausea after receiving the starting dose of 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and one 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g dose. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the Nexvax2 participants were headache (52%), diarrhoea (48%), nausea (37%), abdominal pain (26%), and abdominal discomfort (19%). Administration of Nexvax2 at dose levels from 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g to 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g preceded by dose escalation was not associated with elevations in plasma cytokines at 4&#x000a0;h. Nexvax2 treatment was associated with trends towards improved duodenal histology. Plasma concentrations of Nexvax2 peptides were dose-dependent.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>We show that antigenic peptides recognized by CD4-positive T cells in an autoimmune disease can be safely administered to patients at high maintenance dose levels without immune activation if preceded by gradual dose escalation.

In patients with celiac disease, immunological tolerance to dietary gluten is replaced by a T cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction that results in small intestinal injury and digestive symptoms (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Sollid and Jabri, 2013</xref>). Quarantining the immune system with a life-long, strict, gluten-free diet is currently the mainstay of management for celiac disease (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Ludvigsson et al., 2014</xref>). Gluten-free diet for six months or more usually results in normalisation of serum antibodies specific for gluten-derived peptides and autoantibodies specific for transglutaminase, but signs of ongoing intestinal injury persist in many patients (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Ludvigsson et al., 2014</xref>). Recurrent digestive symptoms on gluten-free diet are common, and the risk of acute symptoms that can follow within hours of accidental gluten exposure is ever present (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">See et al., 2015</xref>). The shortcomings of a gluten-free diet highlight a substantial unmet need that is being addressed by clinical development of agents that may enhance the effectiveness of dietary therapy (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Kurada et al., 2016</xref>). However, overcoming the gluten-specific adaptive immune response and ultimately restoring immune tolerance without global immunosuppression is the long-term goal of pharmacotherapy for autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Sabatos-Peyton et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">Antigen-specific CD4-positive T cells are implicated in many human autoimmune diseases that have strong associations with genes in the class II region of the major histocompatibility complex. Celiac disease stands out as a candidate for development of peptide-based immunotherapy because 90% of patients carry genes encoding human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2&#x000b7;5 (<italic>HLA-DQA1*05</italic> and <italic>HLA-DQB1*02</italic>) and there is clear understanding of the antigenic peptides (epitopes) recognized by disease-associated (gluten-specific) CD4-positive T cells (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Karell et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Jabri, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Tye-Din et al., 2010</xref>). Following systemic peptide administrations, CD4-positive T cells repeatedly exposed to the epitope recognized by their T cell antigen receptor become unresponsive to further antigenic stimulation and may be deleted, rendered anergic or adopt regulatory properties (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Pape et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">McPherson et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, short, soluble peptides containing epitopes for CD4-positive T cells that cause autoimmune disease could have the potential to control or abort destructive autoreactivity (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Larche and Wraith, 2005</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">Early-stage clinical trials of adjuvant-free peptide immunotherapies for multiple sclerosis and type-1 diabetes have shown promising clinical results, but dose selection in clinical trials has been empirical (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Streeter et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Alhadj et al., 2017</xref>). Nexvax2&#x000ae; is a peptide-based, epitope-specific immunotherapy under development for celiac disease (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2017</xref>). Nexvax2 is customized for HLA-DQ2&#x000b7;5-positive patients and is a simple mixture of three synthetic peptides dissolved in normal saline that is administered by intradermal injection. The peptides in Nexvax2 (NPL001, NPL002, and NPL003) each contains 15 or 16 amino acids and encompass at least five HLA-DQ2.5-restricted epitopes frequently recognized by gluten-reactive CD4 positive T cells (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Tye-Din et al., 2010</xref>). Phase 1 clinical trials of Nexvax2 in celiac disease have provided insight into the safety and therapeutic potential of peptide immunotherapy as well as the immunological effects of small antigenic peptides that are recognized by a discrete population of gut-homing or gut-located, memory CD4 positive T cells (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000e1;ki et al., 2007</xref>). As well as having the potential to modify gluten-specific immune responses, injections of Nexvax2 are effectively systemic &#x0201c;gluten epitope challenges&#x0201d; that test the responsiveness of gluten-reactive CD4 positive T cells specific for epitopes in Nexvax2.</p><p id="p0035">Previous phase 1b studies have assessed the safety, tolerability, and bioactivity of Nexvax2 in HLA-DQ2&#x000b7;5 positive participants with celiac disease following a gluten-free diet (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2017</xref>); Nexvax2 has been assessed in fixed, repeat doses from 9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g to 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for up to eight weeks with dose intervals as short as 3 to 4&#x000a0;days. A course of intradermal injections with Nexvax2, particularly at the highest tolerated dose of 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, results in unresponsiveness to the gluten epitopes in Nexvax2, but the first administration at dose levels above 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g has sometimes been associated with clinical symptoms similar to those experienced by patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet when they consume gluten (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2017</xref>). Participants in these phase 1 studies who were HLA-DQ2&#x000b7;5 homozygotes and had completed a 3-day gluten challenge a month before dosing were particularly susceptible to acute gastrointestinal symptoms, which occurred 2 to 5&#x000a0;h after the first administration of Nexvax2. The first dose of Nexvax2 also caused immune activation as early as 2&#x000a0;h, which was demonstrated by elevations in plasma interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 or CCL2), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10), and IL-8 that peaked at 4 to 6&#x000a0;h (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2016</xref>). These features have not been observed with the first dose of antigenic peptides in multiple sclerosis or type-1 diabetes (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Streeter et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Alhadj et al., 2017</xref>), but bare some similarities to the first dose effects of immunosuppressive biologics that initially activate T cells (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Chatenoud et al., 1990</xref>), and also to the timing of isolated late asthmatic reaction elicited by T-cell stimulatory allergen-derived peptide (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Haselden et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">Although higher maintenance dose levels of peptide immunotherapy are hypothesized to be more efficacious (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Sabatos-Peyton et al., 2010</xref>), adverse events associated with the first dose of Nexvax2 prevented further evaluation of Nexvax2 at levels of 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g or higher in fixed dose regimens (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2017</xref>). Studies in genetically modified mice with clonal T cell populations indicate that systemic cytokine release caused by CD4-positive T cell activation after subcutaneous administration of antigenic peptide is attenuated by gradual escalation in dose (or stepwise &#x0201c;up-dosing&#x0201d;) from a low starting dose similar to that employed in specific immunotherapy for allergy (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Burton et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Burks et al., 2013</xref>). However, the relevance of findings in young mice with over 90% of their CD4&#x000a0;+ T cells specific for a single peptide to patients with autoimmune disease established for many years and polyclonal memory CD4&#x000a0;+ T cells is uncertain (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Burton et al., 2014</xref>). Having characterized the effects of fixed dose regimens in phase 1 studies, we wanted to know if up-dosing could allow us to test higher maintenance dose levels of Nexvax2 in future efficacy studies. In the present study, our objective was to determine the safety and tolerability of Nexvax2 administered at maintenance dose levels of 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g or 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g when preceded by dose titrations from a low, well tolerated starting dose in patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Investigational Drug Product</title><p id="p0045">CS Bio (Menlo Park, California, USA) manufactured the peptides NPL001, NPL002, and NPL003 according to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP).

Adverse events were recorded at each visit, which were graded by site staff according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4&#x000b7;03. Pharmacodynamics assessments included a 38plex assay to profile cytokine and chemokine concentrations in plasma before and up to 10&#x000a0;h post-treatment at visits corresponding to administration of Nexvax2 at the previously determined maximum tolerated dose (150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) and at each of the higher dose levels.

The following study populations were used in the statistical analyses: the safety population included all participants who received a dose of Nexvax2 or placebo (analysed according to treatment actually received); the gastrointestinal symptom score population included all participants who received a dose of Nexvax2 or placebo and had at least one assessment of the GSRS after dosing (analysed according to treatment actually received); the pharmacokinetics population included all participants in cohort 3 who received a dose of at least 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of Nexvax2.</p><p id="p0095">Descriptive statistics was used to summarise demographic data and baseline participant characteristics. Adverse events were presented as numbers and percentage of participants. Pharmacokinetics of Nexvax2 peptides was summarised by dose level and presented as mean (95% CI) plasma concentrations; Pearson correlation coefficients were used to compare the plasma concentrations of the Nexvax2 peptides. The paired, non-parametric Wilcoxon's signed-rank test was used to compare GSRS scores over time and between treatment groups and to compare the change in villous height to crypt depth ratio between treatment groups. Cytokine data were presented as median fold change from pre-treatment levels. Data from cohorts 1 and 2 were analysed separately according to the Nexvax2 starting dose levels of 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g or 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g.

Four (5%) volunteers withdrew before completing screening, 24 (33%) were ineligible, and 45 (62%) were eligible. The commonest reasons for exclusion were being unsuitable in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor for unspecified reasons (8, 11%), Coeliac Dietary Adherence Test score over 12 (4, 5%), and having a laboratory test abnormality (3, 4%). Two (3%) participants were eligible but withdrew after randomization and were replaced before dosing commenced, and 7 participants who had been screened after completion of cohort 2 and met all eligibility criteria were found to be non-homozygotes and not randomized because cohort 3 was not yet open for enrolment. Recruitment was slower for cohort 1 because HLA-DQ2&#x000b7;5 homozygotes constitute only about 20% of patients diagnosed with celiac disease (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2007</xref>). Altogether, 36 ultimately received investigational product. By November 16, 2015, three participants had been recruited into cohort 1 (2 randomized to Nexvax2 and 1 randomized to placebo), while 6 had been recruited to cohort 2 (4 randomized to Nexvax2 and 2 randomized to placebo).

For participants enrolled after November 16, 2015, the dosing regimen was amended with the aim of improving tolerability of the starting dose. For the seven subsequent participants in cohort 1 (5 randomized to Nexvax2 and 2 randomized to placebo) and 8 participants in cohort 2 (6 randomized to Nexvax2 and 2 randomized to placebo), the Nexvax2 starting dose was 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and their assigned treatment included a total of 14 doses with six in the up-dosing phase. By December 3, 2015, the last of 15 participants was enrolled into cohort 2 (10 receiving Nexvax2 and 5 placebo), and ten months later, October 31, 2016, the last of 11 participants were entered into cohort 1 (8 receiving Nexvax2 and 3 placebo).

Six participants who commenced treatment did not complete the assigned number of doses, for 2 participants (1 receiving Nexvax2 and 1 placebo) this was due to early withdrawal with adverse events, and for 1 participant receiving Nexvax2 discontinuation was due to a protocol violation (gluten exposure). In addition, 2 participants missed one or two consecutive maintenance doses of 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g or 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, respectively, and 1 participant repeated the 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g dose during escalation.</p><p id="p0145">One of two participants enrolled in the initial group in cohort 1 who received Nexvax2 starting at 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g withdrew consent after the second dose in the up-dosing phase following adverse events considered to be study drug related.

One participant in cohort 2 received six doses of Nexvax2 including two doses at 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g before being discontinued from the study because of a protocol violation of unintended non-adherence to gluten-free diet. Approximately 7&#x000a0;h after the fifth dose, food containing gluten was consumed inadvertently, which was followed between 2 and 3&#x000a0;h later by abdominal pain graded moderate and fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, each graded mild.

For the 21 participants who had a Nexvax2 starting dose of 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and completed seven weeks of treatment in cohorts 1 and 2 or nine weeks of treatment in cohort 3, the average GSRS scores were lower at the end of treatment than at baseline in 13, the same in 3, and higher in 5 participants. In cohort 3, participants who received Nexvax2 showed the highest median change in GSRS scores between baseline and end of treatment (&#x02212;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;13, 25th&#x02013;75th percentiles:-0&#x000b7;18&#x02013;0&#x000b7;02), compared with cohort 1 (&#x02212;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;07, 25th&#x02013;75th percentiles:-0&#x000b7;13&#x02013;0&#x000b7;06) and cohort 2 (&#x02212;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;04, 25th&#x02013;75th percentiles:&#x02212;0&#x000b7;12-0).</p><p id="p0190">Relative change in the concentration of plasma cytokines and chemokines after sequential doses of Nexvax2 was a secondary endpoint.

In addition, for participants in cohort 3, serum levels of IgG and IgA specific for Nexvax2 were assessed. Participants in cohort 3 who received Nexvax2 had serum levels of IgG and IgA specific for Nexvax2 before and after the treatment period that were below the 95% cut off levels established with sera from unaffected donors (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Median levels of IgG and IgA specific for Nexvax2 were stable in cohort 3 over the 60-day treatment period.</p><p id="p0205">Previous phase 1 studies of Nexvax2 peptides demonstrated detectable plasma levels from 10&#x000a0;min to 2&#x000a0;h after administration of 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of Nexvax2, albeit at concentrations below levels of quantitation (5&#x000a0;ng/mL) (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2017</xref>). An improved pharmacokinetics assay was developed with lower levels of quantitation of 2&#x000a0;ng/mL for each peptide.

We found that stepwise, intradermal up-dosing from a low, well tolerated starting dose allowed Nexvax2 to be administered without any increase in adverse effects at a maintenance dose 300&#x000a0;&#x000d7; higher than the starting dose that was also 6&#x000a0;&#x000d7; higher than the previously determined maximum tolerated dose. The frequency and severity of adverse events appeared to be more strongly influenced by the starting dose of Nexvax2 (3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g or 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) than by the maximum dose administered (300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g or 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g). Dose inflexions during up-dosing were tolerated without any particular dose level being associated with an excess of adverse events. We found that the adverse event profile during up-dosing from 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g to 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g was similar in HLA-DQ2&#x000b7;5 homozygotes (cohort 1) and non-homozygotes (cohorts 2 and 3). HLA-DQ2&#x000b7;5 non-homozygotes in cohort 3 also tolerated further up-dosing from 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g to the maintenance dose of 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, although this was not tested in HLA-DQ2&#x000b7;5 homozygotes due to their slower rate of recruitment. Self-reported gastrointestinal symptom scores were similar for treatment with Nexvax2 and placebo.</p><p id="p0220">HLA-DQ2&#x000b7;5 positive volunteers with celiac disease participating in previous studies frequently experienced acute gastrointestinal symptoms after the first administration of Nexvax2 in regimens with fixed doses ranging from 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g to 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2017</xref>). In these studies, elevated plasma levels of IL-2 (a cytokine released by activated T cells), IL-6, IL-10, and the chemokines IL-8, MCP-1, and IP-10 were observed between two and 6&#x000a0;h after the first dose (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2016</xref>). In keeping with the milder adverse event profile in the present study, no cytokine signature was observed up to 10&#x000a0;h post-treatment with Nexvax2 from 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g to 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g. Occasional, but inconsistent, alterations in plasma chemokines were observed in some Nexvax2-treated participants who commenced up-dosing at 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, which included one participant who inadvertently consumed gluten after receiving the first 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g dose.</p><p id="p0225">Although we have previously detected the constituent Nexvax2 peptides in plasma after intradermal administration of Nexvax2, their levels were below limits of quantitation (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, we show that plasma concentrations of Nexvax2 peptides 45&#x000a0;min after intradermal injection are dose-dependent, which confirms systemic bioavailability that would facilitate engagement of cognate T cells at distant sites, including the gut, within 45&#x000a0;min of administration. Thus, the pharmacokinetics of Nexvax2 is consistent with other intradermally administered peptides that show dose-dependent pharmacokinetics and achieve maximal concentrations within 1&#x000a0;h, and dose exposure similar to subcutaneous administration (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Milewski et al., 2015</xref>). Plasma concentrations of each of the three Nexvax2 peptides were similar at 45&#x000a0;min post-treatment. No difference was found in Nexvax2 pharmacokinetics after the first and eighth maintenance dose at 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, which was associated with no change in serum Nexvax2-specific IgG and IgA levels.</p><p id="p0230">Duodenal morphology was a safety measure to assess whether repeated administrations of &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; doses of Nexvax2 could mimic the deleterious effects of gluten exposure. We found that two-times weekly up-dosing over five weeks and maintenance for four weeks with Nexvax2 at the highest dose of 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g was associated with duodenal histology showing no overall deterioration, and with trends for villus and villus-crypt axis lengthening. However, only one placebo-treated participant was available for comparison, precluding further interpretation of changes in duodenal histology.</p><p id="p0235">Although one limitation of this study was the small cohort sizes with fewer participants receiving placebo than Nexvax2, they were typical of phase 1 clinical studies, and participant demographics in these cohorts was consistent with the general population that suffers from celiac disease, which is primarily white, non-Hispanic women (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, although we have drawn comparisons between Nexvax2 fixed dosing and up-dosing regimens, we did not examine fixed dosing regimens in this study. However, because a maximum tolerated Nexvax2 dose of 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g had been previously established in participants similar to those in the present study, we could not justify arms in this study receiving fixed doses of 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g or 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g to establish their inferior safety profiles compared to up-dosing. Previous clinical trials of peptide-based immunotherapy have not stratified recruitment according to gene dose for the restriction element of the epitopes being administered. Because recruitment of volunteers homozygous for HLA-DQ2.5 was considerably slower than non-homozygotes, we elected to test the effects of up-dosing to the high maintenance dose of 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g only in HLA-DQ2.5 non-homozygotes. Notably, vomiting was the commonest adverse event after the first dose of Nexvax2 and affected 9 of 26 participants in these previous studies when they received 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g in a fixed dose regimen (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, none of 26 participants experienced vomiting when up-dosing preceded their first dose at 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and at 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, as well as none of 10 who received doses of 450&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 750&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, and 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g preceded by up-dosing. Later maintenance doses of Nexvax2 at 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g were also tolerated without excess adverse events, similar to placebo in the present study. In parallel with improved tolerability, Nexvax2 first administered at doses of 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g to 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g preceded by up-dosing was not associated with elevations in plasma IL-8, IL-2, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-10, and IP-10, which contrasted with the increases in these cytokines after the first dose at 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g to 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g in fixed dose regimens (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Goel et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0240">Patients with coeliac disease having no excess of adverse events and no increasing plasma cytokine levels after dosing with Nexvax2 at dose levels as high as 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g supports the potential use of Nexvax2 maintenance treatment to protect against the effects of dietary gluten exposure. Our recent findings in patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet indicate that the plasma cytokine signature associated with bolus administration of Nexvax2 is qualitatively and temporally indistinguishable from that following ingestion of gluten (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Tye-Din et al., 2017</xref>). Consuming a 3&#x000a0;g bolus of gluten elicits about 1/8th the elevation in plasma IL-2 as intradermal administration of a single dose of Nexvax2 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g in HLA-DQ2.5 positive celiac disease volunteers adhering to a gluten-free diet (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Tye-Din et al., 2017</xref>). In view of the unresponsiveness of participants to Nexvax2 900&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g in the present study, and that daily consumption of gluten is about 10 to 14&#x000a0;g in Europe and the United States (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Hoppe et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Kasarda, 2013</xref>), the optimized dose regimens determined in the present study would be attractive to further assess in clinical studies. Collectively, these results support the safety and tolerability of up-dosing and have allowed higher maintenance doses of Nexvax2 to be tested in efficacy trials.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Funding Source</title><p id="p0245">ImmusanT, Inc. funded the study and was involved in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and the writing of this report.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Conflicts of Interests</title><p id="p0250">JMA is a consultant to Abbvie, Abbott, Bayer, Celgene, Ferring, Janssen, MSD, Nestle, Hospira, Pfizer, Takeda, and Shire.
