reality movement therapy plus mental practice on upper extremity function in chronic
stroke patients with hemiparesis. [Subjects] The subjects were chronic stroke patients
with hemiparesis. [Methods] Thirty subjects were randomly assigned to either the control
group or experimental group. All subjects received 20 sessions (5 days in a week) of
virtual reality movement therapy using the Nintendo Wii. In addition to Wii-based virtual
reality movement therapy, experimental group subjects performed mental practice consisting
of 5 minutes of relaxation, Wii games imagination, and normalization phases before the
beginning of Wii games. To compare the two groups, the upper extremity subtest of the
Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Box and Block Test, and quality of movement subscale of the Motor
Activity Log were performed. [Results] Both groups showed statistically significant
improvement in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Box and Block Test, and quality of the movement
subscale of Motor Activity Log after the interventions. Also, there were significant
differences in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Box and Block Test, and quality of movement
subscale of the Motor Activity Log between the two groups. [Conclusion] Game-based virtual
reality movement therapy alone may be helpful to improve functional recovery of the upper
extremity, but the addition of MP produces a lager improvement.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Game-based virtual reality</kwd><kwd>Mental practice</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke remains a leading cause of adult disability in many countries. Though stroke can
cause dysfunctions in a number of neurological areas, the most commonly affected area is the
motor system<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Up to 85% of stroke
survivors experience motor dysfunction of the affected upper extremity (UE) after
stroke<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Traditional rehabilitative therapies can help improve the motor function of the UE<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recent studies indicate that repetitive
task-oriented training of the affected UE is beneficial<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, traditional rehabilitative therapies that require
repetitive and simple movements cause boredom and monotony, which may decrease the
participant&#x02019;s motivation to achieve a successful goal in rehabilitation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, it is difficult for stroke patients to sustain the
effect of interventions because it is impractical to observe how correctly interventions are
being performed at home. Due to the limitations of interventions, novel approaches using
virtual reality (VR) systems have been suggested and have begun to be used in clinical
settings<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Game-based VR is a novel approach that uses interactive simulation systems created by
computer hardware and software to provide three dimensional environments that mimic the real
life and enable users to be engaged in activities regardless of their physical
disabilities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Game-based VR movement therapy provides easily controlled and
graded purposeful task of the UE that can be practiced in a repetitive manner and thereby
may improve motor function after stroke<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Several studies have shown the effectiveness of costly game-based VR movement therapy using
the Sony PlayStation, EyeToy, and Nintendo Wii for functional recovery of the UE in patients
with stroke<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In stroke rehabilitation, mental practice (MP) has been adopted to improve physical
function and movement because of convenience in its use, cost effectiveness, and safety<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, MP can be used as a method
of performing additional practice attempts in rehabilitation settings, especially when
physical activity is not possible due to severe impairment<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. MP is a specific procedure in which stroke patients imagine the
process of a given movement sequence task without actually performing physical movement<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies indicate that MP is a
promising addition to the conventional intervention for stroke patients with hemiparesis.
Imagination of affected UE movement is helpful for facilitating learning of motor tasks<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have suggested that game-based VR movement therapy is an effective tool for
rehabilitation<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, whereas there has
been much less research on game-based VR movement therapy plus MP in stroke patients. The
objective of this study was to investigate the effects of game-based VR movement therapy
plus MP compared with game-based VR movement therapy only in chronic stroke patients with
hemiparesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Subjects were recruited in a local rehabilitation hospital in Republic of Korea. Subjects
were eligible for the trial if they were at least 6 months post stroke, were aged 18 to
80&#x02005;years, were cognitively intact (score &#x02265; 24 points on the Korean version of Mini-Mental
State Examination), had no experience with game-based VR, had mild to severe weakness of
their affected UE (as assessed by scores of 4&#x02013;60/60 points on the UE subtest of the
Fugl-Meyer Assessment), and were without other neurological conditions or epilepsy. All
subjects provided written informed consent prior to study inclusion according to the Code of
Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki, version 2004).</p><p>Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to control group (CG) or experimental group (EG)
in accordance with a random number table. Random allocation was performed by a research
assistant under blinded conditions. As in previous studies, all clinical measurements were
administered to the subjects at two time points at baseline and after the intervention
(after 4 weeks), by the same blinded rater<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All subjects performed 20 sessions (5 days a week for 4 weeks) of game-based VR movement
therapy using the Wii (Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan) for 30 minutes each session. Nintendo
introduced a new style of VR by using a wireless controller that interacts with the player
through an avatar and a motion detection system. The controller use embedded acceleration
sensors responsive to changes in direction, speed, and acceleration that enable subjects to
interact with the games while performing wrist, arm, and hand movements. A-2 point infrared
light sensor, mounted on top of a television, captures and reproduces on the television&#x02019;s
screen the movement from the controller as performed by subjects<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects who could not grip the controller used a bandage
to fix the controller onto the affected hand.</p><p>In the present study, the Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort games, both of which contain a
variety of games, were used. Based on previous studies on virtual reality movement
therapy<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, the bowling, table tennis, and canoeing games were used in this
study. The arm movements involved in use of the Wii included shoulder flexion and extension
(bowling), shoulder internal and external rotation, elbow flexion and extension, and forearm
pronation and supination (table tennis and canoeing). All subjects were allowed to practice
before playing the games and instructed to play the bowling, table tennis, and canoe game
with their affected UE.</p><p>In addition to Wii-based VR movement therapy, EG subjects engaged in MP sessions. Before
beginning to play the Wii games, the author described the goal of MP to each participant. MP
was performed in a quiet room. During MP, one of the authors read a script to the subjects
describing how to successfully play the Wii games for 5 minutes. According to the
suggestions of previous studies<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, authors implemented three phases of MP in
this study. The three phases of MP were as follows: (1) 1 minute of relaxation time, (2) 3
minutes of Wii game imagination, and (3) 1 minute of refocusing on the room. The purpose of
the relaxation time was to induce a mental response by regulating muscle tension and
breathing rate. The Wii game imagination phase was aimed at facilitating Wii game
performance by making subjects mentally practice task sequences. During this phase, subjects
were asked questions to check whether they were actually following each process of the Will
games. In the final phase, the authors asked the subjects to relax as they would
normally.</p><p>UE function was assessed using the UE subtest of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FM) and Box and
Block Test (BBT). The total maximum score of the FM is 66 points for the upper extremity
section, which assesses impairment using a 3-point ordinal scale. The FM offers impressive
test-retest reliability (total=0.98 to 0.99; subtest=0.87 to 1.00)<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BBT was used to assess gross dexterity by having the
subjects move as many blocks as possible from one place to another in 60 seconds. A change
of 5 or 6 blocks between before and after an intervention seems to be the smallest
detectable difference. The test-retest reliability of the BBT was reported to be r=0.95 for
the left hand and r=0.98 for the right hand; the intra-rater reliability was reported to be
r=0.99 for the left hand and r=1.00 for the right hand<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The quality of movement subscale of the Motor Activity Log
(MAL-QOM) was used as index to confirm transfer of therapy-induced improvement to the
performance of activities of daily living. The MAL-QOM has been shown to reflect how well
the affected extremity is used in activities of daily living, and the 30 items of the
MAL-QOM were completed daily. Scores for each task range from 0 to 5<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>
test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare differences in the participants&#x02019;
characteristics between the two groups. The Mann-Whitney U was used to test differences in
the FM, BBT, and MAL scores between the two groups. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used
to test differences in continuous variables within groups. Statistical significance was
accepted for values of p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The demographic characteristics of the subjects did not show significant differences

functional recovery of the UE in chronic stroke patients and that the effects are further
increased when the therapy is performed in conjunction with MP. Consistent with previous VR
studies<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, all subjects showed improvement in the outcome measures.
Furthermore, the changes were clinically significant, with the changes transferring to the
ability to perform activities of daily living (reflected by increased MAL-QOM scores).</p><p>In this study, the basic intervention for functional recovery of the UE was a game-based VR
movement therapy that was performed using the Wii. The therapy was performed by completing
each task displayed on a television screen by using the affected UE, and the tasks required
diverse UE movements. This may help to improve functional recovery of the UE by increasing
UE movement. Birkenmeier et al. reported a proof-of-concept study of a high-repetition dose
of UE task-specific training<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Combs et al. also indicated that repetitions of goal-directed movements using game-based VR
can facilitate UE repetitions in a fun and motivating manner<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Higher motivation is associated with better intervention outcomes,
which may reduce problems with intervention compliance<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. All subjects in this study had no experience with game-base VR
before participating in the study and were unfamiliar it. Such an unfamiliarity facilitated
interest, promoting motivation through visual feedback such as the avatars and VR
environment presented on the screen. In addition, the performance of the subjects in each
game was recorded daily and used to redefine intervention goal to facilitate motivation and
intervention compliance.</p><p>The EG subjects showed larger improvements in the FM, BBT, and MAL-QOM than the CG
subjects. These results are consistent with those of other studies in which MP was combined
with other interventions for the affected UE<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. MP has been shown to independently
produce neural changes<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular,
the combination of MP and a specific intervention can provide more opportunities for
neuroplasticity to occur than in the case of a specific intervention alone. In addition, MP,
including imaging the procedures of each game task in detail and training the task mentally
in advance, is effective for learning motor skills because it enhances the ability to
control UE movement and self-confidence when performing the task<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There were several limitations in this study. Although this study adopted a randomized
controlled trial design, the relatively small number of subjects limits the ability to make
definitive conclusions about the efficacy of game-based VR movement therapy plus MP.
Therefore, in future study, randomized controlled trial with a larger sample size are needed
to clarify the clinical benefits of game-based VR plus MP as a rehabilitation approach for
UE function in chronic stroke patients. In addition, because stroke patients were able to
use game-base VR at home without the constant supervision of a therapist, the use of
game-based VR movement therapy as a form of telerehabilitation needs to be examined.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Rathore</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Hinn</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Characterization of incident stroke signs and symptoms:
