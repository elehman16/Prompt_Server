Dry eye syndrome, which increases with age, is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface; symptoms include discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability, with the potential for exposure of and damage to the ocular surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Dry eye is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film, which can lead to morphological changes in the cornea and conjunctiva. Dry eye also involves inflammation of the ocular surface, which can result in apoptotic cell death in the corneal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Current therapies for dry eye are only palliative, focusing on replacement of tears to reduce symptoms. Thus, there is a need for drugs that directly address the causes of dry eye.</p><p>Oxidative mechanisms are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of dry eye syndrome. SkQ1 is a novel small molecule developed to reduce oxidative stress in cell mitochondria, targeting and neutralizing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondria are one of the main sources of molecular oxygen consumption in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Natural antioxidants are not capable of penetrating mitochondria and neutralizing the excessive amounts of free radicals generated by these organelles. After ROS-dependent oxidation in the mitochondria, SkQ1 is reduced by the respiratory chain, making it a renewable active compound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The localization of SkQ1 in mitochondria and its ability to regenerate make it a potentially effective pharmacological agent for treating pathologies of the eye associated with oxidative stress and lipid and protein peroxidation in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and for the prevention of the onset or progression of dry eye syndrome.</p><p>As a topical ophthalmic formulation for dry eye, SkQ1 has demonstrated statistically significant positive results in a Phase 2 clinical trial in the US for reduction of both signs and symptoms in subjects with mild to moderate dry eye syndrome, as discussed in this article. This study confirmed the results of a prior SkQ1 clinical study conducted in Russia and Ukraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An ophthalmic formulation of SkQ1, Visomitin, was approved in Russia in December 2011 and has since been marketed there as a prescription product. Russian studies with SkQ1 have involved 633 subjects; the US Phase 2 study enrolled 91 subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The Phase 2 US study was a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, single-center, 29-day clinical trial. The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of SkQ1 ophthalmic solution in the environment and during challenge in the Controlled Adverse Environment (CAE<sup>SM</sup>) chamber (Ora, Inc., Andover, MA, USA). The CAE is a clinical model used in the investigation of therapeutic agents to exacerbate the signs and symptoms of dry eye in a controlled manner by regulating humidity, temperature, airflow, lighting, and visual tasking within the CAE chamber. The CAE allows for standardized measurements of dry eye signs and symptoms and reduces variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The study included several dry eye sign and symptom parameters, described below.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Population</title><p>The subject selection process ensured that no subjects with underlying factors that could affect the conduct of the study or compromise subject safety enrolled in the study. All 91 subjects enrolled had clinical signs of mild to moderate dry eye for at least 6&#x000a0;months prior to study entry. The mean age of subjects was 62&#x000a0;years [standard deviation (SD) 10.68]; 24 subjects were men and 67 were women. Key inclusion criteria at Visits 1 and 2 included a corneal fluorescein staining score of &#x02265;2 in at least one region pre-CAE, a total lissamine green conjunctival score of &#x02265;2 pre-CAE, a Schirmer&#x02019;s test score of &#x02264;10 and &#x02265;1&#x000a0;mm, a score of &#x02265;2 in at least one symptom pre-CAE, and a demonstrated response to the CAE, based on Ora Calibra&#x02122; scales (Ora, Inc., Andover, MA, USA) as discussed in this article.</p><p>All subjects had to have demonstrated a reproducible dry eye response to the CAE at Visits 1 and 2. Exclusion criteria included no recent history of ocular surgery/procedures, no clinically significant (CS) slit lamp findings, no ongoing ocular infection or inflammation, no Restasis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) use within 30&#x000a0;days of Visit 1 (Day &#x02212;7), no punctal plug use that was not stable within 30&#x000a0;days of Visit 1, no contact lens use within 7&#x000a0;days of Visit 1, and no use of medications known to cause ocular drying within 30&#x000a0;days of Visit 1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p>All subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized 1:1:1 into one of three ophthalmic solution treatment groups, at SkQ1 1.55&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL, SkQ1 0.155&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL, or SkQ1 0.0&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL (placebo). The placebo consisted of benzalkonium chloride, hypromellose, sodium chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, and sodium dihydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate, and was identical to the SkQ1 treatment drug formulation except that the active ingredient SkQ1 was absent. Subjects self-administered one to two drops twice daily (BID) for 29&#x000a0;days in the morning and evening, including self-administration at two in-office visits, as described below. Subjects also recorded dry eye symptoms in a diary. Investigator assessments occurred at all study visits.</p><p>The study involved 4 visits over approximately 5&#x000a0;weeks. Visit 1 (Day &#x02212;7) was the screening visit; subjects were assessed for eligibility, including response to a 90-min CAE exposure. The study included a 1-week placebo (SkQ1 vehicle) run-in period between Visit 1 and Visit 2 for subject selection prior to randomization. At Visit 2 (Day 1), baseline efficacy and safety measures were taken and baseline values established; subjects received a 90-min CAE exposure and their responses to the CAE were confirmed. Also at Visit 2, subjects were then randomized into the three treatment groups and self-administrated the assigned study drug. Subjects continued to self-administer the study drug BID for 4&#x000a0;weeks. Visit 3 (Day 15) was the 2-week follow-up visit with efficacy and safety measures taken, and included subject self-administration of the study drug; no CAE exposure occurred at Visit 3. At Visit 4 (Day 29), the final 90-min CAE exposure occurred, efficacy and safety assessment measures were taken, and subjects exited the study.</p><p>Most efficacy measures for dry eye signs (corneal fluorescein staining, lissamine green staining, ocular protection index, blink rate, tear film break-up time (TFBUT), conjunctival redness, and lid margin redness) were assessed at each study visit (both pre- and post-CAE at Visits 1, 2, and 4, and once at Visit 3 at which no CAE exposure occurred). Additional measures for dry eye signs included corneal sensitivity, which was assessed at all study visits pre-CAE only, and Schirmer&#x02019;s test, which was conducted at all study visits post-CAE only.</p><p>Efficacy measures for dry eye symptoms included subject assessments of five symptoms (ocular discomfort, burning, dryness, grittiness, and stinging) assessed at all study visits (both pre- and post-CAE and at Visit 3); drop comfort assessed post-CAE at Visit 2 and Visit 3; and an ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire assessed pre-CAE at all visits.</p><p>Safety assessments for adverse events (AEs), visual acuity, and slit lamp biomicroscopy testing were conducted at all study visits; intraocular pressure (IOP), dilated fundoscopy, and pregnancy testing were conducted at Visits 1 and 4.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software Version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Middleton, MA, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Efficacy parameters were assessed at all study visits at all or some of the following time points: Visit 4 (Day 29)&#x02014;Pre-CAE, Pre-CAE change from Baseline (Visit 2, Day 1), post-CAE, change from Visit 2 post-CAE, and change from pre- and post-CAE at Visit 4; and Visit 3 (Day 15) and Visit 3 change from Baseline. The unit of analysis for most efficacy endpoints was the worst eye of each subject, defined as the eye with the worse inferior corneal staining before CAE exposure at baseline (Visit 2, Day 1), or if inferior corneal staining was the same in both eyes, then the eye with the earliest onset of symptom reaction to the CAE at baseline. For other endpoints, the unit of analysis was the subject.</p><p>Two-sided two-sample <italic>t</italic> tests were calculated for levels of significance. A level of statistical significance of 0.05 was used for differences between the SkQ1 treatments and placebo. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare each dose of SkQ1 ophthalmic solution and placebo and for count or rank-based data, including symptom scores at individual time points. Analysis of covariance models were used to include baseline values as covariates where appropriate. Mixed-effect models were used to analyze individual dry eye symptoms from the subject diary.</p><p>The primary and secondary efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomized subjects. Sensitivity analysis was performed on the per-protocol population, which excluded subjects with significant protocol deviations or who did not complete the study. Safety assessments were performed on the safety population, which included all subjects who received treatment from whom at least one safety measurement was obtained following the first dose of study drug.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study Procedures</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Efficacy Measures</title><p>The procedures used to assess efficacy measures are described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Dry Eye Signs</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Corneal Fluorescein Staining</title><p>Fluorescein staining of the cornea, commonly used to assess ocular surface damage, was assessed by the investigator using a slit lamp 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;min after instillation of 5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of 2% preservative-free sodium fluorescein solution into the inferior conjunctival cul-de-sac of each eye. A Wratten #12 yellow filter was used to enhance the ability to grade fluorescein staining. Staining was assessed in precisely defined regions (inferior, superior, central, temporal, and nasal) of the ocular surface using the Ora Calibra&#x02122; Corneal and Conjunctival Staining Scale and the National Eye Institute (NEI)/Industry Workshop Scale (NEI scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The Ora Calibra 5-point scale ranges from 0 to 4 points (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;none to 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;confluent) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The 4-point NEI scale ranges from 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;no staining present to 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;severe staining.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Lissamine Green Staining</title><p>Lissamine green staining, another measure of ocular surface damage, was assessed by the investigator using a slit lamp approximately 30&#x000a0;s after instillation of 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of lissamine green solution into the inferior conjunctival cul-de-sac. The Ora Calibra Corneal and Conjunctival Staining Scale and the NEI scale (both scales described above) were used for assessment. The NEI grid divides the conjunctiva into six regions: far temporal, temporal-superior, temporal-inferior, nasal-superior, nasal-inferior, and far nasal; the intensity of staining in these regions was scored by the investigator using the NEI 0&#x02013;3 scoring system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Ocular Protection Index (OPI 2.0)</title><p>An automated methodology was used to simultaneously measure TFBUT (described below) and Inter Blink Interval (IBI, the average time between blinks), as well as the area of tear film break up (percent of cornea exposed). Mean breakup area divided by IBI provides the OPI 2.0 score, reflecting a percentage of the area of tear film break up. Following instillation of fluorescein solution into the inferior conjunctival cul-de-sac, subjects&#x02019; tear films were recorded using a camera system for one minute while the subjects watched television. A 15 frame-per-second video of the fluorescent eye under visual task was taken and a computer program analyzed the area of cornea with broken tear film on a frame-by-frame basis. IBI and OPI were calculated and produced as assessments of the level of drying of the ocular surface.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Blink Rate</title><p>Blinks per minute were measured over a three-minute period, with a lower blink rate after treatment and CAE exposure associated with improvements in dry eye. A subject&#x02019;s blink rate (blinks per minute) was non-invasively assessed using automated controls and measured over a period of up to 10&#x000a0;min using a digital micro-camera system. The camera tracked the position of the upper eyelid over time and counted the number of times the upper eyelid moved out of its resting position. The blink rate was taken while the subject focused on a visual task. The camera was mounted onto a headset that fit any subject and used ambient illumination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>TFBUT</title><p>The TFBUT test was performed in accordance with standard procedures. For each eye, two measurements were taken and averaged unless the two measurements were &#x0003e;2&#x000a0;s apart and were each &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;s, in which case, a third measurement was taken and the two closest of the three were averaged and used for analysis. If the difference between the two sequential pairs was the same (e.g., 3, 6, 9&#x000a0;s), then the median of the three readings was used for analysis. Less time indicated a faster break-up of the tear film, which in turn indicates an unstable tear film characteristic of evaporative dry eye.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Corneal Sensitivity</title><p>Corneal sensitivity was measured with a Cochet&#x02013;Bonnet aesthesiometer, using vertical nylon threads of different lengths (mm) that touch the corneal surface. A lower value indicates less corneal sensitivity.

Data indicated that SkQ1 ophthalmic solution (0.155 and 1.55&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) could be expected to be safe and well tolerated in monitored human subjects studied at these concentrations (1.55&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL BID&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/eye/day and 0.155&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL BID&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.31&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/eye/day). Thus, the preclinical studies supported dosing at the higher concentration of 1.55&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g SkQ1/mL, with no evidence of systemic exposure at either 1.55&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL or 0.155&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL with BID dosing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Compliance with Ethics Guidelines</title><p>The study was Institutional review board-approved (Alpha IRB) and registered (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02121301).</p><p>All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, as revised in 2013.

For dry eye symptoms, statistically significant results occurred that indicated less ocular discomfort, dryness, and grittiness for SkQ1-treated subjects compared to subjects treated with placebo. Additional dry eye sign measurements, although not statistically significant, also indicated superior SkQ1 efficacy compared to placebo, and included corneal fluorescein staining for all other corneal regions at some time points, lissamine green staining for the central and nasal conjunctival regions, and blink rate.</p><p>Regarding safety, both doses of SkQ1 were safe. No serious AEs occurred, rates of AEs were similar between the SkQ1 treatment groups and the placebo group, and no subjects discontinued the study because of AEs. No CS safety issues were identified.

Oxidative stress occurs with excessive levels of ROS, a type of free radical produced as a byproduct of cellular mitochondrial respiration. At normal levels, ROS is important in cell signaling and homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. ROS, oxidative stress, and inflammation are important factors in dry eye disease, for which inflammation is considered the primary mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The relationship between oxidative stress and inflammation in dry eye disease continues to be explored. High levels of ROS and oxidative stress markers have been identified in the tear film and conjunctiva of Sjogren syndrome patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], in superficial punctate keratopathy in corneal epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], in the tear film of dry eye patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and in animal models of dry eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Wakamatsu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] discussed antioxidant enzyme activity in the eye, with the highest levels found in the retina, lower levels in the sclera and cornea, and tears containing little such enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, except for the retina, the eye contains few protections against free radicals/ROS. It has been suggested that lactoferrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] or selenium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] may provide protection of the corneal epithelium. SkQ1 belongs to a relatively new class of chemical compounds&#x02014;mitochondria-targeted antioxidants&#x02014;capable of targeting and neutralizing mitochondrial ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Aging, Environmental, and Lifestyle Contributors to Dry Eye Disease</title><p>Aging, which commonly results in decreased tear production and flow, and certain hormonal changes (e.g., during menopause) are major contributors to dry eye disease, with oxidative stress involved in the natural aging process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, acute and chronic environmental conditions can contribute to oxidative stress in the ocular surface, resulting in dry eye. Environmental and lifestyle contributors to dry eye are numerous and include: exposure to low humidity outdoors or indoors; tobacco smoke; wind; sun [ultraviolet (UV)] exposure; pollutants; ozone; certain medications, such as antihistamines, antidepressants, and beta-blockers; certain medical conditions, including other ocular conditions (e.g., blepharitis, allergic conjunctivitis), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren&#x02019;s syndrome, or contact dermatitis; contact lens use; and activities that decrease blinking, such as prolonged computer use or reading. SKQ1 has been shown to play a key role in the treatment of age-related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], slow age-dependent retinal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and increase the resistance of the lens to UV-irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Dry Eye Models</title><p>Animal and human models of dry eye can reflect the environmental conditions that contribute to oxidative stress and dry eye. A rat model of dry eye using low-humidity airflow suggested a strong relationship between oxidative stress and corneal surface disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A mouse model reflecting age-related ocular changes in the retina indicated that oxidative stress may play a role in retinal degeneration, and that the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme may protect retinal pigment epithelium from age-related degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Using this same mouse model, another study found that SOD1 may also provide protection for the dry eye parameters of tear function, the ocular surface, and the lacrimal gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>SkQ1 or related molecules have been shown to be active in a variety of animal models of illness believed to involve free radical damage. These include rat models of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ischemia-induced heart arrhythmia, heart infarction, kidney ischemia, and stroke, studied both ex vivo and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, SkQ1 has shown efficacy in a number of eye disease models. Ocular preclinical studies with SkQ1 have included dry eye models in mice, and uveitis and retinal degeneration models in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In the Phase 2 US clinical trial, SkQ1 was investigated using the CAE model to reflect the oxidative stress conditions of dry eye. The post-CAE results of this study as reported here indicate that SkQ1 treatment prior to CAE exposure protects the ocular surface from oxidative stress and provides a novel approach to dry eye treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Preclinical Studies with SkQ1</title><p>Preclinical studies have shown that SKQ1 effectively modulates mitochondria membrane electric potential, reduces cellular destruction and damage caused by excessive concentrations of ROS, and decreases ocular surface inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Based on a full range of animal toxicology studies, no adverse effects on general behavior or the central nervous system were observed (in rats orally administered SkQ1 at 0, 5, 25, or 100&#x000a0;mg/kg), or for cardiovascular parameters, pulse pressure, electrocardiography, body temperature, or clinical condition (in Beagle dogs orally administered SkQ1 at 0.00, 7.75, 77.5, or 775&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg) (unpublished reports). A mouse model study showed the efficacy of SkQ1 for the reduction of corneal staining, as discussed in the &#x0201c;Dose Selection&#x0201d; section above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Possible Study Limitations</title><p>Limitations of some of the available diagnostic tools (e.g., Schirmer&#x02019;s test, corneal fluorescein staining) may contribute to mixed underlying etiologies. Use of several dry eye tests compensates somewhat for these test limitations. In addition, seasonality may contribute to a reduction in the effects of dry eye treatments as the drier season progresses. In addition, environmental factors, such as subjects&#x02019; increased use of computers or reading or exposure to pollutants or certain medications, may also decrease the effects of dry eye treatments. Using a dry eye model (e.g., CAE chamber) that regulates humidity, temperature, airflow, lighting, and visual tasking, as used in the US Phase 2 study, can help control and minimize these potential confounding factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Prior SkQ1 Clinical Studies</title><p>The Phase 2 US clinical trial followed two clinical studies conducted in Russia. The first Russian clinical trial of SkQ1 demonstrated efficacy in treating signs and symptoms of dry eye compared to an artificial tear treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], after which Visomitin SkQ1 ophthalmic solution was approved in Russia (December 2011) and has since been marketed there as a prescription product. The second Russian clinical study assessed the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Visomitin compared with placebo (the same artificial tears formulation used in the initial Visomitin study) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The results of the second Russian study indicated that SkQ1 was safe and well tolerated by subjects, and restored corneal cell function and tear film stability, with improvements in both symptoms and corneal staining associated with dry eye. Post-therapy efficacy of Visomitin for TBUT, corneal staining, and symptoms over 6&#x000a0;weeks of a follow-up observation period showed a clear advantage of Visomitin over artificial tear treatments. The US Phase 2 clinical trial confirmed the safety and efficacy of SkQ1 dry eye treatment.</p><p>For future studies, categorizing subjects by both their worst dry eye symptom score and their corneal fluorescein staining scores may be useful in determining treatment efficacy, particularly when changes from pre-CAE and post-CAE scores at the end of the four-week treatment cycle are compared to baseline pre- to post-CAE scores.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This Phase 2 clinical trial indicated that SkQ1 is efficacious for the treatment of dry eye signs and symptoms and supported prior study results. SkQ1 was safe for use in the study&#x02019;s dry eye subjects, who found SkQ1 to be well tolerated and comfortable. Future studies will be conducted to confirm the efficacy and safety of SkQ1 ophthalmic solution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec48"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12325_2015_274_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material (PDF 291&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Sponsorship, article processing charges, and the open access charge for this study were funded by Mitotech S.A., Luxembourg.
