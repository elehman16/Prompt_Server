In China, 310 million people have been diagnosed with cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Cancer patients are at risk of malnutrition, not only due to the physical and metabolic effects of the disease but also due to the effects of anticancer therapies, and malnutrition is associated with poorer prognosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Additionally, malnutrition has a negative effect on clinical outcome. These effects may be driven by inadequate food intake, decreased physical activity, and catabolic metabolic derangement.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Therefore, it is important to improve nutritional status in order to enhance immunity status and chemotherapy tolerance in cancer patients.</p><p>However, concise intervention recommendations remain under heated debate. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines recommend regular screening of all cancer patients for the risk or presence of malnutrition. Weight loss and nutrition screening tools such as the 2002 Nutrition Risk Screening system (NRS-2002) could be used for nutrition screening.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> The Chinese version of NRS-2002 has been shown to function well in Chinese hospitalized patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> However, the methods and efficacy of this strategy requires improvement. Our clinical oncology center has developed a multidisciplinary team of specialist nurses for patient nutritional interventions. This strategy has been widely accepted by cancer patients and shows promising effects on nutritional status improvement in our center. Thus, we conducted a clinical trial to systematically investigate this strategy.</p><p>This prospective study investigated the effect on patient weight and serum albumin and prealbumin levels of this multidisciplinary team approach for nutritional interventions in colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>We performed a prospective, observational study to evaluate consecutive adult patients with colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy in the general ward of the Department of Medical Oncology of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University between January 1, 2014, and June 31, 2015. A total of 110 participants voluntarily joined the study and provided written informed consent. This study used the NRS-2002<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> to evaluate the nutritional status of patients upon their admission. Several results of clinical studies of NRS-2002 showed that nutritional support was invalid for NRS scores less than 3. Thus, patients with NRS scores of 3 points or less were excluded.</p><p>The inclusion criteria included conscious patients 18 years or older who had pathologically diagnosed cancer and were undergoing chemotherapy, with NRS-2002 scores greater than or equal to 3 points. Patients who were rejected participation in the study included those meeting the exclusion criteria, including those unable to eat normally, with severe organ failure, with a diagnosis of another cancer, with apparent infection or fever, and those with pulmonary tuberculosis or peptic ulcer.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Nutrition interventions</title><p>The patients were randomly divided into intervention and control groups of 55 patients each. Patients in the control group received nutrition screening, nutritional guidance, diet mission, and arranged meal times. Furthermore, nurses provided individual nutrition education, encouraged patients to eat more, and administered nutrition treatments according to patient biochemical indicators. Patients in the intervention group received individual recipes developed by a team including specialist nurses, clinical doctors, dietitian, family caregivers, and patients themselves. Two specialist nurses with 5 years of experience assessed in patient nutritional status within 48&#x0200a;hours according to NRS-2002. A dietitian calculated the patients&#x02019; total energy requirement according to the formula<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>: (total energy demand&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;base energy expenditure [BEE]&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;activity coefficient&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;stress coefficient&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;temperature coefficient; BEE: male weight (kg) &#x000d7;24, female weight (kg) &#x000d7;22.8; activity coefficients: bedridden (1.2), bed activities (1.25), normal light activity (1.3); stress coefficients: no postoperative complications (1.0&#x02013;1.05), cancer (1.1&#x02013;1.45), peritonitis (1.05&#x02013;1.25), serious infection or multiple trauma (1.3&#x02013;1.55); temperature coefficients: normal temperature (1.0), 10% increase for every degree Celsius rise in consumption). The dietitian informed the doctors and professional nurses of this result. Afterward, doctors administered parenteral or enteral nutrition at 70% to 80% of the total energy supply in order to avoid refeeding syndrome. After a full assessment of the patients&#x02019; custom, diet nutrition, chemotherapy, gastrointestinal reaction duration, and changes in serum prealbumin levels, the patients and family care takers received individual nutrition education from the professional nurses. The patient diets were continually adjusted according to their nutritional status.

Therefore, it is important to accurately and early identify nutritional risk in patients.</p><p>In this study, a multidisciplinary team approach for nutritional interventions conducted by specialist nurses improved prealbumin levels in colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, with no weight change. Moreover, 12 of 55 patients in the intervention group received nutritional intervention 1 week before chemotherapy. No treatment was interrupted by nutrition-related complications. Among the 55 cases in the intervention group, no patient required force-feeding. However, treatment in eight cases in the control group was interrupted by nutrition-related complications, including 5 cases of force-fed syndrome. A previous study<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> conducted a similar &#x0201c;individualized nutrition intervention,&#x0201d; in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. They found that the intervention decreased nutritional deterioration, similar to our results. These findings revealed that nutrition interventions should be based on the combination of specialist nurses and the full patient cooperation.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>Patient weight<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> and serum albumin and prealbumin levels<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> reflect the nutritional status of cancer patients and have been identified as critical prognostic factors for multiple cancers. Serum albumin and prealbumin levels increase immediately with improved nutritional status. The ESPEN guidelines recommend that weight, serum albumin level, and body mass index (BMI) could be used for nutritional screening.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> In this study, the serum albumin and prealbumin levels in the intervention group were statistically significantly different from those in the control group. These 2 indicators immediately increase with improved nutritional status. However, weight was not easy to improve.</p><p>A multidisciplinary team<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> dominated by professional nurses could effectively improve nutrition in patients with advanced cancer. In this study, the multidisciplinary team included a dietitian, clinic doctor, professional nurse, family caretaker, and the patients themselves. The professional nurse screened and identified early malnutrition in the cancer patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Clinic doctors should balance malnutrition and anticancer therapy in order to avoid the further aggravation of malnutrition by complications. Additionally, a specialist dietitian should be part of the multidisciplinary team for cancer patients throughout the continuum of care, as frequent dietetic contact has been shown to enhance outcomes.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, patients were aware of the study and would discuss their anticancer experiences with one other, so some nutritional interventions administered to the intervention group may have been imitated by the patients in other groups. Second, the sample size was limited. Third, all patients were from a single center; multicenter-based studies are needed to prove the efficacy of this strategy. Finally, it is necessary to collect data and continue follow-ups to explore the relationship between nutrition and patient survival.</p><p>In conclusion, a multidisciplinary team approach for nutritional interventions conducted by specialist nurses improved prealbumin levels in colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy with weight changes. Therefore, such multidisciplinary teams could provide the appropriate nutritional support essential for chemotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BEE = base energy expenditure, ESPEN = European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, NRS-2002 = 2002 Nutrition Risk Screening system.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>J-XL, X-WC, and Z-HC contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding: This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (31600710 and 81372374), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong (No. 2014A030313146 and 2016A030313302), Scientific research project of Guangzhou Municipal University (1201630019), and Research project of Guangzhou Medical University (2016A09) and Guangzhou Science and Technology Plan (2015Y2000007).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Baade</surname><given-names>PD</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
