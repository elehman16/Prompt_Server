For this reason, we formulated a new phenytoin-containing mucoadhesive paste and used it for better healing of oral biopsy wounds.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, in the present study we re-evaluated the healing effects of phenytoin mucoadhesive paste with a larger sample size and more matching between case (phenytoin group) and control (placebo group) in terms of age, sex, site of the biopsy, and type of biopsied lesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial has been done on patients attending Ghazi Tabatabaei Dental Clinic, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, who were candidate for oral biopsy. Thirty-five consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly classified into two groups of treatment and placebo (containing all of the paste ingredients without the phenytoin in the form of paste).</p><p>According to a previous study by Hasamnis <italic>et al</italic>., the paste contained 1% phenytoin powder (Merck Group, Frankfurt, Germany).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Other ingredients were plant heteropolysaccharides (Sigma Pharmaceuticals Limited, Victoria, Australia), hydrolyzed collagen (Merck Group, Frankfurt, Germany), Vaseline (Merck Group, Frankfurt, Germany), 1, 2-Propanediol (Merck Group, Frankfurt, Germany), cellulose (Sigma Pharmaceuticals Limited, Victoria, Australia), and strawberry essence (Darou-Pakhsh Pharmaceuticals Mfg. Co, Tehran, Iran). The paste was formulated in School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.</p><p>The inclusion criteria in the trial were as follows: (1) All patients had tentative diagnosis of oral lichenoid or lichen planus, (2) buccal mucosa was involved and biopsy was taken from this site in all participants, (3) age range between 30 and&#x02013; 50, (4) no history of systemic diseases at the time, of study (5) not using any topical or systemic medications, (6) being non-smoker and non-alchoholic, and (7) willing to participate in the study. Meanwhile, malignant-looking oral lesions, necrotic lesions, pemphigus-like lesions, and pregnant patients were excluded from the study.</p><p>After taking a written consent from all patients lesions were biopsied under local anesthesia using punch biopsy number 8 (Kia Medical Company, Japan), so that the size of all incisions was almost 10 mm. After incisional biopsy, patients were instructed to apply simple, or 1% phenytoin - containing mucoadhesive paste at least three times a day (after each meal), for 4 days. The patient and the researcher who gave the paste to them were unaware of the paste constituents, and allocation of patients to study or control group was done randomly. Phenytoin and placebo paste were packed in similar tubes.</p><p>Patients were evaluated every other day for size of wound closure, severity of pain, and diameter of the inflammatory halo. The inflammatory halo, as well as the degree of wound closure, were measured by Williams probe (Hu-Friedy Mfg. Co., Chicago, USA) at the day of the biopsy, and then on days 2 and 4 after biopsy.</p><p>The degree of pain was evaluated by patients&#x02019; self-report using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) at the day of biopsy, and then every other day till day 4 post biopsy.</p><p>The patients in both placebo and phenytoin-treated groups were instructed to apply the paste at least three times a day and preferably after meals on their incision site.</p><p>All study procedures were accomplished according to Helsinki Declaration after being approved by Medical Ethics committee session number 132, and research council number 330 of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.</p><p>Statistical analysis was done using Mann-Whitney U Test and Ordinal Logistic Regression by means of SPSS software, version 17 (Chicago, IL, USA). <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Out of 35 patients, 17 were in the phenytoin group including 59% men (10) and 41% women (7) with the mean age of 40 (4.11).

Various methods and medications have been used so far to alleviate the symptoms and improve the healing process of wounds; however, the outcomes of existing methods are still far from optimal.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The main mechanism by which phenytoin accelerates wound healing is still unclear. Clinical studies suggest that stimulation of fibroblastic proliferation, enhancing the formation of granulation tissue, decreasing bacterial contamination, decreasing collagenase activity (by reducing its production or secretion, or both), promoting deposition of collagen and other connective tissue components, and decreasing the formation of wound exudate might be implicated in the healing process.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In addition, biopsies of phenytoin-treated open wounds showed neovascularization and collagenization.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The analgesic effect of phenytoin may be more complex. Local pain relief due to blocking the sodium channels and membrane-stabilizing action of topical phenytoin therapy has been observed in several studies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we did not analyze the relation between age and sex with healing effects of pastes, but Makrantonaki and Zouboulis indicated that there was a sex divergence in the healing of acute wounds, and the healing process occurred more slowly in elderly men than in age-matched women.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Rhodes <italic>et al</italic>. found that topical phenytoin therapy resulted in a shorter time to complete healing and formation of granulation tissue when compared with DuoDerm dressings or triple antibiotic ointment applications.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Fonseka <italic>et al</italic>. found that phenytoin sodium 2% solution was beneficial for pyoderma gangrenosum with various etiologies, and it enhanced ulcer healing especially when the patient had refractory diseases.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Pereira assessed the therapeutic effect of topical phenytoin 0.5% on cutaneous healing from excision of melanocytic nevi on the face and found that patients who treated with phenytoin had significantly more profound epithelialization with smaller wounded area and shorter healing time than controls.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Hasamnis <italic>et al</italic>. studied the wound healing effect of 1% phenytoin cream in the wounds of rats. In their study, 20 male Wistar albino rats were subjected to excisional wounds measuring 500 mm<sup>2</sup> on the back and then randomized to control and treatment groups. The control group received no drug treatment till the end of the study. One percent phenytoin cream was applied to the wounds of rats in the treatment group and continued till the 16<sup>th</sup> day of the study. They calculated the percentage of wound healing by Walker formula after measurement of the wound area.

In their study, those patients treated with phenytoin suspension showed significantly faster healing at days 14 and 28 with significantly lower pain intensities.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Baharvand <italic>et al</italic>. administered 10 ml of 0.5% phenytoin mouthwash in patients with oral mucositis under chemotherapy four times a day. Their study failed to show any advantage of using 0.5% phenytoin mouthwash to reduce pain and discomfort, but it was effective in mucositis healing and improving life quality.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Applying the drug in the form of paste, when compared to cream or elixir, can avoid washing out the drug by saliva and prolongs contact of the formulation with the oral mucosa and allowing a longer duration for absorption. Besides, this formulation can act as a wound dressing, which can further ameliorate patients&#x02019; pain and discomfort.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Baharvand <italic>et al</italic>. first described healing effect of phenytoin mucoadhesive paste after oral biopsy on humans in 2013. She found that the rate of wound healing and decrease in the size of ulcers were significantly quicker in the phenytoin group, and the patients in this group reported less pain than those in the placebo group. However, the diameter of the inflammatory halo was not significantly different between two groups.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In their study, patients had different types of lesions with different entities of inflammatory, neoplastic, autoimmune-mediated, origin, etc., Moreover, biopsies were taken from different sites of keratinized and nonkeratinized epithelium. It seems that various nature and location of lesions with different microstructures might affect the healing process of the tissue and thereby therapeutic effects of phenytoin somehow. Therefore, in the present study, we modified the methodology and found some different results, which are discussed as follows.</p><p>In our study, it was shown that applying 1% phenytoin-containing mucoadhesive paste on biopsy incisions on the buccal mucosa can accelerate wound closure and help in reducing the size of incisions up to 3 days after surgery compared with control group, but after 5 days the difference between two groups was not significant. All incisions were of 1 cm length, of an acute nature, and expected to be healed up to 7 days after surgery. That is why phenytoin paste had a better effect in a short time, because as time passes the tissue healing process closes the wound through its natural mechanisms. Our results were in accordance with Chan <italic>et al</italic>., Jarrahi and Vafaei studies.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In our study, phenytoin paste was able to reduce the inflammatory halo better than placebo up to 3 days after surgery, but its effect was not significantly better than placebo after 4 days. Previous studies demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect of phenytoin.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] It seems that in acute wounds, the effects of topical phenytoin is more pronounced in a few days after onset of lesion when the natural healing process has not been reached its optimum effect yet.</p><p>Several studies have shown that VAS is a valuable method of pain measurement.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Contrary to some previous studies, our results failed to show any significant analgesic effect of topical phenytoin when compared with placebo.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In our study, the length of all incisions was short (1 cm), therefore, the pain quantity reported by both groups was of low intensity (VAS: 0&#x02013;4) at different intervals. This might be the reason why phenytoin paste did not show outstanding effects on pain control.</p><p>During the study period, patients in phenytoin group reported no side effects. In the agreement to our finding, Hasamnis <italic>et al</italic>. pointed out that the topical application of phenytoin results in direct access of the drug to the target site, and avoids the risk of getting systemic side effects.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, according to Talas <italic>et al</italic>., the most frequent side effect of phenytoin when administered systemically is gingival enlargement observed after approximately 1 month of drug use, begins in interdental papillae, and usually in the anterior gingival regions.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Other uncommon side effects of phenytoin include ataxia, ophtalmoparesis, megaloblastic anemia, hypertrichosis, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and immunoglobulin A deficiency.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In order to better clarification of the effects of phenytoin paste, it is suggested to design further studies to compare it with other formulations such as creams, powders, and mouthwashes. Meanwhile, additional studies in various types of oral lesions are recommended.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Mucoadhesive phenytoin paste has shown
