Head-to-head comparisons of current fixation constructs are needed to establish which stitch/suture combination is most biomechanically favorable.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypothesis:</title><p>Of the tested fixation constructs, Giftbox repairs with Fiberwire will exhibit superior stiffness and strength during biomechanical testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design:</title><p>Controlled laboratory study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Two biomechanical trials were performed, isolating stitch technique and suture type, respectively. In trial 1, 12 transected fresh-frozen cadaveric Achilles tendon pairs were randomized to receive either the Giftbox-modified Krackow or the Bunnell stitch with No. 2 Fiberwire suture. Each repair underwent cyclic loading, oscillating between 10 and 100 N at 2 Hz for 1000 cycles, with repair gapping measured at 500 and 1000 cycles. Load-to-failure testing was then performed, and clinical and catastrophic failure values were recorded. In trial 2, 10 additional paired cadaveric Achilles tendons were randomized to receive a Giftbox repair with either No. 2 Fiberwire or No. 2 Ultrabraid. Testing and data collections protocols in trial 2 replicated those used in trial 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In trial 1, the Bunnell group had 2 failures during cyclic loading while the Giftbox had no failures. The mean tendon gapping after cyclic loading was significantly lower in the Giftbox repairs (0.13 vs 2.29 mm, <italic>P</italic> = .02). Giftbox repairs were significantly stiffer than Bunnell (47.5 vs 38.7 N/mm, <italic>P</italic> = .019) and showed more tendon elongation (5.9 &#x000b1; 0.8 vs 4.5 &#x000b1; 1.0 mm, <italic>P</italic> = .012) after 1000 cycles. Mean clinical load to failure was significantly higher for Giftbox repairs (373 vs 285 N, <italic>P</italic> = .02), while no significant difference in catastrophic load to failure was observed (mean, 379 vs 336 N; <italic>P</italic> = .61). In trial 2, there were no failures during cyclic loading. The Giftbox + Fiberwire repairs recorded higher clinical load-to-failure values compared with Giftbox + Ultrabraid (mean, 361 vs 239 N; <italic>P</italic> = .005). No other biomechanical differences were observed in trial 2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Simulated early rehabilitation biomechanical testing showed that Giftbox-modified Krackow Achilles repair technique with Fiberwire suture was stronger and more resistant to gap formation at the repair site than combinations that incorporated the Bunnell stitch or Ultrabraid suture.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Relevance:</title><p>A more in-depth understanding of the biomechanical properties of the Giftbox repair will help inform surgical decision making because stronger repairs are less likely to fail during accelerated postoperative rehabilitation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Achilles rupture</kwd><kwd>tendon repair</kwd><kwd>Achilles repair</kwd><kwd>tendon biomechanics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Achilles tendon ruptures are a common problem that many orthopaedic surgeons encounter.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The rate of midsubstance Achilles ruptures has nearly doubled in the past 50 years, reaching its current incidence of 18 injuries per 100,000 people.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Changes in population demographics such as increased age and elevated body mass index have been shown to be risk factors.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>
</p><p>Operative versus nonoperative management of midsubstance Achilles ruptures continues to be debated. Surgical repair has been associated with decreased rerupture rates and trends toward faster return to work, but with increased risk for complications.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Suboptimal outcomes are common with both operative and nonoperative management.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>
</p><p>Overlengthening of the Achilles tendon secondary to suture stretching or loss of fixation at the suture-tendon interface is a key issue responsible for poor functional outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Even after precise intraoperative tensioning and apposition of the tendon ends, a gap of even 5 mm can lead to significantly worse outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A second consideration is the high rate of postoperative wound dehiscence and tendon necrosis, leading some to hypothesize that increased suture bulk and prominence may act as a nidus for adhesion.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>
</p><p>Historically, there has been debate over several repair techniques, including the Kessler, Bunnell, triple bundle, and Krackow.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The recent meta-analysis by Sadoghi et al<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> of Achilles repair techniques noted trends in the strength differences between stitches but concluded that the compiled data were too heterogeneous to allow for an endorsement of any single repair technique. The Krackow stitch has been a staple of treatment, and its strength and durability has been shown to be superior to several other stitches.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In 2009, the Giftbox modification of the Krackow was introduced and demonstrated superior biomechanical properties in comparison to the original Krackow.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The triple-bundle technique is touted as the strongest in biomechanical studies, but there are clinical concerns regarding disruption of the vascularity of the tendon due to large amounts of suture employed.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Finally, repairs using the Bunnell stitch have exhibited the greatest tensile strength of the commonly used techniques, outperforming the Kessler and Krackow by a significant margin.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>
</p><p>Several studies have compared different types of braided nonabsorbable sutures, finding Fiberwire (Arthrex) to be superior when compared with other conventional sutures.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, none of these trials used cyclic loading in human cadavers.</p><p>This study reports on a series of 2 head-to-head biomechanical comparisons of matched cadaveric Achilles repairs with different fixation constructs.

The Giftbox modification of the traditional Krackow stitch changes how the suture tails are managed and where the final knots are placed. After the Krackow stitch is completed, the suture tails are passed across the rupture site and traverse in a buried fashion through the central portion of the opposing tendon. One suture tail is brought out of the superficial tendon surface before reaching the crossing arm of the opposing Krackow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2325967117707477">Figure 3</xref>). The second suture tail exits beyond the crossing arm, capturing the crossing arm between the 2 suture tails. This procedure is repeated for the suture tails of the opposing Krackow. Both sets of tails are then tagged, and an epitendinous repair is completed with 3-0 polypropylene suture to help reapproximate the tendon ends and achieve appropriate tension before the final core knots are tied.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> A No. 2 nonabsorbable braided suture made of ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) (Fiberwire) was used for all repairs.</p><fig id="fig1-2325967117707477" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>An example of the Giftbox repair in a cadaveric Achilles tendon.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2325967117707477-fig1"/></fig><fig id="fig2-2325967117707477" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>An example of the Bunnell repair in a cadaveric Achilles tendon.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2325967117707477-fig2"/></fig><fig id="fig3-2325967117707477" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>A schematic illustrating the stitch patterns for the (A) Giftbox and (B) Bunnell repair techniques.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2325967117707477-fig3"/></fig><p>After a single surgeon completed all 24 repairs, a cyclic loading protocol adapted from prior similar studies was performed.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The calcanei were mounted on a materials testing machine (EnduraTEC Systems Corp) with the Achilles placed at a 30&#x000b0; angle to simulate the physiologic stress of early heel rise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2325967117707477">Figure 4</xref>).

Despite extensive research, determinants of Achilles tendon repair effectiveness have not been clearly established.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> As rehabilitation protocols have become much more aggressive, emphasizing early motion and controlled stress at the repair site, knowledge of the strongest and most durable repair construct is needed. The purpose of this study was to analyze suture pattern (Giftbox vs Bunnell) and suture type (Ultrabraid vs Fiberwire). Testing protocols historically used in the literature were employed for consistency.</p><p>In the analysis of pattern, Giftbox repairs were biomechanically superior to Bunnell repairs with regard to both gap resistance and strength (<italic>P</italic> = .02 for both). In the analysis of suture type, Fiberwire Achilles repairs were found to be statistically significantly stronger than matched Ultrabraid repairs during load to failure.</p><p>Our experimental design incorporates aspects of many previous Achilles biomechanical studies. High-repetition, high-force cyclic loading is thought to most accurately model current trends for postoperative rehabilitation protocols that stress early range of motion, early weightbearing, and early light-resistance stressing of the repair.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Our testing method revealed biomechanical differences that may not be apparent with only single-trial displacement-driven load-to-failure testing, reproducing a more physiologic load nearing what has been proposed for early weightbearing with a shoe lift in place.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Traditional displacement-driven single load-to-failure trials were also included as a subsequent step to allow for comparison of our results with many previous studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>
</p><p>The chosen repair techniques and &#x0201c;failure&#x0201d; definitions were driven by the most recent articles and guidelines.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Fiberwire was selected for inclusion primarily because it has been shown to lead to stronger tendon fixation than Ethibond (Ethicon) and many other suture types.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="bibr3-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr4-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Second, the only previous biomechanical study of the Giftbox used a much less studied suture (Hi-Fi, ConMed Linvatec), which made comparison with other construct combinations difficult.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>
</p><p>Our 2 trials address key elements of Achilles repair and Achilles research. Trial 1 and trial 2 both contained Giftbox + Fiberwire groups. These identical groups exhibited similar clinical load-to-failure values, reinforcing the consistency and reproducibility of our testing protocol. Second, catastrophic load-to-failure values in our study occurred when the tendon ends were already gapped greater than 1 cm, hence we considered this outcome measure less clinically relevant, a conclusion that has been alluded to in other studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Finally, the clinical load-to-failure strength of Giftbox + Ultrabraid repairs was lower (239 N) than the Bunnell + Fiberwire (285 N), but the Bunnell group exhibited failures during cyclic loading and the Giftbox + Ultrabraid did not. Hence, stitch technique may affect the stiffness of Achilles repairs and their ability to resist gapping more than suture type. Given this finding, load-to-failure values in isolation should be interpreted with caution, as they did not always correlate with the overall integrity and durability of the repairs in our study.</p><p>Weaknesses of this study include its use of cadaveric tendons as a model for in vivo tendons. Many studies have noted limitations with regard to cadaver-related, suboptimal tissue integrity secondary to early decay and advanced age when compared with the typical patient population that sustains this injury.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Heterogeniety in the cadaveric tissue quality between the 2 trials may explain the difference in stiffness observed between the Giftbox + Fiberwire groups in trials 1 and 2. Additionally, the tissue shredding that occurs at the ruptured tendon ends in vivo was not accurately represented by the simple transection used in our procedures. However, the repair techniques span the shredded portion of tendon, with the first core suture passes traversing the tendon 2 to 3 cm away from the rupture site. These limitations could significantly alter the biomechanical properties of the tendon and the repairs.</p><p>The ultimate construct for Achilles tendon rupture fixation remains to be seen; however, the Giftbox + Fiberwire method outperformed the other tested constructs in this study. This combination minimizes suture bulk particularly around the repair junction, increases the number of strands across the rupture site, and keeps the knots away from the diseased portion of tendon. It also allows for accurate tensioning of the tendon ends because any shortening of the repaired segment can be directly visualized and adjusted as the knots are tightened down on the tendon. The Giftbox + Fiberwire constructs showed minimal displacement with intensive cyclic loading, and exhibited higher clinical load-to-failure values than any other construct to date except the triple bundle, whose increased suture bulk and prominence has led to concern about tendon adherence and wound healing.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> To our knowledge, only 1 clinical study, which was retrospective in nature, has included the Giftbox technique, reporting increased strength compared with the Krackow.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2325967117707477" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Further outcome-focused, prospective clinical research is needed to confirm the superior characteristics of this repair and compare it head to head with other well-studied repair techniques.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section7-2325967117707477"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combination of a Giftbox-modified Krackow Achilles repair technique and Fiberwire suture with an epitendinous repair is stronger and stiffer than constructs that combined the Bunnell technique with Fiberwire suture and the Giftbox with Ultrabraid. It also outperformed all other previously published fixation combinations except the triple bundle, although direct comparison is limited by different testing conditions and study protocols. We recommend the Giftbox stitch with Fiberwire in combination with an epitendinous repair for the operative fixation of midsubstance Achilles tendon ruptures.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-2325967117707477"><p>One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: the Dayton Area Graduate Medical Education Community (DAGMED) awarded this project the resident research grant of $250.
