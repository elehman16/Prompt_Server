Eligibility criteria were the ability to complete the intervention accurately and no history of psychiatric diseases. The students were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: an intervention group (IG, n = 28) and a control group (CG, n = 26). The IG participants completed fiveacupressure sessions three times a day (morning, noon, and night), involving the application of pressure to six acupuncture points (GB12, SI17, and LI18 according to 2008 World Health OrganizationRegional Office in the Western Pacific standard), three on the left and three on the right side of the neck for 5 s each. The CG participants were requested to spend their time as usual. Self-reported levels of tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, vigor, fatigue, and confusion over the past week were measured before and after the study as the main outcomes. Side effects were not predicted and not assessed. The retention rate of this trial was 100%. Improvements in mood, defined as a change from baseline to 2 weeks later, were significantly greater in IG. Our results showed that self-administered intervention had the ability to alter mood levels in college students.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>college students</kwd><kwd>contemporary and alternative medicine</kwd><kwd>mood</kwd><kwd>self-administered acupressure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In Japan, the management of mood levels is considered an important issue to maintain the mental health of students (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Michimuko, Kinoshita, &#x00026; Nishizawa, 1997</xref>). <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Katsuura et al. (2011)</xref> reported that 26.3% and 8.1% of 209 Japanese college students exhibited moderate to severe levels, respectively, of anxiety and depression. Therefore, from a mental health perspective, it is important to help Japanese college students to manage negative moods.</p><p>Acupressure plays an important role in both contemporary and alternative medicine (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">McFadden et al., 2012</xref>). According to the meridian theory of Chinese medicine, energy (Qi) flows through meridians, which are invisible circuitries or energy channels in the body. This theory assumes that mental or physical health is disturbed if the flow of Qi is too fast, too slow, turbulent, or static. Acupressure corrects the flow of Qi by applying pressure with the fingers to given acupuncture points. Importantly, acupressure can be self-administered to promote physical and mental health (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Honda, Tsuda, &#x00026; Horiuchi, 2012a</xref>).</p><p>Self-administered acupressure may be a useful self-care tool for college students to manage mood levels. <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Honda, Tsuda, and Horiuchi (2012b)</xref> reported that self-administered acupressure intervention, developed by <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Honda et al. (2012a</xref>), decreased the degree of depression&#x02013;dejection, which was measured with the Japanese version of the <italic>Profile of Mood States&#x02014;Brief Form</italic> (POMS-J; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Yokoyama, 2005</xref>). The participants were instructed to complete five acupressure sessions three times a day (morning, noon, and night). Each session involved pressing six acupuncture points, three on the left and three on the right side of the neck for 5 s each. The three acupuncture points are known as GB12, SI17, and LI18, according to the <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization Regional Office in the Western Pacific (2008</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether this self-administered intervention can reduce other negative moods, such as anxiety and anger, or improve positive moods in college students.</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine the effects of self-administered acupressure intervention (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Honda et al., 2012a)</xref> of Japanese college students to provide new information on the ability of self-administered acupressure to alter mood levels. Specifically, the results of this study will help practitioners to use acupressure for the intervention of mood levels of college students.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>2.1 Participants</title><p>A total of 54 college students (34 males and 20 females; mean age, 29.96 &#x000b1; 9.10 years) majoring in acupuncture and moxibustion medicine at a college located in Fukuoka, Japan, were intentionally recruited for participation in this study for two primary reasons. First, these participants were trained to accurately locate the six acupuncture points used in the aforementioned study by <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Honda et al. (2012a</xref>). Secondly, the participants were a sample of convenience. One of the authors (Y. H.) was the instructor of several classes completed by the participants. The exclusion criterion was only a history of current or previous psychiatric illnesses; however, no participant fulfilled this criterion. The authors did not conduct a priori power analysis to determine an adequate sample size, as there has been no previous randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of self-administered acupressure on a variety of mood levels.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>2.2 Outcome Measure</title><p>Mood levels were measured using POMS-J, which comprisessix mood scales: tension&#x02013;anxiety, depression&#x02013;dejection, anger&#x02013;hostility, vigor, fatigue, and confusion (POMS-J; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Yokoyama, 2005</xref>). Each subscale comprises five items. Participants were asked to report their mood levels over the past week on a 5-point Likert scaleranging from 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 4 (<italic>extremely</italic>). POMS-J is a standardized tool of moods and its scores can be converted to T score [mean = 50, standard deviation (SD) = 10], using its manual (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Yokoyama, 2005</xref>). This conversion is based on a large dataset, not on the study sample only. Thus, the mean and standard deviation of the participants were not necessarily 50 and 10, respectively. Higher T scores indicate higher levels of moods.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>2.3 Procedure</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kurume University. This study was conducted at a college located in Fukuoka prefecture, Japan, over a 2-week period in July, 2012. The participants gave an oral informed consent to participate in this study after receiving a thorough explanation of the study aims and procedure.A written consent was not obtained from each participant. One of the authors was a teacher to each participant, and some participants might hesitate to declare through written consent form that they would refuse to participate in this study. Effort was made to protect the right of each participant to refuse to participate in this study.</p><p>The participants were randomly assigned into one of the two groupsby one of the authors: an intervention group (IG) and a control group (CG). Finally, 28 students were assigned to IG and 26 to CG. The allocation was disclosed to the participants and the authors.</p><p>After completion of the classes, baseline mood levels were collected using POMS-J. The participants in IG were instructed to complete the self-administered acupressure intervention, as reported by <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Honda et al. (2012a</xref>), and perform five acupressure sessions thrice a day (on waking, after lunch, and before going to bed). For each session, the participants were instructed to apply pressure with the thumbs to the six acupuncture points (i.e., GB12, SI17, and LI18) for 5 s each for a sensation of comfort. These acupuncture points are located in the neck [for detail, see <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Honda et al. (2012a)</xref>]. The intensity of pressure to the accupoints was determined by each participant. One of the authors provided encouraging messages once a week to each participant in IG to effectively perform acupressure, while those in CG received no specific intervention. The participants in IG were not required to report whether they performed the acupressure procedure or not. After 2 weeks, mood levels were measured. The participants were followedup by numbers (e.g., 912), words (e.g., orange juice), or nicknames (e.g., little may) that they determined at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>2.4 Analyses</title><p>Statisticalanalyses were performed using SPSS statistical software (version 22; IBM SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

The acupressure intervention described here can be self-administered once students learn where and how to apply pressure to the six acupuncture points. Practitioners in the field of school healthcare can select from a variety of methods to assist college students with mood regulation. For example, the effectiveness of several relaxation techniques, such as autogenic training, progressive relaxation, and biofeedback, has already been demonstrated. However, no technique has been reported to be effective in all individuals. Thus, additional choices of methods to manage mood will aid in the design of interventions according to an individual&#x02019;s needs (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Honda et al., 2012a</xref>).</p><p>Although this study provided new evidence supportive of the ability of self-administered acupressure to reduce mood levels, the following two limitations should be addressed. It is unclear whether these findings can be generalized to other student populations. First, this study focused on college students who are majoring in acupuncture and moxibustion medicine. These students seem to be more likely to be interested in acupressure, and this may contribute to very high participation and retention rates. Second, this study lacked a placebo-control group. Based on this study, it is required to conduct another randomized controlled trial wherein such a control group is established. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the generalizability of the findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by grants from JSPS KAKENHI (grant nos.: 22330196 and 26780390).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><source>Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences</source><year>1988</year><edition>2nd ed</edition><publisher-loc>New Jersey</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Lawrence Erlbaum</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Honda</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsuda</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Horiuchi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of a four-week self-administered acupressure intervention on perceived stress over the past month</article-title><source>Open Journal of Medical Psychology</source><year>2012a</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>20</fpage><lpage>24</lpage><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/ojmp.2012.13004">http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/ojmp.2012.13004</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Honda</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsuda</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Horiuchi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Four-week self-administered acupressure improves depressive mood</article-title><source>Psychology</source><year>2012b</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>802</fpage><lpage>804</lpage><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/psych.2012.329121">http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/psych.2012.329121</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Katsuura</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamezaki</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamagishi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuwano</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Nishida</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Masuda</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Rokutan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Circulating vascular endothelial growth factor is independently and negatively associated with trait anxiety and depressive mood in healthy Japanese university students</article-title><source>International Journal of Psychophysiology</source><year>2011</year><volume>81</volume><fpage>38</fpage><lpage>43</lpage><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2011.04.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2011.04.004</uri></comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21545819</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McFadden</surname><given-names>K.
