Of those, fatigue is one of the most common side effects in patients receiving chemotherapy. It has been reported that about 50% to 75% patients had experienced fatigue when they received such treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> The others studies also reported that this number rises to 80% to 96% for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and 60% to 93% for patients also undergoing radiation therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Although the mechanism of chemotherapy-related fatigue is not well understood, rest and sleep alone cannot help to relieve the condition.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Additionally, if this condition cannot be treated effectively and timely, it can lead to anxiety, depression, and a very poor quality of life (QOL) for cancer patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Unfortunately, very few interventions are available to treat cancer-related fatigue.</p><p>It has been reported that complementary and alternative therapies (CAT) can be used to treat chemotherapy-related fatigue.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> In addition to reducing fatigue, they can also enhance QOL and relieve depression and anxiety among cancer patients,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> with the improvement of the median of brief fatigue inventory from 4.8 to 3.9 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.001), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)-Anxiety from 8 to 7 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.001), HADS-Depression from 7 to 6 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.001), and global QOL improved from 50 to 67 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.001) after the treatment of 12 weeks. Therapeutic care (TC), especially acupressure, is one of the CAT interventions with the potential to reduce fatigue. In addition, 1 prior study reported a positive effect of acupressure in managing cancer treatment-related fatigue and achieved successful outcomes<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> with significant improvements of general fatigue (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.001), physical fatigue (<italic>P&#x0200a;</italic>=&#x0200a;.016), activity (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.004) and motivation (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.024). Additionally, significant improvements of fatigue levels with 36% and 19% improvements in the acupuncture group, and acupressure group, when compared with 0.6% in the sham acupressure group. However, limited evidence is still available to support the idea that TC can be effectively used to treat this condition.</p><p>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that TC can reduce cancer treatment-related fatigue in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p>This randomized controlled trial was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of The Affiliated Hongqi Hospital of Mudanjiang Medical University and was also performed at such hospital. Forty-eight breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy from January 2015 to December 2016 were included. All eligible participants were screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria before selection. The patients were randomly divided into the intervention group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Study population</title><p>All participants were recruited from The Affiliated Hongqi Hospital of Mudanjiang Medical University. The eligibility criteria for this study included patients aged from 18 to 70 years with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score from 0 to 2. All participants had histologically proven breast cancer and were surgically treated with lumpectomy or mastectomy. Patients with active psychiatric illness, pregnancy, or refused to participate were excluded. Moreover, patients who take supplements, herbs, and medication-related fatigue were also excluded from this study. In addition, all patients had to provide informed consent, demonstrating that they understood they would receive active or sham treatment and would be unaware of group assignment. All patients were recruited and included prior to their first chemotherapy treatment.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>The software package SAS 8.3(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to perform a block randomization scheme. The randomization assignments were concealed in opaque sequentially numbered sealed envelopes prepared by the statistician. Forty-eight participants were assigned at a 1:1 ratio to the intervention group or control group according to the randomization assignments. The participants, researchers, outcome assessors, and data analysts were blinded to the treatment allocation.</p><p>All participants in both groups were told that they were testing the effects of 2 sets of acupoints by the same acupressure technique skills. All patients did not know which set of acupoints were applied by sham technique.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Intervention</title><p>All participants in the intervention group were administered TC with acupressure at bilateral Hegu (LI4, in the middle of the second metacarpal bone on the radial side), Zusanli (ST36, 3 cun below the lower border of the patella, 1 finger width lateral from the anterior border of the tibia), and Sanyinjiao (SP6, 3 cun directly above the tip of the medial malleoulus on the posterior border of the tibia), 30&#x0200a;min/d, each point 10&#x0200a;minutes, 3 days weekly for 12 weeks. All the selected points have been reported to relate with the energy in the human body and have been previously shown to relieve fatigue in cancer patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> In the control group, all patients received sham TC at the first metacarpal head, patella, and inner ankle with the same scheme treatment session as the intervention group.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> The 3 points in the control group within the range of locations without acupoints, have been reported to have no relationship with any ability to alleviate cancer-related fatigue.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>All 3 acupoints were stimulated through acupressure with thumbs of physicians. The acupressure of these 3 points should feel strong but not intolerably painful. Additionally, the acupressure skills in this study consisted of pointing, pressing, kneading, and pushing in both groups. Pointing technique is used for finding the acupoints. Pressing technique is used for releasing the qi flow by pressure. Kneading technique is used for stimulating the therapeutic effect by rotating the figures around the selected acupoints. Pushing technique is used for relaxing the local muscles and improving the blood circulation by pushing the thumb from the selected acupoints to the around area.</p><p>All acupressure interventions were performed by 2 practitioners, who were trained for acupressure technique skills by a 10 years qualified professional practitioner. The 2 practitioners were not allowed to know which groups they performed. All acupoints were selected by the other professional acupressure treatment expert, who did not involve the treatment assignments and also the acupressure interventions. The consistent of acupressure therapy was measured by the previous scale.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> The accuracy of implementation was also confirmed by 2 professional experts.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>The primary outcome was fatigue, which was measured by the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI).<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> This well-validated scale consists of 5 areas: general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced activity, reduced motivation, and mental fatigue. Each subscale ranges from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of fatigue.</p><p>The secondary outcomes included anxiety, depression, and sleep quality. The HADS was used to evaluate anxiety and depression,<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was estimated based on the given outcome measurement of fatigue, with a significant difference with a standard deviation of 0.8, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 (2-sided) and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.20.

TC is one of the most important types of CAT that effectively relieves a variety of symptoms.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> It has been reported that it can reduce stress, anxiety,<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> and pain,<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> as well as other symptoms.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> In the present study, we explored the effect of TC for relieving chemotherapy-induced fatigue in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</p><p>The results of the present study are partly consistent with the previous study,<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> which specifically focused on the acupressure therapy for the treatment of fatigue in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. It was designed as a 3-group randomized controlled trial with total of 47 patients comparing acupuncture therapy and acupressure therapy with sham acupressure treatment control.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> It consisted of 2-week treatment, and 2-week follow-up after the treatment. The acupuncture group and acupressure group reported significantly greater reductions in fatigue compared with the control group with general fatigue (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.001), physical fatigue (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.016), activity (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.004), and motivation (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.024). In addition, there were also more significant differences of fatigue levels with 36% and 19% improvements in the acupuncture and acupressure group respectively, when compared with 0.6% in the sham acupressure group. In this study, we treated all patients for 12 weeks and measured the outcomes at the end of 6-week and 12-week treatment, respectively. At the end of 6-week and 12-week treatment, the significant improvements of fatigue in the intervention group were found, compared with the sham acupressure in the control group. However, only at the end of 12-week treatment, anxiety and depression, measured by HADS-Anxiety, and HADS-Depression; and sleep quality, measured by PSQI exhibited more significant enhancements in the intervention group, compared with those in the control group.</p><p>Although a positive effect of TC for relieving cancer treatment-related fatigue was achieved, this study still suffered from several limitations. First, the sample size was pretty small, which may affect the detection of differences between the groups. In addition, the effect of the intervention may have been affected by the patient&#x02013;provider relationship. Third, the cancer treatment-related fatigue relief was evaluated using the MFI scale, which is a relatively subjective tool and may be affected by multiple unknown factors. Finally, this study was conducted at only 1 center of The Affiliated Hongqi Hospital of Mudanjiang Medical University, and all of the participants were Han Chinese, which might have influenced the generalizability of our findings to patients in other hospitals and other ethnicities.</p><p>We demonstrated that the administration of TC to breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy induced a significant reduction in cancer treatment-related fatigue and relieved anxiety, depression, and poor sleep quality. Future studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to verify this result.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CAT = complementary and alternative therapies, ECOG = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, HADS = Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, ITT = intention-to-treat, LI4 = Hegu, MFI = multidimensional fatigue inventory, PSQI = Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, QOL = quality of life, SP6 = Sanyinjiao, ST36 = Zusanli, TC = therapeutic care.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported in part by The Key Project of the Heilongjiang Health Bureau(2017-317) and The Innovation and Training Project of Heilongjiang Provincial College Students (201710229055).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>CZ</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
