We evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib for induction and maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (CD).</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>We conducted two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase IIb studies. Adult patients with moderate-to-severe CD were randomised to receive induction treatment with placebo, tofacitinib 5 or 10&#x02005;mg twice daily for 8&#x02005;weeks. Those achieving clinical response-100 or remission were re-randomised to maintenance treatment with placebo, tofacitinib 5 or 10&#x02005;mg twice daily for 26&#x02005;weeks. Primary endpoints were clinical remission at the end of the induction study, and clinical response-100 or remission at the end of the maintenance study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>180/280 patients randomised in the induction study were enrolled in the maintenance study. At week 8 of induction, the proportion of patients with clinical remission was 43.5% and 43.0% with 5 and 10&#x02005;mg twice daily, respectively, compared with 36.7% in the placebo group (p=0.325 and 0.392 for 5 and 10&#x02005;mg twice daily vs placebo). At week 26 of maintenance, the proportion of patients with clinical response-100 or remission was 55.8% with tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg twice daily compared with 39.5% with tofacitinib 5&#x02005;mg twice daily and 38.1% with placebo (p=0.130 for 10&#x02005;mg twice daily vs placebo). Compared with placebo, the change in C-reactive protein from baseline was statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.0001) with 10&#x02005;mg twice daily after both induction and maintenance treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Primary efficacy endpoints were not significantly different from placebo, although there was evidence of a minor treatment effect.

Clinical laboratory parameters were monitored and events, confirmed by adjudication related to cardiovascular safety, opportunistic infections, malignancy, GI perforation and hepatic injury, were recorded. Malignancies were confirmed by central laboratory pathologist review of biopsies, when relevant biopsy specimens were available.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size</title><p>The induction study aimed to randomise approximately 275 patients. Following removal of the tofacitinib 15&#x02005;mg twice daily group from the study, it was estimated that at least 80 patients would be assigned to each of the three remaining groups, with the total planned number of patients remaining unchanged at 275. Under the assumption that the placebo remission rate was 19%, 80 patients per group would provide 80% power at a level of 0.05 to detect a 20% difference.</p><p>Based on the expected response proportions to tofacitinib and placebo at the end of the induction study, it was expected that approximately 90 patients from the tofacitinib groups would be re-randomised in the exploratory maintenance study. With 30 patients per group, and the assumption of 55% patients in the tofacitinib groups achieving remission or clinical response-100 at week 26, the half-width of the two-sided 80% CI of the primary endpoint in each tofacitinib group was &#x0003c;12%. With an additional assumption that the primary endpoint was 35% in the placebo group at week 26, the half-width of the two-sided 80% CI for the difference between each of the tofacitinib groups and the placebo group was &#x0003c;16.5%.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Assignment of subject identification number and study drug were managed by a tele-randomisation system, by which the subject was enrolled online or via a telephone call. At the baseline visit, provided all inclusion and exclusion criteria were met, the subject was randomised to trial medication. In the induction study, patients were stratified by whether or not they had previous exposure to TNFi. In the maintenance study, patients were stratified and randomised according to their treatment assignments in the induction study, and their clinical remission status at week 8 of the induction study. Study treatment was blinded to patients, investigators and the sponsor. Treatment randomisation information remained confidential and was not released to the investigator or study staff until the conclusion of the studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>In the induction study, the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used for efficacy data to test the superiority of each dose of tofacitinib to placebo. Stratification was based on prior use of TNFi treatments at baseline. Two-sided 95% CIs for the difference between each dose of tofacitinib and placebo were calculated at weeks 2, 4 and 8, based on normal approximation to the binomial distribution. A total of 16 patients had been randomised to the tofacitinib 15&#x02005;mg twice daily group, in the induction study, when this group was removed. Due to the small number of patients treated with tofacitinib 15&#x02005;mg twice daily, the data for this group were not included for comparison with placebo in the efficacy analyses but were included in the safety analyses.</p><p>In the maintenance study, binary efficacy endpoints were descriptively summarised by dose group and study visit. Normal approximations were used to form the two-sided 80% CIs for the treatment difference and p values from two-sided Fisher's exact test for the comparison of each dose of tofacitinib versus placebo.</p><p>The continuous endpoints such as CDAI scores and biomarkers that were measured overtime were analysed using linear mixed-effects models that require no imputation of missing data. For binary efficacy endpoints derived from the CDAI score, patients with missing values were treated as non-responders or non-remitters in both studies. The changes from baseline for CDAI scores measured repeatedly over time were analysed using a linear mixed-effects model assuming an unstructured covariance matrix. Biomarker data were log-transformed (natural logarithm) and changes analysed using a linear mixed-effects model. The adjusted estimate for the difference between each tofacitinib dose and placebo, as well as the corresponding two-sided 95% CIs and p values, were reported. Descriptive summaries of CRP and FCP in the original scale were also presented by dose group for observed values and for change from baseline at each time point.</p><p>Analyses were performed for the full analysis set (FAS, all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study medication) of the induction study, and for the modified FAS (mFAS, excluding placebo responders from the induction study) population of the maintenance study.

maintenance study (10.0&#x02013;13.1%) compared with the induction study (3.3&#x02013;11.6%). In both studies, these proportions were similar between the tofacitinib 5&#x02005;mg twice daily and placebo groups (3.5% and 3.3%, respectively in the induction study; 10.0% and 11.9%, respectively, in the maintenance study), and numerically higher with tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg twice daily (11.6% and 13.1% in the induction and maintenance study, respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="GUTJNL2016312735TB3">table 3</xref>). The most common SAEs in the tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg twice daily groups were GI AEs and infections.</p><p>Two patients in each of the induction study treatment groups had serious infections (placebo: one cytomegalovirus infection and one perianal abscess; tofacitinib 5&#x02005;mg twice daily: one abdominal abscess and one gastroenteritis; tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg twice daily: one perianal abscess and one pneumonia influenza) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="GUTJNL2016312735TB3">table 3</xref>). Of these, one case (cytomegalovirus infection in the placebo group) was confirmed by adjudication as an opportunistic infection. One case of malignancy confirmed by adjudication (breast cancer, in the tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg twice daily treatment group) was reported in the induction study.</p><p>In the maintenance study, there were no reports of serious infections or special events of interest in the placebo group. Three and two patients in the tofacitinib 5 and 10&#x02005;mg twice daily groups, respectively, had serious infections (tofacitinib 5&#x02005;mg twice daily: one <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> colitis, one <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection and one septic shock all in the same patient, and two perianal abscesses; tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg twice daily: one perianal abscess and one pneumonia influenza infection). No cases of opportunistic infections were confirmed by adjudication in the maintenance study. There was one case of large intestinal perforation confirmed by adjudication in the tofacitinib 5&#x02005;mg twice daily group of the maintenance study and two cases of non-serious herpes zoster (tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg twice daily) were reported in the maintenance study. Finally, no cases of cardiovascular events were confirmed by adjudication in either study.</p><p>At week 8 of the induction study, larger increases in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were observed with tofacitinib 5 and 10&#x02005;mg twice daily (8.4% and 11.5% increase from baseline in total cholesterol, respectively) compared with placebo (3.4%). A 10.5% increase from baseline in triglyceride levels was reported in the placebo group at the end of the induction study compared with 1.1% and 0.1% in the tofacitinib 5 and 10&#x02005;mg twice daily groups, respectively. At week 26 of the maintenance study, mean per cent changes from baseline in the placebo, tofacitinib 5 and 10&#x02005;mg twice daily groups were &#x02212;12.3%, 3.3% and 0.2%, respectively, for total cholesterol levels and &#x02212;1.5%, 4.2% and 8.0%, respectively, for triglyceride levels.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The proportion of patients in clinical remission (CDAI &#x0003c;150) after 8&#x02005;weeks of induction therapy, with tofacitinib 5 and 10&#x02005;mg twice daily, was not statistically significant compared with placebo. The proportion of patients achieving clinical remission or clinical response-100 at week 8 was only significant for tofacitinib 5&#x02005;mg twice daily versus placebo. A modest but consistent treatment effect of tofacitinib was demonstrated for the secondary clinical endpoints of clinical response-70 and clinical response-100 at week 8. This treatment effect was supported by significantly greater reductions from baseline in CRP concentration with both doses of tofacitinib versus placebo although no significant reductions from baseline in FCP concentration were observed. In the subsequent 26-week maintenance study, the primary endpoint of clinical response-100 or clinical remission at week 26 was observed in a higher proportion of patients receiving tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg twice daily than placebo, although again the difference was not statistically significant. It should be noted, however, that this study was not powered for comparisons between treatment groups. Together with the results observed in patients with moderately to severely active UC in which the proportion of patients achieving remission with tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg twice daily was significantly higher compared with placebo,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> changes from baseline in the biomarkers CRP and FCP concentrations (secondary endpoints) supported a treatment effect with tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg twice daily in CD.</p><p>The proportion of patients in the placebo group achieving or maintaining clinical remission or clinical response-100 was substantially higher than that reported in other recent phase II or III studies assessing other agents in CD and using CDAI as the efficacy endpoint.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;25</xref> This unexpectedly high placebo response prevented a thorough evaluation of the dose-response relationship of tofacitinib in inducing and maintaining response in clinical endpoints and biomarkers.</p><p>A number of factors could have contributed to the high placebo response observed in these studies. First, although there was a requirement for visible ulceration for inclusion, there was no requirement for a centrally read endoscopy at study entry, and no protocol-defined minimal requirement for the extent or severity of ulceration at baseline. There was also no protocol-defined threshold for FCP or CRP levels at baseline, as an objective marker of disease activity. A previous study has shown a greater treatment effect in patients with endoscopically confirmed ulcers and elevated CRP levels at baseline.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A high proportion of patients (&#x0003e;30%) in the tofacitinib 5 and 10&#x02005;mg twice daily and placebo groups were receiving corticosteroids at baseline. Although there was a requirement for a stable dose to have been received for at least two&#x02005;weeks prior to baseline and to be maintained during the induction trial, it is possible that the response seen in some patients receiving placebo was due to steroids, which are known to be effective in inducing remission.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> A slow tapering with prolonged corticosteroid therapy may have led to a higher proportion of responders in the placebo group. Lastly, the lack of correlation between CDAI and disease activity may have contributed to an elevated number of remitters in the placebo group. This possibility is supported by the demonstration of a statistically significant treatment effect for both 5 and 10&#x02005;mg twice daily using PRO2-75 remission endpoint and for 5&#x02005;mg twice daily using the PRO3-80 remission endpoint.</p><p>No new safety signals were detected for tofacitinib in either study compared with those previously reported in other indications,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> although three AEs of special interest (one case of large intestinal perforation confirmed by adjudication and two cases of non-serious herpes zoster) were seen in patients receiving tofacitinib as maintenance therapy. Most AEs were either GI AEs or infections. There were no cases of opportunistic infection confirmed by adjudication in patients treated with tofacitinib in either study, although one such infection (cytomegalovirus infection) was reported in the placebo group of the induction study. The proportions of patients with SAEs were numerically higher with tofacitinib 10&#x02005;mg twice daily (11.6% and 13.1% in the induction and maintenance study, respectively) compared with the tofacitinib 5&#x02005;mg twice daily (3.5% and 10.0%) and placebo (3.3% and 11.9%) groups.</p><p>In summary, some evidence of minor clinical efficacy for tofacitinib in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate-to-severe CD was observed in these two phase IIb clinical studies. There were no unexpected safety findings. The minor improvement in measures of disease activity observed in these studies supports further investigation of the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibition for CD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the patients, investigators and study teams who were involved in both clinical trials.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> PH, BES, WJS, EM, GC, WW and AM substantially contributed to the conception or design of the work.
