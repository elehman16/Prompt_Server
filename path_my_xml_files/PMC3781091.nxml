Studies have shown that PA works by undoing the effects of stress [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, experience of PA decreases the likelihood of follow-up depressive symptoms [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and facilitates remission from a depressive episode [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Positive and negative affective states do not represent two extremes of the same dimension [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Rather, they constitute distinct dimensions of emotional experience, with distinct adaptive functions, mediation of which takes place in different brain systems [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Where negative affect (NA) may inform the person of imminent threat (with respect to life, future, or hierarchical position in the group), PA has the function of engaging the person with the environment and other individuals in social networks [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This function is reflected in the fact that positive affective states have an inverted U-shaped curve over the day [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], suggesting that most PA is experienced in the middle of the day when there are more opportunities to encounter pleasant situations. The broaden-and-build theory [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] suggests that positive emotions have a direct impact on attentional awareness, making us more open to experience and contact. This theory also suggests that positive emotions facilitate the building of social networks, resulting in long-term well-being and social connectedness. Garland and colleagues [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] characterized this as the positive spiral of positive emotions: increased social openness and positive behavioral repertoire will, in turn, again lead to new experiences of positive emotions. Taken together, PA appears to significantly contribute to mental health.</p><p>There are different ways to acquire PA. One is the experience of PA in response to natural rewards. Reactivity to rewarding situations has been examined both experimentally and prospectively in the flow of daily life. Experimental studies expose individuals to pleasant images in the laboratory or use computer tasks in which participants can earn certain monetary rewards [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Other studies prospectively measured appraisals of situations and affective states, and examined reactivity to pleasant situations in the flow of daily life [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Second, retention of earlier acquired PA contributes to subsequent positive emotional experience over time. Only few studies have tried to examine this phenomenon in relation to depressive symptoms. Heller and colleagues [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found that depressed patients have difficulty sustaining activity in brain areas that are responsible for PA and reward, suggesting reduced PA persistence in depression. Two other experimental studies measured persistence of PA and NA in the laboratory, during a 20-minute family interaction task between adolescents and their parents, focused at resolving an area of conflict. The conversations were videotaped and emotional fluctuations were measured by rating the verbal and non-verbal behavior of healthy and depressed adolescents during this interaction. Results showed that, compared to healthy participants, depressed adolescents were more emotionally resistant; that is, showed less emotional reactivity to changing circumstances [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In healthy adolescents, this emotional resistance to both positive and negative change predicted follow-up onset of major depression [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To date, only one study has measured persistence of PA in daily life. This study compared the extent to which individuals retained PA over time in a group of 53 depressed adults compared to a group of 53 healthy controls [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. No differences between groups were found.</p><p>Taken together, only few studies have prospectively examined PA persistence in relation to depression. These studies used different designs and yielded dissimilar conclusions. There is an urgent need for replication of findings as true replication of studies across different designs is challenging. Therefore, in the present study we explored PA persistence in three different samples by examining moment-to-moment transfer of positive affect in the flow of real life. Studies that measure PA persistence prospectively in the flow of daily life are particularly scarce. To our knowledge, to date no study has examined prospectively, in the flow of daily life, how PA persistence &#x02013;conceptualized as moment-to-moment transfer of PA- predicts future course of depression. For this purpose, we used the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>ESM is an assessment technique that allows prospective tracking of momentary experience in daily life. The advantage of this technique is that subtle moment-to-moment transitions in affective states are captured and assessed in the moment, with minimal retrospection and cognitive reinterpretation. Furthermore, ESM has strong ecological validity, as measurements are performed in everyday life [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine and replicate, in three different samples, whether moment-to-moment transfer of PA predicts future course of depressive symptoms. First, we examined in a general female population sample whether moment-to-moment transfer of PA would be associated with follow-up symptoms of depression. Second, we examined in a sample of depressed patients whether differences in moment-to-moment transfer of PA would be associated with differences in treatment response. In addition, in this sample we were able to examine whether this effect would differ for patients with first episode versus recurrent depression, as previous work suggests that this is an important moderator of treatment response [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Finally, in a third sample we investigated again whether differences in moment-to-moment transfer of PA would be associated with differences in treatment response in depressed patients. The data of this sample, however, were derived from a randomized controlled trial in which depressed participants were allocated to imipramine or placebo treatment. Therefore, this sample allowed for an additional moderation analysis comparing active pharmacological treatment with placebo. For both patient samples, matched healthy controls were available to additionally compare effects as a function of clinical status.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Three separate studies were carried out to answer the above research questions.

In the present three studies, participants received a digital wristwatch and a set of ESM self-assessment forms collated in a booklet for each day. The wristwatch was programmed to emit a signal (&#x02018;beep&#x02019;) at an unpredictable moment in each of ten 90-min time blocks between 07:30 and 22:30, on five or six consecutive days, depending on the study. After each beep, participants were asked to fill out the ESM self-assessment forms, collecting reports of mood. All self-assessments were rated on seven-point Likert scales. Trained research assistants with ample experience in momentary assessment techniques explained the ESM procedure to the participants during an initial briefing session and a practice form was completed to confirm that all were able to understand the scales. Subjects could call a telephone number in case they had questions or problems during the ESM sampling period. Participants were instructed to complete their reports immediately after the beep, thus minimizing memory distortion, and to record the time at which they completed the form. In order to verify compliance, the reported completion time was compared with the actual time of the beep. All reports not filled in within 15 minutes after the beep were excluded from the analysis, as previous work has shown that reports completed after this interval are less reliable and consequently less valid [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, participants with fewer than 17 out of 50 (study 1), or 20 out of 60 (studies 2 and 3) valid reports were excluded from the analysis, as previous work has shown that measures of individuals with less than 30% of completed reports are less reliable [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Study 1</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Participants</title><p>We investigated in a sample of 621 participants from the East-Flanders Prospective Twin Survey in Belgium &#x02013;a general population sample that has been followed prospectively to study gene&#x02013;environment interactions in affective disorders [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]- whether people with greater momentary transfer of PA are less likely to develop follow-up depressive symptoms. Although most subjects were twins, the current study did not require twin methodology.</p><p>Of the 621 participants, 610 completed the ESM measurements. Thirty-one were subsequently excluded due to inadequate ESM compliance and 39 due to missing follow-up data on depressive symptoms, resulting in a final sample of 540 participants. The mean number of completed ESM reports was 38.0 (SD 6.6; range 17-50). Participants were white and of Belgian origin; mean age was 27.6 (SD 7.8; range 18-61).

Since some analyses had to be controlled for level of NA, this was assessed in a similar fashion as PA. Participants rated ten momentary affective states on 7-point Likert scales (1: not at all to 7: very). Our choice of the ESM affect items was guided by the PANAS questionnaire [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and by results of previous ESM studies (selecting items with high loadings on NA and PA latent factors and sufficient within-person variability). Factor analysis, using principal component analysis with oblique rotation, identified two mood factors with eigenvalue &#x0003e;1 [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ratings for the items &#x02018;cheerful&#x02019;, &#x02018;content&#x02019;, &#x02018;energetic&#x02019;, and &#x02018;enthusiastic&#x02019; &#x02013;weighted for factor loadings- were averaged to form the PA scale. The weighted average of ratings for &#x02018;insecure&#x02019;, &#x02018;lonely&#x02019;, &#x02018;anxious&#x02019;, &#x02018;low&#x02019;, &#x02018;guilty&#x02019;, and &#x02018;suspicious&#x02019; formed the NA scale.</p></sec><sec id="s3.3.2"><title>Depressive symptoms</title><p>All participants completed the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90R) [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which yielded prospective measures of depressive symptoms over time. As a measure of follow-up depressive symptomatology, we used the mean of the SCL-90R scores over time points T1 through T4. In order to improve normality, the SCL-90R depression score was log-transformed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3.4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>ESM data have a hierarchical structure with multiple observations (level 1) clustered within participants (level 2). Multilevel analysis takes the variability associated with each level of nesting into account [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Multilevel mixed regression analyses, using the <italic>xtmixed</italic> command in Stata 11.1 (StataCorp, 2009), were applied to the data. To obtain a regression model that specifically tests within-subject effects, we centered the variables PA and NA around the individual mean. The model estimated the extent to which PA level at moment (<italic>t-1</italic>) (independent variable) predicted PA level at the next moment (<italic>t</italic>), approximately 90 minutes later on the same day (dependent variable), reflecting the degree of momentary PA transfer or PA persistence. By fitting an interaction term between PA at (<italic>t-1</italic>) and mean SCL-90R scores at T1-T4 in the model of PA at (<italic>t</italic>), we tested whether PA persistence differed according to level of depressive symptoms at follow-up, corrected for baseline depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075655-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This model thus effectively tests whether the association between baseline PA and follow-up SCL-90R scores is contingent on the level of PA persistence. We controlled for level of NA at moment (<italic>t</italic>) to ensure that any effect of momentary transfer of PA was in fact independent from level of NA. All effect sizes were standardized and calculated from the model containing the interaction with the Stata <italic>lincom</italic> command.</p></sec><sec id="s3.5"><title>Results</title><p>Overall, level of PA at a given beep was a significant predictor of level of PA at the next beep (&#x003b2;=.370, SE=.007, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.001).

We found that individuals from a general population sample with a higher baseline ability to savor PA in daily life had a lower level of depressive symptoms at follow-up. In the first clinical sample, baseline transfer of PA over time predicted response after eight weeks to combined treatment with antidepressants and psychotherapy. This effect was more pronounced in patients with a history of depressive episodes than in patients who were depressed for the first time. Finally, the results from the second clinical sample revealed that baseline moment-to-moment transfer of PA over time predicted treatment response after six weeks.

Although several studies have examined PA reactivity to pleasant situations [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], PA <italic>persistence</italic> remains understudied.</p><p>The current findings are compatible with work presented by Heller and colleagues [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], who showed that depressed patients have difficulty sustaining activity in brain areas responsible for PA and reward. It is attractive to speculate that these findings represent the neurobiological correlates of lower level moment-to-moment transfer of PA in real life in depressed patients, as reported in the current study. A recent ESM study by Thompson and colleagues [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], however, found no difference in momentary PA persistence between depressed individuals and healthy controls. This contrasts with the current findings, which indicated that generally lower PA persistence was encountered in depressed patients as compared to healthy controls. One potential difference between Thompson and colleagues&#x02019; and our study to explain the discrepancy in findings may be found in the group characteristics that were compared. While Thompson and colleagues compared depressed patients with healthy controls, our study mainly focuses on the difference in response to treatment within the patient group as compared to healthy controls. That is, we did not compare healthy individuals with depressed patients in general, but with responders and non-responders, respectively. Finally, a study by Kuppens and colleagues [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] found that persistence of happy feelings was related to <italic>higher</italic> levels of current and future [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] depressive symptoms. In their experiment, adolescents and their families were instructed to talk about difficult family situations for 20 minutes while they were being videotaped. The adolescents&#x02019; verbal and non-verbal behavior during the interaction was rated, and happy, angry and dysphoric behaviors were derived. The emotional behavior of current and future depressed adolescents appeared to be more resistant to changing circumstances. That is, they showed greater persistence of positive as well as negative emotional behavior than healthy participants. It is possible that these contrasting findings reflect important differences in study design and methodology. While we measured savoring PA in daily life at random moments in the day, Kuppens and colleagues measured the persistence over time in emotional <italic>responses</italic> to a certain situation in the laboratory. A fundamentally different concept may therefore have been measured. Kuppens and colleagues explain their findings in that a stronger persistence of PA or NA seems to indicate an affective resistance to change, reflecting impaired adjustment to the environment (<italic>emotional inertia</italic>) or inflexibility [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The findings in the current study on moment-to-moment transfer of PA pertained to measurements at a different time scale (measurements were on average 90 minutes apart over several days and were not assessed minute-to-minute in a 20 minute lab experiment) and do not reflect persistence of an emotional response to a certain situation. Since measurements in the current study were further apart than in the study of Kuppens and colleagues [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], it is additionally possible that in the current study a stronger persistence of PA reflected the ability to use PA to create new PA in the near future. All in all, the above differences in results and methodology highlight the importance of within-study replication with constant methodology.</p></sec><sec id="s6.2"><title>Savoring positive affect as compensatory mechanism</title><p>The current study showed that increased transfer of PA over time predicted better follow-up response to treatment in patients. Particularly surprising was the fact that persistence of PA over time was not only higher in responding versus non-responding depressed patients, but also in responding depressed patients versus healthy controls. Notably, increased levels of PA persistence in depressed patient responders &#x02013;compared to controls- were found in both patient samples. Better-than-normal ability to hold on to PA may be required for depressed patients in order to recover. The differences in depressed patients compared to healthy individuals are often viewed upon as reflecting risk. However, the current findings suggest that these specific alterations indicate a better than average ability to savor PA. This extraordinary quality, or resilience trait, may reflect a compensatory mechanism in that increased ability to hold on to PA is required to counteract the increased presence of NA in these individuals. A speculation is that only in case of strong compensatory mechanisms, which can restore emotional balance, patients will be able to recover.</p><p>Although responders generally appeared to be better at savoring PA than non-responders, this effect was more pronounced in patients with a history of depressive episodes compared to patients who were depressed for the first time. This interesting finding raises the possibility that, due to the recurrence of their depression, a learning process may have taken place. Over time, patients with recurrent episodes may have acquired ways to savor their PA, thereby aiding the process of recovery [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, these mechanisms need to be examined in more depth before any firm conclusions can be drawn.</p><p>The replication of the finding of higher PA persistence in depressed patients who respond to treatment compared to healthy controls in two independent samples underscores our findings, and indicates that specific groups of depressed patients paradoxically may possess higher-than-average ability to preserve PA that can facilitate recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s6.3"><title>Medication and savoring positive affect</title><p>Patients who responded to imipramine treatment showed higher levels of PA persistence than responders who were treated with a placebo. There are different ways to interpret this finding. One potential interpretation is that antidepressant medication acted synergistically with baseline ability to savor PA in bringing about a reduction in depressive symptoms. This interpretation suggests that medication may give an extra boost to the favorable effect of baseline PA persistence on follow-up outcome. An alternative interpretation is that for those using imipramine a higher baseline PA persistence is required in order to become a responder than for those using a placebo. Although counterintuitive, there have been previous studies suggesting that some antidepressants are associated with &#x02018;emotional blunting&#x02019; [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], reduced reward experience [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and diminished processing of not only negative but also positive stimuli [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In other words, the antidepressant may not only diminish negative, but positive emotional experience as well. Also, recent studies have shown that PA is important in facilitating recovery from depression [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. With respect to the current findings this may suggest that patients who receive antidepressants may <italic>need</italic> to be better at savoring PA in order to counteract the PA-dampening effects of medication. This interpretation is speculative, since the above studies all employed SSRIs, whereas the patients in our study received a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). Further exploration of the long-term underlying psychological effects of antidepressants is needed in order to shed more light on the influence of medication on PA.</p></sec><sec id="s6.4"><title>Limitations</title><p>A limitation regarding study 1 is that the sample consisted of female participants only. Consequently, our findings may not generalize to men. A limitation regarding the patient samples (studies 2 and 3) is that follow-up depressive symptoms were not assessed at the exact same time point following baseline measurements. That is, in study 2, depressive symptoms were assessed eight weeks following the start of the treatment, whereas in study 3, they were assessed after six weeks. It should be noted as well that patients in study 2 were treated with a combination of pharmacotherapy and supportive psychotherapy, whereas in study 3 they received pharmacotherapy only. Also, whereas in study 2 pharmacotherapy consisted mainly of serotonergic antidepressants, in study 3 patients received TCAs. Despite these differences in methodology, similar results were reported regarding the effect of PA persistence on follow-up responder status in both studies. Finally, a general limitation is that there are some differences in the adjectives that were used to conceptualize PA and NA in the three studies. This was a consequence of the fact that we used existing ESM samples to test our hypothesis. Slightly different choices for one item or another were made by the researchers who conducted the original studies. However, most items were identical and for each study the items loaded on one factor of PA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present findings indicate that healthy individuals with greater PA persistence have a significantly smaller probability of developing increased levels of depressive symptoms, and that depressed patients are more likely to respond to their treatment if they have greater PA persistence at baseline. This is the first study that, consistently and in three different samples, indicates that PA persistence, as measured in the flow of daily life, predicts future course of depressive symptoms. </p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
