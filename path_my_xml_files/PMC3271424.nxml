Low back pain from mechanical origin is identified by the presence or absence of symptoms and signs with different postures or movements. Mechanical low back pain is commonly treated conservatively with physical therapy. Poor or delayed response to conservative treatment will indicate surgery. Surgery too, has its own poor outcomes. Hence proper management must ensue once the diagnosis of mechanical low back pain is made clinically[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>].</p><p>Lack of clear definition or diagnostic criteria posed a new category of non- specific low back pain which might be the subtype which is the greatest in the group of chronic low back pain patients. Thorough subjective and objective examination is thus indicated to accurately identify the sub population who would not show a general predictable response to therapy so that they could then be evaluated further for providing suitable management[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>].</p><p>Assessment of segmental motion is inherent in any spinal examination to localize the level of involvement and to precisely target that affected level with suitable manual techniques. Segmental motion analysis is done clinically using the central PA pressure where the examiner applies pressure vertically over the spinous processes of the vertebrae. Symptom reproduction which correlates to the subjective complaints is considered as an important comparable sign. The examiner then detects the passive accessory mobility and compares across levels to diagnose abnormal mobility at that level. The validity of central PA pressure increases when it is correlated to the subjective perception of pain intensity during the assessment than objective sensation of resistance to the accessory examination[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>].</p><p>Segmental vertebral motion analysis done using central postero-anterior pressure would show normal, decreased or excessive mobility depending on the structural involvement. This available joint play is then graded using the seven point grading scale termed the Joint Play Grading Scale initially introduced by Stanley Paris. The scale has seven categories (0, ankylosed; 1, considerable hypomobility; 2, mild hypomobility; 3, normal mobility; 4, mild hypermobility; 5, considerable hypermobility; and 6, unstable)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>].</p><p>The passive tissues supporting the spine resist the postero anterior forces applied by the operator with a property termed the postero anterior stiffness. Reduced stiffness may be indicative of segmental instability whereas increased stiffness may be suggestive of segmental hypomobility[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]. Whereas hypomobility or dysfunctions of the lumbar spine are often treated with manual vertebral mobilization, the effects of manual mobilization are however limited in segmental instability. Application of manual techniques to the involved level of segmental instability would necessarily potentiate complications and adverse therapeutic effects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>].</p><p>Assessment of pressure pain thresholds is a valid and reliable clinical tool to evaluate the subjective perception of pain in response to application of pressure. Pressure algometry is used in manual therapy to objectively quantify the pressure pain thresholds and it was shown that a predictable variation exists across various spinal levels from cervical to lumbar levels[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]. Objectivity of central postero anterior pressure assessment on lumbar spine would thus be improved if assessment is correlated with the spinal pressure pain thresholds.</p><p>Management of lumbar segmental instability would be based on clinical and radiological findings after characterizing it into clinical or mechanical instability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]. While mechanical instability (mostly resulting from macrotrauma) indicated surgery or lumbar supports as treatment, clinical instability (resulting from microtrauma) was managed with motor control retraining and re-education programs involving postural control retraining, segmental stabilization exercise using transversus abdominis and multifidus co-activation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>].</p><p>Treatment of lumbar segmental instability focuses mainly on active subsystem stabilizing the spine, namely the global muscles- the transversus abdominis and local muscles- the multifidus. Though core stabilization using transversus abdominis strengthening is an inherent part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program for lumbar segmental instability, local multifidus strengthening using pressure biofeedback units also has been shown to be effective[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>], but there was a paucity in the existing clinical scenario whether a program of segmental stabilization using multifidus strengthening would then be sufficient to improve stability in segmental instability subjects.</p><p>Hence the current study was aimed to study the immediate and short term effects of multifidus strengthening at the involved level in subjects with segmental instability of the lumbar spine as compared to a placebo intervention. It was hypothesized that spinal segmental stabilization exercise would be better than placebo intervention in mechanical low back pain patients identified to have segmental instability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional ethics committee of Kasturba Medical College, Manipal University, Mangalore.

Then the subject was asked to slowly lift one arm while maintaining the earlier neutral spinal position when the tester palpated for the activation of multifidus at the tested level just medial to the facet joints on both sides simultaneously. Tester gave instructions to avoid substitution by the long extensor muscles. The steps were then repeated with lifting other arm. Ten repetitions were given for each side.

Evaluation had shown that subjective and objective findings if they are correlated with clinical reasoning, could effectively be used in short term management of low back pain patients. Multifidus strengthening should be considered either as an adjunct or in combination with other exercises for the spinal segmental instability. The quadruped position would have challenged spinal proprioception to the maximum; hence the improvement in spinal stiffness could be attributed to the enhanced proprioception due to co-contraction with selective activation of the segmental muscles. Clinical improvement was observed in the placebo group, which may be attributed to the effects of prone lying position itself would have its own effects to induce relaxation of the muscles in spasm thus relieving the symptoms. Further randomized controlled trials are needed and studies should compare global versus local stabilization either individual or in combination.</p><p>Segmental stabilizing muscle especially multifidus was found in earlier studies that there is selective atrophy at the affected level and that recovery of multifidus is not spontaneous following the episode of symptoms of low back pain. This indicates that a routine exercise program would not have long term benefits without activation of multifidus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]. The earlier studies found that altered trunk muscle activation existed in low back pain subjects which when treated with motor control approaches, would thus enhance the lumbar posteroanterior stiffness in low back pain individuals[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>].</p><p>Thus a hypothetical association existed between reduced lumbar postero anterior stiffness (as that occurring in instability) detected by manual examination using central PA pressure and reduced pressure pain thresholds (less pressure leading to pain provocation). However this association was not demonstrated in the earlier findings on lumbar spine examination, be it in normals or in individuals with mechanical low back pain. There was no comparable data as to whether there is any difference in the pressure pain thresholds with any intervention in subjects with segmental instability.</p><p>The current study design ruled out the probability of effects of almost all the confounding variables which might alter the findings like age, sex, body weight, individual differences in occupation or lifestyle. The incorporation of cross over design is not available in the literature on management using segmental stabilization possibly because the interventions were given for least duration of three weeks. This study has its major limitation that there was no long term follow up to determine the reversibility. The treatment session was only one, the results would have been influenced by the shorter treatment duration. The results of this should be interpreted with caution, since the patients who fulfilled the Delphi criteria were the ones who responded to therapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Segmental stabilization exercise therapy was more effective than placebo intervention in symptomatic lumbar segmental instability amongst people with mechanical low back pain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The author wishes to thank the patients for their whole-hearted participation in the study.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pincus</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Vogel</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Breen</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Foster</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Underwood</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Persistent back pain- why do physical therapy clinicians continue treatment?
