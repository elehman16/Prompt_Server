Time constraints and stigma are common barriers to postpartum treatment. Web-based treatments offer potential flexibility and anonymity. <italic>What Am I Worried About</italic> (WaWa) is a self-guided treatment based on cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness principles for women experiencing postpartum anxiety. WaWa was developed in Australia and consists of 9 modules with optional weekly telephone support. WaWa was adapted to a Web-based version for use in England (Internet-based What Am I Worried About, iWaWa).</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>This study aimed to investigate the feasibility (engagement and usability) and acceptability (usefulness, satisfaction, and helpfulness) of iWaWa among English postpartum women with anxiety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Postpartum (&#x0003c;12 months) women with mild-to-severe anxiety were recruited anonymously via social media during an 8-week period. Participants were randomized to the iWaWa treatment (8 weeks) or wait-list control group. Treatment and study feasibility and acceptability were assessed after the treatment, and anxiety symptoms were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks postrandomization, and 12 weeks postrandomization (treatment group only) using Web-based questionnaires. Semistructured telephone interviews were carried out after the treatment period for a more in-depth exploration of treatment acceptability and feasibility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 89 eligible women were recruited through social media and randomized into the treatment (n=46) or wait-list control group (n=43). Women were predominantly Caucasian, well-educated, married, on maternity leave, first-time mothers and reported moderate levels of anxiety. Dropout rates were high, especially in the treatment group (treatment: 82%, 38/46; wait-list control: 51%, 22/43). A total of 26 women started iWaWa with only 2 women completing all 9 modules. Quantitative and qualitative data suggest iWaWa was experienced as generally useful and helpful. Participants enjoyed iWaWa&#x02019;s accessibility, anonymity, and weekly reminders, as well as the introduction to the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness. However, iWaWa was also experienced as not user-friendly enough, too long, and not smartphone-friendly. Parts of the content were experienced as not always relevant and appropriate. Participants felt that iWaWa could be improved by having it in a smartphone app format and by making the content more concise and inclusive of different parenting styles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite interest in iWaWa, the results suggest that both the study and iWaWa were not feasible in the current format. However, this first trial provides useful evidence about treatment format and content preferences that can inform iWaWa&#x02019;s future development, as well as research and development of Web-based postpartum anxiety treatments, in general, to optimize adherence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="trial-registration"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02434406; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02434406 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6xTq7Bwmd)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>postpartum period</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd><kwd>Internet</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><sec><title>Postpartum Anxiety</title><p>Anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and phobias in the first year after birth (postpartum) are common with prevalence rates ranging between 9.9% and 20% [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Anxieties in the postpartum period are often life-stage specific, for example, worries about baby&#x02019;s care and health and fear of criticism and inadequacy as a mother [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Postpartum anxiety disorders can either be a recurrence of a previous disorder or develop as a first episode. Symptom intensity and associated degree of impairment of these anxiety disorders can vary over the course of the postpartum period [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite available effective treatments [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], postpartum mental health problems often go undetected or untreated [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Low screening and diagnosis rates play a role, but some women with emotional difficulties postpartum are often more reluctant to disclose and seek help [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Possible reasons for this include being too busy to get around to seeking help and feeling too embarrassed or having no-one they felt comfortable talking to [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], as well as child care concerns [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The importance of having efficient and timely treatments is highlighted by the adverse effects of untreated mental health problems on the physical and psychological health of the mother, child, and family [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], as well as potential costs to society [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, it has been shown that maternal anxiety can affect infant bonding and feeding [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and may negatively affect the child&#x02019;s cognitive and social development [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Considering the importance of treatment and unique postpartum barriers to accessing treatment, providing convenient and anonymous treatment seems essential.</p></sec><sec><title>Web-Based Self-Help Treatments</title><p>One approach of offering anonymous and convenient treatment is Web-based self-help treatments, which run on computers, tablets, or smartphones and allow individuals to work through written therapy material without or with minimal therapist or mental health professionals&#x02019; assistance. Many of today&#x02019;s parents search for information and support on the Web [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, postpartum women who feel isolated or restricted by their baby&#x02019;s schedule experience Web-based resources as useful [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In a thematic analysis of motivators and barriers to a Web-based postpartum treatment, it was found that the offered flexibility and anonymity fitted women&#x02019;s postpartum circumstances [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This suggests that Web-based treatments may be an appropriate alternative or supplement to conventional face-to-face therapy for postpartum women.</p><p>Systematic reviews and one meta-analysis focusing on the perinatal period suggest that Web-based treatments can help improve postpartum depressive symptoms [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but so far none are specifically developed for postpartum anxiety [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A Web-based survey demonstrated that women with postpartum anxiety are interested in Web-based treatments [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and a qualitative study of postpartum health care professionals (health visitors) in the United Kingdom reported a need for more treatment options for postpartum anxiety and that Web-based treatments could be useful to address this issue [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The What Am I Worried About Treatment</title><p>On the basis of the identified interest and need, a self-help treatment for women experiencing moderate or severe symptoms of postpartum generalized anxiety disorder called <italic>What Am I Worried About</italic> (WaWa) developed in Australia [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] was transformed into a Web-based version called Internet-based WaWa (iWaWa). This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of iWaWa for women with postpartum anxiety problems in England. On the basis of the stage model of behavioral therapy research [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the primary study objectives were to determine study feasibility by examining recruitment and attrition, examine iWaWa&#x02019;s feasibility in terms of engagement and usability, and examine user&#x02019;s acceptability of iWaWa in terms of usefulness, helpfulness, and satisfaction. The secondary objective was to examine potential changes in anxiety over the course of the treatment and compare with a wait-list control group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study received ethical approval from the National Research Ethics Service, London&#x02014;Dulwich Research Ethics Committee (ref: 15/LO/1827).</p><sec><title>Sample and Recruitment</title><sec><title>Sample Size Calculation</title><p>Studies evaluating the feasibility of Web-based treatments for postpartum depression have recruited between 53 to 103 participants in total [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A power calculation indicated that 27 participants in each group would be required to achieve 95% power at a one-sided 5% significance level. In studies evaluating postpartum depression, Web-based treatments had attrition rates between 11.3% and 62.3%, with an average attrition of 34.2% [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. About 18 more participants needed to be recruited to allow for 34.2% attrition. It was therefore aimed for a minimum of 36 participants per group (treatment vs wait-list control) (total=72).</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants (n=89) were recruited over 8 weeks (March to May 2017) through Facebook, Twitter, and appropriate UK third-party parenthood websites, as well as through posters and flyers in two clinical settings in England (hospital and health visiting clinic). The development of the promotional material was informed by mothers participating in patient and public involvement meetings. Monetary compensation was only offered for taking part in the follow-up interviews.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility Criteria</title><p>Eligible participants had to have given birth in the last 12 months, be aged over 18 years, be living in England, be able to read and write English, have internet access, and have scored &#x02265;5 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Women were excluded if they were receiving formal psychological treatment at the start of the study, reported self-harm or suicidal ideation, or had a stillbirth or the baby was seriously ill.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>The Web-Based Treatment (iWaWa)</title><sec><title>Origin and Format</title><p>iWaWa is based on the WaWa self-help booklet for postpartum generalized anxiety disorder [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A licensing agreement with Monash University allowed researchers at the City, University of London to develop a Web-based version of WaWa for use in England in collaboration with the WaWa development team in Australia.</p><p>WaWa is based on cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness principles and consists of 3 sections: (1) Is this for me? (2) Practice, and (3) Understanding. In the first section, concepts such as generalized anxiety disorder, common worries during the perinatal period, and the cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness models are explained, and the program is outlined. The section on &#x0201c;Practice&#x0201d; consists of 7 worksheet modules that target life stage-specific anxieties and worries using guided activities. The last section provides background information about the biopsychosocial model of anxiety and a lay language description of CBT and mindfulness theories and practice. For more detailed information about the WaWa program, please refer to [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>iWaWa Format</title><p>iWaWa, the Web-based WaWa version, was developed on and hosted by the Qualtrics Platform and a City University of London blog. For the Web-based format, the three main sections were divided into 9 modules (one &#x0201c;Is this for me?&#x0201d; module; seven &#x0201c;Practice&#x0201d; modules; and one &#x0201c;Understanding&#x0201d; module). A link to each module could be found on a password-protected blog page of the iWaWa study website. See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref> for two images of iWaWa. Sessions were made up of multimedia presentations (text, images, and audio) and Web-based interactive material (eg, textboxes, self-assessment with sliders, hotspot graphics).</p><p>Participants were advised to start with the first module, but were free to access the remaining modules in any order and as many times as they wished. iWaWa users were also offered optional weekly email and or text-message reminders and weekly 30-min telephone support with each practice module. The iWaWa coach (MA) was a health psychology doctoral student with a master&#x02019;s in clinical psychology. An adapted version of the WaWa Health Professional&#x02019;s Guide was developed, which included checklists to record fidelity of program implementation and participant understanding and progress. No changes were made to iWaWa after the trial started.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study Design and Procedure</title><sec><title>Design</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the study design and procedures including data collection time-points and measures. A 2 (groups) by 3 (time-points) randomized controlled trial was carried out. Using a blocked randomization design (generated on the Web), the participants were randomly allocated to an iWaWa treatment group or a wait-list control group. Data were collected at baseline, throughout the treatment, 8 weeks postrandomization, and 12 weeks postrandomization utilizing both quantitative (Web-based questionnaires) and qualitative methods (optional iWaWa module comments and semistructured interviews).</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>The study website contained a link to the Web-based questionnaire consisting of the electronic informed consent procedure, the eligibility questions, and the baseline assessment. Women who were not eligible were provided with links to websites of organizations dealing with postpartum or general mental health problems and advised to contact their general practitioner or health visitor if concerned about their mental health.</p><p>Participants were quasi-anonymous. Treatment allocation was revealed to eligible participants via email, and participants created a personal identifier for the iWaWa modules and Web-based assessments. The personal identifier was also used to detect participants signing up multiple times. Treatment group participants were immediately emailed the link and password to the iWaWa program with telephone support, and wait-list control group participants were offered access to iWaWa without telephone support at 8 weeks postrandomization. Treatment group participants received one reminder email to start treatment, and all participants received one reminder email for the 8-week and 12-week follow-up assessments. Participants and the researcher (MA) responsible for the study management and analysis were not blinded.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Study Feasibility</title><p>For study feasibility, the following parameters were recorded: (1) recruitment rate and recruitment source, (2) eligibility and consent rates, (3) dropout attrition rates, and (4) completeness of data collection and assessment response rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment Feasibility</title><sec><title>Engagement</title><p>Module views (module opened) and completion (all pages of the module were viewed), engagement with interactive components, and the number and duration of iWaWa support calls were recorded.

At the 8-week postrandomization assessment, the System Usability Scale (SUS) [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] was used to determine treatment usability. The SUS is a 10-item instrument rated on 5-point Likert scale (0=strongly disagree to 4=strongly agree). The SUS has been found to be a highly robust and versatile tool [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and has previously been used in a study evaluating the feasibility of Web-based treatment for postpartum depression [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The SUS was adapted by replacing &#x0201c;the system product&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;iWaWa.&#x0201d; Scores were added together and multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores to 0-100. A score above a 68 is considered above average and below 68 is below average.

Regarding the study&#x02019;s feasibility, the minimum sample size required was exceeded within the relatively short recruitment period (8 weeks). Facebook proved most successful for recruitment. However, there was a high dropout attrition from the study and also a high treatment nonusage attrition. Among women who accessed iWaWa, the treatment was experienced as generally useful and helpful but not user-friendly enough in terms of treatment format and content. Participants felt that iWaWa could be improved by having it as a smartphone app and by making the content more concise and inclusive of different parenting styles. Anxiety levels decreased significantly for both groups from baseline to the 8-week follow-up assessment, but there were no differences between the treatment and wait-list control group. However, due to high drop-out and nonusage attrition, especially in the treatment group, the results for mental health cannot be interpreted reliably and will therefore not be further discussed. The results regarding recruitment and attrition, usability, and acceptability will be discussed in more detail below, including a comparison with previous literature and potential program improvements.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment and Attrition</title><p>Within a relatively short recruitment period, the iWaWa trial successfully recruited more than the minimum calculated sample size through Facebook. The response rate is comparable to similar studies. A study recruiting women with postpartum anxiety for a Web-based online survey through Facebook had a similar response rate (220 respondents over 4 months) [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Two studies recruiting women in the United Kingdom with postpartum depression through website advertisement banners for a Web-based treatment had similar (249 respondents over 5 months [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) and higher response rates (1403 respondents over two waves of 2-week recruitment periods [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). The successful recruitment might indicate that there is an interest and potential need for a treatment such as iWaWa among postpartum Facebook users. Due to the inability to recruit participants in health care settings, it remains to be investigated whether recommendation or endorsement from health care professionals might have increased iWaWa&#x02019;s recruitment rates.</p><p>Dropout attrition in the iWaWa trial was high (49% to 91%). In comparison, in the open pilot study evaluating WaWa, dropout attrition ranged from 39% to 61%. However, it has been pointed out that many trials testing Web-based interventions often suffer from high attrition rates [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Due to the lack of other trials of Web-based postpartum anxiety treatments, attrition can only be compared with trials of postpartum depression. Regarding postpartum Web-based treatments, one study evaluating the feasibility for depression with minimal support (Netmums program) also reported a high attrition rate (76%) [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The study found that, like this trial, there was an initial high access with a small user subgroup continuing to access and use the program. The authors discussed the role of curiosity, and it has also been suggested that one session may satisfy the user&#x02019;s need [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The Netmums program&#x02019;s attrition reduced to approximately 20% at the posttreatment assessment when telephone support was added [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similarly, the Web-based MomMoodBooster program for postpartum depression with telephone guidance also reported comparably very low attrition rates [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. When comparing iWaWa&#x02019;s attrition to postpartum depression trials, it has to be noted that a systematic review found higher Web-based intervention adherence rates for depression than anxiety [<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>There are a variety of factors that could have caused iWaWa&#x02019;s high attrition. Commonly identified reasons for dropout include the burden of the program, program information structure, content relevance, level of support, technical access issues, time constraints, lack of motivation, and improvement of the group [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The potential role of these factors regarding iWaWa&#x02019;s high attrition will be briefly discussed.</p><p>This study suggests that some women indeed experienced the access, length, and exercises of iWaWa as a burden. With the infant&#x02019;s demanding schedule, it is possible that iWaWa participants felt a lack of motivation or experienced time constraints. For Web-based postpartum depression treatments, adherence was high when scheduled support was offered [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Scheduled support was part of the original WaWa treatment and valued as strength of the treatment [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. On the basis of a survey which found that telephone support was not the preferred mean of support among women with postpartum anxiety [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], it was decided for iWaWa&#x02019;s telephone support to be optional. Scheduled support might improve adherence of women wanting this type of support, but it might also put off women who do not feel the need or find it unsuitable. Offering to opt in for scheduled support at the treatment start might be an alternative for future iWaWa versions. Regarding content relevance, a qualitative study suggested that being able to identify with a an online intervention program helps with adherence in Web-based psychological interventions [<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As some of iWaWa&#x02019;s topics were not experienced as relevant, it could therefore be that some participants logged into iWaWa but dropped out because they experienced the topics as irrelevant. Concerning symptom improvement, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that the prevalence of postpartum anxiety decreases from 1-4 weeks to 5-12 weeks [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and it could therefore be that the participant&#x02019;s symptoms improved and they no longer felt the need for iWaWa. In addition, almost half of the participants scored in the severe to extremely severe range of stress. It might be that participants were in need for stress management techniques, which could be incorporated in future iWaWa versions. The iWaWa program used an organic information structure design that allowed users to freely explore the modules. The use of a tunnel design, in which users navigate through content in a sequential order, has been identified as less likely to overwhelm users with options [<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and may increase use [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>iWaWa&#x02019;s Usability and Acceptability</title><p>Participants enjoyed iWaWa&#x02019;s accessibility, anonymity, and weekly reminders, as well as the introduction to the principles of CBT and mindfulness. This is in line with previous qualitative research regarding Web-based treatments for postpartum depression [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], as well as postpartum UK health care professionals (health visitors) [<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>iWaWa was rated and experienced as generally useful and helpful but not user-friendly enough. The iWaWa content was experienced as too long. A preference for brief modules was also identified by Web-basedsurveys among a sample of adults [<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and among women with postpartum anxiety [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Participants also felt that iWaWa&#x02019;s content was not inclusive of different parenting styles. WaWa&#x02019;s content was found to be acceptable in a small sample (n=7, in the posttreatment evaluation interview) pilot study in Australia [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It might therefore be important to investigate in more depth the needs of a larger and more diverse sample of women with postpartum anxiety so that iWaWa&#x02019;s content and format can be adapted to better meet their needs.</p><p>Women in this study also felt that not all topics were relevant. The need for Web-based treatments to be relevant to their own needs and circumstances was also discovered among women with postpartum depression [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Future iWaWa versions might benefit from presenting users with content most relevant to them (eg, anxiety topic needs and relevance assessment before the treatment starts).</p><p>Interactive components with space for responses were previously found to be valued among women with postpartum depression [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Even though most iWaWa users engaged with the exercises, many experienced them as difficult. The ease of usage of the interactive components seems important among iWaWa users, and therefore exercises of future iWaWa versions should be tested by potential users before implementation (eg, think-out aloud technique).</p><p>Regarding the format, iWaWa participants experienced the log-in process as difficult. The log-in process was also identified as difficult by women testing a Web-based postpartum depression treatment [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Participants also expressed that iWaWa was not smartphone-friendly, which was also reported by women testing a Web-based treatment for postpartum depression [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The preference for a smartphone-compatible treatment was also found in a survey among women with postpartum anxiety [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. iWaWa was smartphone compatible, but iWaWa as a smartphone app might improve the ease of access and presentation on smartphones.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The generalizability of the results of this study is compromised due the use of convenience sampling and a homogenous sample. Findings may therefore not be representative of women from different cultural or ethnic backgrounds, lower socioeconomic status, and more severe anxiety. In addition, most women were recruited through Facebook, so findings are limited to this self-selected pool of women. However, the homogeneous nature of this sample can also be a strength, as results can be generalized for this specific group. Furthermore, no incentives were offered during the enrollment, allowing for a sample with a genuine and intrinsic need. The generalizability may also be affected by the fact that the anxiety status was established by a screening instrument and not by a diagnostic tool. However, the GAD-7 is a frequently used anxiety screening tool and has been suggested as suitable for postpartum anxiety [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, diagnostic interviews are less anonymous and iWaWa&#x02019;s anonymity was highlighted as an important strength by the participants.</p><p>High dropout and nonusage attrition may have also biased the results. Therefore, findings regarding iWaWa&#x02019;s usability, acceptability, and mental health changes are limited to the experiences and views of a small sample. None of the women who did not start iWaWa took part in the follow-up interviews; so, no knowledge could be gained regarding what caused the early dropout.</p><p>The interviewer of this study was MA, who is a doctoral student investigating Web-based treatments for postpartum anxiety with personal experience related to this subject. These experiences may affect the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data. Therefore, several actions were taken to minimize the likelihood of this risk. Participants were aware that the interviewer was the main study lead, but reassured of the importance of any feedback (positive and negative) for improving iWaWa. The qualitative analysis also included comments from the iWaWa modules and the follow-up assessment in which women might have felt more comfortable providing negative feedback. MA kept a reflective journal to consider how the treatment and interviewee responses affected her own views on iWaWa throughout data collection, analysis, and reporting. An effort was made to consider this when analyzing the data. Interviewees were offered monetary compensation for their time, which might have confounded their responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated that there is an interest in a postpartum anxiety Web-based treatment like iWaWa. However, the iWaWa study and program in the current format is not yet feasible and acceptable, and due to high dropout rates, the results on the impact of iWaWa on anxiety cannot be interpreted reliably. Nonetheless, the study revealed strengths and weaknesses of the iWaWa content and format, as well as highlighted potential areas of improvements. As a first study investigating the usability and acceptability of Web-based treatment specifically targeted at postpartum anxiety, these results provide useful information about Web-based treatment preferences that can help improve iWaWa and inform research and development to optimize usability, acceptability, and Web-based treatment adherence in this population. This study also contributes to filling the gap in evidence-based self-help for mild-to-moderate postpartum anxiety symptoms.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the
