Most hamstring injuries occur in the late swing phase, when the hamstring undergoes a stretch-shortening cycle and the hamstring does a significant amount of eccentric work. The incidence of these injuries has not decreased despite there being effective injury prevention programmes focusing on improving eccentric hamstring strength. As this might be because of poor compliance, a more functional injury prevention exercise programme that focuses on the stretch-shortening cycle might facilitate compliance. In this study, a bounding exercise programme consisting of functional plyometric exercises is being evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT). Male amateur soccer teams (players aged 18&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years) have been randomly allocated to intervention and control groups. Both groups are continuing regular soccer training and the intervention group is additionally performing a 12-week bounding exercise programme (BEP), consisting of a gradual build up and maintenance programme for the entire soccer season. The primary outcome is hamstring injury incidence. Secondary outcome is compliance with the BEP during the soccer season and 3&#x000a0;months thereafter.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Despite effective hamstring injury prevention programmes, the incidence of these injuries remains high in soccer. As poor compliance with these programmes may be an issue, a new plyometric exercise programme may encourage long-term compliance and is expected to enhance sprinting and jumping performance besides preventing hamstring injuries.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">

Hamstring injuries also have the highest re-injury rate and are associated with the longest time off play and training (&#x0003e;28&#x000a0;days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

In the second half of the swing, the bi-articular hamstring muscles undergo a stretch-shortening cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The greatest stretch is seen in the femoral biceps, which is the hamstring muscle most often injured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The stretched hamstring muscle actively contracts in the swing phase, which could indicate that the hamstrings contract eccentrically in the late swing phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, it has been found that as the sprint speed increases, so too does the amount of stretch and negative work of the hamstring muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus it has been suggested that increasing eccentric strength might reduce the risk of sprint-type hamstring injury.</p><p id="Par12">Recent studies have shown that improving eccentric hamstring strength by means of the Nordic Hamstring Exercise (NHE) can reduce the incidence of hamstring injuries by 66&#x02013;70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Yet the incidence of hamstring injuries has not only not decreased in the past 10&#x000a0;years, but has actually increased by 4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This might be because these exercises are not performed correctly or because compliance is poor. A recent study among Champions league and Norwegian premier league teams confirmed this hypothesis: only 6% of the participating teams performed the NHE according the prescribed programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The same trend has been seen in Dutch soccer players [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], with most teams no longer performing the prevention programme 3&#x000a0;years after its introduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Arguments for non-compliance mentioned in the Netherlands are lack of time, delayed onset muscle soreness, the need to sit on the ground or a mat, and not sport- specific enough to incorporate into the warming-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The bounding exercise programme (BEP) is another potentially effective training programme that can be done after warming-up. It consists of single leg jump exercises characterized by a stretch-shortening cycle: eccentric pre-stretch phase, amortization phase, and concentric shortening phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This stretch-shortening cycle strengthens the elastic properties of connective tissue, thereby improving (eccentric and concentric) strength and power by allowing the muscle to accumulate (pre-stretch / eccentric phase) and release (concentric phase) energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Specific physiological adaptations induced by plyometric training are increased motor unit activation, increased passive tension of the muscle- tendon complex, and improvement of cross-bridge mechanics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These adaptations are associated with improved strength, increased joint stiffness, and improved neuromuscular control and functional performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Plyometric training is already used widely in intermittent team sports in order to enhance sprinting and jumping performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and might reduce sprint-type hamstring injuries.</p><p id="Par14">In summary, hamstring injuries are a major health problem in soccer and their incidence has increased over recent years, despite there being effective prevention programmes. This is possibly because of poor compliance. There is an urgent need for a functional, short, easy-to-implement, sport-specific hamstring injury prevention programme that includes eccentric and plyometric exercises, so as to improve the performance of sport-specific tasks, such as sprinting and jumping, and which is likely to be adopted. The BEP could fulfil this need. The aim of this hamstring injury prevention study-3 (HIPS-3) is to investigate the preventive effect of a BEP on hamstring injuries in male amateur soccer players. The secondary aim is to investigate compliance with this programme during the soccer season 2016&#x02013;2017 and at the start of the soccer season 2017&#x02013;2018.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and study setting</title><p id="Par15">This prospective, cluster-randomized trial was designed in accordance with the guidelines of the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations For Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

The hamstring injury incidence is recorded per 1000&#x000a0;h of exposure, and severity is operationalized as the number of days since the day of injury and the day of full return to play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Compliance is expressed as a percentage of BEP completion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par33">The sample size was calculated based on previous studies. Earlier findings showed a reduction in hamstring injury incidence of up to 70% with eccentric training of the hamstring muscle, an injury incidence of 1 in 11 players per soccer season, and recurrence rates of 12&#x02013;30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. On the basis of these findings and two-sided testing, significance level of 0.05, power 0.8, an inflation correction for cluster randomization of 1.19, drop-out of 20%, and loss to follow-up of 20%, we calculated that 26 teams of approximately 16 players would have to be included. Taking into account that the follow-up period is in a new soccer competition, with a larger loss to follow-up, we included 10% extra players, so that in total the study includes 30 teams with about 16 players/team (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;480).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par34">SPSS version 22 will be used to analyse the data. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse the baseline characteristics. The incidence of hamstring injuries will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcomes will be compared in the intervention and control groups using Chi square tests, Poisson general log-linear analysis, and Cox regression analysis with survival curves.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="Par35">This trial was approved by the Medical Ethics committee of University Medical Centre of Utrecht (16&#x02013;332\C) and is registered in the Dutch trial register (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/index.asp">http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/index.asp</ext-link>) (NTR6129). All participants received a written information letter, and any questions were answered (verbally or in writing) by one of the researchers (SvdH). All participants were asked for their informed consent, and all data are handled according to legal requirements.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par36">Hamstring injuries are a major problem in amateur soccer players. Recent studies have shown that a reduction in hamstring injury incidence up to 70% can be achieved by eccentric training following the NHE programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While NHE compliance was high in studies, the NHE programme has not been adopted in amateur soccer and the number of hamstring injuries has not diminished yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Arguments for non-compliance are lack of time, delayed onset muscle soreness, the need to sit on the ground or a mat, and not sport- specific enough to incorporate into the warming-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">The BEP, consisting of a gradual build-up to plyometric (bounding) exercises, is a more sport-specific injury prevention programme, so that compliance is expected to be better. It can be easily implemented during warming-and is expected to improve sprint and jumping performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">This study has the advantage of a standardized methodology and consensus regarding definitions of injuries and exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The self-reported registration via modern systems, such as SMS and NetQ, will probably ensure valid injury registration and optimal compliance.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BEP</term><def><p id="Par5">Bounding Exercise Programma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIPS-3</term><def><p id="Par6">Hamstring Injury Prevention Study-3</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KNVB</term><def><p id="Par7">Royal Netherlands Football Association</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHE</term><def><p id="Par8">Nordic Hamstring Exercise</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPIRIT</term><def><p id="Par9">Standard Protocol Items Recommendations For Interventional Trials</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><sec id="FPar2"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par40">The study was funded by ZonMW: The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par41">Not applicable.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contribution</title><p>SH, BH and FB designed the study in collaboration with NV and EG.
