We compared the efficacy and safety of thermotherapy and <sc>m</sc>eglumine antimoniate for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>An open randomized Phase III clinical trial was performed in five military health centres. located in northwestern, central and southern Colombia. Volunteers with parasitological positive diagnosis (Giemsa-stained smears) of cutaneous leishmaniasis were included. A single thermotherapy session involving the application of 50&#x000b0;C at the center and active edge of each lesion.

The efficacy of thermotherapy was 64% (86/134 patients) by protocol and 58% (86/149) by intention-to-treat. For the <sc>m</sc>eglumine antimoniate group, efficacy by protocol was 85% (103/121 patients) and 72% (103/143) by intention-to-treat, The efficacy between the treatments was statistically significant (p 0.01 and &#x0003c;0.001) for analysis by intention to treat and by protocol, respectively. There was no difference between the therapeutic response with either treatment regardless of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> species responsible for infection.

It is transmitted by female insects from the <italic>Lutzomyia</italic> genus in America and Phlebotomus in the Old World, affecting humans and domestic and wild mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is endemic in more than 98 countries. There are 2 million new cases per year, of which 1.5 million present in the cutaneous form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In Colombia, there has been a reappearance of leishmaniasis. During the years of 2005&#x02013;2008, 61,120 new cases were diagnosed. Among these cases, 34,262 (56.1%) occurred in National Army soldiers Statistical data (Direcci&#x000f3;n de Sanidad del Ej&#x000e9;rcito (DISAN)).</p><p>Since the 1940s, the pentavalent antimonials (Sb<sup>5</sup>) (<sc>m</sc>eglumine antimoniate and sodium stibogluconate) have been considered first line medications for the treatment of leishmaniasis. In Colombia, health authorities recommend a 20&#x02009;mg Sb<sup>5</sup>/kg/day dose for 20&#x02009;days to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis and 28&#x02009;days of therapy to treat mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>However, the pentavalent antimonials are expensive (approximately $200 per patient), cardiotoxic (P wave prolongation, inverted T waves, ST elevation and QT prolongation), hepatotoxic (liver enzymes elevation), nephrotoxic (BUN and creatinine elevation) and can also cause pancreatitis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, arthralgia and myalgia.</p><p>These complications, in combination with the parenteral route and the duration of treatment, cause adherence problems. Antimonials are contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation, in very young children, in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug and in patients suffering from chronic conditions. Some reports have shown a decrease in the sensitivity of Leishmania parasites to antimonials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the Old World leishmaniasis caused by <italic>L.&#x02009;(L) tropica,</italic> the parasite resistance is the main problem for the use of antimony [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, all of the factors mentioned above reinforce the need for alternative therapies.</p><p>Several oral medications have been tested for the treatment of CL, such as dapsone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], ketoconazol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], mefloquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], allopurinol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], miltefosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], none of which are completely effective. Comparisons of the efficacy of different drugs are complicated by the different protocols used in each study. According to a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials for CL, this lack of standardization of methodologies makes it impossible to obtain conclusive information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Some studies have shown that it is possible to induce healing of lesions by treatment with local heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Ethnomedical studies have shown that, in rural communities of South America and Africa, the empiric application of caustic materials (powder, hot brown sugar, silver nitrate, oil, battery) or the cauterization of the lesions with hot metal objects (spoons, knifes) is very common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Currently, we employ the local application of an instrument, maintained at 50&#x000b0;C, called Thermomed&#x000ae;. This equipment was used in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the benefits of local treatment, the cost of thermotherapy is significantly lower than the pentavalent antimony. The antimony cost is approximately USD 37.2, which must be added on to the patients disability, medical test before, during and after treatment, and in cases where it is needed, the electrocardiogram. According to calculations by dermatologist of the study, the total cost of local heat therapy, does not exceed USD 20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Thermotherspy compared with Meglumine antimoniate for the treatment of Cutaneous Leishmnaniosis in Colombia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted an open randomized, phase III clinical trial to compare the differences in efficacy and safety between thermotherapy and <sc>m</sc>eglumine antimoniate.</p></sec><sec><title>Population and site of the study</title><p>The study was conducted between June 2006 and April 2008.

Phoenix-USA). Following the aseptic preparation of the lesions and local anesthesia with 2% xylocaine, we applied a single session of thermotherapy to the center, active borders and peripheral area of the lesions. Each thermal application was at 50&#x000b0;C and lasted for 30 seconds; the number of applications depended on the size of the lesion. After the thermotherapy session and over the next 10&#x02009;days, an antibiotic ointment (fusidic acid) was applied over the lesions, which were then covered with sterile gauze to prevent secondary infections. Meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime&#x000ae;, Aventis, Paris, France) was administered intramuscularly under medical supervision at a dose of 20&#x02009;mg Sb<sup>5</sup>/kg/day for 20&#x02009;days. All patients of both groups remained within the military unit for the duration of the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection and samples</title><p>After providing writing informed consent, all patients were given a medical chart with pertinent demographic information, lesion data and a review of inclusion/exclusion criteria. We subsequently photographed each lesion. Histologic samples were taken from all patients to confirm the diagnosis and to identify the type of Leishmania using PCR-RFLP, according to published guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Clinical samples were taken from all subjects for the parasitological confirmation of leishmaniasis by direct microscopic examination, lesion aspirate samples were taken from each of the patients and were processed as explained in other publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In brief, the aspirates were cultured in NNN culture medium, incubated at 26&#x000b0;C, and from the fourth day on they were observed weekly for one month, in the inverted microscope in search of promastigotes. The media cultures were labeled with the code of each participant and were stored on independent racks to avoid mixing. Each week positive cultures were mass cultured in 50&#x02009;ml glass bottles with NNN modified medium, one part was frozen in liquid nitrogen and is now stored in the PECET Criobank, and the other was used for species identification; for the DNA extraction, Promastigotes cultures were centrifuged and washed three times for 5&#x02009;min at 1000&#x02009;g in PBS pH 7.6. Parasites were then re-suspended in 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of lysis buffer (10&#x02009;mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8,5&#x02009;mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 200&#x02009;mM NaCl, 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml proteinase K) for 90&#x02009;min at 65&#x000b0;C with moderate agitation. DNA was precipitated by adding two volumes of absolute ethanol to the lysate and the solution was mixed by inversion, and centrifuged for 15&#x02009;min at 10,000&#x02009;g. To recover the DNA, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was dried for 15&#x02009;min at 65&#x000b0;C and then re-suspended in 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of water or TE.

Frequency and severity of side effects were greater in the <sc>m</sc>eglumine antimoniate group. These side effects occurred during and after treatment. These side effects included fever, myalgia, arthralgia and headache. In the group treated with thermotherapy, we found an association with local pain, especially four days after initiating treatment (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>In all laboratory analysis conducted during and at the end of treatment with <sc>m</sc>eglumine antimoniate, there were alterations in renal, hepatic, pancreatic and hematologic tests.

The sample size was adequate for the study. The follow-up rate was 88% at six months after treatment, which was higher than estimated when calculating the sample size.</p><p>In the <sc>m</sc>eglumine antimoniate group, treatment efficacy by protocol and intention-to-treat were 85 and 72%, respectively. These results demonstrate a decrease in the rate of efficacy for this age group, which was reported as 93% during the 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This decrease in the efficacy of antimonials could be related, among other factors, to the administration of incomplete doses as a consequence of adherence problems, unavailability of a complete dose to all patients, black market of medications in rural areas and evidence that men also play a role in the transmission of American cutaneous leishmaniasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of treatment efficacy with leishmania species.</p><p>Thermotherapy had an efficacy of 64 and 58% per protocol and intention-to-treat, respectively; these results are comparable to the findings reported by a study in Kabul, Afghanistan, (CL due to <italic>L.&#x02009;(L) tropica</italic>) in which the efficacy per protocol was 69% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In other study made with patients from other Asian countries (Ir&#x000e1;n and Kuwait), following the same conditions of application of local heat and where the isolated specie was <italic>L.&#x02009;(L) major</italic>, the intent efficacy of thermotherapy to treat was 48%, two months after treatment ends[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>With regard to efficiency, we found that <sc>m</sc>eglumine antimoniate is statistically superior to thermotherapy for the treatment of CL in Colombia (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), but we also found that <sc>m</sc>eglumine antimoniate has been associated with severe side effects in the musculoskeletal system (myalgia and arthralgia), fever, headaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and toxicity in organs such as the kidney, the pancreas and the hematologic and cardiovascular systems. These effects are not associated with thermotherapy, which only causes local pain four days after the initiation of treatment.</p><p>Systemic treatment with pentavalent antimonials for cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by <italic>L.&#x02009;(V) panamensis</italic> and <italic>L.&#x02009;(V) braziliensis</italic> was recommended by the WHO in 1990 under the assumption that such treatment prevents the development of mucosal lesions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, subsequent studies conducted in Peru demonstrated that mucosal lesions may appear despite the use of these therapeutic schemes. In the case of Colombia, where the predominant parasite species are <italic>L.&#x02009;(V) braziliensis</italic> and <italic>L.&#x02009;(V) panamensis,</italic> the need for all patients to receive systemic treatment of 20&#x02009;mg Sb<sup>5</sup>/kg/day for 20&#x02009;days is even more controversial, especially because the incidence of mucosal leishmaniasis is less than 0.5% although it is estimated that, in rural areas far from health centers, only 10% of the population with CL receives complete treatment with antimonials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Unpublished data (Direcci&#x000f3;n de Sanidad del Ej&#x000e9;rcito (DISAN) and Programa de Estudio y Control de Enfermedades Tropicales (PECET)) documented 12 fatalities related to the use of this therapy, which is unacceptable for a form of the disease that is not fatal.</p><p>Thermotherapy has been evaluated in several American and Old World countries with efficacy rates of more than 70%. In Colombia, only one report of thermotherapy used to treat CL was made in an epidemic area of <italic>L.&#x02009;(V) guyanensis</italic>. In this region, thermotherapy had an efficacy of 100 and 19% by protocol and intention-to-treat, respectively, although the lack of follow-up in many patients (81%) decreased the efficacy of the study and limited the interpretation of results[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>The facts mentioned previously led us to ponder the convenience of using local treatments (thermotherapy, paromomicine, cryotherapy, intra-lesion pentavalent antimony) in combination with patient education on how to detect early signs and symptoms of mucosal complications so they can be promptly reported to the physician and addressed with systemic treatment.</p><p>The results of the present study show that thermotherapy could be considered a valid alternative treatment due to its efficacy (&#x0003e;60%) and safety as well as because it requires a single session and does not require laboratory monitoring.</p><p>Although the equipment required for thermotherapy (ThermoMed) is very expensive and difficult to access in endemic countries due to its cost, the expenses related to conventional treatment overweigh the costs of Thermomed.</p><p>With the goal of increasing its efficacy, we propose a subsequent clinical trial to evaluate new schemes of application of local treatment with thermotherapy; for example, patients may undergo 2&#x02013;3 sessions or a combination of local treatments with a low systemic dose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although the efficacy rate of <sc>m</sc>eglumine antimoniate was greater than that of thermotherapy for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis, the side effects were also greater. Those factors, added to the increased costs, the treatment adherence problems and the progressive lack of therapeutic response, make us consider thermotherapy as a first line treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis.</p><p>The thermotherapy is also a valid alternative in patients with renal, hepatic and cardiac illness who cannot receive systemic therapy. It is important to mention that thermotherapy should not be applied near mucosal areas.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The protocol was approved by the Bioethics Committee for Human Research of &#x0201c;Sede de Investigacion Universitaria&#x0201d; (CBEIH-SIU) from the University of Antioquia and by the Ethics Committee of the General Health Management of the Colombian Army and and carried out according to international norms of good clinical practice</p></sec><sec><title>Consent informed</title><p>Before deciding to participate in the research, All patients signed a informed consent form in the presence of two witnesses.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CL, Cutaneous leishmaniasis; ML, Mucosal leishmaniasis; VL, Visceral leishmaniasis; CTCAE, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; CI, Confidence Interval; PECET, Programa de Estudio y Control de Enfermedades Tropicales; DISAN, Direcci&#x000f3;n de Sanidad del Ej&#x000e9;rcito.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interest</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LL coordinated and conducted the field work, participated in the design and reporting of the study; MR and MV carried out field work (inclusion and follow-up of volunteers); IV participated in the design, execution and reporting of the study.
