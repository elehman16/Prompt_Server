Scan takes about 10-30 min according to the diagnostic MRI study needed and it is quite noisy and the patient is moved into a narrow pipe with limited access. For optimum image quality and to ensure precise diagnosis, patients have to remain motionless. Goals of sedation in the pediatric groups of patients for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be defined as: Guard the patient's safety and welfare; decrease physical discomfort and pain; reduce anxiety, minimize psychological trauma and maximize the potential for amnesia; control behavior and/or movement to permit the safe completion of the procedure; and return the patient to a state that permit safe discharge from medical supervision, as determined by recognized criteria.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Fear of physicians, injections, operation and the operation theatre in children is much more than in adults. Separation from the parents to a totally unknown world with unknown faces makes the operative experience more traumatic for young children.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>An a traumatic sedation can minimize the previously mentioned problems. Intranasal (IN) drug delivery is relatively easy and convenient, it also reduces first pass metabolism and has been used successfully for fentanyl, ketamine, and midazolam premedication.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine (Precedex, Hospira) is a highly selective &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonist approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2008 for sedation of adults in areas outside the intensive care unit (Package Insert, Hospira, 2008) with a shorter half-life. Although dexmedetomidine is not labeled for pediatric use, its application for pediatric sedation has been described.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Ketamine may be administered through intravenous, intramuscular, oral, rectal, nasal, epidural, or intrathecal routes. The use of ketamine to induce sedation and analgesia in pediatric patients has been described in various non-operating room settings, including emergency department, oncologic, dental, radiation therapy and radiology suite settings.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this investigation is to compare the efficacy of two sedation regimens in children who required sedation for an MRI procedure.

Vilo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] evidenced that younger children require larger bolus doses of dexmedetomidine to achieve satisfactory sedation due to pharmacokinetic factors.</p><p>The target patient population was chosen upon findings of Yuen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] who randomized 116 children between 1 and 8 years of age to receive an IN dexmedetomidine dose of either 1 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> or 2 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> as a pre-induction sedative. Satisfactory sedation at the time of induction was observed in 53% of the children in the lower dose group versus 66% in the higher dose group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.049). The difference between the two doses was more obvious in the children between 5 and 8 years of age, where the 2 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> dose resulted in significantly more patients achieving satisfactory sedation, than in the 1-4 year olds who responded the same to both doses. Our results nearly matched with this results in regard to percentage of adequate moderate sedation (B score = 69%) at 30 min [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>].</p><p>Yuen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in a randomized, crossover evaluation of healthy adult volunteers, demonstrated that intransal 1 and 1.5 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> dexmedetomidine produces sedation in 45-60 min and peaks in 90-105 min. In addition, they observed only a modest reduction of HR and arterial blood pressure (BP). In a follow-up study these authors found the onset of action of IN dexmedetomidine to be 25 min and duration of action to be 85 min.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Many authors[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] investigated the pharmacokinetics of IN ketamine. They documented that nasal ketamine peaks and sedation begins at 15-20 min. Furthermore[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] they found that 9 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of nasal ketamine resulted in plasma levels comparable to the IV induction dose used to provide deep anesthesia.</p><p>Three other studies[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] tested various doses of intranasal ketamine ranging from 3-9 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. They revealed statistically significant differences in levels of sedation between small and larger doses. Children who received a 9 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> dose, were considered to have adequate sedation in contrast to those received 1-3 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> had unsatisfactory sedation.</p><p>Intranasal ketamine at 6 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> dose was evaluated by Pandey <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for sedation in uncooperative children undergoing dental procedures and documented that this dose resulted in a goal of adequate sedation in 91% and successful procedural efficacy in 85% of cases. These results come in agreement with our results that revealed mean sedation onset of 22.4 &#x000b1; 5.6 min and 14.65 &#x000b1; 4.9 min after intranasal dexmedetomidine and ketamine respectively.</p><p>Furthermore, these results explained why the percentage of sedation failure was higher in Group K and in turn need for rescue propofol.</p><p>Gyanesh <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] compared intranasal dexmedetomidine (1 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and ketamine (5 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) for procedural sedation in children undergoing an MRI. There were no significant differences in the children's response to administration of the drug and IV cannulation between dexmedetomidine and ketamine. There were no significant differences in adverse effects among the groups and no serious events. These results agreed with our findings revealing that intranasal administration of dexmeditomidine (3 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) or ketamine (7 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) to be very effective in providing adequate conditions for the placement of the IV cannula. Most of the children accepted the IN instillation of the drugs with minimum discomfort. Both groups showed insignificant differences regarding sedation scale at 30 min point, parents&#x02019; separation and acceptance of IV cannulation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>There was a significant difference in HR and SBP between the two groups starting from the point of 20 min. In Group D, the HR and SBP were significantly decreased at 30 min value when compared with basal readings (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). These findings required no treatment and we attributed it to relatively large dose of dexmedetomidine.</p><p>One limitation of this study was that we did not measure parents&#x02019; and radiologist satisfaction. Another limitation may lie with the method of IN drug delivery. We instilled the study medications with the use of tuberculin syringes. Sprayed or atomized IN medication delivery is a recent technique. Use of these methods of drug delivery may lead to more bioavailability and higher satisfaction with the use of IN medications in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>IN administration is pain free and more acceptable to children. IN dexmedetomidine 3 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> or ketamine 7 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> can be used safely and effectively to induce a state of moderate conscious sedation and to facilitate parents&#x02019; separation and IV cannulation. Addition of midazolam in a dose not sufficient alone to produce the target sedation achieved our goal of deep level of sedation suitable for MRI procedure.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
