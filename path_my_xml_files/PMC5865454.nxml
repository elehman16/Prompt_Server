For patients with true hypovolemic hyponatremia, this will usually involve administration of isotonic intravenous fluid to correct hypovolemia, with restriction of free water intake and frequent observation of the trend in the [Na]s correction. Measurement of the hourly urine volume and the tonicity of urine allows identification of an excessive aquaresis that may occur when the hypovolemia-mediated pituitary hormone 8-arginine vasopressin (ADH) response has been abolished. It is often an unanticipated aquaresis, rather than the volume of isotonic fluid infused, that will result in erroneous predictions of the rate of rise of [Na]s, leading to overcorrection.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2054358118761051" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), a synthetic analogue of the ADH, can control aquaresis through its action on the V2-receptors in the renal collecting system.

To obtain a homogenous cohort in terms of hyponatremia etiology, we selected cases of severe, hypovolemic hyponatremia. Inclusion criteria were [Na]s &#x0003c;125 mmol/L at referral, serum osmolality &#x0003c;275 mOsm/kg, urine sodium &#x0003c;30 mmol/L, and urine osmolality &#x0003e;100 mOsm/kg.

The administration of intravenous DDAVP and the indication for DDAVP were recorded, including the number of doses and cumulative dose. The use of hypertonic 3% saline infusion was recorded.

DDAVP was effective in controlling the [Na]s correction in patients with severe hypovolemic hyponatremia. Patients who received DDAVP had a significantly more rapid trajectory of [Na]s correction on the first day after diagnosis, which was the likely reason for DDAVP administration. The [Na]s correction on the second day was effectively slowed, achieving a similar overall magnitude of correction as the comparison group. All patients who had experienced an overcorrection on the first day after diagnosis were successfully treated with DDAVP, which significantly lowered the rate of [Na]s correction so that no patient had an overcorrection at 48 hours. There was a trend toward a longer length of hospital stay for the group who received DDAVP, which can likely be attributed to increased medical complexity in those patients consistent with their lower baseline [Na]s and higher proportion of ICU admissions, diabetes, and AKI. Within the DDAVP-exposed patients, those treated in a prophylactic manner tended to have a shorter length of hospital stay than those treated in a reactive manner.</p><p>Few previous studies have focused on DDAVP use in hyponatremia treatment. Perianayagam et al described the effective use of DDAVP in reversal of established [Na]s overcorrection or to prevent an anticipated [Na]s overcorrection in 20 patients who received DDAVP over a 6-year period in one center, with all but one patient being able to avoid an overcorrection at 48 hours.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2054358118761051" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Rafat et al successfully corrected an excessive initial [Na]s correction rate in 20 ICU-admitted patients by using intravenous DDAVP, with a lowering of [Na]s in 11 patients, and reduced [Na]s variability.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2054358118761051" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Although informative, these studies are small and uncontrolled, and cannot draw conclusions on how DDAVP compares with standard management. Our results demonstrate that DDAVP use appeared to have been appropriately directed to those at risk of overcorrection, or those who had already overcorrected, and the overall results achieved within 48 hours were then similar to the comparison group.</p><p>Sood et al have described a novel approach to severe hyponatremia management, using a regimen of regular intravenous DDAVP administration every 6 to 8 hours, while infusing hypertonic saline based on the patient&#x02019;s weight.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2054358118761051" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The case series of 25 patients demonstrated reliable and consistent [Na]s correction over 48 hours, without any overcorrections or episodes of lowering of [Na]s. Unfortunately, there was no comparison group to demonstrate whether this approach was superior to more standard practice. The rationale was to preempt the abolition of the intrinsic ADH stimulus that occurs during successful treatment, so that the exogenous DDAVP will then counteract any unpredictable aquaresis that could lead to an overcorrection in [Na]s. Although the results appear impressive, this approach could be viewed as nonphysiological, first administering DDAVP to patients already in a high ADH state at presentation, and second, ignoring one of the fundamental principle in treatment of hypo-osmolar hyponatremia that the patient must achieve a net negative in electrolyte-poor water to achieve a lasting [Na]s correction. Also, prolonged DDAVP administration could compound or worsen hyponatremia if there is not simultaneous close monitoring and restriction of free water intake.</p><p>The optimal strategy for DDAVP use to prevent rapid sodium correction in severe hyponatremia remains unknown.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2054358118761051" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Our data, acknowledging the limitations of the small sample size, did not suggest any significant baseline differences in those who received either a prophylactic or a reactive approach, and it is probable that the decision was at the discretion of the treating physician. There was a nonsignificant trend toward a lower [Na]s48 correction in the prophylactic group compared with the reactive group. Interestingly, whether patients received a single DDAVP dose or multiple doses did not affect the [Na]s48, nor did the cumulative dose of DDAVP given. One possible explanation is that additional DDAVP was being administered at times when there was no excessive aquaresis. These additional doses may have been a precautionary measure to prevent the emergence of aquaresis, for example, overnight when on-call physicians may not have been familiar with DDAVP administration or if the clinical environment precluded reliable hourly urine output monitoring (eg, a patient in the emergency department), making real-time dosing of DDAVP impractical. It could also suggest that a single dose of DDAVP is all that is required in this setting.</p><p>Strengths of the current study include that presence of a contemporaneous comparison group who did not receive DDAVP and the homogenous etiology of hyponatremia in both groups. The study is limited primarily by its sample size and study design. First, patients were not randomized to receive DDAVP or not, in addition to there not being a standardized care plan for the approach to monitoring and treating cases of hypovolemic hyponatremia (which is not unique to this center). Second, owing to treatment bias in the prescription of DDAVP, there were clinically significant differences in the patient group who received DDAVP, such as a higher proportion of ICU admissions, a higher rate of AKI, and more patients with diabetes. In relation to ICU admission, it should be borne in mind that many patients with severe hyponatremia are often admitted to ICU as a precautionary step to allow close observation, and not because they are requiring hemodynamic or ventilatory support. Hence, an ICU admission in this case is not necessarily the usual surrogate for extreme acute illness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section34-2054358118761051"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of DDAVP in the management of severe, hypovolemic hyponatremia appears to be safe and effective when compared with similar patients who do not receive DDAVP, with no evidence of a delay in [Na]s correction, prolonged hospital length of stay, or reduced survival to hospital discharge. DDAVP appears to have a useful role in managing hyponatremia where the rate of correction is more rapid than desired, or in those who have already overcorrected. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to investigate the role of DDAVP in the management of severe, hypovolemic hyponatremia.
