Despite the established benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], many type 2 diabetes patients do not participate in regular physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This highlights the need to develop efficacious physical activity interventions for this particular patient group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>We developed a behavioral modification program to increase physical activity in type 2 diabetes patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Since effective behavioral modification programs are necessarily based on established correlates, it is needed to take theoretical models into account when developing an intervention. This intervention was based on constructs from the social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the transtheoretical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and the self-determination theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Constructs derived from these theories have been widely accepted to understand and promote physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], both in general populations and type 2 diabetes patients. Based on the consistent associations with physical activity, the following theory-based constructs were targeted in the intervention: modeling, social norm, social support, self-efficacy, benefits, barriers, coping with relapse, processes of change and motivation. The intervention itself consisted of an individual face-to-face session by a psychologist, the use of a pedometer and a 24-week schedule of follow-up telephone support (by the psychologist), including topics on social support, self-efficacy, benefits, barriers, decisional balance, goal-setting, problem-solving strategies, time management, coping with relapse and motivation. The intervention aimed at gradual increases in physical activity, starting from the participants' baseline levels. The protocol and content of the intervention have been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This behavioral modification program showed positive effects on steps/day, accelerometer-based and self-reported physical activity over the short-term and intermediate term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Most studies, including our own, reported the behavioral impact of physical activity interventions, but few studies have reported changes in theoretical constructs preceding behavioral changes or examined possible mediators, resulting in a lack of information concerning how the intervention worked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Results from earlier studies in a general population are mixed but the most common mediators of intervention effects on physical activity seem to be behavioral processes (substituting alternatives, enlisting social support, rewarding yourself, committing yourself and reminding yourself) and self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For decisional balance and social support, mixed results were found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Mediators of intervention effects in type 2 diabetes patients have been rarely studied. Barrera and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] investigated social support (from family, friends and neighborhood) as a short- and long-term mediator and only found a short-term effect. Dutton and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] found that self-efficacy completely mediated physical activity among type 2 diabetes patients after a brief one-month intervention period.</p><p>To better understand which variables mediate physical activity improvements in a type 2 diabetes population, additional research utilizing prospective and controlled trials is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Mediators should be examined at multiple time points, including both short-term and long-term time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and objective measures of physical activity should be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>We examined whether the effects of a physical activity program were mediated by the theoretical constructs targeted by the intervention, both post-intervention (after 24 weeks) and at one year. It was hypothesized that self-efficacy and social support (derived from social cognitive theory) would be changed by the intervention and that these changes would mediate the changes in self-reported and objective physical activity, as has been previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. As the intervention was also based on the self-determination theory and the transtheoretical model, the other theoretical constructs targeted (e.g. motivation, coping with relapse, modeling) were also examined as potential mediators of change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants and procedure</title><p>The study protocol is described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A sampling pool of potential participants was generated from the Endocrinology Department of the Ghent University Hospital in Belgium. The inclusion criteria were: 1) &#x02265; six months post-diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; 2) age: 35-75 years; 3) body mass index (BMI): 25-35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 4) treated for type 2 diabetes; 5) no documented physical or medical physical activity limitations 6) Dutch speaking; 7) having a telephone number, and 8) having a follow-up appointment with their endocrinologist during the recruiting period from July till December 2007. Based on these criteria, a total population of 143 individuals were identified as eligible to participate and invited by mail to participate in the study. Thirty-two showed no interest, two s passed away prior to the study and 17 could not participate because of medical reasons. The remaining 92 agreed to participate in the study and were called to be enrolled. They were subsequently randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 60) or a control group (n = 32) using an imbalanced randomization 2:1. Every participant signed an informed consent form. The non-stratified randomisation was performed using sealed envelopes so the group allocation was concealed until the point of allocation. Blinding to group allocation could not be maintained post-recruitment, as with most behavioral interventions. The psychologist did the blinded group allocation, as well as the measurements, the intervention and the statistical analyses.</p><p>Three one-week assessments were spread over one year: at baseline, immediately after the 24-weeks intervention (post-intervention) and one year after baseline. The measurement one year after baseline was called 'intermediate-term' as it was not considered sustainable enough to speak about long-term changes. For the assessments, all participants were visited at home. During this visit, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was completed by interview. During the week following the home visit, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire on psychosocial correlates of physical activity, to wear an accelerometer and a pedometer, and to record their pedometer steps/day in a logbook. The Ethical Committee of the Ghent University Hospital approved the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Sociodemographics</title><p>The basic information on age, weight, height, diabetes duration of the sample was retrieved from the patient files, and from a sociodemographic questionnaire that was filled out by the participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective and self-reported physical activity measurements</title><p>Physical activity was measured using a pedometer (steps/day), an accelerometer (min/day) and the IPAQ (min/day). The pedometer (Yamax DigiWalker SW200, Tokyo, Japan) and the accelerometer (Actigraph, model 7164) were worn at the waist during waking hours for seven consecutive days. Both the pedometer and accelerometer are valid and reliable tools used to objectively measure physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. An activity log was used to record the steps taken, and the type and duration of non-walking activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. For every minute of non-walking activities (cycling or swimming) reported, 150 steps were imputed at the end-day number of steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The outcome variables of the accelerometer were time spent at activities of different intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. For the present analyses, accelerometer-based total physical activity (= light-intensity physical activity + moderate-intensity physical activity + vigorous-intensity physical activity) was used as outcome variable. The long IPAQ Dutch interview version was used to assess self-reported physical activity. The interview version was chosen as our previous experiences showed that the self-report version lead to many unanswered items in the questionnaires and massive over-reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The interview version was administrated 3 times in every participant in the same standardized way, by the same researcher, but with special attention to specific explanations for seniors and with special attention to decrease overreporting following a standardized protocol. Validity and reliability of the interview version of the long IPAQ have been shown to be acceptable in a 12-country study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the questionnaire, frequency (number of days) and duration (hours and min/day) of physical activity in different domains (work, transportation, leisure time, housekeeping and gardening) were queried. Minutes/week of physical activity in the different domains was calculated by multiplying frequency by duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Psychosocial correlates</title><p>As the intervention was based on theoretical constructs from the social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], transtheoretical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and self-determination theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], all the different constructs were queried in the psychosocial questionnaire.

This questionnaire was chosen because it specifically assesses motivation towards participation in physical activities. This is a validated questionnaire consisting of five scales: amotivation, external regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation and intrinsic regulation.</p><p>Modeling, social norm, social support, general self-efficacy, self-efficacy towards barriers of physical activity, perceived benefits (outcome expectations) (all derived from the social cognitive theory), and perceived barriers towards physical activity and coping with relapse (derived from the transtheoretical model) were also assessed. Questions were selected and adopted from a previous study in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Modeling was measured by asking participants how frequently their family, friends and general practitioner were physically active. Social norm was assessed by asking if their family, friends and general practitioner thought that they should be physical active. To investigate social support, participants were asked if they had a regular sport partner, how often their family, friends and partner invited them to exercise with them and how frequently they encouraged them to participate in physical activity.</p><p>The level of self-efficacy towards specific barriers was obtained by asking participants how confident they were that they can be physically active under 16 potentially difficult situations (early in the morning, depressive mood, family expectations, lots of work to do, not feeling well, end of a long tiring day, major life events, social obligations, etc.). General self-efficacy towards physical activity was also inquired.</p><p>Perceived benefits and barriers with regard to physical activity were investigated by asking respondents to rate their agreement with possible positive effects of physical activity (23 items) and the frequency with which barriers prevented them from exercising (35 items). Benefits and barriers were each divided in six subscales with good internal consistency, based on previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Coping with relapse, was assessed by asking participants if they thought they were able to make an inventory of future high-risk situations that can contribute to relapse episodes and cope with these situations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS 15 with baseline carried forward intention-to-treat principles. Descriptive statistics of the study sample were analyzed and differences in baseline characteristics between the intervention group and the control group were examined using independent sample t-tests. In case of significant differences in baseline characteristics, these factors were included in the mediating analyses as confounding factors. Coping with relapse and changes in modeling, social norm, social support, general and specific self-efficacy, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, decisional balance, and motivation were examined as potential mediators of the intervention effects on changes in physical activity behavior (pedometer steps/day, accelerometer-based total physical activity, and self-reported active transportation, physical activity for housekeeping and gardening, leisure-time physical activity, and total physical activity).</p><p>Measures of change in physical activity behaviors between pre- and post-intervention test and between pre- and one-year follow-up test were created by regressing the physical activity measures at post-intervention test and at the one-year follow-up test onto their baseline values. Based on these regression outcomes, residualized physical activity change indices were computed. These scores can be interpreted as the amount of increase or decrease in physical activity behaviors between baseline and either subsequent time point, independent of baseline activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A similar measure of residualized change in psychosocial correlates (except for coping with relapse, for which only the post-intervention values and the one-year follow-up values were used) was created by regressing each psychosocial factor score at post-intervention test and at the one-year follow-up test into the baseline scores. These measures of change in psychosocial factors are also independent of baseline scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>As suggested by Cerin and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], the Freedman-Schatzkin difference-in-coefficients test was used to assess the mediating effects of the changes in psychosocial factors on the change in physical activity behaviors. This method was used instead of the traditional Baron-Kenny causal step approach, because the Baron-Kenny method has low statistical power in studies with a small sample size, even when strong mediating effects are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The Freedman-Schatzkin test measures a mediating effect by comparing the relationship between the independent (the intervention) and the dependent variable (change in physical activity behaviors) before and after adjustment for the mediator (change in psychosocial variables). For each potential mediator, this test was repeated (single mediation analysis). Using the Freedman-Schatzkin method, the null hypothesis that the difference between the unadjusted (without mediator: &#x003c4;) and adjusted (with mediator: &#x003c4;') regression coefficients of the independent variable is zero, was tested. The test consists of three regression analyses. The first analysis examines the impact of the intervention condition (dummy variable: 0 = control group, 1 = intervention group) on the outcome measure, providing an estimate for &#x003c4; (relationship between intervention condition and physical activity behavior change before adjusting for the mediator). The second regression looks at the associations between the intervention condition (independent variable) and the potential mediators (dependent variables). This step is necessary because a significant intervention effect on the potential mediators is required to do mediating analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The third regression analysis looks at the effect of the intervention condition on the outcome measure, after controlling for the mediator (residualized change in psychosocial factors), giving an estimate for &#x003c4;' which represents the independent effect of the intervention condition on physical activity change after adjusting for the mediator. The significance test for the mediating effect is computed by dividing (&#x003c4; - &#x003c4;') by its standard error and comparing the obtained value to a t-distribution with N-2 degrees of freedom.

Post-intervention (short-term) and one-year (intermediate-term) psychosocial mediators of the changes in either objective or self-reported physical activity were investigated in a randomized controlled trial. In line with the hypothesis, the results revealed that some changes in psychosocial constructs mediated the intervention effects on physical activity. However, mediators were different at the short or intermediate term and highly dependent on the measure of physical activity.</p><p>Coping with relapse, defined as the ability to avoid and cope with relapse-inducing situations, was the most consistent mediator over the short-term. During the intervention, participants learned how to cope with future high-risk situations; coping with relapse and getting active again after a period of relapse was a frequent theme in the telephone calls with patients. Six months after the end of the intervention, the ability of patients to cope with relapse still mediated 28.4% of the intervention effect on self-reported active transportation. There are no physical activity studies with which we can compare this effect. Coping with relapse is seldom measured, and was never included in mediation analyses to explain intervention effects on physical activity. Nonetheless, in a study examining possible mediators of the effectiveness of a smoking cessation program, coping with relapse was identified as a significant mediator of the short-term effect of the cessation program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Moreover, in clinical practice and also in the Transtheoretical Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] it is considered to be a major factor in sustained behavior change. Although it might be too early to draw firm conclusions on the role of coping with relapse as an important mediator in explaining intervention effects in diabetes patients, this construct should be included in further studies and probably also be part of intervention strategies to increase physical activity in diabetes patients.</p><p>General self-efficacy was most often found to be a major mediating factor in previous studies on mediators of physical activity in the general population. In the present study, not general self-efficacy, but changes in self-efficacy towards overcoming specific physical activity barriers was an intermediate-term mediator, mediating 44.3% and 10.5% of the intervention effect on active transportation and total physical activity, respectively. Other intervention studies have reported clear effects on specific self-efficacy (barrier and task self-efficacy, self-efficacy under specific circumstances and in specific difficult situations) both in a general and type 2 diabetes populations, however only over the short-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In our study, self-efficacy towards physical activity barriers was not a mediator during the intervention period (short-term), but only after the intervention ended (intermediate-term). This finding is in line with the theory of Marlatt and Gordon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] suggesting that individuals who initiate behavior change, experience increased self-efficacy that grows as they continue to maintain the change. This reciprocal relationship between behavior and self-efficacy might explain the fact that specific self-efficacy became only a mediator of behavior change after a certain period of intervention. This finding also implies that interventions that can increase patients' self-efficacy towards physical activity barriers seem to be particularly important for maintaining physical activity changes over the intermediate-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The intervention did not succeed to have a significant impact on general self-efficacy towards physical activity. One reason could be that general self-efficacy was queried to vaguely. This pleads for including specific self-efficacy in future studies.</p><p>In addition to the mediation effects found for coping with relapse and self-efficacy towards barriers, a third group of mediators was found, all related to social factors. Increases in social norm and modeling from family mediated some of the short-term intervention effects. This underlines the need for an environment with physically active family members (modeling) who have clear physical activity expectations towards the participant (social norm). In the initial face-to-face session, modeling was discussed and most of the participants' spouses were present, which may have increased their physical activity expectations towards the participant. Our results supported the early emphasis on modeling to yield especially changes in leisure-time activities. These activities were often performed together with a partner or a friend, which means that modeling can be interpreted here as being active together with a 'sportpartner'. Increases in social norm from family were mainly related to increases in steps and active transport, which means that the intervention succeeded in changing the perceptions of partners of the patients and in attempts to encourage them to take steps or to walk or cycle for transport. Social support from family did not mediate short-term physical activity changes but was the most consistent mediator of intermediate-term changes of physical activity. An explanation for this effect could be that the participants received enough support from the study psychologist during the intervention and did not rely on their family for further support. Unfortunately, the perceived support from the psychologist was not queried by any of the questionnaires. After the intervention, however, participants did rely again on their family for support. Barrera and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] also found a mediating effect of social factors in type 2 diabetes patients but only over the short-term, during the 6 months intensive intervention period. However, in that study a general social resources measure was used summing the effects of family, friends and neighbors and not distinguishing between specific constructs such as social norms, modeling or support, which makes comparison with our effects rather difficult. No other studies examining the mediating role of social factors on physical activity changes in type 2 diabetes patients were found. However, in general adult populations, social factors like social support do not appear to mediate intervention effects on physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Possibly, social factors are of higher importance in specific populations like diabetes patients than they are in the general adult population.</p><p>There was no increase in autonomous motivation (i.e. introjected regulation, identified regulation, intrinsic regulation) towards physical activity in this study group, although our intervention also incorporated self-determination theory constructs. An explanation could be that it is very difficult to intrinsically motivate this elderly chronically ill population. Because of their age and illness, they seemed to be more externally motivated to be physical active (because it is good for their health, because they need to take less medications, etc.). An alternative explanation could also be that the content of the intervention or the delivery mode did not support autonomous motivation adequately. Secondly, our intervention did not succeed in increasing the benefits and decreasing the barriers of physical activity, despite the fact that part of the face-to-face session and the telephone sessions with the patients were dedicated to these constructs, and these constructs are considered to be important mediators of behavior change in several popular models or theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. If future studies confirm that it is hard to change motivation, barriers, and benefits of physical activity, and these constructs do not act as mediators to change physical activity, a possibility could be to delete these elements from the intervention, in order to make the intervention more restricted and to have a stronger focus on a limited number of constructs. This was suggested before in a study examining mediators of a physical activity intervention in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. It is however important to notice that self-efficacy towards physical activity barriers and coping with relapse were found to be important mediators, so listing personal physical activity barriers could possibly be seen as a first step needed to increase self-efficacy and decrease relapse. Therefore, before concluding that certain constructs (e.g. perceived barriers and benefits) could be deleted from interventions, one needs to know whether there is a possibility that they have an indirect effect on physical activity. Further research on this subject is needed.</p><p>In line with the recommendations of King and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], we tried to gain a wider understanding of mediators across different physical activity domains in the present study. As mentioned before, most constructs only mediated effects on specific measures of physical activity. Although the intervention had a strong impact on physical activity for housekeeping and gardening, few mediating effects were found (only social support on the intermediate-term). A possible explanation can be that gardening and housekeeping are tasks that have to be done routinely, and are thus the result of unconscious individual decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. It is possible that just by wearing a pedometer, through monitoring their behavior, people increase their gardening and housekeeping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>The results of this study should be viewed in light of its limitations. The physical activity intervention was delivered from a tertiary care-based setting, which may not generalize to other community samples or settings. Results might differ if participants were recruited from community or primary care settings. Secondly, although previous studies have shown that self-reported psychosocial measures have good reliability and acceptable validity, they could suffer from social desirability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thirdly, only 92 diabetes patients participated in this study. Because of this limited sample size, also marginally significant results were included in this paper. If future studies would include a larger study sample, stronger findings could possibly be identified.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the present study is noteworthy given the very limited number of studies examining mediating effects of a physical activity intervention in type 2 diabetes patients. A second strength is that the present study also investigated intermediate-term mediators, after a one-year period. Because of the overall effectiveness of this randomized controlled trial on physical activity measurements, this is one of the first true mediation analyses in a type 2 diabetes sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings indicate that coping with relapse can be an important mediator of changes in different types of physical activity during the 6 month intervention period (short-term), while social support is a mediator of change in the longer term. Self-efficacy towards overcoming specific physical activity barriers was found to be an additional intermediate-term mediator. Positive social norms and modeling from family were significant initial mediators of physical activity change.</p><p>Future interventions should give particular attention to teach participants how to cope with high-risk situations, to train their skills and self-efficacy to overcome physical activity barriers, and to mobilize family members to support them to be active or to engage in physical activity together with them. As this is one of the few studies focusing on mediators of change in a physical activity intervention for adults with type 2 diabetes, additional research is necessary to confirm and extend these findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the design of different parts of the study.
