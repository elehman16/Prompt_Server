Many studies have investigated the efficacy of different drugs in converting AF to sinus rhythm (SR). There are numerous randomized controlled trials comparing the value of these drugs with placebo, as well as among each other. Efficacy for acute conversion of AF was demonstrated for ibutilide, flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, and amiodarone, and there was moderate evidence for quinidine.<sup><xref rid="euw052C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Ibutilide, a Class III antiarrhythmic drug that blocks IKr, blocks the rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current and activates a late inward sodium current,<sup><xref rid="euw052C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> is approved for acute termination of AF and atrial flutter of recent onset and has been shown to be superior to sotalol<sup><xref rid="euw052C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and equivalent to flecainide<sup><xref rid="euw052C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> in this indication in two randomized controlled trials. Recently, the relatively atrial selective antiarrhythmic agent vernakalant has been approved by the European Medicines Agency for the rapid conversion of recent-onset AF to SR in adults. It is recommended for rhythm control by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) since the 2010 guidelines<sup><xref rid="euw052C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and highlighted in a recent review.<sup><xref rid="euw052C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Vernakalant rapidly terminates AF through blocking of potassium and frequency- and voltage-dependent sodium ion channels in all phases of the atrial action potential.<sup><xref rid="euw052C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In the AVRO trial (a randomized active-controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety of vernakalant to amiodarone in recent-onset AF), vernakalant demonstrated being more effective than amiodarone for acute conversion of recent-onset AF<sup><xref rid="euw052C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> as well as in a small single-centre trial from Argentina, intravenous vernakalant was significantly faster in converting AF to SR when compared with oral flecainide.<sup><xref rid="euw052C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Vernakalant and ibutilide have comparable pharmacokinetic properties and are both recommended by the current ESC focused guidelines update for the management of AF in patients with and without moderate, but not severe structural heart disease.<sup><xref rid="euw052C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>The aim of our study was to compare the time and the efficacy of conversion to SR within 90 min in patients with recent-onset AF treated with vernakalant or ibutilide intravenously.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the independent Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Vienna (EK NR: 220/2011).

Exclusion criteria were necessity for immediate electrical cardioversion due to haemodynamic instability; heart failure NYHA III/IV; a previously documented left ventricular ejection fraction of &#x02264;35%; history or signs of acute coronary syndrome within the last 30 days; a resting ventricular rate of &#x0003c;80 bpm without pacemaker backup; a QT interval of &#x0003e;440 ms; presence of Wolff&#x02013;Parkinson&#x02013;White syndrome; history of Torsade de pointes (TdP) arrhythmia or other polymorphic ventricular tachycardias (VTs); signs of thyrotoxicosis, sick sinus syndrome or atrioventricular block II and III, severe valvular heart disease, clinically meaningful hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, or constrictive pericarditis; serious disorders of the hepatic, renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, haematological, or central nervous system; serious psychiatric disorders; abnormal serum electrolytes despite adequate therapy; intravenous use of any Class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs within 4 h prior to study drug application; pregnancy; and known hypersensitivity to study medications.</p><p>We did not include patients with atrial flutter as vernakalant treatment is not indicated in this patient group due to lack of efficacy.<sup><xref rid="euw052C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>Block randomization into two treatment groups with variable block sizes of four to six was performed by an independent epidemiologist using <uri xlink:href="www.randomization.com">www.randomization.com</uri>. To conceal allocation we used sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes, which were produced before initiation of the study.</p><p>If potassium values were not in the high normal range (&#x0003e;4.2 mmol/L), patients received a pre-fabricated electrolyte infusion (Elozell &#x02018;spezial&#x02019;, 250 mL, Fresenius Kabi, Austria) with 24 mmol of potassium and 6 mmol of magnesium prior to randomization. A total of 43 patients (88%) in the vernakalant group and 38 patients (75%) in the ibutilide group received this treatment.</p><p>Additionally, according to local standard of care, most patients received 500 mL of a balanced electrolyte solution (Elo-Mel isoton, Fresenius Kabi Austria) intravenously, in order to increase plasma volume.</p><p>All subjects were randomized to receive either up to two infusions of ibutilide (1 mg each in 100 mL normal saline) intravenously over 10 min with an interruption of 10 min in-between or up to two infusions of vernakalant (3 and 2 mg/kg in 100 mL normal saline) with an interruption of 15 min in-between. The second dose was given only if AF persisted (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="euw052F1">1</xref></italic>). Subjects weighing &#x0003c;60 kg received 0.01 mg/kg ibutilide according to the manufacturer's instructions, as well as for subjects receiving vernakalant a maximum of 339 mg for the first, and 226 mg for the second infusion was not exceeded.

We attempted a series of up to three electrical cardioversions (biphasic defibrillation, Philips HeartStart MRx) starting with 100 J and increasing energy up to 150 J and consequently 200 J (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="euw052F1">1</xref></italic>).</p><p>Intravenous administration of ventricular rate controlling drugs (&#x003b2;-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digitalis) was performed in both treatment groups if appropriate. Patients without sufficient anticoagulation received 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin subcutaneously. Monitoring included real-time 12-lead ECG, oxygen saturation, and heart rate. Additionally, arterial blood pressure, QT, and QTc (Fridericia correction) were measured every 20 min for the first 60 min; additional measurements were performed after 120, 240 min, and prior to discharge. To determine the exact time of conversion to SR, patients received continuous ECG monitoring. These traces were centrally stored in a secure database for later analysis.</p><p>Treatment had to be discontinued according to the protocol if uncorrected QT interval increased to &#x02265;550 ms or by &#x0003e;25% from baseline, heart rate decreased to &#x0003c;40 bpm, systolic blood pressure increased to &#x0003e;190 mmHg or decreased to &#x0003c;80 mmHg, new bundle-branch block developed or QRS interval increased by &#x02265;50% from baseline, VT, recurrent non-sustained VT (nsVT; defined as three or more ventricular extrasystoles lasting &#x0003c;30 s), a sinus pause of &#x02265;5 s, complete heart block, or intolerable adverse effects occurred. A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined according to the ICH-GCP guidelines as an event resulting in death, a life-threatening condition, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or persistent or significant disability or incapacity.

For comparison of cardioversion success, we used survival analysis methods. Cardioversion success until 90 min was analysed using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method with follow-up time starting at initiation of study medication and sustained SR defined as success (15 min at least). As electrical cardioversion time was not protocol directed within the first 90 min, we censored follow-up for this analysis at 90 min. We plotted 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) around the survival probabilities and compared the intervention groups using a log-rank test. As an additional analysis, we repeated this analysis without censoring using the follow-up time until the last success. To assess adverse effects and other categorized outcomes, we calculated absolute risk differences with exact 95% CI and used the Fisher's exact test for hypothesis testing. To assess other ancillary outcomes on a continuous scale, we used the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test or <italic>t</italic>-test, as appropriate. For heart rate, QT interval and blood pressure repeated measurements were available. To allow for the panel structure of these variables, we used multivariable random effects models with each of these measurements as outcome, intervention group, time, and treatment&#x02013;time interaction as covariates, and patient identifier as the cluster identifier to estimate the difference between the intervention groups based on a Wald test.</p><p>A two-sided <italic>P</italic>-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Prior data indicated that the median time to conversion in the control treatment was 25 min. If the true median time to conversion in the control and experimental treatments was 25 and 12 min, respectively, we needed to study 30 experimental subjects and 30 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the experimental and control survival curves (based on time to conversion) are equal with a power of 80%. The Type I error probability associated with this log-rank test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. To compensate for an expectedly large number of missing data, we increased the study sample to 50 patients per group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study population</title><p>From January 2012 to March 2015, a total of 209 patients were screened for eligibility, of which 101 patients were enrolled in this single-centre randomized controlled trial. A total of 108 patients were excluded, whereof 53 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria, 28 declined to participate, and 27 patients converted to SR during screening phase.</p><p>The two treatment groups were well balanced; there were no significant differences regarding demographics and baseline characteristics (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="euw052TB1">1</xref></italic>). However, more patients in the ibutilide group had previous ablation (7 vs. 2). This did not affect conversion rate in our study and did not significantly affect further analyses. Interestingly, although AF was recurrent in a large proportion of patients, use of prophylactic oral antiarrhythmic drug therapy was low in both study groups.

The majority of those studies observed conversion rates of &#x0223c;50%, with an increased conversion success of &#x0223c;60% in one <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis.<sup><xref rid="euw052C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In one recent Swedish cohort study including 251 patients, a conversion rate of 70% was reported, which is comparable to our findings.<sup><xref rid="euw052C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Just two small single-centre studies from Argentina, each with 17 patients receiving vernakalant, reported even higher conversion rates of 76.4% within 30 min<sup><xref rid="euw052C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and 93% within 2 h.<sup><xref rid="euw052C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The high conversion rate in our study might be related with the low number of patients with greater co-morbidities (e.g. structural heart disease), the rather young patient age and the relatively short duration of AF prior to study inclusion.</p><p>The conversion rate in the ibutilide group was in the same range as in previous trials that compared the efficacy of ibutilide with placebo or other antiarrhythmic agents. Conversion rates of 35&#x02013;51% have been observed in those studies, with the highest efficacy in patients with atrial flutter<sup><xref rid="euw052C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="euw052C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and in patients with AF lasting &#x0003c;48 h.<sup><xref rid="euw052C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="euw052C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Likewise, the time to conversion is comparable to our results (mean conversion time of 27&#x02013;33 min).<sup><xref rid="euw052C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>The electrophysiological actions of the mixed ion channel blocker vernakalant are largely characterized by frequency-dependent alterations of peak sodium channel currents including effective refractory period prolongation due to induction of post-repolarization refractoriness.<sup><xref rid="euw052C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Additionally, vernakalant acts by blockade of the ultra-rapid delayed potassium atrial rectifier current (I<sub>Kur</sub>), with consequent prolongation of the atrial effective refractory period.<sup><xref rid="euw052C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> These effects may explain the prominent anti-AF efficacy and consequently the superiority when compared with ibutilide, which acts by blocking the rapid component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium and by activation of a late inward sodium current.<sup><xref rid="euw052C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>The benefits of an early cardioversion and a comprehensive rhythm control therapy<sup><xref rid="euw052C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> include a reduction in the risk of recurrent AF episodes,<sup><xref rid="euw052C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> less need for electrical cardioversion,<sup><xref rid="euw052C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> prevention of prolonged and expensive hospital admissions, and might improve overall outcome, a question addressed in the on-going EAST (Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial) study.<sup><xref rid="euw052C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Indeed, significantly less patients in the vernakalant group needed electrical cardioversion (13 when compared with 26 patients in the ibutilide group), and duration of emergency department stay could have been significantly shortened, especially in the vernakalant group, if an observational period of at least 6 h would not have been required by our study protocol. Accordingly, the cumulative time to conversion to SR, summarizing pharmacological and electrical cardioversion, was shorter in the vernakalant group when compared with the ibutilide group [median time: 15 (IQR = 8&#x02013;140) vs. 124 (IQR = 20&#x02013;241)].</p><p>Of interest, vernakalant was at least as effective as ibutilide in enhancing electrical cardioversion. Of 13 patients, 12 (92%) in the vernakalant group were successfully electrically cardioverted with one shock of 100 J, when compared with only 17 of 26 patients (65%) in the ibutilide group. This finding is in line with a recently published study from Germany in which vernakalant was more effective than amiodarone in facilitating electrical cardioversion in patients with either immediate AF recurrence or failed electrical cardioversion after antiarrhythmic-na&#x000ef;ve electrical cardioversion.<sup><xref rid="euw052C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>Both study drugs were well tolerated in our study, and most observed adverse events were in the range of previous trials. Dysgeusia, sneezing, and paraesthesia were comparable to the summarized findings from the Phase II and Phase III trials of intravenous vernakalant vs. placebo (dysgeusia 20.4%, sneezing 15%, paraesthesia 8.8%)<sup><xref rid="euw052C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and the AVRO trial (dysgeusia 6.9%, sneezing 3.4%).<sup><xref rid="euw052C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Likewise, atrial flutter occurred with the same incidence as in the AVRO trial (8.2 vs. 8.6%).</p><p>Non-sustained VTs occurred in 14% (<italic>n</italic> = 7) of the patients in the ibutilide group. This incidence is higher as reported in previous studies with ibutilide, where nsVTs were observed in 4.9&#x02013;8.3% of treated patients.<sup><xref rid="euw052C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="euw052C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In line with previous reports, QT and QTc prolongation was particularly pronounced in the ibutilide group.<sup><xref rid="euw052C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Of interest, no patient experienced relevant arterial hypotension, and blood pressure did not differ between treatment groups, although hypotension is a potential dangerous adverse event developing after vernakalant administration in &#x0223c;6% of patients.<sup><xref rid="euw052C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This might be at least partly attributable to our local standard of care intravenous fluid therapy (on average 0.75 L electrolyte infusion) in patients with AF and the fact that just a minority of our study patients showed impaired left ventricular function, a known risk factor for developing haemodynamic instability.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, we did not include a placebo group due to our concerns of leaving symptomatic patients untreated. Moreover, placebo controlled trials already exist for both drugs.<sup><xref rid="euw052C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="euw052C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Second, study treatment was not blinded, so we cannot exclude some type of bias. However, our predefined study endpoints were not prone to subjective assessment. Third, we performed a single-centre trial and cannot rule out that local standard of care affected study outcomes. Indeed, the administration of an electrolyte infusion to raise potassium values to high normal values during the screening phase might be linked with the absence of TdP arrhythmia or other polymorphic VT in our study patients. Forth, AF duration prior the study inclusion was short, and most of our study patients had good ejection fraction and were relatively young.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Vernakalant was superior to ibutilide in converting recent-onset AF to SR in the emergency department setting.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This project was supported by a grant from the Jubilaeumsfonds of the Austrian National Bank (#14891 to A.O.S).
