Most of those interviewed were satisfied with the layout and technique and with the support provided by the study coordinators. More frequent contact with study coordinators was suggested as a way to improve program adherence and completion.

The concept of mindfulness has been defined as &#x0201c;the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment by moment&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In mindfulness-based programs, a number of specific meditation and yoga exercises are used to develop and increase the ability to be mindful in the present moment. The MBSR program was originally developed for individuals with somatic disorders [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but over the years the effects of mindfulness-based programs have been evaluated in a large number of studies for various population groups and for different symptoms and conditions. A meta-analysis examining the effects of mindfulness training in nonclinical settings on a wide variety of outcomes showed small to medium effect sizes for anxiety, stress reduction, and psychological well-being&#x000a0;[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The Internet provides an opportunity to deliver evidence-based psychosocial programs to a broader range of individuals and a possibility to disseminate interventions targeting stress and stress-related problems to large groups [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. An increasing proportion of the global population has access to the Internet&#x02014;more than 70% of people in Europe, nearly 90% in North America, and 95% in Sweden are Internet users [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Internet-based programs can be cost efficient [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and the stigma that might be associated with some face-to-face consultations regarding mental disorders can be avoided [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A growing number of treatment programs are Internet-based, targeting many stress-related and mental conditions and behaviors such as smoking, insomnia, and depression [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. An increasing number of studies of patients with various mental disorders have shown the positive effects of Internet-based programs [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Several of these programs have been based on or included mindfulness techniques. The effects of specific mindfulness-based programs delivered through the Internet have been promising regarding the improvement of mental states such as stress, anxiety, and depression [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and results apply to persons with psychological symptoms of stress or distress [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], as well as to persons without previously known mental health problems [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], including students [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have explored the experiences of Internet-based interventions among users, although few of them have investigated participant perceptions of specific mindfulness-based programs. In one randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the feasibility of an Internet-based mindfulness program for stress management in the Unites States, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire about overall feedback on the intervention and reasons for early study or program termination [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. About 25% of those who completed the baseline questionnaire responded to the feedback questionnaire. Of those who gave feedback, 45% found the overall program to be very or extremely helpful, 35% somewhat helpful, and 19% little or not at all helpful. The most common reason for leaving the program was that the participant was too busy. The second most common reason for termination was technical or access problems. In an American interview study assessing participant experiences of a mindfulness-based intervention delivered through the Internet for reducing residual depression symptoms and preventing relapse, participants reported on a perceived lack of support during the program but appreciated the flexibility of completing weekly sessions according to their own schedule [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>This randomized controlled pilot trial examined the feasibility, usability, acceptability, and outcomes of a newly developed 8-week Internet-based mindfulness training program among Swedish students. Feasibility was examined by determining the degree to which participants were engaged in and completed the program. Usability and acceptability were assessed using postintervention questionnaires and semistructured interviews of experiences at completion of the program. Outcomes were examined by comparing pre- and postassessments of psychological well-being and depression symptoms both within the intervention group and between those participating in the mindfulness training program and those randomized to an active control condition. This broad approach of evaluation aims to expand the knowledge about the potential of Internet-based self-administrated mindfulness-based programs to improve mental health status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants and Procedures</title><p>Study participants were recruited between December 2013 and March 2014 by advertising at different university campuses in Stockholm, Sweden. The study was open to students aged 18 years and older with access to a computer and an email address. Students interested in participation phoned or sent an email to the study coordinators to receive additional information about the study design. Participants were randomized to either the intervention group (Internet-based mindfulness training program) or an active control group (Internet-based expressive writing program) on a rolling basis using a random sequence of numbers. One of the authors generated the sequence of numbers using SPSS statistical analysis software (IBM Corp) and another author enrolled and assigned participants in the order they were recruited. All participants in both groups were asked to fill out a questionnaire before and after the program and complete weekly assessments. Participants who did not respond to the weekly assessments were reminded by email. The completion of a week&#x02019;s training was not time-limited, but the next set of program material was only made available after the participant completed the previous training and assessment. Those who did not respond to the reminder or did not fill out the weekly assessments marking continued participation were not asked to give a reason for discontinuation or noncompliance. All participants completing the Internet-based programs were compensated in an amount of SEK 500 (about $54).</p></sec><sec><title>The Internet-Based Mindfulness-Based Intervention</title><p>The mindfulness training program developed for this study was a modified version of the group-based mindfulness program developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The adaptation of the program to an Internet environment was based on experiences gained from other Internet-based programs [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Participants were given access to the course platform by logging in and using an individual password. The program consisted of 8 weekly modules including information about the theoretical foundations of mindfulness regarding relaxation, meditation, and the body-mind connection. Each weekly module consisted of a few pages of text (ie, the lecture) and a set of exercises. All formal exercises described in the standards of practice of MBSR from the University of Massachusetts Medical School Center for Mindfulness in Medicine [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (body scan meditation, hatha yoga, sitting meditation, and walking meditation) as well as the informal exercises awareness of pleasant and unpleasant events, awareness of breathing, and deliberate awareness of routine activities and events were included in the program (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Program content.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="621" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="1"><col width="50" span="1"/><col width="100" span="1"/><col width="133" span="1"/><col width="133" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Topic of lecture</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Formal exercises</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Informal exercises</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Week 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mindfulness: benefits to quality of life and health</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Introduction of: <break/>&#x02013;&#x000a0;Mindful breathing <break/>&#x02013;&#x000a0;Body scan meditation</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Introduction of: <break/>&#x02013;&#x000a0;Deliberate awareness of routine activities and events such as waking up, eating, taking a shower, driving, awareness of interpersonal communications</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Week 2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cultivation of mindful attitudes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continued practice of introduced exercises</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continued practice of introduced exercises <break/><break/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Week 3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">The desire to keep or avoid</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Introduction of: <break/>&#x02013;Lying yoga <break/>Continued practice of introduced exercises</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Introduction of: <break/>&#x02013;&#x000a0;3-minutes meditation: <break/>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x025cb;Step 1: Becoming aware <break/>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x025cb;Step 2: Gathering and focusing attention <break/>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x025cb;Step 3: Expanding attention <break/>Continued practice of introduced exercises</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Week 4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mindfulness and stress</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continued practice of introduced exercises</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continued practice of introduced exercises</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Week 5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Relations and social context</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Introduction of: <break/>&#x02013;&#x000a0;Standing yoga<break/>&#x02013;&#x000a0;Sitting meditation<break/>&#x02013;&#x000a0;Walking meditation<break/>Continued practice of introduced exercises</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continued practice of introduced exercises</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Week 6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Automatic thoughts</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continued practice of introduced exercises</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Introduction of: <break/>&#x02013;&#x000a0;STOP: A Short Mindfulness Practice enabling distancing from instant feelings<break/>Continued practice of introduced exercises</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Week 7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sleep and Mindfulness</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Encouragement to train without audio files and experiment with different combinations of exercises</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Introduction of: <break/>&#x02013;&#x000a0;Short exercise to facilitate falling asleep <break/>Continued practice of introduced exercises</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Week 8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No lecture</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Encouragement to again use audio files and choose preferred exercises</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continued practice of introduced exercises</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The main departures in the content of our self-administrated program from MBSR as described in the standards of practice from the University of Massachusetts Medical School [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] were (1) no face-to-face sessions, (2) no group dialogue or contact between participants, (3) no all-day silent retreat during the sixth week, and (4) no introduction of self-evaluation instruments at the end of the course. Participants could navigate within each module in the texts by clicking on navigational icons. Audio files, 15 or 30 minutes in length, were provided to facilitate daily practice of formal exercises. The participants were encouraged to practice 30 to 45 minutes a day, continuously or throughout the day, 6 to 7 days per week. The program also included short-duration meditation and exercises aimed to promote the integration of mindful awareness into everyday activities. New exercises were introduced gradually during the first 5 weeks, including mindful breathing and body-scan meditation in the first and second weeks, lying yoga in the third and fourth weeks, and standing yoga, sitting meditation, and walking meditation in the fifth week. In weeks 6 to 8, participants could choose which exercises to perform. None of the exercises required a high degree of physical strength or agility. Participants were presented with alternative ways of doing the exercises if needed, like choosing other positions, to ensure their safety. The study coordinator supported participants by sending weekly messages informing them that a new week&#x02019;s text and exercises were available. The study coordinator could monitor each participant&#x02019;s log-in history and send extra reminders to participants who did not visit the platform for 14 days or longer. The participants could contact the study coordinators through the program platform or by sending an email or making a phone call.</p></sec><sec><title>The Internet-Based Expressive Writing Intervention</title><p>Participants in the Internet-based expressive writing program were asked to write about stressor-related emotions and thoughts for 20 minutes on 4 occasions spread out over approximately 4 weeks. This procedure is drawn from work by Pennebaker and colleagues and has been tested across dozens of RCTs [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In this study, the standardized procedure by Pennebaker was complemented with an additional writing instruction. In addition to writing about stressor-related emotions, participants were asked to write for 10 minutes using a positive prompt following the first writing assignment. Examples of positive prompts are: &#x0201c;What has become better since . . .,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;What personal strengths helped you deal with . . .,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;What makes you feel hopeful about the future?&#x0201d; The exercises were made available on an Internet-based platform participants could access by logging in using an individual password. Participants could make contact with the study coordinators through the program platform or by sending an email or making a phone call.</p></sec><sec><title>Internet-Based Measurements at Baseline and Postintervention</title><sec><title>Participant Characteristics</title><p>Participants were asked to complete a baseline questionnaire which included questions on age, gender, level of education, and living situation. This was done in connection to the obtaining of baseline measures of the outcome variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome Variables</title><p>Psychological Well-Being is a questionnaire measuring 6 dimensions: environmental mastery, self-acceptance, positive relations with others, purpose in life, personal growth, and autonomy. It has been extensively used and has shown acceptable factor structure and validity [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this study, an overall total measure of psychological well-being was used. The alpha coefficient of the scale was .82 in our sample.</p><p>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale is a 20-item scale measuring depression symptoms in nonpsychiatric populations [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The alpha coefficient of the scale was .90 in our sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Weekly Follow-Up Assessments</title><p>After each week, the participants in the mindfulness intervention group were asked to answer questions about how much time they had spent on exercises during the previous week. Participants in both groups were also asked to respond to a number of questions assessing potential mediators of intervention effect: mindfulness skills after weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 and positive/negative affect after weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7. For the analyses in this paper, the time and frequency of practice is reported, but no analyses of the mediation was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluations of the Program</title><p>At the postassessment follow-up, respondents were asked to answer 7 questions on a scale of 1 to 9, where 1 indicates &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; and 9 indicates &#x0201c;very,&#x0201d; to evaluate their overall experiences of the programs. The questions were based on research into factors considered to be important for participation in Internet-based programs (ie, how well the intervention is received and perceived by users) [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and included: How meaningful do you think the program was? How successful do you think the program was in improving your way of being? How likely is it that you would recommend the program to someone in the same situation as you? How emotionally demanding do you think the program was? On the whole, how challenging do you think the program was? If you had known as much about the program before starting as you know today, how likely would it have been that you would still have participated? Do you feel that your ability to reach mindful awareness has changed during the program? Items rated 1 to 3 points were considered to have a low value to participants; items rated 4 to 5, middle value; and items rated 7 to 9, high value.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Baseline characteristics of the sample, stratified by experimental group, were examined to ensure that key variables were evenly distributed by randomization using Student <italic>t</italic> tests. The most specific test of the hypothesis as a whole was the difference between groups on the contrast between baseline and follow-up. This was tested using multivariate repeated-measures analyses of variance (MANOVA) with baseline and follow-up scores as dependent variables. Time and group (mindfulness vs expressive writing) were entered as factors in the analyses. In addition to the MANOVA, inferential analyses were conducted to examine pre- and postintervention change for each dependent variable, stratified by randomization condition, using independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests. Cohen's <italic>d</italic> effect size for within and between group differences was calculated based on the difference between group means on baseline and follow-up change scores. The denominator was based on the pooled standard deviation (SD) at baseline and follow-up adjusted for different sample sizes [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. All tests of intervention effects were done with intention-to-treat analyses with missing data at follow-up imputed according to last-observation-carried-forward strategy, meaning that some baseline values were used as postintervention values. All tests of significance were two-tailed. Analyses were performed in SPSS.</p></sec><sec><title>Semistructured Telephone Interviews Postintervention</title><p>To get information about participant perceptions of the mindfulness training program, telephone interviews were conducted with a small number of participants shortly after program completion. The focus of the interviews was the participant experience of the techniques, information, instructions, and exercises, as well as the perceived support received from the study coordinators. The first students who completed the mindfulness program were asked to participate in an interview. One of the study coordinators (PK) conducted all interviews using a semistructured guide with open-ended questions along with probing statements. The interview guide reflected issues that have previously been shown to influence participant perceptions of Internet-based programs (eg, if the program was easy to use [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], how it was perceived in terms of reliable information and professional appearance, and challenges in carrying out the exercises [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]). The interviews were 15 minutes long on average and recorded with the permission of the interviewees. After 6 to 7 interviews, no new information seemed to appear, and the interview process was discontinued when 8 participants had been interviewed. The interview questions were as follows: Do you want to say something in general about the program and your experiences of it? How did you experience the Internet technique by which the program was delivered? How did you experience the information in the program? How did you experience the interaction with the study coordinators? How did you experience the training? What is your view on the items in the questionnaires? Do you have any suggestions on how the program could be improved? The audio records were transcribed verbatim after the interview process was completed.</p></sec><sec><title>Content Analysis of Semistructured Interviews</title><p>Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the interview data [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The analysis was to a large extent deductive, since the interview questions initially directed the analysis. Unexpected content was also taken into account in order to refine and extend the understanding of the material. The approach most closely resembling ours has been described as directed content analysis [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A team-based approach was used for developing codes and coding the narratives [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. All interviews were initially coded by researcher PK, who developed a coding scheme by identifying meaningful units that could be grouped into categories, as exemplified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. To assess the reliability of the coding [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], an independent recoding was undertaken by researcher YB using the original coding scheme.

Some participants suggested improvements regarding the interaction with study coordinators and technical and layout issues. One of the respondents said that more emails reminding participants to exercise might facilitate completion of the program. Another suggestion was to arrange a meeting with the study coordinators and other participants at the beginning of the program in order to facilitate participation in and completion of the program. It was also suggested that a phone call from the study coordinators at the beginning of the program would increase the completion rate. Other suggestions were related to technical improvements, such as providing access to a special smartphone app where the participants could log their training. A reorganization of the audio files was proposed as was the provision of some kind of bank with questions from other participants, with related answers from the study coordinators.</p></sec><sec><title>Personal Facilitators</title><p>The topics included in this subcategory are about circumstances connected to the participants&#x02019; personal situations that contributed to facilitating implementation of the program. Some of them were related to attitudes or motivation, like curiosity and personal interest, and others to more practical or technical conditions, like having the opportunity to download files onto a phone and listen to them on the way to work.</p><disp-quote><p>Well, I have a positive attitude towards it because I have practiced mindfulness before, privately on my own, in different ways [. . .] I am very curious and interested.</p><attrib>Woman, 32 years</attrib></disp-quote></sec><sec><title>Personal Barriers</title><p>The topics in this subcategory are about circumstances connected to the participants&#x02019; personal situations that impeded implementation of the program.

A prominent topic in this subcategory is appreciation of the opportunity to choose between exercises and time to practice.</p><disp-quote><p>The advantage is that it has been great to be able to do it just when you feel like it, that you don&#x02019;t need to fit in with a time.</p><attrib>Woman, 23 years</attrib></disp-quote><p>A number of participants also mentioned positive experiences from the training itself, like getting help to relax and calm down.

Somewhat related to the issue of planning was a statement regarding difficulties in choosing between different exercises in the program. Lack of contact with other participants was also brought up as a dissatisfying, in contrast to the expressed view that anonymity was a good thing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>This study gave support for the usability and acceptability of our self-administered Internet-based mindfulness training program among those who completed it. Although less than two-fifth of the participants completed the full program and participants practiced less than recommended, a significant increase in psychological well-being was observed. There were, however, no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control group. Most of those completing the program expressed that the program was meaningful and helpful in improving their way of being. The flexibility to perform exercises where and when it was convenient for them was appreciated and overall the program layout was perceived as satisfactory. More frequent contact with the study coordinators and reminders were suggested as ways to help participants to complete the daily exercises and to increase the likelihood of successful completion of the program. A major difficulty for several of the participants was to find enough time to practice. In addition, the majority of the participants perceived the program as challenging.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison With Prior Work</title><p>The fact that no statistically significant differences in outcomes between the mindfulness and expressive writing group was detected could be due to the active condition in the control group and the large drop-out rate in the mindfulness group. A large drop-out rate is often associated with an underestimation of the intervention effect in intention-to-treat analysis using last-observation-carried-forward approach [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>-<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The rate of participants completing the full program in this study corresponds to previous experiences from studies of Internet-based programs [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In an RCT assessing the effects of a brief 14-day Internet-based mindfulness-based intervention among British students, 43% completed a postintervention measure [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In another study of an Internet-based mindfulness program for stress management, the 8-week completion rate was 41% [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Interestingly, in this study the proportion of men who did not complete the full program was much larger than the proportion of women. Previous studies have indicated that women are more interested in participating in mindfulness training programs than men [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In a study among British students, only 12 out of 104 participants who signed up for an Internet-based mindfulness-based intervention were men [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, no gender differences between the British students who completed the mindfulness-based program and those who dropped out were found. In our study, the students were not aware of which program they would be randomly assigned to when they signed up. Students might therefore have realized that they were expected to practice mindfulness after having consented to participate, increasing the risk for early termination among those who had a less positive attitude to mindfulness. The reasons for early termination of the program were not systematically explored in this study, but several of the participants stated spontaneously that lack of time was the main reason, which is in line with earlier research [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The fact that 70% of the participants in the less time-consuming and shorter expressive writing program completed their program supports that hypothesis. About a quarter of the students left the program early (before initiating week 2). Reasons for this could be that they did not like the program or realized that they did not have enough time to spend on the program. In a similar study of a brief 14-day program instructing British students to listen daily to a 10-minute guided mindfulness meditation exercise, more than half of the students dropped out before completing a postassessment questionnaire, indicating that there are other reasons than lack of time that influence termination shortly after initiation [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the interviews after the program in our study, lack of contact with other participants was brought up as a negative feature of the program, similar to what has been reported in earlier research [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In a US study of an Internet-based mindfulness program, however, the completion rate among participants who received an Internet-based program without a message board was only slightly lower (41%) compared to participants who had access to an Internet-based message board where they could make contact with other participants (44%) [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], suggesting that contact with other participants does not contribute very much to an increased completion rate. Interviewees also mentioned the importance of contact with the study coordinators for successful completion of the program. Results from another study using computer-based mindfulness meditation training indicated that virtual coach-based training of mindfulness is both feasible and potentially more effective than a self-administered program [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. One suggestion from the completers in this study regarding facilitation of completion of the mindfulness program was to arrange a meeting between participants and study coordinators at the beginning of the program or at least having a phone call. In an expert review on Internet-based psychological treatments for depression [<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] examining different levels of contact between therapists and client in relation to outcomes, the authors stated that contact before and/or after the treatment may potentially enhance both guided and unguided Internet-based psychological treatments. Whether this is the case for self-administrated mindfulness-based and Internet-based programs among students is still unknown.</p><p>The flexibility regarding location and time for training was perceived as positive by participants, in line with earlier research [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Anonymity was also mentioned as beneficial, which has been previously observed as advantageous for participants in Internet-based interventions [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the participants reported that it was easy to navigate the program content using the Internet-based platform and that they had few or no problems with technical issues, important conditions when distributing an Internet-based program [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Choosing between different exercises and having to plan one&#x02019;s own training were considered demanding by some of those interviewed. Perhaps some participants might have felt the need for clearer guidance and support in the latter part of the program. Earlier research has shown that participants need support, for example in managing time challenges, when taking part in Internet-based programs [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The participants did not spend the intended amount of time practicing mindfulness in this training program. It is possible that greater improvements in well-being and depression symptoms could have been reached with a higher level of compliance. However, a previous 14-day Internet-based mindfulness-based program encouraging students to practice mindfulness meditation 10 minutes each day resulted in a significant group &#x000d7; time interaction for anxiety/depression symptoms, suggesting that it is possible to achieve improvements in mental states with a rather limited effort. In summary, results from this study suggest that students can benefit from an Internet-based mindfulness training program.</p><p>Our study highlights the challenge of developing health-related Internet-based interventions, including mindfulness-based programs, that are sufficiently easy to complete for an intended target group. A way to enhance completion of Internet-based programs might be to use more reminders and make personal contact by phone before program start. Less time-consuming exercises and a shorter program period might also be considered in order to raise the completion rates in these interventions. Acquiring further knowledge about how to develop and deliver such programs is warranted in order to make use of the potential of the Internet in health care and other relevant settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Although this study is of great interest because it is one of the first to explore the feasibility and effect of an Internet-based mindfulness intervention, it has several limitations. First, the participants were not required to have a certain level of stress or other psychological symptoms to be included in the study, which may have reduced the ability to detect changes in the outcome measures. A possible absence of stress or distress may also have influenced participant perceptions of the program and their motivation to practice. Perhaps they would had given the program a higher priority in their daily lives if they had felt that they really needed the training. Second, our study did not systematically investigate if the students experienced some negative effects from the mindfulness training. A literature review from 2008 concluded that no negative effects from mindfulness-based interventions have been documented [<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, research of face-to-face treatment suggests that 5% to 10% of patients experience negative effects in terms of deterioration, and other types of negative effects have been proposed to exist as well [<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Third, there is a risk that the method for selecting students for interviews brought bias to the results. However, some of the first students who were asked to participate in an interview did not have time for it immediately and others who finished the program later volunteered for an interview, which led to a more mixed group of interviewees. Another concern regarding bias was that one of the study coordinators interviewed the participants, potentially influencing their responses. We consider the risk of socially desirable replies to be highest concerning the issue of support from study coordinators but to be smaller regarding topics related to technique, information, instructions, and exercises, as these issues are not closely connected to the personality and skills of the coordinator. Fourth, the study was carried out among students, which limits the generalizability of the findings to other groups. Students are perhaps relatively accustomed to Web technology and may have found the program easier to navigate than for older people, for example. In addition, women were largely overrepresented in the study, especially in the investigation of usability and acceptability, which limits the generalizability of our findings to men. Another issue that limits the generalizability of the results lies in the fact that the participants received reimbursement for their participation. It is possible that the expectations regarding the program and perceived improvements of well-being would have been different without a reimbursement.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings support the usability and acceptability of a self-administered Internet-based mindfulness training program for several participants. The program showed potential for increasing psychological well-being. However, additional modification to the target group might be needed to increase retention and compliance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The research was supported by the Swedish National
