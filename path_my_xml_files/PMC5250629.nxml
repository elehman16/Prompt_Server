Increased dentin permeability due to removal of smear layer interferes with infiltration of resin monomer and leads to its dilution and consequently increased sensitivity of the restored tooth [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In order to decrease the exit of dentinal fluid from the etched surface during the bonding process, Pashley et al, [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] suggested the application of oxalate desensitizer agents on the acid-etched surface prior to adhesive application. It is assumed that decreasing the calcium ions on the dentin surface leads to greater diffusion of oxalate ions into the dentinal tubules. The formed calcium oxalate crystals seal the dentinal tubules and decrease the permeability of dentin without compromising the bonding process [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Simultaneous usage of several formulations of desensitizer agents and different adhesives has been investigated [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Yiu et al, [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed that combination of desensitizer with E&#x00026;R adhesives, which had relatively high pH and no fluoride did not affect the quality of bond. However, application of fluoride-containing E&#x00026;R adhesives with low acidity interfered with the bonding procedure due to formation of spherical globules on the surface of dentin, which interfered with the hybridization process of demineralized dentin. In another study, Tay et al, [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] concluded that poor bond of E&#x00026;R adhesives to dentin treated with oxalate was a result of interference caused by acid-resistant oxalate crystals. They believed that in order to achieve efficient sealing of dentinal tubules and bond to dentin, calcium removal by acid should take place before application of desensitizer agent. Moreover, tooth hyper-sensitivity following composite restorations results from increased microleakage or marginal permeability to fluids, bacteria and their enzymes. This is due to the formation of micro-gaps at the restoration-dentin interface resulting from adhesive failure [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Shafiei et al, [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] observed that application of oxalate after acid etching may increase microleakage of dentin margins when applying low pH (E&#x00026;R) adhesives, but it had no effect on microleakage of adhesives with neutral pH. Another study showed that application of BisBlock (BB) resulted in higher microleakage at the dentin margins compared to other surface pretreatments [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In addition, solubility of oxalate is affected by pH since the anions are the basis of weak acids [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Yousry [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] suggested that some of the oxalate desensitizing agents might need an extra etching process in order for the substrate to have better bonding ability. It was shown that after re-etching, oxalate crystals in dentinal tubules were fewer and smaller in size as revealed by scanning electron microscopic examination [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, this concept has not been further investigated to decrease microleakage of dentinal cavity walls.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different dentin re-etching time periods (five or 10 seconds) following oxalate treatment on microleakage of composite restorations.</p><p>The null hypothesis was that re-etching of dentin treated with oxalate desensitizer agent for five or 10 seconds would not decrease the microleakage at the dentinal margin of composite restorations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixty-four newly extracted, caries-free, sound human third molars without any cracks were collected and stored in normal saline for one month. The teeth were stored for one week in 0.5% chloramine T solution at 4&#x000b0;C for disinfection. Standard class V cavities (4mm long, 2mm high, 2mm deep) were prepared on the buccal surface of each tooth, with occlusal margins 1mm above the cementoenamel junction and gingival margins 1mm below it, using a straight diamond bar (# 878/2d; Teeskavan, Tehran, Iran) with a high speed headpiece under constant air-water spray. After five preparations, the diamond bur was replaced with a new one. Enamel cavosurface line angles were not beveled. Adper Single Bond 2 (3M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) was used as an E&#x00026;R adhesive and BB (Bisco Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA) as a desensitizer agent according to their manufacturers&#x02019; instructions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1:</label><caption><p>Materials used in this study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Statistically significant (P&#x0003c;0.05)</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study assessed the marginal microleakage of oxalate desensitized dentin after re-etching. Based on the results of the present study, the group with 10 seconds of dentin re-etching showed a significant increase in microleakage compared to the control group. Thus, the null hypothesis was not accepted. The results also showed significantly more microleakage in BB+5E+SB and BB+10E+SB groups compared to BB+SB group. In the present study, dye penetration method was used because it allows gross evaluation of the quality of the interface. The significant role of hybridization in marginal leakage and bond strength has been previously reported [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Any interference with formation of hybrid layer has an adverse effect on marginal leakage [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, application of BB removes calcium from the surface and allows the oxalate crystals to form deep in dentinal tubules [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Oxalate desensitizing agents interact with calcium ions in dentin and dentinal fluid, and form insoluble calcium oxalate ions [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Various forms of crystals including calcium oxalate monohydrate, dehydrate and trihydrate in hexagonal, rhomboid and quadrangular shapes are formed. It has been reported that spherical oxalate crystals are found at a pH of 8, while hexagonal ones are found at a pH of 4 [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, precipitation of oxalate crystals in various sizes depends on the density of the active material and its acidity [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Yiu et al, [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported that oxalate desensitizing agents had no negative effect on bond quality of Single Bond (3M ESPE) and One Step (Bisco Inc.). However, they reported that adhesives with low pH and high concentration of fluoride were incompatible with oxalate agents since spherical crystals were formed [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These crystals blocked open tubules in cervical dentin [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. According to the results of the current study, no significant difference was found among the four study groups regarding microleakage at the enamel margins. In dentin, however, the results were different. No significant difference in microleakage was observed between the control and BB+SB groups. This was in agreement with the results of Shafiei et al [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Also, BB+SB group showed the least microleakage among the study groups. Tay et al, [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] suggested to etch the dentin before application of oxalate desensitizers, because it was previously observed that the adhesive systems were unable to bond effectively to dentin treated with oxalate since calcium oxalate crystals cover the surface of the dentin and the orifice of the tubules. This acid-resistant layer can make etching ineffective and interfere with the hybrid layer [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Consequently, a gap is created between oxalate-treated dentin and the restoration [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The initial etching of dentin removes calcium ions from superficial dentin and results in formation of calcium oxalate crystals that seal the dentinal tubules in subsurface layers. Thus, this process does not interfere with hybrid layer and therefore does not affect the dentin bond strength [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. On the other hand, De Andrade e Silva et al, [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] showed that after one-year storage period, the decrease in bond strength of SB+BB was lower than that of the control group. However, this decrease in bond strength was observed after moderate to long-term water storage; thus, it can be due to the effect of water sorption causing resin swelling and subsequently decreased inter-polymer frictional forces and weakened mechanical properties [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hydrophilic resins such as Single Bond are highly susceptible to water sorption, and their internal strength is weakened by plasticization and hydrolytic degeneration [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It has been proposed that presence of calcium oxalate relatively blocks movement of fluid in dentinal tubules. Reduction in water content induced by osmotic phenomenon during bonding facilitates evaporation of the solvent and decreases the amount of water locked in the adhesive. It also decreases the hydrophilic degradation of adhesive induced by water sorption over time [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This may explain the results of the present study especially because this result was obtained after 10,000 thermal cycles. Moreover, Yiu et al, [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported that the solubility of calcium oxalate depended on pH, since the anion is the conjugate of a weak acid. According to Le Ch&#x000e2;telier&#x02019;s principle, the higher the exposure of calcium oxalate to H

, the greater the decomposition of crystals to oxalate and calcium ions in order to maintain this balance [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the other hand, Yousry [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] observed smaller and fewer oxalate crystals in dentinal tubules under a scanning electron microscope after re-etching of dentin for 15 seconds due to increased solubility of calcium oxalate. They showed that oxalate crystals were not removed completely from the dentin surface after re-etching of dentin for 15 seconds and the bond strength was compromised in their study. It has been proposed that these ions, especially oxalate ions are not completely removed by rinsing, and they interfere with the process of hybrid layer formation [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, further etching might accelerate hydrolytic degradation due to insufficient infiltration of resin at the resin-dentin bond, and probably activate matrix metalloproteinases [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. According to the results of the present study, while the microleakage in BB+10E+SB group was significantly more than that in the control group, this was not the case in BB+5E+SB group. In addition, according to observations by Yousry [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], this might result from longer etching and greater surface roughness in BB+10E+SB group compared to BB+5E+SB group. It seems that successful combination of desensitizers and adhesives depends on the type of E&#x00026;R adhesive used [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. According to the results, it seems that use of Single Bond and BB simultaneously does not affect the quality of adhesive-dentin bond. It even led to better results than the control group after 10,000 thermal cycles in our study. On the contrary, re-etching of dentin treated with oxalate cannot be suggested either for five or 10 seconds. Further studies on this topic are encouraged especially on bond strength, scanning electron microscopic examination of the surface, and long-term results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Under the conditions of this study, re-etching of dentin after application of BB oxalate desensitizer agent for five or 10 seconds increased microleakage at the dentinal margins of composite restorations.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1-</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
