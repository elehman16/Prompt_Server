Less than 50% of randomized trials have been estimated to meet their recruitment targets <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Low rates of recruitment have implications not only for the internal and external validity of the trial but also financial and ethical consequences, delaying the introduction of effective treatments. RCTs involving surgical interventions have particular challenges, which have been linked to surgeons' lack of familiarity with RCT methodology and appreciation of the need for them <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Consequently, up to one in three surgical RCTs close prematurely or findings from completed ones are not published <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Despite research over a number of years to understand the barriers to trial recruitment <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and interventions designed to address them <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, recruitment difficulties are poorly understood and still persist.</p><p id="p0050">Clinician-related factors have been cited as one of the main reasons for low rates of recruitment in RCTs across different care settings <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Even though nurses have taken on an increasing role in RCT recruitment in the UK in recent years, this is often without much formal training beyond the required Good Clinical Practice training that offers broad ethical guidance on clinical trial conduct. A systematic review of the recruitment activity of clinicians across a variety of RCTs highlighted the need for training for recruiters <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The authors concluded that understanding and communicating RCT methods were a priority for future recruiter directed interventions to improve recruitment. Findings from a survey and workshop of UK Clinical Research Collaboration registered Clinical Trials Unit directors confirmed these findings <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. They considered methods for improving recruitment, and in particular training for site staff, as the highest priority for RCT methodology research. Despite these recommendations, robust research into the development and evaluation of recruiter training programs designed to address recruiter needs is limited. A recent systematic review of training interventions for recruiters to RCTs found evidence of improvements in recruiters' self-confidence in communicating with patients about RCTs following training <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, recruiters still struggled with the amount, clarity, and completeness of information to provide to patients and had difficulty with explaining key RCT concepts such as randomization. The authors concluded that more work is required to address these identified training needs.</p><p id="p0055">Previous RCT recruiter training programs have tended to focus on communication of key issues (what to convey and how to convey it) <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, but the issues are not always that obvious. The QuinteT (Qualitative research integrated within Trials) research team has developed a recruitment intervention (QuinteT Recruitment Intervention [QRI]) which has been embedded in RCTs to understand and address recruitment difficulties <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This has advanced our understanding of the intricacies of the recruitment process revealing difficulties beyond communication that relate to emotional and intellectual challenges with approaching and recruiting patients <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The research confirms conclusions from previous studies that RCT recruiters could benefit from support, especially in relation to emotional aspects of recruitment work <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. It also highlights the need for training programs to raise awareness of how recruiters' views and discomfort can contribute to recruitment difficulties and for training to be tailored to meet the differing needs of doctors and nurses. Findings from this, and related research <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, have been&#x000a0;developed into training materials to improve the practice of frontline and future RCT recruiters.

RCTs that were known or anticipated to have recruitment difficulties were primarily targeted. The chief investigator of these trials (or in a few cases the trial manager) invited and encouraged recruiters to attend. Workshops were also advertised through the Royal College of Surgeons, the Medical Research Council's Network of Hubs for Trial Methodology Research, and the University of Bristol's Surgical Trials Centre.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Workshop development and delivery</title><p id="p0080">Three 1-day workshops lasting 5&#x000a0;hours each were held between March and May 2015 and one in May 2016. The workshops were broadly similar, comprising interactive presentations, group exercises, and discussion based around key recruiter challenges for the different health professionals. The aims of the training were to: (1) share skills and evidence-based knowledge, (2) promote awareness and tackling of key recruitment challenges, and (3) enhance self-confidence in recruiting patients to RCTs.</p><sec id="sec2.2.1"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Content</title><p id="p0085"><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref> shows the content of the workshops. The material was empirically based, addressing the clear obstacles and hidden challenges of recruitment identified from a synthesis of QRI studies embedded within six pragmatic RCTs <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and supplemented with findings from related studies <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, across a range of clinical settings. The same topics were covered in each workshop but to varying degrees depending on whether it was delivered to nurses or surgeons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). Verbatim quotes from audio recordings of RCT recruitment discussions were used extensively to demonstrate what other recruiters had said in relation to the key topics and to show the impact that this had on patients' decision-making. Discussion of issues typically followed in small or large groups. Participants were given a one-page summary sheet of key learning points at the end of training.

The training was delivered through a mixture of informal slide presentations that encouraged interaction; role-play, one-to-one, and small group discussion with other course participants; and whole group discussion. With the exception of the first workshop (which was given primarily by an academic professor), workshops were delivered by a mixture of academic researchers, an academic surgeon, a research nurse, and a statistician/trialist. All had an extensive understanding of recruitment difficulties and previous recruiter training experience, and in two cases, direct experience of RCT recruitment.</p><p id="p0095">Although the content and delivery of the surgeon workshops was essentially the same, we took into account feedback from attendees. The value of the interactive discussions was reported so more time was devoted to this in subsequent workshops. As we were continuing our research into understanding recruitment barriers in specific RCTs alongside this training, we also updated a few quotes highlighting discomfort with recruitment in later workshops.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Data collection</title><p id="p0100">Questionnaires were given to workshop attendees at three time points: immediately prior to, immediately after, and at 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;months posttraining. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> shows the data collected at the different time points.

Although participants in the final surgeon workshop were allocated a study ID, data were analyzed as they were for the previous workshops, that is, comparison of group mean scores before and after training. We initially analyzed self-confidence data from the three surgeon workshops individually. Although there were some differences across groups in their baseline scores which may indicate a group effect, the score changes after training were consistently in the same direction and the confidence intervals (CIs) overlap each other. This gave us confidence in the robustness of the findings so we have presented collated findings from all three surgeon workshops for more precise estimates. Free text was analyzed to illustrate and elaborate on the numerical findings using content analysis to systematically categorize and describe the data <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Comments were read several times to get an overall sense of what was said and to create general categories which were then applied to the text. These categories were then further scrutinized to create subcategories, bearing in mind the question from which the comments came from.

All participants (with two exceptions) completed a questionnaire prior to training, all except one completed one immediately after training, and 72% (48/67) of surgeons and 81% (26/32) of nurses completed a questionnaire at 1- to 3-month follow-up. Around two-thirds of participants provided at least one free-text comment at one time point. Surgeons were involved with (or in a few cases soon to be involved with) over 40 different RCTs evaluating a surgical intervention, 35 for the nurses. The majority of attendees were actively recruiting to at least one RCT that the University of Bristol was involved with. Key recruiters from these trials were present. Those who attended the surgeon workshops were predominately male (73%) aged 30&#x02013;39, and those at the nurse workshop were primarily female (87%) aged 40&#x02013;49&#x000a0;years (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). Just over half of the surgeons were consultants. The nurse attendees were more likely to have had some experience of recruiting patients into RCTs than the surgeons (97% of nurses had previous recruitment experience compared with 80% of surgeons), with a fifth of nurses having over 5-year experience (compared with 16% of surgeons) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Impact of training on self-confidence</title><sec id="sec3.2.1"><label>3.2.1</label><title>Self-confidence prior to training</title><p id="p0125">Levels of self-confidence in discussing various aspects of RCT recruitment before training were similar between surgeons and nurses and tended to hover just over midway between not at all confident (0) and very confident (10) (range for surgeons 5.1&#x02013;6.5; range for nurses 5.4&#x02013;6.9) (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>).

Both nurses and surgeons with minimal experience of recruitment expressed unease discussing RCTs with patients if it compared surgery with no surgery/treatment. Also, surgeons in particular were concerned with ensuring truly informed consent and dealing with patients' preconceived beliefs and fears about medical research.

The aim of the training was to increase self-confidence in discussing RCTs with potential participants and improve self-assessed recruitment practice. Content focused on raising awareness and encouraging discussion of clear obstacles and hidden emotional and intellectual challenges to recruitment. Following the QuinteT RCT Recruitment Training, surgeons and nurses reported increased self-confidence in discussing RCTs with patients, a raised awareness of hidden challenges and improvements in how they felt they conveyed key RCT concepts and responded to treatment preferences. This study, therefore, supports the use of training workshops for recruiters to equip and educate them in dealing with recruitment into RCTs in surgery. It has implications for the development and implementation of future training for RCT recruiters.</p><p id="p0175">Despite the literature highlighting training needs for health professionals in recruiting patients to RCTs <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, there have been relatively few initiatives to address this. Prior interventions have tended to focus on issues around interaction and communication with patients and structuring RCT discussions in line with agreed ethical practice <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Recruitment difficulties are often perceived to arise from practical, logistical, and patient-related issues but may also reflect recruiters' underlying discomforts associated with their dual clinical and research roles <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This discomfort is evident among recruiters demonstrating concern with &#x0201c;bothering&#x0201d; patients <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and unease with going against their clinical judgment in recruiting them to an RCT <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. It is also evident in delivering interventions <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and closing down an RCT <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. These emotional challenges can result in eligible patients not being approached or being steered toward a particular treatment without the opportunity to fully discuss and consider RCT participation. Raising recruiters' awareness of these issues, while demonstrating the impact they can (often unknowingly) have on recruitment and offering suggestions to minimize them, forms the unique basis of the QuinteT RCT Recruitment Training.</p><p id="p0180">A comparison of recruiter training programs to identify what aspects of training are most effective at optimizing recruitment is hampered by variation in the content, delivery, and format of training, in addition to varying measures of effectiveness <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. A recent systematic review identified 17 studies of varying quality that evaluated training programs for RCT recruiters <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Training mostly included a mix of health professionals covering general aspects of RCTs (such as core principles of RCTs and discussing key concepts with patients) as well as trial-specific issues. Training programs increased recruiter confidence in communicating key information to patients in early <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and later phased cancer RCTs <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In these studies, recruiter-perceived confidence was measured before and after training using a tool that was adapted for the present study. Our findings of increased recruiter confidence following training confirm those from these studies.</p><p id="p0185">Participants in the present study most valued training on conveying equipoise, explaining randomization and exploring treatment preferences&#x02014;aspects that were attributed to the increased confidence scores and impact on practice. We know from previous research that recruiters can struggle with explaining randomization in a way that patients readily understand <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Communicating clinical equipoise has also been shown to be particularly challenging for recruiters <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Despite intentions to set aside personal treatment biases and to present treatments in a neutral and balanced way, recruiters can override or compromise clinical equipoise in patient encounters <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Patients' decisions around RCT participation can be guided by treatment biases conveyed (often subtly) by the recruiting clinician <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. This emphasizes the importance of encouraging recruiters to reflect on personal biases and raise awareness of how and in what ways these can be transmitted to patients at a cost to recruitment. Prejudiced views of recruiters on trial interventions have been cited as a key reason for recruitment failure in discontinued RCTs <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Patient treatment preferences pose a further difficulty for recruiting staff. There is an assumption that preferences act as a barrier to recruitment <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and that &#x0201c;challenging&#x0201d; them borders on coercion <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, exploring treatment preferences can be justified on the basis of gauging patients' level of understanding of the study treatments to ensure that their decision whether to participate or not is well-informed. Recruiters can be trained to elicit and address preferences during RCT recruitment consultations, and this can lead to an increase in the numbers of patients who then consider and accept participation <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Workshop attendees openly expressed how they were now more comfortable exploring patients' treatment preferences rather than accepting an initial preference at face value.</p><p id="p0190">The impact of training in terms of self-confidence in recruiting patients to RCTs appeared greater on the whole for nurses than surgeons, although the study was not powered to detect differences across the different health professionals. This finding may have been because surgeons had less opportunity than nurses to put this training into practice in the 3-month follow-up period. Implementing new skills and adapting existing ones are likely to require practice. As nurses had more RCT experience at the outset than surgeons, it is also possible that training reaffirmed nurses' confidence in recruiting. Some nurses highlighted this posttraining. A further observation was that surgeons' baseline self-confidence scores regarding patients who are most critical and suspicious of research were relatively low before training. This was repaired to some extent by the training. A key aspect of the training was managing patients' treatment preferences, which can arise from being suspicious of RCTs <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. It seems that the training may have been tapping into a previously unmet need. However, both observations require further exploration in a future, larger evaluation powered to detect differences across groups and in recruitment rates.</p><p id="p0195">A key feature of our training intervention is the separate training of doctors and nurses. Previous research has demonstrated that support and training needs for doctors and nurses overlap, but doctors need support to ensure they are committed to the RCT design and comfortable with the eligibility criteria and interventions options, whereas nurses need support in relation to perceived role conflicts and training on approaching eligible patients <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Nurses have taken on an increasing role in RCT recruitment in recent years, but research has highlighted a perceived conflict between their roles in caring for patients and recruiting them to an RCT <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This conflict has resulted in patients missing the opportunity to consider participation. Similarly, doctors have shown difficulty in reconciling their research with clinical practice roles, admitting that when faced with a particular patient or those with specific clinical characteristics, they become more uncomfortable in inviting them on the RCT <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Surgery is a particular branch of medical science in which the conduct of RCTs is often considered too challenging to undertake for practical and cultural reasons <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Surgeons often have less exposure to conducting RCTs than other clinical colleagues (e.g., oncologists). As a result, they tend to have less familiarity with and understanding of this methodology <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and seem to struggle more with setting aside their personal treatment biases and recruiting patients to RCTs <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The findings in the present study of enhanced self-confidence and perceived impact on practice following training of surgeons become even more salient when considered in this context. These issues justify training health professionals separately to enable focus on their specific training needs, but recognizing the value that training different health professionals together can also bring <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p id="p0200">Our workshop materials were designed with reference to health care professional training initiatives delivered by other groups <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and developed from empirical research that has identified recruitment challenges <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and techniques that appear to have been effective in improving recruitment through QRIs <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The training is essentially a behavior change intervention defined as a &#x0201c;coordinated set of activities designed to change specified behavior patterns&#x0201d; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>&#x02014;in this case health professionals' RCT recruitment practice. The behavior change techniques that were addressed in the intervention include &#x0201c;feedback and monitoring,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;shaping knowledge,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;natural consequences,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;comparison of behavior&#x0201d; within the behavior change technique taxonomy by Michie et&#x000a0;al <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The general attributes of our training are supported by Michie et&#x000a0;al.'s behavior change wheel (BCW) which helps to select the intervention function most likely to be effective in changing a particular target behavior <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Based on our prior empirical work <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, targeting the &#x0201c;psychological capability&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;reflective motivation&#x0201d; determinants of behavior had the greatest potential to result in behavior change. According to the BCW, the most appropriate interventions for addressing these determinants are &#x0201c;training&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;education,&#x0201d; which fits with our type of intervention. Furthermore, based on a theory-led overview of published systematic reviews of professional behavior change interventions, educational meetings and &#x0201c;educational outreach visits&#x0201d; (where a skilled trainer/facilitator imparts knowledge) are more likely to successfully change professional behavior than other types of interventions <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. It will be important to further consider our training intervention in the context of theory, with a view to identifying the active ingredients to make it more effective.</p><p id="p0205">The main limitation of the study is that we were unable to assess the impact of training on actual practice in terms of recruiting patients and relied instead on self-assessed impact. While this may not be an objective reflection of impact, participants were consistent in their responses&#x02014;perceiving immediately after training that it was likely to have some impact on how they discussed RCTs with patients and then reporting it as having had an impact at up to 3-month follow-up. Moreover, free-text responses were similar from the different health professionals and highlighted the key training areas&#x02014;consideration of conveying equipoise, explaining randomization, and exploring treatment preferences. Although response rates at 1- to 3-month follow-up were high (72% for surgeons and 81% for nurses), it is possible that those who did not reply did not experience an impact of training on their recruitment practice or did not recruit patients in this time period. We acknowledge that there may be a degree of selection bias in terms of the types of people who agreed to the training, but personal invites from the chief investigator or trial manager resulted in each RCT having their key recruiters attend. As questionnaires from the majority of attendees were anonymous, we were unable to account for paired responses, which if analyzed using an appropriate regression model might have increased the reliability of the findings. It also meant that we were unable to undertake stratified analysis or explore a group effect. With regard to the latter point, the direction of change of self-confidence scores after training compared with before is consistent for both surgeons and nurses and mirrors the findings from other studies <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p id="p0210">A further limitation is that we developed and evaluated our own training intervention. Findings are preliminary, as training was delivered in the relatively early stages of development, but they are promising and in line with other similar studies <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The intervention would need more robust testing by others when it is fully developed, with a clinically relevant effect specified and sample size calculation. Most of the participants invited to the training workshops were recruiting to RCTs that the trainers were coapplicants on or were aware of as having/likely to have recruitment difficulties (due, for example, to diverse treatments). Some of them had already had exposure to similar training from the QuinteT team within their individual RCT. This may have diluted findings so it may be possible that the observed effects could have been greater if the recruiters had not had prior exposure to similar training material. The strength of this work is the focus on raising awareness of issues which are often hidden to recruiters and yet can unknowingly impact on recruitment. Using evidence from real RCTs, we were able to not only highlight the key issues that similar recruiting health professionals have, but also demonstrate the impact of this on the patients' decision-making process around recruitment to RCTs. The full impact from this kind of awareness and self-reflection may take longer to be seen in practice than the follow-up period in this study. This suggests that impact may still be observed further on in time, although continued training may be required to ensure effects do not dissipate over time.</p><p id="p0215">The training provided support to those working on a number of diverse RCTs within the field of surgery, as opposed to focusing on the issues inherent within a particular trial. Working within individual RCTs to identify and address specific issues may lead to a greater impact. The QRI, a two-staged process implemented in RCTs deemed difficult for recruitment or those experiencing difficulties, explores where the key difficulties in the trial might be focused. Strategies are then employed to address them (largely involving feedback and training akin to that given within the present study) <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. There seems to be a place for both broad RCT recruitment training covering common issues and training within an individual trial covering trial-specific issues that could together enhance informed consent and recruitment in RCTs.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0220">A 1-day training workshop for health professionals that focuses on the emotional and intellectual challenges of recruiting patients to RCTs looks promising in increasing confidence with recruitment, raising awareness of hidden challenges and impacting positively on self-assessed recruitment practice. Although the training intervention evaluated in this study was in the relatively early stages of development, findings are encouraging. The intervention will continue to be developed, made more available, and be evaluated in relation to informed consent and recruitment rates.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Treweek</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pitkethly</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kjeldstr&#x000f8;m</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Johansen</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Strategies to improve recruitment to randomized controlled trials</article-title><source>Cochrane Database Syst Rev</source><year>2010</year><fpage>MR000013</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Potter</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mills</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cawthorn</surname><given-names>S.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Donovan</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Blazeby</surname><given-names>J.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Time to be BRAVE: is educating surgeons the key to unlocking the potential of randomized clinical trials in surgery?
