enhance the overall health of the Korean people. The campaign increased cigarette cost and
turned public places such as restaurants, bars, and coffee shops into non-smoking area. As a
result of the stop-smoking campaign, the adult smoking rate decreased from 43.1% in 2014 to
39.9% in 2015 indicating the approach of a smoking rate below 30%, which would be a first in
the history of official smoking statistics<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the smoking rate has not decreased as markedly in college
students. The smoking rate among college students in Korea is 23.2%, well above the average
reported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of 20.7%<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. This discrepancy may be due to a change in
college students once they reach the age at which they can buy cigarettes legally.</p><p>Cigarettes contain over 5,000 types of toxic or carcinogenic compounds including carbon
monoxide (CO), nicotine, and tar. CO has a high capacity to chemically combine with
hemoglobin (Hb), thereby resulting in an elevation of the carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level
thereby impairing the oxygen transportation activity of blood and resulting in
polycythemia<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, CO decreases
the oxygen level in blood resulting in damage to blood vessels and it has been associated
with an increase in blood cholesterol, atherosclerosis, lung cancer, and colorectal
cancer<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Typically, smokers have lower values for various bronchial
resiliency indicators including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced volume for 1 second
(FEV1), and forced expiratory flow (FEF) than those of non-smokers<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the amount smoked is positively related to the
body mass index (BMI) and abdominal obesity<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, smokers&#x02019; abdominal circumference
and abdominal obesity measures tend to be greater than those of non-smokers<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. As
college students have the highest smoking rate among all age groups<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, this study aimed
to analyze the effect of complex training on exhalation CO level, cardiorespiratory
function, and body mass in college students who were stopping smoking.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 40 male college students voluntarily participated in this study. All subjects
had been smoking for more than 1&#x02005;year. Students diagnosed with a respiratory ailment by a
doctor or who previously participated in a stop-smoking program were excluded from the
study. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group (N=20;
age=20.2 &#x000b1; 0.3 yrs; height=176.5 &#x000b1; 2.7&#x02005;cm; weight=78.4 &#x000b1; 2.6&#x02005;kg) and the control group
(N=20; age=20.9 &#x000b1; 0.3 yrs; height=175.7 &#x000b1; 1.7&#x02005;cm; weight=79.2 &#x000b1; 2.0&#x02005;kg). All subjects had a
12 week of nonsmoking period from the beginning of the experiment. The experimental group
underwent complex training while the control group did not participate in such training. All
subjects were informed of the content and purpose of the experiment and all provided written
informed consent (Mokwon University) before participating in the study.</p><p>Subjects&#x02019; exhalation CO level, maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), maximum heart rate (HRmax),
maximum ventilation (VEmax), body fat content (%), and skeletal muscle mass were measured at
the start and end of the study. Exhalation CO level was measured to the nearest parts per
million (ppm) as previously reported<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> by
using a CO measuring instrument (Micro Co., Rochester, Kent, England). For reference, CO
levels were categorized into five stages: stage 1 (non-smoker, 0&#x02013;6&#x02005;ppm), stage 2 (risky,
7&#x02013;10&#x02005;ppm), stage 3 (smoker, 11&#x02013;15&#x02005;ppm), stage 4 (habitual smoker, 16&#x02013;25&#x02005;ppm), and stage 5
(addictive smoker, 26&#x02013;35&#x02005;ppm) as previously described<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercise tolerance was estimated by using the Bruce protocol. Briefly, the protocol begins
with an initial treadmill speed of 1.7 miles per hour (mph), which is then increased by 0.8
mph every 3&#x02005;min; in addition, the initial gradient of 10% is increased by 2% every 3&#x02005;min.
Subject&#x02019;s VO2max, HRmax, and VEmax were estimated by using a breath-by-breath respiration
analysis gas analyzer assembly (Quark b2; Cosmed, Rome, Italy), which was operated in peak
mode.</p><p>Body composition determined from body fat content (%) and skeletal muscle mass (kg) values
was estimated by using bioelectrical impedance analysis equipment (InBody J20, Bio-Space,
Seoul, Korea).</p><p>The complex training program included participation in physical exercise for 30&#x02005;min five
times a week for 12 weeks at the fitness center of D university. The complex training
program consisted of two parts: aerobic exercise (walking and running) and resistance
exercise (weight training). Aerobic exercise was performed until the subject attained 50&#x02013;70%
of their HRmax. To accurately assess exercise intensity, subject heart rate was monitored
during exercise with a portable recordable HR monitor (Polar Electro, Technogym, Finland).
Weight training was performed until 70% of a subject&#x02019;s one repetition maximum (1RM) was
attained, with the 1RM values calculated by using Brzycki&#x02019;s equation<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

implementing new policies, such as raising the cost of cigarettes and placing graphic health
warnings on cigarette packages<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite
these policies, the smoking rate of college students, in particular, has not been decreasing
as much as other groups<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are many health concerns related to smoking. One, in
particular, is CO, which has a high affinity to chemically combine with Hb, thereby
impairing the oxygen transportation capacity of smokers&#x02019; blood, as well as affecting
cardiorespiratory function and blood pressure<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Smokers tend to have approximately 10% lower oxygen transportation
capacity than non-smokers<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
the associated higher level of carboxyhemoglobin increases the possibility developing
coronary artery disease, cerebral infarction, chronic obstructive lung disease, and lung
cancer<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. On that basis, this study aimed to analyze the effects of
participation in complex training on CO, cardiorespiratory function, and body mass among
college students who were at the initial stage of stopping smoking. The results of this
study show that exhalation CO levels decreased in both the experiment and control groups.
Notably, the exhalation CO level of the experiment group significantly decreased from stage
4 (habitual smoker, CO level 16&#x02013;25&#x02005;ppm) to stage 1 (non-smoker, CO level 0&#x02013;6&#x02005;ppm). The
control group also had a decreased exhalation CO level; however, the experimental group had
a greater CO decrease. Complex training assisted in achieving this result by increasing
blood circulation, transport of oxygen, heartbeat, respiration volume, pulmonary
circulation, and perspiration. In addition, the experimental group showed significant
increases in VO2max, HRmax, and VEmax indicating multiple effects of the complex training
program. In contrast, the control group did not show such increases. The results of this
study are consistent with those in previous studies. Rode and Shephard<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> examined the effect of smoking and abstinence from
cigarette on the oxygen cost associated with hyperventilation. The hyperventilation oxygen
cost was measured twice, immediately following smoking and after one day of abstinence from
cigarettes<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. After abstinence, the
hyperventilation oxygen cost was 13&#x02013;79% lower than that before abstinence<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Byun<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that 8 weeks of a combined exercise training program
significantly improved VO2max, body composition, and, in particular, body fat content among
current smokers. Nam and Kang<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> analyzed
changes in CO level in two groups over a 12 week period. They<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> found that those abstaining from cigarettes and exercising had a
greater decrease of CO level than those abstaining from cigarettes but not exercising.</p><p>The results of the present study also showed changes in body fat (%), waist: hip ratio, and
skeletal muscle mass (kg). The body fat content (%) decreased and skeletal muscle mass (kg)
increased only in the experiment group. These results are consistent with those in previous
studies<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Those studies<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that complex physical exercise
increases basal metabolism by developing skeletal muscles and such exercise also reduces
obesity, diabetes, and many other chronic diseases. In addition, development of skeletal
muscles reflects associated increases in mitochondria, oxidative enzymes, muscle
capillaries, and muscle blood flow rate<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In conclusion, a complex physical
exercise program would be an effective way to support a stop-smoking program as it can
quickly eliminate CO from the body and improve cardiorespiratory functions and body mass.
Therefore, this study provided practical data establishing the effective exercise program
for people who are stopping smoking and want to improve their health (e.g.,
cardiorespiratory function, and body mass). However, this study only focused on male college
students. Thus, future study needs to include diverse personal characteristics, such as age
and gender.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">Korea Ministry of Health and
