Teriparatide, a recombinant parathyroid hormone (PTH), stimulates osteoblasts and has been suggested to improve cancellous bone healing in humans. This might also be relevant for prosthesis fixation. We used radiostereometric analysis (RSA) to investigate whether teriparatide influences prosthesis fixation. Early migration as measured by RSA can predict future loosening.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>In a randomized controlled trial with blind evaluation, 50 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were allocated to a teriparatide treatment group (Forsteo, 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;g daily for 2 months postoperatively) or to an untreated control group. RSA was performed postoperatively and at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. The primary effect variable was maximal total point motion (MTPM) from 12 to 24 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Median maximal total point motion from 12 to 24 months was similar in the 2 groups (teriparatide: 0.14&#x02009;mm, 10% and 90% percentiles: 0.08 and 0.24; control: 0.13&#x02009;mm, 10% and 90% percentiles: 0.09 and 0.21). [Authors: this is perhaps better than using "10th" and "90th", which looks ugly in print./language editor] The 95% confidence interval for the difference between group means was &#x02212;0.03 to 0.04&#x02009;mm, indicating that no difference occurred.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>We found no effect of teriparatide on migration in total knee replacement. Other trials using the same dosing have suggested a positive effect of teriparatide on human cancellous fracture healing. Thus, the lack of effect on migration may have been due to something other than the dose. In a similar study in this issue of <italic>Acta Orthopaedica</italic>, we found that migration could be reduced with denosumab (Ledin et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The difference in response between the anabolic substance teriparatide and the antiresorptive denosumab suggests that resorption has a more important role during the postoperative course than any deficit in bone formation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Early stable fixation in total knee replacement (TKR) is important for prevention of late loosening (Ryd et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>, Pijls et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) is performed to estimate fixation by measuring the postoperative migration of the prosthesis. Bisphosphonates, which are most commonly used in treatment of osteoporosis, have been shown to prevent early migration in TKR (Hilding et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, Hilding and Aspenberg <xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and they are associated with a lower risk of revision in epidemiological studies (Teng et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, Namba et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Teriparatide is a recombinant truncated parathyroid hormone (PTH). While bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity, PTH stimulates osteoblasts and acts as an anabolic hormone. In animals, PTH stimulates fracture healing (Andreassen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) and enhances implant fixation (Skripitz et&#x000a0;al. 2001a,b, Gabet et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, Aspenberg et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Teriparatide stimulates bone formation in osteoporosis treatment, and there are reasons to believe that teriparatide can accelerate fracture healing in clinical settings (Aspenberg et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>At insertion of a total knee replacement, the metaphyseal bone is traumatized, which is likely to elicit a fracture healing response of a kind typical of metaphyseal injury (Aspenberg <xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, Bernhardsson et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Since this healing response can be augmented by antiresorptive therapy, we speculated that an anabolic treatment using teriparatide would also augment the process, thereby improving early fixation in total knee replacement and thus reducing the risk of late loosening.</p><p>In this study, we assessed whether teriparatide administered in the postoperative phase can enhance bone healing at the interface between bone and cement after knee replacement surgery. We performed a randomized controlled trial with blind evaluation to study the effects of teriparatide, using migration (by RSA) as the primary effect variable. The specific hypothesis was that migration from 12 to 24 months would be reduced, as measured by maximal total point motion (MTPM). This time period was chosen because it appeared to have the best predictive value in the study by Ryd et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>).</p><sec disp-level="2" id="s0002"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>50 patients (30 women) were included in this 2-center trial. The patients were scheduled for elective cemented primary total knee replacement because of osteoarthritis. 29 of the patients were operated on in Motala and 21 in Oskarshamn, Sweden, and the operations were performed between November 2009 and June 2011. 1 patient (a woman) was excluded because of malignancy diagnosed after surgery. Inclusion criteria were the accepted clinical criteria for elective primary total knee replacement due to primary or secondary osteoarthritis and without severe disease (ASA 1&#x02013;2). Exclusion criteria were rheumatic arthritis, a history of severe heart disease, renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, metabolic bone disease (osteoporosis was not screened for), malignancy, bilateral surgery, previous radiation therapy of the skeleton, or inability to give informed consent.

These were prepared by PA using shuffling of envelopes before numbering them. Randomization was stratified for sex and performed in blocks of 6 (with some blinded exchange between blocks) which randomized half of the patients to receive subcutaneous teriparatide (Forsteo), 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;g daily over 2 months postoperatively, starting on the first postoperative day.

Moreover, the confidence interval for the difference between group means excluded any meaningful differences. This contrasts with the effect of antiresorptive treatment, which has previously been shown to reduce migration in repeated studies with very much the same design as this one. Moreover, in our accompanying paper (Ledin et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), we have shown that another antiresorptive treatment (denosumab) also reduces migration (in the same settings as this study on teriparatide). The difference in response between teriparatide and antiresorptive drugs suggests that resorption plays a more important role during the postoperative course than any deficit in bone formation.</p><p>The effects of teriparatide on fracture healing are debated. There have been several studies suggesting a positive effect of the same dose regimen as we used, on radiological healing of wrist fractures (Aspenberg and Johansson <xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, Aspenberg et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and also on the functional outcome of trochanteric hip fractures (Huang et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, Aspenberg et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, these results are all based on post hoc testing, and should be interpreted with caution (Aspenberg <xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). There has also been 1 study on proximal humeral fractures showing no obvious effect of teriparatide (Johansson <xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Prosthesis fixation has many properties in common with the healing of cancellous bone in metaphyses. Based on human biopsies (Aspenberg and Sandberg <xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and animal experiments (Bernhardsson et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), injured cancellous bone appears to heal by rapid activation of mesenchymal cells present in the bone marrow (Sandberg et&#x000a0;al. in press), and this process responds strongly to PTH in animal models (Skripitz and Aspenberg <xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">2001a</xref>,<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). These notions made us believe that teriparatide would improve implant fixation in humans also.</p><p>Our findings regarding migration have rather limited relevance for weighing the evidence for or against a positive effect of teriparatide on fracture healing. Even though we believe that the response to implantation has similarities to cancellous fracture healing, the lavage and cementation creates an environment rather dissimilar to a fracture. In contrast, uncemented prostheses are dependent on the healing response to trauma to produce ingrowth of bone into pores. It is possible that the anabolic effects of teriparatide would have a positive effect here.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="s0010"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Table 2 is available as supplementary data in the online version of this article <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2017.1300745">http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2017.1300745</ext-link>.</p><p>HL: participation in design, performance of and responsibility for all data collection and analysis, writing of the first draft, and revision and approval of the manuscript.
