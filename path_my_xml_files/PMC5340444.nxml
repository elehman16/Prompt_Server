Burning is a chief cause of mortality worldwide.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Healing is divided into 4 main parts: formation of granulation tissue, collagen deposition, re-epithelialization, and contraction.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> For many years, partial-thickness burns have treated by daily washing and cleaning of the wound, followed by a topical application of the antimicrobial cream. However, the pain suffered and damaged wound healing remain problems to be addressed. Superficial partial-thickness burns often heal in 3 weeks.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> In topical burn therapy, silver sulfadiazine was introduced as the gold standard having antibacterial properties.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> However, it has some disadvantages, including retardation of wound contracture, delayed and incomplete epithelialization, generation of black scars, limited penetration the depth of the wound, hypersensitivity, neutropenia, silver toxicity, the inaccurate assessment of healing progress because of the presence of a layer of the slough, ineffectiveness against some microorganisms, and thrombocytopenia.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Other topical antibiotics such as mafenide acetate and silver nitrate are also associated with side effects such as pain and hypersensitivity at the wound site, delayed wound healing, electrolytic imbalance, and hemoglobinemia.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Currently, silver-foam dressings are being the gold standard used to manage the bio-burden of a wound, with or without a silicone skin interface such as Acticoat and Mepitel.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><p>There are many reports that have confirmed the use of medicinal plants for dressing wounds described by traditional medicine.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup><italic>Centella asiatica</italic> (L.) is a Stoloniferous constant herb, commonly growing in humid areas in several tropical countries. In Asia, it has long been used in traditional medicine in the treatment of different diseases. This plant is commonly found in many parts of the world,<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> including Asia and the Middle East.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> In Iran, it just found in a local wetland at Bandar-Anzali and it is growing and blossoms in April, May, and June.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Extracts and active constituents are found in many herbal drugs and cosmetic preparations worldwide, especially for venous circulation and skin care.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> The main active principles of <italic>C. asiatica</italic> are triterpene glycosides and their respective aglycones.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup><italic>C. asiatica</italic> contains triterpene glycosides such as centellasaponin, alkaloids, volatile and flavonoids compounds, steroids, asiaticoside, sceffoleoside, phenolic acid, and madecassic acid.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Asiaticoside is the most major triterpene glycoside in the water extract and it is transformed in vivo by hydrolysis into asiatic acid, which was shown to be effective in induction of apoptosis in different types of cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> The therapeutic substances in <italic>C. asiatica</italic> are saponin-containing triterpene acids and their sugar esters, of which asiatic acid, madecassic acid, and asiaticosides are considered to be the most important.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> It has been reported that 1% <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extract cream improves wound healing of chronic ulcer in width, length, and depth after 7, 14, and 21 days of use of the product.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Phyto-constituents present in C. asiatica have been found to be responsible for these wound healing properties. Asiaticoside isolated from <italic>C. asiatica</italic> increased hydroxyproline content, tensile strength, collagen content, and epithelialization in a punch wound model.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Further, triterpenes from <italic>C. asiatica</italic> were shown to increase remodeling of the collagen matrix and stimulate glycosaminoglycan synthesis in a rat wound chamber model.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Oral administration of madecassoside isolated from <italic>C. asiatica</italic> herbs promoted burn wound healing in mice through its antioxidative effect, collagen synthesis, and angiogenesis.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> All extracts of <italic>C. asiatica</italic> promote the wound healing in both incisional and burn wounds. Asiatic acid in the ethyl acetate extract is the most active ingredient for healing the wound. The extracts of this plant have antibacterial effects, too.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> The final purpose in burn management is promotion of wound healing and epithelialization as soon as possible to avoid infection and lesser side effects. Given the adverse effects of currently used topical drugs, innovation of novel topical agents that could effectively and safely promote wound healing and relieve the associated pain is desirable.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup></p><p>On the basis of the previously studies that showed promoting healing in animal studies for burn and surgical wounds and antibacterial effects of <italic>C. asiatica</italic>, in this study, we compared the efficacy of Centiderm versus SSD in partial thickness burning patients referred to Velayat Hospital _referral hospital of Guilan province in Northern_ Rasht, Iran.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>Our study population comprised burn victims who were treated in Velayat Burning Hospital at Rasht, Iran. Period of study was from October 2014 to February 2015.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria were partial thickness, burning wound less than 10% of total body surface area (TBSA) and in the limbs, burning event was fewer than 48&#x0200a;hours, no other concurrent injury except burning, general physical and mental health, between 14 and 60 years old.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were the existence of any cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, concurrent endocrine, hepatic or renal disease, pregnancy, history of alcohol or drug abuse, concurrent use of antibiotic.</p><p>A total of 134 patients with second-degree burn wounds on their limbs were referred to Velayat Hospital emergency ward. Seventy-five patients had the eligibility and entered the study, 35 of them in SSD group and 40 of them in Centiderm group. Fifteen patients have excluded the study because of lost follow-up and incomplete data. Thirty patients in both groups were evaluated. One burning specialist physician evaluated the patients at admission and chose and classified them on the basis of inclusion criteria and ruling out the exclusion criteria based on scientific definitions of partial thickness burning wounds.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> Bedside clinical evaluation was used to assess burn wound depth based on the subjective assessment of visual and tactile characteristics of a burn wound, namely wound appearance, capillary blanching and refill, capillary staining, and burn wound sensibility to light touch and pinprick.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> Lund and Browder's chart were used for evaluating TBSA.<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> If the wounds were mixed superficial, deep and full thickness, they were excluded from the study because of not confounding the results.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Interventions</title><p>The intervention group subjected to use topical Centiderm ointment. The control group used silver sulfadiazine 1% cream (routine treatment) on the area of burning wound. Burn wounds were treated once daily in the home after getting information about how to use the drugs. Equal shape and boxes of ointment were used in both groups. Patient compliance was checked at the first visit after inclusion on the basis of jobs and ability to referring to the hospital for follow-up. After enrolling patients in the study, they were given a remembering checklist for using the drugs at home. They brought the remember checklist in follow-up sessions. Also, for checking true use, we called them during the period they used the ointment, and in every visit, they showed the drug boxes to make confidence true using.</p><p>The herbal product was Centiderm ointment that was a derivative of <italic>C. asiatica</italic>. This product is cheaper than SSD. The formulation of ointment was made by pharmacognosist of the pharmacy faculty in Guilan University of Medical Sciences and confirmed by the University and registered and licensed as a drug patent in Iranian Intellectual Property Office (Patents) with the registration number of 86035 and international classification patent of A61K36/00; A61J3/04.<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup></p><p>The fresh leaves of <italic>C. asiatica</italic> were collected in May 2014 from a local wetland at Bandar-Anzali, Iran. The accuracy of plant selection was proved and authenticated by Mr. Asaadi, a senior botanist of the Department of Botany, University of Guilan, with adopting the scientific herbarium information. Fresh leaves of the plant were air-dried at 40&#x000b0;C and ground to powder by mixer. Then, they were subjected to exhaustive extraction using ethanol (96%) and distilled water with the relation of 60:40. The dark green liquid extract was concentrated under rotary evaporator and vacuum. The resulting dried extract was partitioned between butanol and petroleum ether. It made 2 separate portions in which Butanol fraction was concentrated under rotary evaporator and vacuum. Dried butanol fraction was mixed with Vaseline and Glycerin to make the emulsified final based contained about 3% of the final extract which named Centiderm ointment. All chemical ingredients were purchased from Merck Co., Germany. The last formulation was tested physically and chemically to select the most stable and desirable product thermodynamically or physiologically. Samples were sterilized by gamma radiation.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Pharmacokinetic and safety</title><p><italic>C. asiatica</italic> is in World Health Organization (WHO) medicinal plants monographs and its safet and pharmacokinetic is validated there.<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup> It contains several active constituents, of which the most important are the triterpenoid saponins, including asiaticoside, centelloside, madecassoside, and asiatic acid. In addition, it contains other components, including volatile oils, flavonoids, tannins, phytosterols, amino acids, and sugars.<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup> A pharmacokinetic study suggests that the active ingredients in total triterpenoid fraction of <italic>C. asiatica</italic> are well absorbed in human volunteers. After single oral administration of 30 and 60&#x0200a;mg of the extract, maximum plasma levels of asiatic acid were reached at 4.5 and 4.2&#x0200a;hours, respectively. Plasma half-lives were 2.2&#x0200a;hours in the 30-mg dose and 3.4&#x0200a;hours in the 60-mg dose, with no detectable levels of the saponin present 24&#x0200a;hours after single dosing. Seven-day treatment with the herb at the same dosing schedule resulted in higher peak plasma concentrations, longer half-lives, and greater area-under-the curve values,<sup>[<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup> which ensured its external usage safety. Its external use is validated by European Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products. In this committee, reports about <italic>C. asiatica</italic> mentioned that the cream 1% for cutaneous use is authorized in Belgium since 1969 for the treatment of moderate or benign problems in wound formation such as atonic wounds, hypertrophic scars, keloids in active phase, in France, since 1975 to aid in the local treatment for cutaneous ulcerations and since 2000 to aid in the local treatment for granulation phase of wounds, cutaneous ulcers, and cutaneous gangrene. The ointment 1% is used in Greece as a potent wound healing agent (induce collagen biosynthesis).<sup>[<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup></p><p><italic>C. asiatica</italic> is an important medicinal herb that is widely used in traditional medicine. The safety of this plant extracts mentioned in many medical references and clinical trials. Therefore, using this product in our research based on such references is safe.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> We carried out the determination of total triterpenoid content for the product (Centiderm) during the research and findings showed that the total triterpenoid content of this product is constant during the trial. The content of triterpenoids obtained by the aforementioned method was determined according to the study by Lu et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> with a slight modification and then expressed as milligrams ursolic acid equivalent/gram dry weight. Briefly, after a 200-&#x003bc;L sample solution in a 10-mL volumetric flask was heated to evaporation in a water-bath, 1&#x0200a;mL new mixed 5% (W/V) vanillin-acetic solution and 1.8&#x0200a;mL sulfuric acid was added, mixed, and incubated at 70&#x000b0;C for 30&#x0200a;minutes. Then, the mixed solution was cooled and diluted to 10&#x0200a;mL with acetic acid. The absorbance was measured at 573&#x0200a;nm against blank using a spectrophotometer. The blank consisted of all reagents and solvents without sample solution. The content was determined using the standard ursolic acid calibration curve. The calibration equation for ursolic acid was Y&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0725X - 0.0207 (R 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.9991), in which Y was the absorbance value; X was the concentration of ursolic acid (&#x003bc;g/mL). The linear range of ursolic acid was 1 to 10&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL.</p><p>The patients were requested to inform investigators about any adverse events or complaint during the trial. If there were any symptoms, they were checked and recorded at the beginning and at each baseline visit. Also, possible side effects were checked and recorded via telephone call every day and the physician was responsible for continuing or discontinuing the drugs. The adverse effects check list was completed by independent raters.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Objectives &#x00026; outcomes</title><p>We evaluated the burn wounds based on objective and subjective criteria in both groups and our hypothesis was that burning wound in Centiderm group cannot heal them better and faster than the SSD group. All the wounds were evaluated at the admission to the emergency ward of the hospital by objective signs, including burning wound VSS score (Pliability, Pigmentation, Height, Vascularity of the wound), VAS, Subjective criteria (Itching, Dryness, and Irritation) and re-epithelialization, complete healing, and existence of infection<sup>[<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]</sup> by 1 burning specialist physician. Re-epithelialization was defined as noting the number of days required for the Escher to fall off from the burn wound surface without leaving a raw wound behind in examination.<sup>[<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]</sup> The patients followed up till complete healing daily with a burning specialist physician, and on days 3, 7, 14, the subjective and objective variables and VAS were recorded. Also, the pathological changes, for example, granulation tissue formation and re-epithelialization in wounds and their comparison with the normal tissue part were inspected medically by him. Patients were visited daily for compliance of drug consumption and evaluation of re-epithelialization and probable wound infection till complete healing of wound reached and the day of finishing re-epithelialization and complete wound healing were recorded for each patient. We evaluated patients in all of the days (even weekends) during the week on the basis of remember chart.</p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Sample size</title><p>For the purpose of sample size calculation, the difference in duration of treatment for complete wound healing was considered as the primary outcome measure. It was calculated that 30 subjects would be required per group in order to detect a difference of 5 days in this parameter with 80% power and 5% probability of type I error. This calculation assumed a standard deviation of 1.5 days for the complete wound healing feature.</p></sec><sec><label>2.7</label><title>Randomization</title><p>The study was designed as a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. We used the foursome random fixed block for randomization. After allocation of patients into 2 different groups, SSD and Centiderm ointment were administered topically once a day. Seventy-five subjects were randomized of whom data were analyzed for 30 patients treated with 1% SSD cream and 30 patients treated with Centiderm. The sequence was concealed until interventions were assigned. The randomization sequence was created using Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) with a 1:1 allocation using random block sizes of 2 and 4 by an independent doctor. Patients and burning specialist, and physician were blinded.</p></sec><sec><label>2.8</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analysis was performed per protocol.

Its effects on healing surgical and burning wound have mentioned and evaluated in many documents.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Antioxidant<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> and antibacterial<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> effects of this medicinal plant had proved previously. These properties are based on this plant constitutes as seen in previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Burns are the most common forms of trauma. They are physical and chemical phenomena and cause many morbidities and mortalities in the world. The best goal of all the current burn treatments is to speed up skin healing and prevent wound infection.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> One standard antimicrobial topical ointment is silver sulfadiazine with advantages such as easy and convenient use. It is not causing pain during administration, yielding low toxicity and sensitivity, and having antibacterial effects. These properties have made it known as the gold standard among antimicrobial topical drugs for the patients with burns and turned it to the main consumed drug in treating burn wounds around the world.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup></p><p>Investigation of our results showed that indexes of the burning wound healing with Centiderm after 3 days of treatment healed better than routine treatment of 1% silver sulfadiazine (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001) that was surprising in the few first days of the burn and its maximum effects seen in the first 3 days. The range of re-epithelialization was between 10 and 16 days after administrating the Centiderm ointment that was significantly better than the SSD (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001). Also, because of good antioxidant and antibacterial activity of Centiderm, patients showed no adverse reaction and infection in comparison with SSD. Some clinical studies about external use of <italic>C. asiatica</italic> will be mentioned. Basset<sup>[<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</sup> assessed the effects of impregnated dressing of Madecassol derivate from <italic>C. asiatica</italic> on ulcer cicatrization and burns recovery were investigated and Mad&#x000e9;cassol individual gauze (10&#x0200a;x&#x0200a;10&#x0200a;cm) impregnated with a mixture of titrated extract of <italic>C. asiatica</italic> (TECA) was used on 76 patients who had experienced previous allergic dermatitis or were affected by dermatosis of different kinds. The results were favorable after a treatment period of 8 to 10 days.<sup>[<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</sup> Haftek et al<sup>[<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]</sup> performed a randomized, double-blind study on photo-aged skin of 20 female volunteers with actinically aged facial, neck, and forearm skin to investigate the effects of topically applied 5% vitamin C and 0.1% madecassoside on the clinical, biophysical, and structural skin properties, and their results indicated a functional and structural remodeling of chronically sun-damaged skin. Ryu et al<sup>[<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]</sup> performed a study to evaluate the efficacy of wrinkle improving lipstick containing asiaticoside (0.2% concentration) and showed that by using the lipstick containing asiaticoside for 8 weeks, the change of visual grading scores and replica analysis indicated the wrinkle-improving effect. The results of our study were better than other natural products used for burning wound. Panahi<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> evaluated the herbal cream consisting of Aloe vera, Lavandula stoechas, and Pelargonium roseum as an alternative for silver sulfadiazine in burn management. They showed that both herbal and SSD groups experienced a significant reduction in the pain severity at day 14 compared with baseline (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001) and there was a significantly greater reduction from baseline to the 7 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.014) and 14 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05) day in the herbal cream compared with control group. However, the frequency of skin dryness was not significantly different between the groups at any of the assessed time points (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;0.05) and there was a single case of infection in the herbal cream group.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Akbari et al<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> showed that use of nettle extract treatment led to shorter wound healing time, fewer dressing changes, and shorter hospital stay, than silver sulfadiazine treatment. But no difference in the incidence of wound infection or grafting was found.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Malik et al<sup>[<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]</sup> compared honey with SSD in the treatment of superficial partial-thickness burns. They showed that the rate of re-epithelialization and healing of superficial and partial-thickness burns was significantly faster in the sites treated with honey than in the sites treated with SSD (13.47 vs 15.62 days, respectively: <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.0001) and the site treated with honey healed completely in less than 21 versus 24 days for the site treated with SSD. Six patients had positive culture for <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in honey-treated site.<sup>[<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]</sup> Khorasani et al<sup>[<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]</sup> evaluated Aloe versus SSD creams for second-degree burns on 30 patients with similar types of second-degree burns at 2 sites on different parts of the body. They showed that the rate of re-epithelialization and healing of the partial thickness burns was significantly faster in the site treated with aloe than SSD (15.9 vs 18.73 days, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.0001).<sup>[<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]</sup> There was no clinical trial similar to our work. However, animal and in vitro studies were performed on this subject that are in line with our results. Somboonwong et al<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> investigated wound healing activities of different extracts of <italic>C. asiatica</italic> in incision and burn wound models. They showed that similar to our study, the degrees of healing in the burn wound with the 4 extracts were significantly higher than that of the control on Days 3, 10, and 14. Also, histopathological findings on Day 14 after burn injury revealed prominent fibrinoid necrosis and incomplete epithelialization in the control and untreated groups, whereas fully developed epithelialization and keratinization were observed. They referred these effects to the phyto-constituents &#x003b2;-sitosterol, asiatic acid, and asiaticoside and madecassocide.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Shukla et al<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> showed that asiaticoside in streptozotocin diabetic rats, where healing is delayed, improved by topical application of 0.4% solution of asiaticoside. They indicated that asiaticoside exhibits significant wound healing activity in normal as well as delayed healing models and is the main active constituent of <italic>C. asiatica</italic>. Lu et al<sup>[<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]</sup> explained the mechanism of asiaticoside by using cDNA microarray technology and showed that alternation of genes expression profiles was determined in a human dermal fibroblast in vitro in the presence of 30&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL asiaticoside, and 54 genes, with known functions for cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, and synthesis of the extracellular matrix, were significantly upregulated. They showed that there is a close correlation among the gene profile, mRNA, and protein production in the cells response to asiaticoside stimulation.<sup>[<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]</sup> Ermertcan et al<sup>[<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]</sup> compared the effects of collagenase and <italic>C. asiatica</italic> in the rat model. Their immunohistochemical examinations showed strong inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) immunoreactivities in <italic>C. asiatica</italic> group. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) immunoreactivity was moderate in this group.<sup>[<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]</sup> Zhang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]</sup> indicated that asiaticoside can downregulate TGF-&#x003b2;1 mRNA and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP1) expressions and upregulate TGF-&#x003b2;3 mRNA expression in postburn hypertrophic scars capable of decomposing the products of type I collagen, contributing to the reduction of hypertrophic scars. Kimura et al<sup>[<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]</sup> suggested that the enhancement of burn wound healing by asiaticoside might be due to the promotion of angiogenesis during skin wound repair as a result of the stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production caused by the increase in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression in keratinocytes and the increase in IL-1&#x003b2; expression in macrophages induced cooperatively by asiaticoside along with MCP-1. On the basis of clinical and experimental findings, our ointment originated from <italic>C. asiatica</italic> can promote the wound healing in burn wounds.</p><p>The use of <italic>C. asiatica</italic> is safe and some clinical trials in other topics were done. It was used clinically for periodontal treatment that showed adjunctive local delivery of extracts from <italic>C. asiatica</italic> in combination with significantly improved clinical signs of chronic periodontitis and IL-1beta level in maintenance patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]</sup> It was used for minor oral aphthous ulcers by Ruengprasertkit et al<sup>[<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]</sup> and they demonstrated that its oral paste was safe and effective in reducing pain, ulcer size, and erythema. Kuo et al<sup>[<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]</sup> evaluated the effects of a topical cream containing <italic>P. amboinicus</italic> (Lour.) Spreng. (Lamiaceae) and <italic>C. asiatica</italic> (L.) for diabetic foot ulcers and showed that treating diabetic foot ulcers with them is a safe alternative to hydrocolloid fiber dressing without a significant difference in effectiveness.</p><p>The pharmacological activity of <italic>C. asiatica</italic> is thought to be due to several saponin constituents, including asiaticoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid.<sup>[<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]</sup> In vitro, each of these compounds stimulated the production of human collagen I, a protein involved in wound healing.<sup>[<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]</sup> Stimulation of collagen synthesis in foreskin fibroblast monolayer cultures by an extract from Herba Centellae has also been reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Asiaticoside quickened the healing of superficial postsurgical wounds and ulcers by speeding up cicatricial action.<sup>[<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]</sup> Asiaticoside stimulates the epidermis by activating t28he cells of the malpighian layer in porcine skin, and by keratinization in vitro.<sup>[<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]</sup> Topical application of asiaticoside promoted wound healing in rats and significantly increased the tensile strength of newly formed skin.<sup>[<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]</sup> Extracts of <italic>C. asiatica</italic>, and, in particular, its major triterpene ester glycoside, asiaticoside, are valuable in treating hypertrophic scars and keloids.<sup>[<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]</sup> Asiaticoside has been reported to decrease fibrosis in wounds, thus preventing new scar formation.<sup>[<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]</sup> The mechanism of action appears to be 2-fold: by increasing the synthesis of collagen and acidic mucopolysaccharides and by inhibiting the inflammatory phase of hypertrophic scars and keloids. It has further been proposed that asiaticoside interferes with scar formation by increasing the activity of myofibroblasts and immature collagen.<sup>[<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]</sup> In clinical trials, an extract of <italic>C. asiatica</italic> in a 1% salve or 2% powder accelerated healing of wounds.<sup>[<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]</sup> A formulation containing asiaticoside as the main ingredient healed 64% of soiled wounds and chronic or recurrent atony that was resistant to usual treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]</sup> In an open clinical study, the treatment of 20 patients with soiled wounds and chronic or recurrent atony with a galenical formula containing 89.5% <italic>C. asiatica</italic> healed 64% and produced improvement in another 16% of the lesions studied. Local application of an extract of the drug to second- and third-degree burns speeded up healing, prevented the shrinking and swelling caused by infection, and further inhibited hypertrophic scar formation.<sup>[<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]</sup> Previous studies have focused on the effects of Centella ointment on the process of healing burn wounds or surgical in the laboratory and in vivo conditions. In this study, we showed that healing effects of Centiderm were significantly better than the routine drug _SSD_ for treating partial thickness burning wounds such as pain, objective and subjective signs, and also re-epithelialization and complete healing time. None of subjected patients had infection rather than SSD.</p><p>Previous studies displayed the positive antibacterial, anti-inflammatory effects, and positive results on in vitro and in vivo experiments of the drug on the wound healing and its useful and effective features. Our results showed that consumption of Centiderm ointment not only improved the objective and subjective signs but also improved the re-epithelialization and complete healing rather than SSD without any infection in the subjects with burning event. In our evaluation, patients who underwent Centiderm treatment showed their optimal effects in first 3 days that is clear in figures and detailed results. Centiderm is cheaper than SSD and it can be a suitable choice for treating partial thickness burning wounds. Performing a clinical trial for deeper thickness burning wounds for Centiderm is recommended. We also suggested using Centiderm in dressing form and comparing it with other dressing methods and also with other antiseptic and burn wound healer drugs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank Shahid Ali Es&#x02019;hagh Moafi for moral support.
