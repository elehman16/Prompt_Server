The present study compared the effects of regular activity breaks and prolonged sitting on appetite. In a randomised, cross-over trial, 36 healthy adults (BMI (Body Mass Index) 23.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (S.D. = 3.9)) completed four, two-day interventions: two with prolonged sitting (SIT), and two with sitting and 2 min of walking every 30 min (RAB). Standardized meals were provided throughout the intervention, with an <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal at the end of Day 2. Appetite and satiety were assessed throughout both days of each intervention using five visual analogue scales. The five responses were combined into a single appetite response at each time point. The area under the appetite response curve (AUC) was calculated for each day. Intervention effects for appetite response AUC and <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal intake were tested using linear mixed models. Appetite AUC did not differ between interventions (standardised effect of RAB compared to SIT: Day 1: 0.11; 95% CI: &#x02212;0.28, 0.06; <italic>p</italic> = 0.212; Day 2: 0.04; 95% CI: &#x02212;0.15, 0.24; <italic>p</italic> = 0.648). There was no significant difference in energy consumed at the <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch meal on Day 2 between RAB and SIT. Interrupting prolonged sitting with regular activity breaks does not acutely influence appetite or volume of food consumed, despite inferred increases in energy expenditure. Longer-term investigation into the effects of regular activity breaks on energy balance is warranted.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>regular activity breaks</kwd><kwd>sedentary</kwd><kwd>appetite</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nutrients-10-00125"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Sedentary behaviour, defined as activities of low energy expenditure performed in a seated or reclining posture [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], is a risk factor for detrimental health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Regularly interrupting (every 20&#x02013;60 min) sedentary time with short (1 min 40 s to 5 min) bouts of walking acutely improves postprandial plasma glucose and insulin responses [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Performing activity breaks during sedentary behaviours increases energy expenditure [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which may contribute to a meaningful negative energy balance if not accompanied by increased energy intake. Conversely, engaging in extended bouts of sedentary time reduces the opportunity for energy expenditure and poses challenges to achieving energy balance [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is uncertain if and to what extent compensatory changes in energy intake and expenditure occur in response to intentional energy expenditure [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. If appetite were to increase in response to short bouts of intentional energy expenditure, energy intake may also increase; however, if appetite remains unaffected, energy intake may remain unchanged despite the increased energy expenditure, resulting in a change in energy balance.</p><p>Experimental evidence from studies designed to measure the acute effect of regular activity breaks on appetite response is scarce, but the results seem to indicate that walking for 2 min at a light intensity every 30 min, or for 5 min at a moderate intensity every 60 min, does not increase appetite [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, to date, all of the studies in adults have measured appetite response over a single 6&#x02013;12 h session of activity breaks, and only one [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] has investigated whether possible changes in appetite are reflected in changes in the amount of food consumed. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to determine the effect on appetite when prolonged sitting is interrupted by regular activity breaks over a 2-day intervention period. However, changes in appetite are only meaningful if they result in changes in energy intake; therefore, the secondary aim was to determine whether appetite predicted energy intake at an <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-10-00125"><title>2.

Participants received breakfast and lunch at the study site on Day 1 at approximately 0900 h and 1200 h, respectively. Breakfast consisted of muesli, milk, and canned peaches, and lunch consisted of pumpkin soup, a bread roll with margarine, and an apple. Participants were given a dinner to take home and consume between 1900 h and 2000 h. This consisted of lasagne, broccoli, carrots, yoghurt, and orange pieces.

This meal provided 4650 kJ in total and contained 515 kJ/100 g energy, 13.8 g/100 g carbohydrate, 3.9 g/100 g fat, and 7.2 g/100 g protein. In order to calculate the exact amount consumed, each meal was weighed before being served, and the remainder was weighed at the end of the meal. The meal was provided in a large bowl, from which participants served themselves. Participants were instructed to eat until comfortably full.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot9-nutrients-10-00125"><title>2.9. Assessment of Appetite Response</title><p>At baseline, immediately prior to and following meals, and hourly throughout both days of each intervention session, participants completed an appetite questionnaire which covered five aspects of appetite: hunger (&#x0201c;How hungry do you feel right now?&#x0201d;), satisfaction (&#x0201c;How satisfied do you feel?&#x0201d;), fullness (&#x0201c;How full do you feel?&#x0201d;), quantity of food (&#x0201c;How much do you think you can eat?&#x0201d;), and desire for food (&#x0201c;Would you like to eat something right now?&#x0201d;). Text was anchored at each end of the 100 mm visual analogue scales (&#x0201c;Not at all/not much&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Very much/a lot&#x0201d;) and participants were asked to mark the scale in accordance with how they felt. The appetite questionnaire (available on request from the authors) was adapted from Flint et al. [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], based on methodology used by Farah &#x00026; Gill [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. An overall appetite score for each participant at each time point was calculated from the mean of all five appetite responses. Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; values for the appetite scale at each time point ranged from 0.81 to 0.96, with an overall mean Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; of 0.91, indicating uni-dimensionality among the five appetite questions, confirming the appropriateness of creating a single appetite score.</p><p>The area under the appetite score response curve (AUC) was calculated using the Stata command &#x0201c;pkexamine&#x0201d;, using cubic splines, for the three hours following breakfast and for the whole day, for Day 1 and Day 2 separately. The days were treated separately because the breakfasts and the timing of the day differed substantially. The area under the curve was only calculated if the participant was not missing appetite scores at the beginning or end of the measurement period. From 2448 administrations of the appetite questionnaire, AUC could not be calculated on three occasions (two were missing the last appetite measure for the day; one was missing more than three appetite scores for the day). However, as a result of the combination of the RAB and RAB+PA<sup>D1</sup> and SIT and SIT+PA<sup>D1</sup> conditions, all participants with plausible responses had at least one AUC calculated from the two combined conditions, and therefore no participants were excluded on the basis of missing data.</p><p>To confirm that there was not an effect of the physical activity intervention on Day 2&#x02019;s appetite response, a two-tailed, paired t-test compared RAB to RAB+PA<sup>D1</sup> and SIT to SIT+PA<sup>D1</sup>.

Prior to analysis, one more participant was excluded due to implausible appetite scores. Therefore, 35 participants were included in analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-00125-f002">Figure 2</xref>).

Discussion</title><p>Performing regular activity breaks&#x02014;2 min of brisk walking every 30 min&#x02014;did not affect appetite response when compared to prolonged sitting, nor did it affect <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake of a meal. This is clearly demonstrated by the standardised effect sizes comparing appetite response between regular activity breaks and prolonged sitting, the magnitude of which does not approach a clinically meaningful effect (&#x0003e;0.5 S.D.) [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Evidently, performing regular activity breaks does not result in acute changes in either subjective measures of appetite or the objective measure of the amount of food, and thus energy, consumed afterwards. Results from previous studies have also indicated that performing regular activity breaks over a period of 5&#x02013;12 h has little effect on appetite and <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake of a meal [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The results of the current study add to the small body of literature by extending the time frame over which appetite response is measured. Even after a period of ~30 h of strict control of energy intake and activity pattern, neither appetite nor <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake of a meal are affected by performing regular activity breaks.</p><p>Regular activity breaks have been estimated to increase energy intake by 100&#x02013;670 kJ over an 8 h period [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, Bailey et al. estimated that regular activity breaks elicit a relative energy intake that is ~600&#x02013;1400 kJ smaller than the energy intake when sitting, measured over a period of 5 h [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although not reported here, participants in the current study expended approximately 1900 kJ more during the regular activity break intervention than during the prolonged sitting intervention [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Clearly, performing regular activity breaks has the potential to influence energy balance, as excess energy expenditure is not matched by either an increase in desire to eat, or actual dietary or energy intake. However, the implications of these results are not aligned with findings from a recently published meta-analysis of prospective observational studies, which indicate that sedentary time is not meaningfully associated with obesity or changes in body weight [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There are two possible explanations for this disparity. The first is that the negative energy balance established at the onset of regular activity breaks is compensated for over a period of weeks or months, either in terms of dietary intake or activity patterns, thus negating the changes we, and others, have observed. The second explanation is that the pattern in which sedentary time is accumulated may affect energy balance differently than total sedentary time. This idea is supported by cross-sectional analyses, which indicated that a greater number of breaks from sedentary time were associated with a smaller waist circumference, independent of total sedentary time and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, changes in waist circumference may represent changes in body composition, irrespective of bodyweight.</p><p>The use of both an <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal and visual analogue scales to measure appetite is a prominent strength of this study. Appetite scores just prior to the <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal significantly predicted the quantity consumed during this meal, providing further support for the use of the visual analogue scales to accurately describe appetite. Further strengths of this study were its strict standardisation procedures and randomised cross-over design. The major limitation of this study is that aspects of the study design, such as the timing of activity bouts in relation to meals, and the differing meal compositions used on Day 1 and Day 2, were driven by the primary outcomes of the study, and thus were perhaps not the ideal design for investigating the effects of regular activity breaks on appetite. However, we confirmed statistically that the continuous 30 min bout of activity performed at the end of Day 1 did not affect appetite responses on Day 2. Additionally, the different meal compositions used on Day 1 and Day 2 broaden the applicability of the results of this study, as they clearly illustrate that regular activity breaks do not influence appetite response regardless of whether the meal fed is a high carbohydrate or high fat meal.</p><p>Limitations include the fact that information on sleep prior to and between intervention days was not recorded. Sleep is known to effect glucose and appetite regulation [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and regular activity breaks appear not to reduce glucose responses when sleep is restricted [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-10-00125" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, given the randomized crossover nature of this study, it seems unlikely that differences in sleep between interventions would have had a large effect on the results. A further potential limitation of our study was that it was powered to detect differences in postprandial glucose AUC rather than appetite. For this reason, standardised differences with confidence intervals were calculated to aid in comparison between interventions. Given these results, it is unlikely that a meaningful effect of regular activity breaks on appetite exists.</p><p>This is the largest randomised controlled cross-over trial to undertake a detailed investigation into the effect of regular activity breaks on appetite, when compared to prolonged sitting, and is also the first to do so over a two-day period. Both appetite and <italic>ad libitum</italic> food intake were unaffected by regular activity breaks compared to prolonged sitting, but were accompanied by a difference in energy expenditure of approximately 1900 kJ across two days. If appetite affects the amount we eat and regular activity breaks increase energy expenditure without an effect on appetite then the long-term influence of regular activity breaks on weight control could be important. Longer-term randomised controlled trials are required to ascertain whether this extra energy expenditure is compensated for over a longer period of time.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Grace Allen and Hannah Gentle, research assistants who assisted with data collection, and all participants of the study.
