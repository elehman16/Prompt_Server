This procedure not only aims to obtain a diagnosis but also renders important anatomical information, subtle changes in the airway epithelium and vascular patterns of the bronchial tree are clues to guide the endoscopist. These subtle changes may influence the choice of treatment, site of biopsy and resectability of cancers when determining resection margins especially in case of centrally located lung cancer but also in case of multifocal premalignant disease. A meta-analysis showed diagnostic superiority of autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) over routine white light bronchoscopy (WLB) in detecting premalignant lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The superiority of AFB over WLB is especially significant in older studies using fiber optic endoscopes, and the use of video endoscopes further improved detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Yet AFB is not widely used and available in specialized centers only. Furthermore, the latest version of American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guideline does not strongly advocate its use but recommends using AF &#x02018;when available&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This weak advice is mainly due to uncertainty on the natural history and the risk of progression from premalignant lesions to invasive carcinoma and the high rate of false positive findings that need biopsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Currently, normal video white light bronchoscopy is the standard in most countries and video-autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) is offered by specialized centers only.</p><p>Alternatively, the use of filters transmitting only part of the reflected white light (narrow band imaging, NBI) has been shown to be of additional value to detect angiogenic squamous dysplasia (as a precursor for invasive tumors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and was reported to be approximately equal to (video-)AFB in terms of sensitivity and slightly better specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The type of vascular pattern was also related to histological subtype (dotted vessels related to adenocarcinoma and abrupt vessel endings to squamous carcinoma) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Through technological improvement new techniques have become available in the form of high-definition (HD-) bronchoscopy. Furthermore, in combination with improved video processor unit this HD bronchoscope offers real time image enhancement (i-scan Technology) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The impact of this development with high-definition videobronchoscopy using a 1.1 megapixel chip on the diagnostic performance of bronchoscopy is however unknown.</p><p>In this exploratory study we therefore aim to compare the sensitivity of HD bronchoscopy, with or without surface enhancement or tone enhancement to video-AFB (the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; for preinvasive lesions) and standard WLB for detecting abnormalities of the tracheobronchial tree in patients with known or suspected lung cancer, centrally located pulmonary metastatic disease or head and neck cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a randomized observational exploratory study with a blinded post procedure analysis of the diagnostic performance of HD bronchoscopy with or without i-scan image enhancement technology in comparison to standard WLB and video AFB.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>Patients scheduled for diagnostic or therapeutic procedure under general anesthesia were eligible for this exploratory study.

For bronchoscopic evaluation five different imaging modes were used for evaluation of the central airways in a standardized order. After each evaluation the tip of the bronchoscope was retracted above the vocal cords. The order of the different modes was randomized to prevent bias due to scope or coughing induced epithelial lesions and to prevent operator bias. The five imaging modes used in this study are: Standard white light videobronchoscopy (WLB, using Pentax EB1570 in combination with Pentax EPKi7000 videoprocessor in basic setting); High Definition (HD-) bronchoscopy (HD, using Pentax EB1990i with EPKi-7000 videoprocessor in basic setting); HD-bronchoscopy&#x02009;+&#x02009;surface enhancement (i-scan 1: using Pentax EB1990i and EPKi-7000 with settings brightness +0 average, redness 0, enhancement level +4 surface enhancement +4, tone enhancement off, color enhancement off, noise reduction low); HD-bronchoscopy&#x02009;+&#x02009;tone enhancement (i-scan2: using Pentax EB1990i and EPKi-7000 with settings brightness +1 average, redness 0, enhancement level +4 surface enhancement +4, tone enhancement colon, color enhancement off, noise reduction low) and Auto Fluorescence Bronchoscopy (AFB &#x02013; using Pentax EB1970A) in dual video mode (simultaneous image of xenon white light and autofluorescence light source with a laser at wavelength 408&#x000a0;nm and laser power 20 to 40&#x000a0;mW in a Pentax SAFE-3000 videoprocessor). Depending on the randomization order, changing of the bronchoscopes and videoprocessors was needed.</p><p>High-definition digital videos were made from all procedures without in screen indications of date, time or reference to patient identification.

For possible preinvasive lesions AFB seems to be preferred over normal WLB and HD-bronchoscopy but in this exploratory study no routine biopsies were obtained for histological confirmation. For the detection of endobronchial tumor sites no differences were observed. These results warrant further investigation with histological confirmation of lesions with abnormal vascular patterns.</p><p>This study shows that the use of i-scan image enhancement technology in combination with HD bronchoscopy significantls improves detection of vascular changes especially with i-scan2 offering the combination of surface enhancement and tone enhancement rendering a sharp and naturally colored image of the bronchial tree. Vascular changes have been shown to be correlated to angiogenic squamous metaplasia and lung adenocarcinoma or squamous carcinoma, as was reported earlier in studies using the narrow band filtering image technique (NBI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore facilitation of detection of these subtle changes is of clinical importance. It is likely that improvement of the image quality and additional image enhancement technology may improve the overall diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy and improve staging depending on the specificity and percentage of false positive findings in future studies. Furthermore better imaging may reduce procedure time when these techniques become widely available in bronchoscopes designed for everyday use with adequate working channel diameters.</p><p>Additionally, it may be possible that these improved imaging techniques may further reduce the need for AFB. This study indicates that AFB may still be the most sensitive modality for detecting sites suspicious for preinvasive lesions by the lack of autofluorescence in combination with normal WLB indicating thickening of the epithelial layer, but since there was no histological confirmation, this result must be interpreted with great caution. In this study AFB was used in the dual video (&#x0201c;twin-mode&#x0201d;) setting offering direct comparison between WLB and AFB. The readers are experienced and trained to detect lesions that lack autofluorescence without gross changes on the WLB image whereas in the other modalities only irregularity of the bronchial mucosa could be classified as suspicious preinvasive lesions. For daily clinical use AFB is only limited available and has shown to have a low specificity with false positive imaging up to one third of the detected lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For AFB a dedicated (laser) light source is needed emitting a light at a specific wave length, usually at the 390&#x02013;440&#x000a0;nm range. This additional technology requirement in combination with decreasing prevalence of centrally located tumors has probably played a role in its low availability in clinical practice. Therefore the use of a single light source (emitting full spectrum white light) in combination with filtering techniques like NBI or post processing real time image enhancement techniques like i-scan will be much easier to implement into daily clinical practice. Furthermore recent evidence comparing AFB to NBI has shown equal sensitivity and slightly better specificity favoring NBI over AFB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This is supported by our finding that the preferred image modality in this study was the HD-bronchoscopy with either i-scan settings based on joined reading. Apparently a more natural colored image is preferred over the blue images from AFB even by experienced bronchoscopist.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This exploratory study shows that high definition bronchoscopy with image enhancement technique may result in better detection of subtle vascular abnormalities in the airways.

Further investigations using this technique relating imaging to histology are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>ACCP</term><def><p>American College of chest physicians</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AFB</term><def><p>Autofluorescence bronchoscopy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASA</term><def><p>American society of anesthesiologist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HD</term><def><p>High definition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HNC</term><def><p>Head and neck cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NBI</term><def><p>Narrow band imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSCLC</term><def><p>Non small cell lung cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RGB</term><def><p>Red, green, blue</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WLB</term><def><p>Normal white light video bronchoscopy</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>EvdH has received research funding, travel expenditure and speakers fees from Pentax Medical Europe, Lilly Oncology, Pfizer Oncology and Medifin.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>EvdH is responsible for study conception and design, data acquisition analysis and interpretation thereof and writing of the manuscript.
