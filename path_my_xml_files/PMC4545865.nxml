FOCUS, AFFINITY and EFFECTS are a family of investigator-led, multicentre, parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled trials that aim to determine whether routine administration of fluoxetine (20 mg daily) for 6 months after acute stroke improves patients&#x02019; functional outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The three trial investigator teams have collaboratively developed a core protocol. Minor variations have been tailored to the national setting in the UK (FOCUS), Australia and New Zealand (AFFINITY) and Sweden (EFFECTS). Each trial is run and funded independently and will report its own results. A prospectively planned individual patient data meta-analysis of all three trials will subsequently provide the most precise estimate of the overall effect of fluoxetine after stroke and establish whether any effects differ between trials and subgroups of patients.</p><p>The trials include patients &#x02265;18 years old with a clinical diagnosis of stroke, persisting focal neurological deficits at randomisation between 2 and 15 days after stroke onset. Patients are randomised centrally via web-based randomisation systems using a common minimisation algorithm. Patients are allocated fluoxetine 20 mg once daily or matching placebo capsules for 6 months. Our primary outcome measure is the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include the Stroke Impact Scale, EuroQol (EQ5D-5 L), the vitality subscale of the Short-Form 36, diagnosis of depression, adherence to medication, adverse events and resource use. Outcomes are collected at 6 and 12 months. The methods of collecting these data are tailored to the national setting. If FOCUS, AFFINITY and EFFECTS combined enrol 6000 participants as planned, they would have 90 % power (alpha 5 %) to detect a common odds ratio of 1.16, equivalent to a 3.7 % absolute difference in percentage with mRS 0&#x02013;2 (44.0 % to 47.7 %). This is based on an ordinal analysis of mRS adjusted for baseline variables included in the minimisation algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>If fluoxetine is safe and effective in promoting functional recovery, it could be rapidly, widely and affordably implemented in routine clinical practice and reduce the burden of disability due to stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>FOCUS: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN83290762">ISRCTN83290762</ext-link> (23/05/2012), AFFINITY: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12611000774921">ACTRN12611000774921</ext-link> (22/07/2011).

About 50 % of survivors will have long-term residual disability. This places a huge burden on health and social services and informal carers. Although there is more that can be done to implement effective treatments such as thrombolysis and more rapid access to stroke units, there is still an urgent need to identify new treatments that might reduce neurological impairments, disability and dependency. One promising intervention that needs to be tested is a widely used antidepressant drug, fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Patient flow in the FOOD, AFFINITY and EFFECTS trials</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_864_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>SSRIs</title><p>SSRIs have been used in clinical practice since 1988 to treat mood disorders, particularly depression. They are sometimes used to manage emotionalism after stroke. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that fluoxetine may attenuate post-ischaemic brain injury by facilitating expression of neuro-protective and regenerative proteins, suppressing post-stroke hyperexcitability in unaffected brain and reducing inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. SSRIs may also stimulate neuronal generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], secretion of growth factors that augment neuroplasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], expression of brain phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and attenuate hypothalamic pituitary axis overactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], thus reducing cortisol, which is associated with poorer outcomes post-stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>A systematic review of SSRIs in animal models of stroke identified 21 experiments reporting the efficacy of fluoxetine in 252 animals; neurobehavioural scores improved by 41 % (95 % CI 27&#x02013;54 %) but there was insufficient evidence to determine the likely underlying mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>In healthy humans, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have demonstrated that fluoxetine can modulate cerebral motor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In strokes resulting in motor deficits, fluoxetine can cause hyperactivation in the ipsi-lesional primary motor cortex during a motor task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and a decrease of motor excitability over the unaffected hemisphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Promising effect of fluoxetine on stroke recovery in the fluoxetine for motor recovery after acute ischaemic stroke (FLAME) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]</title><p>The FLAME trial results, presented in October 2010, ignited worldwide interest in the role of fluoxetine for motor recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial 118 patients with ischaemic stroke and unilateral motor weakness were randomised to receive fluoxetine 20 mg daily or placebo for 3 months. At day 90, the improvement in the Fugl Meyer motor score from baseline was significantly greater in the fluoxetine group. Also, the frequency of independent patients [with a modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 0&#x02013;2] was significantly higher in the fluoxetine group (26 % vs. 9 %, <italic>p</italic> = 0.015) although there were not significant differences at other mRS cut-offs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cochrane systematic review of SSRIs for stroke recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]</title><p>In a Cochrane systematic review of SSRIs for stroke recovery we identified 52 randomised controlled trials of SSRI versus control (4059 patients), given within the first year after ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, for any indication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Only two trials (<italic>n</italic> = 223), including FLAME, reported the mRS as an outcome measure; the proportion of patients with mRS 0&#x02013;2 at the end of treatment was 62.5 % in the SSRI group and 55 % in the control group (absolute difference 7.5 %, 95 % CI: &#x02212;5.3 to 20.4). Among 22 trials (1310 patients) that reported disability as an outcome measure, meta-analysis demonstrated a large effect size of SSRI (SMD 0.92, 95 % confidence intervals 0.62 to 1.23). The effect size was larger for patients with depression at recruitment [standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.11, 95 % CI 0.71, 1.51] than those without (SMD 0.55, 95 % CI 0.27 to 0.84) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03 between groups). The effect size was smaller in trials at low risk of bias. SSRIs improved several secondary outcomes (e.g. neurological impairment, depression and anxiety) at the end of treatment, but there was a non-significant excess of seizures, gastrointestinal adverse effects and bleeding. However, the meta-analysis identified multiple biases in trial design, substantial statistical heterogeneity among the trials, wide confidence intervals for effect estimates and limited data on adverse effects. Only seven trials followed up patients after treatment had ended; of these only two (<italic>n</italic> = 155) provided data on disability.</p><p>Fluoxetine was the most commonly used drug in the review. However, only 12 fluoxetine trials (<italic>n</italic> = 682) were placebo controlled. Of these, six measured the degree of functional recovery; fluoxetine was associated with less disability compared with placebo (SMD 0.35, 95 % CI 0.03 to 0.61) at the end of treatment. Although promising, the data are not sufficiently compelling to prove that fluoxetine improves functional recovery after stroke and that any possible benefits are not offset by serious adverse effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Why choose fluoxetine to test in a large randomised trial?</title><p>We have chosen to evaluate fluoxetine because it is one of the most widely studied SSRIs. Its safety profile is very well established, and the drug is well tolerated, in long-term use, even in older people. There are more trials in stroke, and fewer concerns about safety in the elderly and in patients with cardiovascular disease, than for alternatives, such as citalopram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A number of manufacturers produce the drug and the price is low. Lastly, of all the SSRIs, it has the longest half life, so that gradual reduction in dose is not required when withdrawing the drug (which is inevitable in a trial) to reduce the possibility of an SSRI withdrawal syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>What are the potential risks of fluoxetine in stroke?</title><p>There are potential risks associated with giving fluoxetine to a wide range of stroke patients. Our systematic review indicated that SSRIs, compared with placebo or usual care, were associated with a non-significant excess of seizures [relative risk (RR) 2.7; 95 % CI 0.6-11.6] (7 trials, 444 participants), gastrointestinal adverse effects (RR 1.9; 0.9-3.8) (14 trials, 902 participants) and bleeding (RR 1.6; 0.2-13) (2 trials, 249 participants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Cohort studies, whilst prone to confounding and indication bias, have also reported that SSRI use is associated with increased risk of seizures, bleeding and hyponatraemia, particularly during the first 4 weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Its interaction with antiplatelet and anticoagulant medication might increase bleeding risk. Hence, co-prescription of fluoxetine with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications that are commonly used by stroke patients might increase bleeding risk in this population of patients. Like other antidepressants, fluoxetine may lower seizure threshold and therefore could increase the frequency of post-stroke seizures. Although evidence on this is conflicting, we are excluding patients with a history of epileptic seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. An adverse effect on glycaemic control in diabetics has been recorded. Hyponatraemia is a recognised adverse effect and may prove to be more common amongst stroke patients who may be taking concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics and proton pump inhibitors. However, reassuringly, fluoxetine has been very commonly prescribed for several years to patients with stroke to treat depression and emotionalism without major problems emerging. Subject to assessment by the responsible clinician, some stroke patients with severe renal or hepatic failure may not be able to participate in the trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>The need for large randomised trials of fluoxetine in stroke</title><p>A cardinal principle of all research should be &#x0201c;trust but verify&#x0201d;. Given the encouraging data from the FLAME trial and other smaller studies, there is an urgent need to carry out randomised trials that have adequate power to reliably detect clinically important benefits and hazards. Fluoxetine is inexpensive (only about &#x000a3;2.50 per month in the UK), simple-to-administer and generally well tolerated. If it proves to be safe in stroke patients and has an effect on functional recovery after stroke that is even a fraction of that seen in the FLAME trial it would be a very worthwhile treatment for patients, their carers, and health and social services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>The need to identify the patients who might particularly benefit from treatment</title><p>Whilst fluoxetine may improve outcome for the whole range of stroke patients, it is also plausible given its diverse pharmacological effects that the balance of risk and benefit may vary in patients with different types of stroke. For instance, pre-clinical work has suggested that motor recovery may be specifically enhanced (see above). Also, fluoxetine influences bleeding risk, particularly in those taking antithrombotic medication, so there could be differences in effectiveness between patients with ischaemic (who are taking antithrombotics) and those with haemorrhagic stroke. Patients with severe stroke associated with cognitive and communication problems may be at greater risk of adverse effects because patients are unable to report early problems but they might also have more to gain from a treatment that enhances recovery. Also, those with severe stroke are normally at greater risk of post-stroke depression (which is associated with stroke severity) but&#x02014;as a consequence of their deficits&#x02014;are at greater risk that their post-stroke depression is not recognised and so goes untreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study objectives</title><p>We have collaboratively designed and implemented a family of three large, investigator-led, government and charity-funded, multicentre, placebo-controlled randomised trials that together aim to robustly address several research questions.</p><p>Our aims are to determine whether the routine administration of fluoxetine 20 mg od started between 2 and 15 days post stroke, and continued for 6 months, improves recovery and whether any benefits persist after the treatment has stopped until 12 months after the stroke.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Primary research question</title><p>Does the routine administration of fluoxetine (20 mg od) for 6 months after an acute stroke improve patients&#x02019; functional status at 6 months?</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Secondary research questions</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>If fluoxetine improves functional status at 6 months, does any improvement in functional status persist after treatment is stopped?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does fluoxetine influence the secondary outcome measures (stroke impact, fatigue, mood and quality of life) at 6 months and 12 months?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does fluoxetine increase the risk of serious adverse events?</p></list-item><list-item><p>If fluoxetine is effective, is it also cost-effective?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is fluoxetine associated with longer-term survival?

Each trial has its own independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to oversee the safety of participants in the trial. During recruitment, interim analyses of the baseline and follow-up data will be supplied, in strict confidence, to the chairmen of the data-monitoring committees, along with any other analyses that the committees may request. In the light of these analyses, the data-monitoring committee will advise the chairmen of the Trial steering committees whether, in their view, the randomised comparisons have provided (1) 'proof beyond reasonable doubt' that for all, or some, the treatment is clearly indicated or clearly contra-indicated and (2) evidence that might reasonably be expected to materially influence future patient management. Following a report from the DMC, the steering committees will decide whether to modify entry to the study (or seek extra data). Unless this happens, however, the TSC, the collaborators and central administrative staff will remain ignorant of the interim results.</p><p>The terms of reference of the DMCs specify that any of the chairmen should confer with the chairmen of the DMCs of the other trials if they have concerns about the accruing data. The chairmen may elect to share blinded or unblinded reports and to request combined analyses of accruing data in the three trials.</p><p>The FOCUS trial is coordinated from the Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit (ECTU) (Neurosciences Division) and sponsored by ACCORD (a joint organisation between University of Edinburgh and NHS Lothian). The AFFINITY trial is coordinated from the Stroke Research Unit in Perth (School of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Western Australia, and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Health Department of Western Australia) and the Neurological &#x00026; Mental Health Division, George Institute for Global Health, in Sydney, Australia. The EFFECTS trial is coordinated from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm but its randomisation and data storage are hosted by the ECTU in Edinburgh.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Discussion</title><p>The investigators of these three trials agreed to a collaborative approach including adhering to a common core protocol and combining their results to allow a prospective individual patient data meta-analysis. We judged that a larger number of participants would be required to answer our secondary research questions than could be recruited in any trial within a reasonable time period if based in one country. Also, we were keen to have sufficient power to ensure we detected even a modest overall effect, since this would still have important implications for patients, their families, and health and social services. The degree of collaboration is illustrated by the fact that the co-chief investigators of each trial participate in each of the three trial steering committees and have, where allowed, been named as co-applicants on each of the funding applications. This means that each of us has an interest in each of the three trials succeeding.</p><p>An alternative strategy that we considered was to establish a single international trial. However, we decided that our chosen strategy has several advantages.</p><p>We are able to vary trial procedures to fit local conditions. For instance, in the UK, the FOCUS trial is supported by a well-organised network of principal investigators and research staff in local centres funded by the National Institute of Health Research. In Australia and Sweden the individual trialists have to identify the local support networks. Regulations vary between countries with respect to whether proxy consent is acceptable and how patient identifiable data can be shared between centres and coordinating centres, which influences the feasibility of centralised follow-up and the intensity of monitoring required by regulators.</p><p>Ideally, the three trials would have collected identical data items at the same time points. Since the vast majority of data items are common to all three trials our approach did allow for some variation. For instance the PHQ9 was favoured in Australasia whilst the MHI5 was favoured in the UK and the MADRS in Sweden. These small variations should not preclude a valid combined analysis. Most importantly the eligibility criteria, method of randomisation, interventions and principal outcome measures were almost identical.</p><p>Our model allows us to confirm the results of one trial in another two providing valuable evidence of external validity. It will also allow us to explore any heterogeneity in trial results that may reflect the settings in which each trial was carried out. For instance, the intensity of background physical therapies, adherence to the trial drug, duration of hospitalisation and costs of delivering hospital and social services vary between countries and may alter the effectiveness or cost effectiveness of fluoxetine in treating stroke patients.</p><p>Our model negates the need to gain approvals for transporting supplies of active drug and placebo across international jurisdictions. It allowed the investigators in each country to apply for, and secure, funding for their own trial, which has provided more resources than were likely to be available from any one funding agency. Governmental and charitable funding agencies often put limits on how much of their grant funding can be spent abroad. Our approach also encouraged local ownership of the trial, which will hopefully facilitate faster recruitment and more complete follow-up.</p><p>Our DMCs are also collaborating to maximise patient safety. If safety concerns are raised as data accrue within one trial, the DMC charters encourage the chairs to share data for confirmation of a problem or for reassurance.</p><p>We urgently need new treatments to reduce the burden of disability after stroke. These three multicentre, investigator-led, charity- and government-funded randomised trials will determine whether the routine administration of fluoxetine 20 mg daily (for 6 months) in stroke survivors between 2 and 15 days after stroke improves recovery at 6 months, whether any benefits persist after fluoxetine has been discontinued and whether there are benefits in specific subgroups.
