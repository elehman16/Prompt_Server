Myocardium reperfusion can lead to myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and contractile dysfunction [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Numerous studies have confirmed the myocardial protective effect of IPC since its first demonstration more than a decade ago [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The majority of these studies were performed in animal models, in which ischemia/reperfusion was imposed in the absence of comorbidities [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, myocardium ischemic victims often have simultaneous classic cardiovascular risks, inclusive of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and heart failure, which markedly interfere with the cardioprotective effect of IPC. It has been shown that the infarct size-limiting effect of IPC is attenuated in hyperlipidemic rabbits [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and cholesterol-fed rats [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme, a reductase inhibitor widely known as statins, inhibits the synthesis of mevalonate. Statin has been strongly recommended in hyperlipidemic patients and has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Numerous studies have evaluated the non-canonical (cholesterol-independent) positives of acute statin administration. Simvastatin administration for three weeks limited the infarct size both in normal and in hyperlipidemic rabbits, irrespective of IPC [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, combination of acute atorvastatin with IPC had a stronger protective effect within the hearts of diabetic rats; in comparison, chronic statin with IPC failed to protect hearts against reperfusion injury in either diabetic or non-diabetic rats [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. When IPC was combined with acute atorvastatin treatment, it inhibited the cardioprotective effects of IPC. Treatment with chronic atorvastatin in isolated rat heart was shown to downregulate IPC-mediated post translational activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and Akt [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The ARMYDA-ACS trial [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] confirmed this findings further, in which hypercholesterolemia was a common risk factor.</p><p>Therefore, defining the underlying molecular mechanisms of statin administration on the cardioprotective effect of IPC in hyperlipidemia is of significant clinical significance. Hence, the objective of the current study was to determine if acute administration of atorvastatin potentiates the cardioprotective effect of IPC in hyperlipidemic rats and whether such potentiation occurs through the pro-survival PI3K/Akt and/or P42 MAPK/ERK signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Infarct size</title><p>To establish a hyperlipidemic animal model, rats were fed with normal food or cholesterol rich diet. The hyperlipidemic rats displayed increased TC, TG and LDLc levels but decreased HDLc levels compared with normal rats (sham group) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In the hypercholesterolemia rats, I/R ratio between myocardial infarction sizes (IS) and area at risk (AAR) was not significantly different between the control (I/R group in which the rats were fed with cholesterol enriched diet) and IPC groups. However, Atorvastation+IPC and Atorvastatin+IPC+wortmannin groups had significantly lower I/R versus the control group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 in either case). The difference was not significant between Atorvastatin+IPC+PD98059 and control groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To exclude the possibility that Atorvastatin alone could protect cardiovascular functions, we also treated the hyperlipidemic rats with Atorvastatin alone, wortmannin alone, or PD98059 alone in a non-IPC control condition. Our results show the atorvastatin decreases I/R ratio only slightly, but not at statistical significant levels, indicating atorvastatin specifically restores the cardioprotective effects during ischemic postconditioning. The wortmannin alone, or PD98059 alone treatments did not decrease the I/R ratio (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In addition, our results show the atorvastatin treatments could protect against infarction in normal diet rats as well (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Atorvastatin treatments protect myocardial functions after IPC</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The hyperlipidemic rats displayed increased TC, TG and LDLc levels but decreased HDLc levels compared with normal rats.

IPC can reduce infarction size and provide cardioprotection, both in animals and human beings. Recent studies [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] revealed that hyperlipidemia can increase the myocardial susceptibility to I/R injury. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme was shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality in hyperlipidemic patients [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Even though many studies evaluated at the cholesterol-independent protective effects of the statins [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the exact mechanism of potentiating IPC is still largely inconclusive. Part of the discrepancy stems from the study model used, drug administration routes, and protocol adopted for IPC induction in these studies. However, this underlies the tremendous clinical significance of elucidating the molecular mechanism of cardioprotective synergism achieved by co-administration of IPC and statin in hyperlipidemic patients. Nevertheless, the effects provided in hyperlipidemic disorders by IPC when acute statin is administered and the potential mechanism via the activation of prosurvival kinases Akt and p42 MAPK/ERK are still inconclusive.</p><p>It was shown that cholesterol diet-induced hyperlipidemia impairs the cardioprotective effect of IPC, at least in part via deterioration of the IPC-induced early increase in peroxynitrite formation [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It was further shown that IPC reduced the infarct size in hyperlipidemic rats in comparison with I/R group and that this might be mediated by upregulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the current study, IPC alone failed to markedly reduce the infarction size compared with control group in hyperlipidemic rat model.</p><p>It was shown that acute administration of lovastatin attenuated Akt phosphorylation-mediated activation and increased the P42 MAPK/ERK phosphorylation in normal rats [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Involvement of ERK1/2, rather than PI3K/Akt, was shown to be more important in the reduction of infarct size achieved with IPC in normal rabbit hearts [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in homozygous GSK-3 double knockout mice did not attenuate cardioprotective effect of IPC [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], indicating that the cardioprotective action of IPC is not mediated by PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. In contrast, it was shown that acute atorvastatin administration with IPC could recover contractile dysfunction in hearts from diabetic rats and that activated Akt signaling pathways could enhance these protective effects [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In summary, there is contrasting data that suggest that the cardioprotective effect of IPC is mediated by PI3K/Akt and P42 MAPK/ERK signaling pathways alone or in combination. In the current study, oral administration of atorvastatin leads to the limiting-size infarction in hyperlipidemic animals. Furthermore, the Atorvastatin+IPC group showed robust P42 MAPK/ ERK, but not Akt, phosphorylation, leading to the hypothesis that cardioprotection is based briefly on the activation P42 MAPK/ ERK instead of Akt pathway.</p><p>The dose of wortmannin [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] used in the current study was previously shown to be adequate in a similar model to suppress insulin-induced PI3K activation. Wortmannin, impaired cardioprotective effects in the signal transduction cascade, when co-treated with wortmannin, the myocardium protection in Atorvastatin+IPC+wortmannin group should theoretically be discounted. Even though, the area of risks showed no significant differences between control group and Atorvastatin+IPC+wortmannin group. The phosphorylated Akt on Ser473 significantly decreased in the Atorvastatin+IPC+wortmannin group compared to the control group. It was speculated that acute statin might activate the P42 MAPK/ ERK signal pathways in parallel, which will overcome the inhibitory effects of wortmannin. Compared to the control group, when PD98059 was applied, there was no limiting-size observed in the Atorvastatin+IPC+PD98059 group and the activation P42 MAPK/ ERK was decreased, but not significantly attenuated. In this study, we focused on the PI3K/Akt and P42 MAPK/ERK activation to explore the mechanisms of the role of IPC in hyperlipidemic rats and observed consistent high-and low variation between the area at risk and phosphorylation in P42 MAPK/ ERK instead of Akt. Consequently, we can conclude that P42 MAPK/ ERK activation rather than PI3K/Akt might participate in the overall protective effect of IPC in hyperlipidemic disorders when acute statin is administered.</p><p>ERK1/2 is a kinase in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and phosphorylation of ERK (p-ERK) can be used as a common end point measurement for the activation of many classes of G protein coupled receptors (GPCR). PI3 kinase, Akt and ERK were termed &#x0201c;reperfusion injury survival kinases&#x0201d; (RISK). The tight coupling between these kinases and mPTP formation was demonstrated in rat cardiomyocyte model [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is believed that RISK act to prevent mPTP formation in the reperfused heart. Previous study has suggested that the activation of ERKs protected cardiomyocytes during ischemia/reperfusion [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Immunoblot analysis with a phosphospecific ERK (Thr 202/Tyr 204) antibody showed a decreased content of cytosolic phospho-ERK-1 and phospho-ERK-2 [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], similar to what we observed in our study. So the increased content of phosphorylated ERK may prevent mPTP formation to protect heart from ischemic and reperfusion injury in post conditioning model. However, one important limitation of our study is we did not probe for the proteins downstream of ERK, which will be needed in future studies.</p><p>To summarize, this study demonstrated that acute statin can restore the cardioprotective effect of IPC in hyperlipidemic rats through activation of ERK1/2 rather than PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Animal</title><p>All animal studies conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Pub.
