However, the predictive value of serum hepatitis B virus core antibody (HBcAb) levels for HBeAg seroconversion among patients with high viral load remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study consisted of 74 patients with high viral load (HBV DNA &#x0003e;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> copies/mL) enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, treated with lamivudine and adefovir (N = 32) or entecavir (N = 42) for up to 96 weeks. Serum HBV DNA, quantitative hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), HBeAg, and HBeAb was tested at each visit. Quantitative HBcAb evaluation was conducted for all the available samples in the trial, by using a newly developed double-sandwich anti-HBc immunoassay.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Serum HBcAb levels were significantly higher in patients with a serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level more than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) compared with patients with ALT levels within 5 &#x000d7; ULN (4.25 &#x000b1; 0.61 vs. 3.94 &#x000b1; 0.47 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0345). Patients with HBeAg seroconversion were associated with a higher level of HBcAb at baseline, compared with those without HBeAg seroconversion (4.38 &#x000b1; 0.54 vs. 4.02 &#x000b1; 0.58 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL, <italic>P</italic> = 0.029).

People with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).<xref rid="b1-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Five nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) have been approved for antiviral treatment of chronic HBV infection in most countries. The aim of antiviral treatment for chronic HBV infection is to suppress HBV replication and to achieve hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion in HBeAg seropositive patients, to improve health-related quality of life, and patient survival.<xref rid="b2-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The presence of HBeAg seropositivity indicates active replication of HBV and a reflection of high risk of HCC. The relative risk of HCC in chronic HBV infection has been reported as 9.6% for patients who were seropositive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) alone; the risk increased to 60.2% for patients who were both HBsAg seropositive and HBeAg seropositive.<xref rid="b3-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Therefore, it is important to monitor HBeAg status in patients with chronic HBV infection during anti-HBV treatment.</p><p>Recently, available evidence suggests that patients with chronic HBV infection with high viral load (HVL) are less likely to achieve HBeAg seroconversion and more likely to be associated with high drug-related resistance and treatment failure. In the 2-year GLOBE trial, data suggested that patients with chronic HBV infection with serum HBV DNA levels at baseline &#x0003c;9 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL were confirmed as strong predictors for a favorable virologic response and serological outcomes at week 104, including undetectable HBV DNA viral load and HBeAg seroconversion.<xref rid="b4-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, chronic HBV infection is an infectious disease with a pathogenesis and course that depends on the virus and host interaction. Although previous studies have shown that HBV viral load and HBsAg levels can be used to predict treatment outcomes of anti-HBV treatment, these predictors are virus-dependent.<xref rid="b5-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> At present, host immune-related predictors for HBeAg seroconversion and immune response in patients with chronic HBV infection with an HVL at baseline are limited. There is currently no specific predictor for HBeAg seroconversion in patients with chronic HBV infection with HVL.</p><p>In 2013, a study by Yuan et al reported that increased serum levels of hepatitis B virus core antibody (HBcAb) may indicate a stronger host-adaptive antiviral immune response in chronic HBV infection.<xref rid="b7-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This study suggested a possible role for HBcAb as a predictor of host immune response to HBV infection. However, due to the relatively low HBV DNA viral load, the performance of detection of HBcAb as a marker for HBeAg seroconversion in patients with chronic HBV infection and with HVL requires further validation.</p><p>The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of serum HBcAb levels as predictors for HBeAg seroconversion in patients with chronic HBV infection treated with NUCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients studied</title><p>This study consisted of 74 patients with HVL (an HVL at baseline defined as serum HBV DNA levels &#x0003e;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> copies/mL) enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, treated with lamivudine (LAM) and adefovir (ADV) (N = 32) or entecavir (ETV) (N = 42) for up to 96 weeks. Patients enrolled in the trial were HBsAg seropositive for at least 6 months, HBeAg-positive with an HVL at baseline, accompanied by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN), documented on two separate occasions, at least 2 weeks apart, with the latest ALT &#x02265;2 &#x000d7; ULN.</p><p>The exclusion criteria included patients who had received previous treatment with IFN or NUCs; pregnancy; a history of metabolic liver disease; patients who had diagnostic markers of co-infection with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus, or HIV; autoimmune hepatitis; heavy alcohol intake; liver cirrhosis; or HCC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Serological methods</title><p>Serum levels of ALT, HBV serological markers, and HBV DNA viral load were evaluated every 12 weeks from baseline to the end of the study.

Although the HBcAb level in both groups decreased during anti-HBV treatment, no difference was found between the two groups with respect to HBcAb levels at week 24 and week 48 in our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Analysis of the performance of HBcAb as a predictor of 96-week HBeAg seroconversion</title><p>The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to determine whether the serum levels of HBcAb could be an indicator for HBeAg seroconversion at week 96 for patients with chronic HBV infection and HVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-idr-11-469">Figure 3</xref>). The AUROC was 0.71 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013) with 95% CI from 0.55 to 0.86.

However, the clinical significance of serum HBcAb levels is poorly understood. There have been few studies to evaluate the performance of quantitative HBcAb in predicting HBeAg seroconversion among patients with chronic HBV infection with HVL. This study has shown that a baseline serum HBcAb level &#x0003e;4.375 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL could predict which patients with chronic HBV infection and with an HVL experience HBeAg seroconversion at week 96 during treatment with NUCs.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that a high HBV DNA level is an independent predictor of patient outcome with NUC treatment, and a predictor of risk of developing HCC.<xref rid="b4-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b6-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> For patients with chronic HBV infection and with HVL, there remains a clinical challenge to improve the efficacy of antiviral therapy and to achieve desirable therapeutic endpoints.</p><p>A previously published study has reported predictive serological markers in chronic HBV infection, including HBV DNA viral load and serum ALT levels.<xref rid="b11-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, measurement of serum HBV DNA levels reflects the pathogen load. Chronic viral hepatitis results from pathogen&#x02013;host interactions, including the immune status of the host. Serum ALT levels may be raised due to a variety of other diseases, such as neuromuscular disease, myocardial injury, and other liver diseases.<xref rid="b12-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, a high pretreatment ALT level, particularly more than 5 &#x000d7; ULN, is a strong predictor of HBeAg seroconversion in both IFN and NUC therapy.<xref rid="b15-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In CHB patients, the HBcAb level was positively correlated with the ALT level from 0.5 &#x000d7; ULN to 5 &#x000d7; ULN and reached a plateau at ALT levels greater than 5 &#x000d7; ULN, the cut-off value for treatment response prediction.<xref rid="b10-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In the present study, we demonstrated the practical application of measurement of serum HBcAb levels to predict HBeAg seroconversion in patients with chronic HBV infection and HVL; an elevated ALT level more than 5 &#x000d7; ULN and a baseline HBcAb level of &#x0003e;4.375 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL may be applied practically in real-world clinical practice.</p><p>Although baseline HBcAb levels showed an independent association with clinical outcome after NUC treatment, AUROC values for serum HBcAg were unsatisfactory at only 0.71. Therefore, a combination formula with several indepen dent predictors may be more effective for predicting clinical outcome in patients with chronic HBV infection treated with NUCs. In 2009, Zeuzem et al reported that virological response at week 24 was a strong predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with chronic HBV infection who received telbivudine treatment, although there was no significant early reduction in serum levels of HBcAb detected between patients with and without HBeAg seroconversion.<xref rid="b11-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The role of HBcAb serum levels in predicting serologic response during NUC treatment should be confirmed in larger, randomized clinical studies.</p><p>For patients with chronic HBV infection, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between HBcAb level and host immune status remain poorly understood, but HBV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cells have an important role in the cellular immune response.<xref rid="b18-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Studies have further shown a role for B-cells; HBcAb is produced by HBcAg-activated B-cells.<xref rid="b20-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Recently, Zgair et al reported that HBcAb could inhibit or clear HBV through hepatocytotoxic effects associated with HBcAb-secreting B cells.<xref rid="b21-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Therefore, it is possible that high serum levels of HBcAb may indicate a robust adaptive immune host response against HBV infection, resulting in an improved clinical outcome following NUC treatment.</p><p>Another problem is that NUC therapy does not eliminate viral cccDNA and recurrent viremia is the clinical recurring event after treatment cessation in most CHB patients.<xref rid="b22-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Combination therapies of NUC with IFN are associated with increased cure rates with HBsAg loss compared to NUC alone.<xref rid="b24-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Therefore, seroconversion from HBeAg to HBeAb is an insufficient marker to eliminate HBV. Although HBeAg seroconversion is a good serum marker in the first few years during treatment, suggesting that risk of end-stage hepatic disease in CHB patients has been reduced.<xref rid="b25-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, for a long-term anti-HBV treatment, HBsAg seroconversion will be a more appropriate marker. A further study about the correlation between HBcAb and HBsAg seroconversion should be done. Recent studies have reported that the innate immune response is critical in the development of adaptive immune response, and multiple innate immune pathways are ultimately induced in chronic HBV infection with relevance to clinical outcome.<xref rid="b27-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30-idr-11-469" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The innate immune response and adaptive immune response should also be taken into consideration as research targets in further studies.</p><p>This study had several limitations. The major limitation was the relatively small sample size. However, the data collected for this study were collection from only four centers. That could remedy the limitation and reduce bias to some extent. We believe that this preliminary study has resulted in findings that warrant future, larger multicenter controlled studies. The approaches used in this study to measure HBcAb levels should be confirmed in future studies and verified with the use of other methods. Therefore, we recommend that to validate these preliminary results further, and to understand the value of serum HBcAb measurement, these findings should be supplemented with the use of examination of liver biopsies to provide information on the histological response.</p><p>In conclusion, the findings of this study have shown that in CHB patients with HVL treated with NUCs, a baseline serum HBcAb level &#x0003e;4.375 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL was predictive for HBeAg seroconversion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-idr-11-469"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Additional performance validation of the double-sandwich anti-HBc assay.</p><p><bold>Notes:</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) Reproducibility of the HBcAb assay.
