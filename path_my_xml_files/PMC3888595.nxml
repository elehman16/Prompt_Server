It is uncommon but has high morbidity and the highest case-specific mortality of any rheumatic disorder with 50% of patients dying or developing major internal organ complications within 3&#x02005;years of diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> There are two major subsets of systemic sclerosis, limited cutaneous SSc and diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></p><p>Although there is understandable focus on the high burden of severe skin and internal organ involvement in early stage diffuse SSc, with less than 3&#x02005;years disease duration,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> there is also substantial burden at later stages and this has been highlighted in recent cohort studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></p><p>Traditional models of pathogenesis have suggested that early vascular events associated with autoimmunity and inflammation lead to subsequent fibrosis. Although this is plausible and supported by preclinical mechanistic studies it is clear that a broad range of biological processes interact in SSc and that these include involvement of key profibrotic cytokines such as transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; and connective tissue growth factor as well as proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)&#x003b1;. There is also increasing evidence of an imbalance in Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg system promoting inflammation and fibrosis and activation of B cells promoting production of autoantibodies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Diffuse SSc is often categorised as early-stage or established/late-stage disease and it is possible that the pathogenic factors underlying the distinct phases of the disease are different. In particular, pathogenic drivers of late-stage disease are less clear, but there is emerging evidence that persistent perturbation of immune cell function may be relevant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> The cornerstone of management of early stage diffuse SSc is broad spectrum immunosuppression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Emerging data support the benefit of immunosuppression for skin and lung fibrosis in SSc, especially when given at the early stages of disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Study drug</title><p>Hyperimmune caprine serum (AIMSPRO, <underline>A</underline>nti-inflammatory <underline>IM</underline>muno -<underline>S</underline>uppressive <underline>PRO</underline>duct) is a goat serum extract derivative supplied frozen and thawed to a liquid for immediate injection. It is produced in goats raised and housed at a licensed facility in Tasmania, Australia. The animals are vaccinated using detergent-inactivated HIV viral lysate. Serum is shipped frozen to the manufacturing facility in Victoria, Australia where the sera are pooled, fractionated and diafiltered to preserve various macromolecules, immunoglobulin species and low molecular weight components prior to further processing nanofiltration and vialing.</p><p>The final product contains principally caprine immunoglobulins but also various small molecular weight species including cytokines. ELISA characterisation of the serum has revealed the presence of a range of components including the cytokines IL-4 and IL-10, proopiomelanocortin, arginine vasopressin, &#x003b2;-endorphin and corticotropin-releasing factor. Previous studies have shown that when peripheral blood mononuclear cells are isolated and incubated with serial dilutions of AIMSPRO, raw hyperimmune serum and heat-inactivated sera induced the release of IL-10 in vitro. Studies in patients with multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy have shown a sodium channel opening effect, which is thought to be one of several potential mechanisms of action of this novel medication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The primary objective of this double blind, placebo controlled parallel group study was to assess safety and feasibility of using this novel agent in late-stage dcSSc. The secondary objectives were assessment of possible treatment effect (using clinical outcomes such as modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS), SSc Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (SSc HAQ-DI) and Short Form 36 (SF-36) quality of life questionnaire) and the exploration of candidate biomarkers (such as von Willebrand factor (vWF), serum IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), PIIINP, as well as multiplex analysis of serum and plasma). The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee. At completion of the blinded phase all subjects were offered 26&#x02005;weeks of treatment with AIMSPRO on a compassionate basis and efficacy and safety end points were evaluated at 52&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study patients</title><p>This was a single-centre double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. Eligible patients were recruited from outpatient clinics and chart reviews. We treated 10 subjects with established dcSSc using hyperimmune goat serum and compared outcome over 6&#x02005;months with 10 control subjects receiving placebo. Subjects were randomised to receive 1&#x02005;ml study drug or placebo subcutaneously twice weekly for 6&#x02005;months. The first two doses of medication were administered in the study centre under supervision at week 0, day 0 and week 0, day 3. Subjects were followed for 26&#x02005;weeks with additional safety visits occurring at weeks 2, 6, 14, 20 and a final safety visit at week 52 (6&#x02005;months after the end of the double-blind phase).</p><p>The major inclusion criteria were: fulfilling the 1980 Preliminary classification criteria for systemic sclerosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> Clinical classification of diffuse SSc (LeRoy criteria)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> and at least 3&#x02005;years duration since the first non-Raynaud's manifestation of SSc.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: use of a putative disease-modifying drug within 1&#x02005;month of screening, patients receiving previous administrations of AIMSPRO or those with a history of known allergy to animal proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Concomitant medication</title><p>Throughout the study period, all medications were kept stable where possible. Medications contraindicated during the treatment phase included other investigational drugs, other biological therapies or immunosuppressive agents. Sodium channel blocking agents such as anticonvulsant medications were also contraindicated. Medications that were allowed during treatment phase included prednisolone up to 10&#x02005;mg/day, and medications for treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Clinical assessments</title><p>For evaluation of skin thickness, the 17-site mRSS was used, with each site assessed on a scale of 0&#x02013;3 with a maximum score of 51. For individual subjects, clinically meaningful change in skin score was defined as greater than 4 skin score units and at least 20% change in overall mRSS, as described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> The same assessor performed all assessments for the duration of the trial ensuring a standardised approach. Additional mRSS data from 26-week unblinded administration were also available and this provided additional opportunities for exploratory analysis of AIMSPRO in cases that had previously received placebo. Pulmonary function and echocardiogram were performed using standard techniques. All subjects completed SSc-HAQ,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> SF-36, neuropathic pain visual analogue scale (VAS) and UK functional score <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> (an 11-item 4-grade questionnaire, developed specifically to assess functional capacity in scleroderma patients) questionnaires at baseline visit, week 6 and week 26. In addition, exploratory clinical assessments such as Medical Research Council sum score (an assessment of muscle power), sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP, an assessment of respiratory muscle function) and the R-R interval (a surrogate marker of autonomic dysfunction) were performed at the same time points.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Laboratory assessments</title><p>Serum and plasma samples were taken at each visit to assess safety and for exploratory biomarker analyses. These followed the template of recent expert consensus regarding exploratory biomarker studies in SSc trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Serum amino terminal propeptide of type III collagen (PIIINP), a marker of fibrosis, sIL-2R, a marker of inflammation, vWF, a marker of vasculopathy were analysed using standard ELISA assays by Quest Diagnostics, California, USA, under good clinical practice (GCP) conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Adverse events</title><p>All subjects were monitored for adverse events (AEs) occurring after screening, even if they had not received study drug. Serious AEs (SAEs) occurring after the first injection and up to 6&#x02005;months after the last injection were documented and reported to the sponsor and medical monitor within 24&#x02005;h.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Key measures of efficacy in this study were change in SSc HAQ-DI from baseline to week 26, change in mRSS from baseline to week 26, the change in the UK Function Score from baseline to week 26 and the change in SF-36 scales from baseline to week 26. Change in HAQ-DI and mRSS analysed as a continuous variable were the prespecified efficacy end points. Responder frequency analysis for mRSS was also included post hoc to capture clinically meaningful change in mRSS.</p><p>Inferential testing has been performed to compare groups in the change from baseline to each post-treatment visit. Two-sided p values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant. A mixed models repeated measures analysis was performed on the data in the first instance. In some cases the mixed models algorithm could not converge, so a standard repeated measures analysis of variance was performed. The use of the mixed models repeated measures also allowed the calculation of probabilities for the adjusted mean change value tested against a standard value of zero, whereas the repeated measures analysis of variance does not calculate those probabilities, but does provide the 95% CI. Other analyses included a responder frequency analysis to capture individual patient data within the more variable cohort changes in mean mRSS. The unconditional z-pooled test was used to analyse responder frequency analysis, as recommended by Lydersen <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study cohort</title><p>Twenty-two subjects were screened and there were two screen failures.

Thus, skin score data were available for seven additional cases treated for 26&#x02005;weeks with AIMSPRO, and from three cases that chose not to take the drug but that were observed for a further 26&#x02005;weeks off treatment. For this larger patient group the change in MRSS between baseline and 26&#x02005;weeks was &#x02212;2.00&#x000b1;1.03 for those treated with AIMSPRO (n=17) and +2.39&#x000b1;1.64 in those not receiving active therapy (n=13).

The results of our study confirm that this drug is safe and well tolerated. AEs were frequent and there were more AEs and SAEs in the placebo group, but this was not statistically significant. None of the SAEs was deemed to be due to the study medication. Late stage disease was chosen because it provides a robust platform for safety analysis through the likely burden of disease and facilitated a placebo-controlled study design. The secondary objective was to explore potential efficacy. For skin score, a responder analysis showed significant benefit in the active treatment arm and a trend for improvement in mean skin score during the blinded phase of the study, and significant improvement when those receiving open label active therapy after the placebo controlled phase, analysed after unblinding. These data are reminiscent of improvement in skin score that was also observed in the treatment group in patients with late stage dcSSc in the oral collagen trial,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> another novel immunomodulatory therapy.</p><p>The biological basis for any treatment effect from AIMSPRO is unclear at this stage and may be complex. However, data suggest a direct immunomodulatory effect that includes modulation of serum levels of relevant cytokines such as IL-10 (SH, personal communication). Previous studies have suggested that modulation of IL-10 activity may be one of the relevant effects of this agent and we confirmed that levels of IL-10 were significantly reduced at 6&#x02005;weeks after starting AIMSPRO compared with placebo (data not shown). In addition, AIMSPRO contains immunoglobulins and this may be relevant in that there are some reports suggesting that immunoglobulins may be of benefit in cases of SSc.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></p><p>Other interesting results include an improvement in neuropathic pain VAS in the treatment group which is in keeping with the potential sodium channel effect of this treatment. Pain is a major morbidity in SSc and is consistently ranked highly as a patient reported outcome and component of the SSc-HAQ. The aetiology of pain is multifactorial and related to tissue ischaemia, musculoskeletal inflammation and possibly intermittent release of neuropathic mediators: hence the benefit observed with AIMSPRO is interesting and potentially clinically important.</p><p>Though there was substantial functional disability in the patients as evidenced by HAQ-DI baseline scores, there was no significant change in HAQ-DI between groups from baseline to 26&#x02005;weeks, which was similar to other trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> A recent meta-analysis of seven scleroderma trials did show a downward trend in HAQ-DI at 6&#x02005;months but the change in HAQ-DI was not significant at 12&#x02005;months. However, all of the trials in this meta-analysis were conducted in patients with early disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p>The study cohort was not recruited to evaluate lung function and although the changes are interesting, they need to be interpreted with caution. Lung function data show a trend to improvement in forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second in the active arm. The main changes are in components of the lung function that involve patient effort, raising the possibility that muscle weakness may be one explanation, though the SNIP data and total lung capacity did not show any changes between groups. Two subjects in the placebo group deteriorated compared with one in the treatment group. All three had pre-existing lung disease and one of the subjects in the placebo group had to be withdrawn due to worsening lung disease necessitating further immunosuppression. The Quinapril in Scleroderma (QUINS) trial also showed a trend to improvement in the active treatment group, the mechanism of this was unknown but was not due to differences in immunosuppression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></p><p>Biomarker analysis shows no changes for vWF or sIL-2R, but there are interesting changes in PIIINP with a significant increase at 26&#x02005;weeks in the treatment group compared with the control group. The mechanism for this is unknown as PIIINP has previously been proposed as a marker of fibrotic burden and is used to monitor potential hepatic fibrosis in cases of psoriasis treated with methotrexate. It is noteworthy that baseline values in both groups are in keeping with other studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> However, the CAT-192 trial showed no change between groups at end of study and the Infliximab trial showed a decrease in values from baseline to end of study. The conflicting results may be explained by the differences in disease duration of subjects in these two studies and our study subjects. These data warrant further prospective evaluation in a larger cohort.</p><p>Strengths of this study are a double-blind design with a placebo group enabling safety assessment and comparison between groups for efficacy signals; the same assessor for mRSS throughout the trial, and a relatively uniform patient group in late-stage disease, reducing the natural variability between presentations seen in early inflammatory disease. Our study has advantages over an open label design used elsewhere that makes a potential efficacy signal difficult to detect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></p><p>In conclusion, we report a pilot study confirming safety and tolerability of AIMSPRO in established dcSSc. Our data also suggest possible efficacy based upon improvement in mRSS in some patients, beneficial effect on pain and trend for improvement in other variables. Changes in serum PIIINP are of interest and warrant further investigation and replication in a larger cohort.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Correction notice:</bold> This article has been corrected since it was published Online First.
