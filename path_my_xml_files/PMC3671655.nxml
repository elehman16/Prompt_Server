Our approach to this topic relies on abiotic and biotic examples of the energy released by moving electrons in thermodynamically spontaneous reactions. A series of analogical model-building experiences was supported with common language and representations including manipulatives. These materials were designed to help learners understand why electrons move in a hydrogen explosion and hydrogen fuel cell, so they could ultimately understand the rationale for energy transfer in the mitochondrion and the chloroplast. High school biology teachers attended a 2-wk Students Understanding eNergy (SUN) workshop during a randomized controlled trial. These treatment group teachers then took hydrogen fuel cells, manipulatives, and other materials into their regular biology classrooms. In this paper, we report significant gains in teacher knowledge and self-efficacy regarding biological energy transfer in the treatment group versus randomized controls. Significant effects on treatment group teacher knowledge and self-efficacy were found not only post&#x02013;SUN workshop but even 1&#x000a0;yr later. Teacher knowledge was measured with both a multiple-choice exam and a drawing with a written explanation. Teacher confidence in their ability to teach biological energy transfer was measured by a modified form of the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument, In-Service A. Professional development implications regarding this topic are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Biological energy flow is a foundational concept in science education. &#x0201c;Pathways and transformations of energy and matter&#x0201d; has recently been recognized as one of five &#x0201c;core competencies&#x0201d; for undergraduate biological literacy (American Association for the Advancement of Science [AAAS], 2011, p. 13). &#x0201c;Energy and matter: Flows, cycles, and conservation&#x0201d; is one of only seven cross-cutting (spanning multiple disciplines) concepts in the new K&#x02013;12 framework from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">National Research Council (NRC) (2012)</xref>. In the recent revision of the Advanced Placement (AP) Biology Curriculum, &#x0201c;energy use&#x0201d; is cited within the third big idea, &#x0201c;Biological systems and their properties, including energy use, molecular components, growth, reproduction, and homeostasis&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">College Board, 2012</xref>, p. iii).</p><p>As the pioneering microbiologist A. J. Kluyver wrote, &#x0201c;The most fundamental character of the living state is the occurrence in parts of the cell of a continuous and directed movement of electrons&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Kluyver and Van Niel, 1956</xref>, p. 71).</p><p>Understanding what gets electrons moving, the paths they follow, and the work done <italic>as they move</italic> are essential to understanding biological energy transfer. These fundamental, abstract ideas are precisely why energy transfer in biology has been notoriously difficult for teachers to teach and students to learn. The difficulties are obvious. First, in order to grasp this description, learners must understand core concepts regarding atomic and molecular structure, the relative tendencies of substances to attract electrons (as the standard electrode potential measured as volts), and the energy released and available for capture when electrons move. All of this is required in order to give meaning to directional net electron movement in cellular respiration and photosynthesis and the resulting energy transfer. In addition, learners must understand the sequential steps by which these cellular processes occur and place them within the structural constraints of proteins and electron carriers located on a membrane enclosed by another membrane. Finally, because the &#x0201c;submicro&#x0201d; scale at which these processes occur often interferes with the ability to visualize these events (as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Gilbert and Treagust, 2009</xref>, p.6), scaffolding is necessary for students to &#x0201c;see&#x0201d; how protons are concentrated (the result of the work powered by moving electrons) and how that concentration difference can drive the coupled process of ATP production. Not only is biological energy transfer intrinsically difficult for students, it is one that challenges teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Anderson <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Driver <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Barak <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Wilson <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Brown and Schwartz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Parker <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p><sec><title>The Need for a New Approach</title><p>Misconceptions about photosynthesis and cellular respiration have been documented for more than 20&#x000a0;yr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Anderson <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 1990</xref>; many reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Driver <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Hazel and Prosser, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Barak <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Brown and Schwartz, 2009</xref>; Wilson <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2010; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Parker <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Work from Michigan State argues for a strategy that focuses on tracking matter and energy and facilitating the ability to cross scales. Anderson and Parker's approach crosses disciplines and discusses both biotic and abiotic examples of energy transfer with the use of a picture-based summative tool for tracking both matter and energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Mohan and Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Parker <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2012</xref>). While this strategy is designed to be useful in helping learners think about climate change on the largest scale, it does not address the <italic>mechanism</italic> by which <italic>energy</italic> is conserved and transferred in organisms at the smallest scale. Our approach has the potential to allow teachers to make sense of ideas inaccessible via current pedagogy. It is designed to help teachers and their students understand how life can occur in environments without molecular oxygen. Similarly, it is designed to make accessible fuel-cell technology that mimics the energy-absorbing chemistry of photosynthetic reaction centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Chandler, 2010</xref>) or that runs on electrons donated by microbes. Our hope is to allow conversations about organisms that clean up pollution and about the amazing diversity of photosynthetic microbes that sustain us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Allen and Martin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Blankenship, 2010</xref>). At the same time, this strategy is designed to help learners understand biology is not a special case when it comes to fundamental laws of energy transfer, a common misconception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Barak <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The Students Understanding eNergy (SUN) Model-Building Sequence for Understanding Biological Energy Transfer</title><p>The SUN model-building sequence was developed to induce understanding of biological energy transfer based on a general model of energy transfer occasioned by moving electrons during thermodynamically favorable or &#x0201c;spontaneous&#x0201d; reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Such &#x0201c;spontaneously&#x0201d; moving electrons can do work, and this allows for energy transfer in living things during cellular respiration and photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, small blue box). At the same time, the analogous experiences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) of the SUN workshop were used to reinforce fundamental laws of thermodynamics, including conservation of matter and energy and the fact that some usable energy must be converted to an unusable form with each transfer during the irreversible processes of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, large blue box).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The SUN model-building sequence.

Theoretically, as discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Gentner <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (1993)</xref>, structural alignment allows one to develop a common model of the similar relationships among these elements, which are not based on more apparent but possibly unrelated surface features. Gentner suggests that such comparisons promote learning through a variety of means, including abstraction, rerepresentation through uniform relational coding, inference-projection, and difference detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Gentner, 2010</xref>, and references therein).</p><p>However, because both the base and the target experiences may be viewed differently by teacher and learner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Duit <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2001</xref>, and references therein), it is important to guide attention to relationships between elements common to each. Tutorials that &#x0201c;blend&#x0201d; a cross-domain abstract representation with a series of concrete (i.e., within-domain) representations, have been shown to promote more productive reasoning than either abstract or concrete representations alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Podolefsky and Finkelstein, 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">b</xref>). Analysis of discourse and assessment choices suggests that representational pairing can drive development of discriminating personal schemata (knowledge structures) that more closely conform to canonical norms of the scientific community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Podolefsky and Finkelstein, 2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2008</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Podolefsky and Finkelstein (2008)</xref> propose &#x0201c;the explicit linking of ideas to representations in a layered manner&#x0201d; (p. 2) as a way to build those salient associations.</p><p>Each of the analogous experiences during the SUN workshop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) was discussed in terms of the common language described above (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). That language heuristic was initially introduced in conjunction with a chart based on the standard reduction potentials of some biotic and abiotic electron carriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This chart indicates the relative tendency of substances to attract electrons under standard half-cell conditions. Therefore it also describes the allowable directionality of electron movement given an ultimate electron donor and ultimate acceptor. After this chart was introduced, and although we were not aware of the research on blended representations described above, ABC cards meant to evoke its meaning were blended into representations of the subsequent experiences as described below.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>E<sup>0</sup> (ABC) chart. The predicted directionality of electron movement under standard conditions. This image is based on the relative tendencies of substances to attract electrons, i.e. standard reduction potentials (E<sup>0</sup>) in volts relative to a standard hydrogen electrode: (Zn/Zn<sup>+2</sup> [&#x02212;0.76], NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> [&#x02212;0.105], H<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> [0.000], Cu/Cu<sup>2+</sup> [+0.337], H<sub>2</sub>O/O<sub>2</sub> [+1.229]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Fasman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Ebbing and Gammon, 2010</xref>). Note that in the figure we have substituted the known E<sup>0</sup> value for NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup>. During the workshop, the ABC chart was regularly used without the label E<sup>0</sup>, and sugar was substituted for NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="287fig2"/></fig><p>The underlying principle taught through this series of analogous experiences was that when electrons move between two electron carriers that differ in electron affinity as measured by their standard reduction potentials (E<sup>0</sup>), there is a predictable standard free-energy change (&#x00394;G<sup>o</sup>) that makes energy available to do work. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, this principle applies whether the work is abiotic or biological. The electrons do not discriminate. Although standard conditions typically do not apply in either biological or abiotic instances of such electron movement, this standard condition can be used as a common point of reference. This idea is based on the relationship: &#x00394;G<sup>0</sup> = &#x02212;<italic>n</italic>F&#x00394;E<sup>0</sup>, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, and &#x02206;E<sup>0</sup> is the difference in standard reduction potential (E<sup>0</sup><sub>acceptor</sub> &#x02013; E<sup>0</sup><sub>donor</sub>) of the donor and acceptor. During the SUN workshop, we did not dwell on the mathematical relationships; rather, teachers were taught that the amount of free energy available to do work and the direction of electron flow under standard conditions could be predicted from the electron affinity of the ultimate electron donor and acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, orange bubble, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>The idea that energy is released by electrons moving in thermodynamically spontaneous reactions was first introduced through a video of a hydrogen-plus-oxygen explosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, source experience). Then, a &#x0201c;progress of reaction&#x0201d; chart showing the change in G<sup>0</sup> value of reactants and products for this reaction was introduced, after which teachers used manipulatives to see that matter was conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, orange bubble). Teachers were also reminded that with each energy transfer that is thermodynamically spontaneous, energy lost to an unusable form increases the random motion and/or the random arrangement of matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, large blue box). (Energy transfer under reversible conditions was not considered.)</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> was central to this intervention. It was repeatedly evoked during the workshop under nonstandard conditions when discussing the rationale for the directionality of electron movement, whether in a hydrogen fuel cell (target experience 1), in cellular respiration or in a microbial fuel cell (target experience 2 and its extension), or in photosynthesis (target experience 3). For example, teachers positioned ABC cards within the physical mitochondrion and chloroplast models discussed below to indicate electron affinity at that position during cellular respiration (target experience 2) and photosynthesis (target experience 3). Because light so changes the affinity of the central chlorophyll pair (P680Chl or P700Chl) in each photosystem involved in oxygenic photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, orange bubble), an electron will move to an adjacent carrier. Therefore, ABC cards were used in the context of the chloroplast manipulatives (target experience 3) to explain the photosynthetic <italic>z</italic>-scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, left). Teachers also constructed figures to indicate reduction potential (ABC)-driven electron movement in both cellular respiration and photosynthesis, again reinforcing target experiences 2 and 3. Notably, this activity asked teachers to blend the representation of the abstract rule shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> with the paths of electron movement in photosynthesis and cellular respiration to generate the first two sections of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The rationale for electron movement in photosynthesis (PS), cellular respiration (CR), and a microbial fuel cell. Once teachers understand the meaning of the ABC chart under standard conditions, it can be used roughly (not under standard conditions) to illustrate why electrons move in both PS and CR. Light changes the tendency of the central chlorophyll pair in both PSII (P680) and PSI (P700) to attract electrons to such a great extent that electrons literally pop out and start moving (dotted line) along the path defined by constrained electron carriers. (One needs to guard against the misconception that the same electron moves from carrier to carrier.) Once electrons are handed off to fix carbon (green arrow), the carbon compound becomes the ultimate electron donor in cellular respiration. By the time electrons reach oxygen in aerobic CR and are captured with some protons to make water, they are at the level of stability of the ultimate electron donor for oxygenic photosynthesis. While electron movement in CR is driven by the relative attraction of a series of carriers, electron movement in the SUN microbial fuel cell occurs both within the microbe via such carriers (dotted line) and then along a wire (solid line) after the electrons from microbes are deposited on an electrode buried in mud. Electrons ultimately are picked up by dissolved molecular oxygen from the other electrode suspended in water. When protons are added, water is made. 4e<sup>&#x02212;</sup> + 4H<sup>+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> &#x02192; 2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="287fig3"/></fig><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, which was developed for this paper as both a composite and refinement of figures used during this study, shows electron movement driven by ABC-based standard reduction potentials. This figure is meant to convey the physics-based rationale for electron movement during biological energy transfer and in microbial fuel cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> highlights the fact that the electron affinity of only the central chlorophyll pair (not the entire photosystem) is altered by light. It shows that the end point reduction potential for the ultimate electron acceptor in photosynthesis defines the electron affinity of the ultimate electron donor in cellular respiration. Its third section shows that microbes buried in the mud of a microbial fuel cell (given to all participants and developed by Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) undergraduate Heather Bobrowitz based on a design by Kelvin Gregory) donate electrons to a similarly buried electrode at a more negative potential than that of oxygen. Therefore, the third section of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> reinforces the idea that microbes can use an alternative electron acceptor. It also shows that electrons move in a wire across the remaining voltage drop to oxygen in this &#x0201c;biotic-plus-abiotic&#x0201d; example of the energy made available by moving electrons.</p><p>In addition, a group activity using ABC cards reinforced the idea that a continuous source of ultimate electron donors and acceptors is required to sustain electron movement and biological energy transfer. For many organisms, including humans, those sources of course are food and oxygen, without which they die; but in this context, one can also discuss alternative electron donors and acceptors used by some microbes or possibly as yet undiscovered life-forms on other planets.</p><p>A second theoretical basis for our work is analogical bootstrapping (an increase in understanding of two previously unfamiliar processes by their one-to-one explicit comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Kurtz <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2001</xref>]). Teachers made explicit comparisons among the model-building experiences shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>: for example, regarding the initial work done by electron flow in a hydrogen fuel cell (target experience 1) and that done by electron hopping in the mitochondria (target experience 2) and chloroplasts (target experience 3) of living things (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>A third basis is the use of manipulatives designed to serve as &#x0201c;metaphor-enhanced learning objects&#x0201d; that instantiate objects and their relationships within the mitochondrion and chloroplast (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Reese, 2010</xref>, p. 147, and references therein). According to Reese, &#x0201c;Metaphor-enhanced learning objects are scaffolding that makes <italic>thinking</italic> concrete&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2010</xref>, p. 146). In our experience, well-designed manipulatives provide prior-knowledge scaffolds for discussion, prediction testing, problem solving, and formative assessment. Reese suggests they provide the scaffolding that allows for &#x0201c;the development of deep hierarchical, highly organized, domain-specific declarative knowledge&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2010</xref>, p. 146, and references therein). If well designed, they can implicitly convey information through their surface features (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Zhang and Patel, 2006</xref>, p. 335, for a list of affordances of all types of external representations). Memory retrieval is normally based on surface features (Gentner and Landers, 1985). However, a variety of researchers have shown that deeper relationships can be retrieved when surface features are associated with matched analogues within multiply interconnected analogical relationships (as discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Gentner <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 1993</xref>, based on her own work and that by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Ross, 1989</xref>; Novick, 1988; and Keane, 1988; also see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Reeves and Weisberg, 1994</xref>). Understandably, experts are better than novices at rejecting initial retrievals from memory based on mismatched surface features. Nonetheless, there is controversy regarding the usefulness of surface feature cues. Concreteness has been known to interfere with abstraction, especially for young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Gentner and Toupin, 1986</xref>) and &#x0201c;poor performers&#x0201d; who do not grasp the underlying analogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Goldstone and Sakamoto, 2003</xref>). On the other hand, abstract representations in the absence of blended or concrete representations decreased productive reasoning for both skilled and unskilled college students in introductory physics classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Podolefsky and Finkelstein, 2007b</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Common objects and relationships within the mitochondrion and chloroplast tray<sup>a</sup></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mitochondrion tray</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Choroplast tray</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="tbl2a.jpg"/></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="tbl2b.jpg"/></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Membrane-bound compartment (gray tray) within another membrane-bound compartment (brown tray).

As discussed above, common surface features can sometimes focus the learner's attention on deep features and promote remembering of relational features normally difficult to retrieve from memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Gentner <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 1993</xref>). This principle was used in a variety of ways as described below.</p><p>In animations created by the authors to describe electron movement in a hydrogen fuel cell and in cellular respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, target experiences 1 and 2), similar visuals and spatial relationships highlighted common elements and their relationships as the teacher toggled from one animation to the other. In each animation, the electron donor entered from the left and the electron acceptor entered from the right. Hydrogen was initially split into an electron and a proton, each of which took separate paths after that charge separation. In each process, water was formed when oxygen finally accepted electrons and attached protons. Text describing the work done by moving electrons (turning the motor attached to the fuel cell and causing pumps to pump protons in cellular respiration) appeared in the same location (target experiences 1 and 2).</p><p>Animations that described ATP synthesis included the same surface features as a mechanical model of the ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and 5). Before applying the electron movement analogy to the process of cellular respiration, it was necessary for the teachers to understand how an intermediate step in cellular respiration (concentrated protons) can cause the production of ATP. They manipulated a mechanical model of the ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and viewed animations of its operation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Both the physical model and animations were designed to show how protons fuel the turning of its rotor and attached shaft. When turning, the central shaft systematically altered the configuration of attached subunits (similarly colored) that allowed binding of ADP and P<sub>i</sub> (either virtually or as a physical model similarly colored). Each demonstrated production and eventual release of ATP (either virtually in the animation or when the ADP and P<sub>i</sub> models snapped together inside the mechanical model). Therefore, these experiences provided blended representations of the mechanism of the ATP synthase.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>The ATP synthase. Ball-bearing &#x0201c;protons&#x0201d; are fed into the mechanical ATP synthase, and the rotor is turned to demonstrate how protons cause the central shaft to turn and deflect the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; subunits. Schematic models of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and P<sub>i</sub> (Pi) can be added to the open &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; subunit to demonstrate how concentrated protons fuel production of ATP.

(B) Mitochondrial protein complexes are shown in the context of a jmol-based interactive model and a Flash animated schematic. Each is also identified within the cross-mapped painting.

Physical manipulatives were designed with common features to highlight common functions and structural relationships in cellular respiration and photosynthesis during target experiences 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows the nested cafeteria trays (a brown tray with a smaller gray tray bolted to its surface) that highlight the crucial compartment-within-a-compartment structure of the mitochondrion and chloroplast. When used to represent the mitochondrion during target experience 2, the smaller gray tray represents the matrix bounded by the inner membrane; as a chloroplast during target experience 3, the gray tray represents the thylakoid lumen bounded by the thylakoid membrane. Components whose surface features and functions were introduced when the teachers learned about cellular respiration were used to indicate the same functionality in photosynthesis. For example the orange block (with pins to attach magnetic &#x0201c;electrons&#x0201d; and a hole that allows passage of ball-bearing &#x0201c;protons&#x0201d;) is a proton pump activated by electron movement. Learners moved magnetic &#x0201c;electrons&#x0201d; across it and passed &#x0201c;protons&#x0201d; through it from one compartment to the other. The function is the same in the mitochondrion and chloroplast. Such careful alignment of the commonalities of these processes also makes &#x0201c;alignable differences&#x0201d; such as the relative orientation of the ATP synthase in cellular respiration and photosynthesis stand out by contrast (as discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Gentner, 2010</xref>). Once learners understood the consequences of electron movement in cellular respiration through target experience 2, it was necessary to introduce the meaning of only a few additional components (photosystems and the effect of light on changing the tendency of electrons to move within them) to make the consequences of electron movement in the chloroplast accessible (target experience 3).</p><p>In addition to their common surface features, the tray manipulatives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) both constrain and embody their nontrivial properties as external analogical representations. For example, the small pink &#x0201c;quinone&#x0201d; can move within the &#x0201c;membrane&#x0201d; and transfer electrons to an adjacent complex whether in the chloroplast or the mitochondrion. Such nontrivial properties serve as memory aides; provide information with little required effort, thereby relieving cognitive load; support thinking and inferences; and support &#x0201c;perceptual rehearsal to make invisible and transient information visible&#x0201d;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Zhang and Patel, 2006, p. 335</xref>). The components can be used to show the effects of electron movement on energy transfer and on the conversion of reactants (the ultimate electron donor and acceptor) into the products made after electrons move. In addition to being used with the nested-tray &#x0201c;organelle&#x0201d; environments essential for target experiences 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, the tray components can also be manipulated in the context of laminated &#x0201c;cell mats&#x0201d; that allow learners to trace the flow of carbon and the flow of energy into and out of cells. This exercise reinforces the energy construct shown in the small blue box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>During and after the workshop, teachers were able to autonomously access information about the meaning of the tray components digitally in the interactive SUN Mitochondrial e-book (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), which can be accessed via a link at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://msoe.edu/academics/research_centers/sun">http://msoe.edu/academics/research_centers/sun</ext-link>. This resource maps a painting of the molecular environment of a cross-section of the mitochondrion (by D.G., who provides the Molecule of the Month feature at the Protein Data Bank) to the SUN trays and schematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Goodsell, 2010a,b</xref>). It also provides Flash animations next to interactive jmols that allow one to explore the functions of the key protein complexes of the mitochondrion in depth, activities meant to revisit target experience 2. Therefore, this e-book provides blended representations of electron transport in the mitochondrion.</p><p>During the workshop, teachers also worked with physical and laminated models of electron carriers in the context of laminated &#x0201c;protein complexes&#x0201d; so as to define the paths and consequences of electron movement in more detail. They also gave short presentations with specificity regarding how this mechanism was interrupted in mitochondrial diseases, which is related to target experience 2. In addition, D.N. presented a lecture on basic laws of thermodynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, large blue box), and how ATP powers life and energy transfer during coupled reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, small blue box). An emeritus professor from University of Wisconsin&#x02013;Madison, Mike Patrick, presented a lecture on light energy capture in photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, orange bubble).

Bandura and others, as discussed in <italic>Self-Efficacy in Changing Societies</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bandura, 1995</xref>) decades ago, categorized four main influences regarding people's coping abilities or efficacy beliefs: mastery experiences (doing something successfully), vicarious experiences (observing successful models), social persuasion (receiving encouragement from others), and what he called &#x0201c;physiological and emotional states&#x0201d; or the effect of mood upon one's personal judgment of self-efficacy. A teacher's sense of his or her ability to teach and students&#x02019; ability to learn influences a variety of effective teacher practices (as discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Tschannen-Moran and Hoy, 2001</xref>), including continuing to implement innovations after federal funding has expired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Berman <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 1977</xref>). Although Bandura felt that mastery experiences had the greatest influence on self-efficacy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Palmer (2006)</xref> found that the main source of pedagogical self-efficacy of primary teacher education <italic>students</italic> was cognitive pedagogical mastery (success in understanding <italic>how</italic> to teach science). He found that both cognitive pedagogical mastery and cognitive content mastery (understanding the science) trumped these students&#x02019; limited experience of actual teaching as a source of self-efficacy. However, Palmer felt his study did not provide the authentic enactive mastery experiences of experienced teachers and suggested such experiences might improve self-efficacy even more.</p><p>Therefore, besides attempting to increase teacher knowledge of these biological processes, we designed the SUN workshop to model use of the SUN materials and increase teacher confidence in using them. Most of the lessons designed for students were modeled as teachers critiqued them from the perspective of students. All teachers developed presentations using the materials to answer specific questions and kept a personal record of concepts learned. All took a performance assessment, using the materials to demonstrate their own understanding of each of the core processes and to become familiar with the materials. Teachers also revised their current curricula to incorporate the SUN materials for the coming year.

In addition, the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument, In-Service A (STEBI-A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Riggs and Enochs, 1990</xref>) was modified for biological energy transfer to determine teacher self-efficacy regarding these topics both after the workshop and 1&#x000a0;yr later. The distal effects of this work on students of these teachers will be discussed in a subsequent paper in preparation. Similarly, conceptual growth will be discussed in a later paper in preparation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>METHODS AND MATERIALS</title><sec><title>The Randomized Controlled Trial</title><p>The effect of the SUN Project intervention was studied in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) only during the first year of this 2-yr trial. During the second year, all teachers had taken the SUN workshop and were using SUN materials in their classrooms.</p><p>Teachers of regular biology, largely from Wisconsin, were recruited more than a year in advance. Based on school size, demographic data, and teacher experience, equivalent school pairs were determined, and one member of each pair was randomly assigned (by flipping a virtual coin at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org">www.random.org</ext-link>) to the SUN treatment group or to the control group. Ultimately 19 teachers from 18 different schools comprised the SUN group in the first year, and 20 teachers from 19 different schools participated as controls. Although assignment was by school, these numbers effectively resulted in a randomized, controlled trial to assess the teacher effects. In the first year, the treatment group attended the SUN workshop and then took SUN materials into their classrooms. In the second year, the control group teachers received the SUN workshop and took the materials into their classrooms. We followed both groups of teachers and a single class of their regular biology students each year. Out of 19 treatment and 18 control group teachers responding, three in each group had taught or were also teaching AP and/or a College Advanced Placement Program (CAPP) course of biology. On average, the treatment group teachers had taught for 15&#x000a0;yr, while the control group teachers had taught for 13&#x000a0;yr. Approximately 70% of each group of teachers held a master's degree; of those, 70&#x02013;77% were in education, administration, or counseling.</p><p>We also conducted a pilot study with a small group of seven AP biology teachers and their students. Note that the quasiexperimental AP pilot had a repeated-measure design conducted over 2&#x000a0;yr without an independent AP pilot control group. Instead, the same set of AP teachers provided both the control condition in year 1 before attendance at the workshop and the treatment condition in year 2 after they had attended the SUN workshop. The AP pilot group teachers averaged 17&#x000a0;yr of experience. Of this group, 71% (5) held a master's degree, and again, &#x0223c;70% of those were in education (one teacher indicated both molecular biology and science education majors). A difference in preparation between the AP and regular biology teachers was that three of the AP teachers were certified Master Educators, while none of the treatment or control group teachers held this license.</p><p>In addition to the workshop, the SUN intervention included semiannual regional meetings, a yearly classroom visit, and deposition of implementation data online every 2 mo. During the meetings, teachers shared experiences and evaluated materials used. They were also given additional instructional materials. While the materials given to treatment group teachers were focused on biological energy transfer, those given to the control and AP group teachers pertained to other aspects of biology. During the classroom visit, teachers set out all materials used to teach these topics, and their students evaluated the materials in both a written assessment and a focus group discussion. After this, the teacher was debriefed regarding his or her experiences teaching these topics and revisited his or her own evaluations of the materials in light of the classroom discussion. Treatment group teachers were prompted by the online survey every 2 mo to provide information about specific concepts taught and materials used. Control teachers provided information about concepts taught with open-ended responses. Human subjects were protected by the MSOE Institutional Review Board protocol 2110.</p><sec><title>Administration Schedule and Analysis Methods.</title><p>Treatment group teachers attended the SUN workshop in the summer of 2009 and took new instructional materials into their designated regular biology classrooms during the 2009&#x02013;2010 school year. Teachers in the control and AP pilot groups were instructed to teach as they had in the past.</p><p>Preworkshop biological energy transfer knowledge data and self-efficacy data were obtained from all of the teachers at an initial meeting at the beginning of the 2009 SUN workshop (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Control group teachers and the AP pilot group attended the 2009 SUN workshop for only half of that first day so as to provide baseline data and learn about administration of assessments during the year. By contrast, the treatment group teachers continued to attend the 2009 SUN workshop for a full 2 wk. The workshop allowed the treatment group both to learn about biological energy transfer and to develop some confidence in using the new materials they would take with them into their classrooms. At the end of the 2009 SUN workshop, the treatment group teachers provided post data regarding biological energy transfer knowledge and self-efficacy. Neither the control group nor the AP pilot group teachers were retested at that time.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><p>Teacher assessment schedule</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">2009 workshop (August)</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">2010 workshop (August)</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Beginning</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">End</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Beginning</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">End</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treatment</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AP pilot</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>During the ensuing year, all teachers attended semiannual meetings to discuss issues related to the study and share ideas; however, only the treatment group teachers received continuing professional development related to the study (controls received unrelated professional development). In addition, each treatment and control classroom was visited to obtain student evaluations of whatever instructional materials the teachers used. This visit provided another opportunity for teachers to discuss materials used with project staff.</p><p>When all teachers gathered 1&#x000a0;yr later at the beginning of the next SUN workshop in 2010, all groups took assessments. However, only the control and AP groups stayed for the rest of the 2010 SUN workshop. They were tested again at the end of the workshop (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Semiannual meetings and classroom visits were continued during the second year after all groups had attended the workshop and were using SUN materials in their classrooms.</p><p>The pre/post gains of the teachers who took the workshop were tested for significance using the paired-samples <italic>t</italic> test. In addition, pre scores were tested for significant differences using analysis of variance (ANOVA) among the three groups. Given the significant differences discovered between the baseline data of the AP pilot group and the other two groups, gains made by the treatment group teachers as a result of the workshop were compared with both the control and AP pilot groups. In interpreting hypothesis-testing results, the type I error level was set at 0.05, a common practice for research studies like this. In other words, in the <italic>Results</italic> section, any <italic>p</italic> value lower than 0.05 is considered a significant effect. In addition to the <italic>p</italic> value, effect size measured by Cohen's <italic>d</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Cohen, 1988</xref>) is given wherever appropriate. A suggested yardstick to interpret <italic>d</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Cohen, 1988</xref>) when comparing two different groups is: 0.2 as a small effect, 0.5 as a medium effect, and 0.8 and greater as a large effect. Note that this yardstick does not apply when comparing pre- to postworkshop gains by the same group.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Teacher Knowledge and Self-Efficacy Assessments</title><p>We used mixed quantitative and qualitative methods to assess gains in teacher understanding and attitudinal changes as a result of the SUN workshop and continuing professional development. Because of the timing of assessments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>), we were able to test long-term effects of the SUN intervention 1&#x000a0;yr later relative to randomized controls who had not yet taken the SUN workshop. However, because the AP pilot study has a repeated-measure design in which the AP pilot group teachers served as a control group during the first year and as a treatment group after receiving the workshop, long-term effects on AP teachers were not measured.</p><sec><title>SUN Multiple-Choice Exam with Likert-Style Confidence Scale.</title><p>The 2009 teacher pre/post content exam contained 25 multiple-choice energy transfer questions. The 2010 exam contained an additional five items, which we added in order to evaluate them as future replacement items, but they were not considered in the analyses below. Along with each multiple-choice question, a confidence rating was sought on how confident the teacher felt in answering each item. The rating was on a Likert-scale from 1, not at all, to 5, extremely. Two exemplar questions are indicated below. Each provides four answer choices.</p><p><disp-quote><p content-type="extract"><inline-graphic xlink:href="287tbl3.jpg"/></p></disp-quote></p><p>The multiple-choice exam was based on an earlier form developed for an Upward Bound pilot by the authors and examined by our scientist advisory board. How well this exam captured the major content areas of the SUN program was investigated by constructing a test blueprint. The test blueprint maps each of the 25 items in the exam to core concepts arranged under the seven themes around which the workshop was developed. The Bloom's taxonomy level of each question was also determined by a consensus of five key personnel, using the analysis of biology content by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Crowe and colleagues as a guide (2008)</xref>. (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> for a summary and Supplemental Figure S1 for the test blueprint.) Notably, 68% of the 25 items were judged to require only lower-order cognition at the level of knowledge or comprehension. Only 20% required application of knowledge, and 12% tested higher-order cognition at the level of analysis or evaluation. The great majority of the 25 items (19) addressed cellular respiration, photosynthesis, or the comparisons of these to each other or to a hydrogen fuel cell (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Only two items tapped fundamental laws of matter and energy. While we found that instruction in control classrooms largely focused on the reactants and products, five items on the teacher multiple-choice test required knowledge of the process of cellular respiration and four items required knowledge of the process of photosynthesis to answer correctly.</p><p>To further evaluate the statistical quality of these items, we conducted an item analysis based on the posttest responses. Due to the relatively small sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 19), item difficulty and item discrimination parameters were computed based on classical test theory, under which item difficulty is defined as the percentage of correct responses, and item discrimination is the correlation between item response and total score. While the difficulty parameter shows how many teachers answered an item correctly, the discrimination parameter actually is a better index of item quality, as it tells who had the correct answer. Overall, these items were quite easy for teachers after the workshop. Out of 25 items, 14 of them were answered correctly by almost all teachers. Even the hardest item received 13 correct responses out of 19 teachers. Item discrimination was quite high for the harder items. However, we did identify some items with unsatisfactory discrimination. We will revise this test to include items that are more difficult, and hopefully therefore more discriminatory, for future use.</p></sec><sec><title>SUN Drawing with Written Explanation Assessment.</title><p>The drawing with written explanation assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and Supplemental Material) says, &#x0201c;Draw what occurs in the mitochondrion during electron transport of cellular respiration. Be as specific as possible. Explain your drawing in the box below.&#x0201d; This assessment was developed by the project to include concepts from four broad categories: 1) general lower-level criteria regarding structures and their spatial relationships, 2) the overall process of cellular respiration, 4) the specific production of ATP, and 4) energy transformations. The authors created a 35-item rubric with &#x02265;0.90 interrater reliability, based on three raters who met to clarify the rubric and gain consensus after beginning to grade and then grading independently. Sample criteria and clarifications of exemplar criteria are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>. Notice that some criteria address the same concept but vary regarding the degree of specification. For example, criteria 18 and 19 both address the formation of water when oxygen accepts electrons in cellular respiration. However, criterion 19 requires more specific information regarding the numbers of electrons and protons used as a requirement for receiving credit.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Example of a teacher drawing pre-2009 workshop, post-2009 workshop, and 1&#x000a0;yr later, at the beginning of the 2010 workshop.

We modified it to assess self-efficacy of high school teachers with regard to energy transfer. Each item is followed by five choices to indicate strongly agree (SA), agree (A), uncertain (UN), disagree (D), or strongly disagree (SD). The choices follow each item.</p><p>The total possible score on the 25-item test is 125. Three exemplars are below:

The reliability coefficient alphas (Cronbach's alpha) for the subscales of the original STEBI-A for elementary classrooms were respectively 0.92 and 0.77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Riggs and Enochs, 1990</xref>), where a value greater than 0.7 is usually considered a reliable measure. Using a sample size of 42 pretests and 24 posttests, we have determined the overall coefficient alpha for the SUN-modified STEBI-A to be 0.88, based on pretest scores, and 0.79, based on posttest scores. The coefficient alpha for the PSTE subscale (consisting of 13 items and a possible total score of 65) is 0.92, based on the pretest scores, and 0.77, based on the posttest scores. However, the coefficient for the STOE subscale consisting of 12 items is only 0.64 in each case. This is a bit lower than acceptable, but it should be noted that this sample size is not large. Therefore, we will not report the STOE subscale scores. However, we will address the overall results and results regarding the PSTE subscale, both of which represent goals of our program.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>We determined significant effects of the SUN workshop for all groups in terms of knowledge and self-efficacy, and we additionally found that the treatment group sustained significant effects even 1&#x000a0;yr later for each outcome.</p><sec><title>Teacher Knowledge Effects</title><p>While the treatment and control groups were initially similar, teachers significantly increased their understanding of biological energy transfer as a result of the SUN workshop and maintained a significant increase even 1&#x000a0;yr later compared with their preworkshop score and compared with the preworkshop 2009 scores of randomly assigned controls.

However, as determined by a paired-samples <italic>t</italic> test, participation in the SUN workshop significantly increased treatment group achievement (21.6 mean vs. 17.1 mean, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.16) to the level of the small comparison group of AP pilot group teachers who had not yet attended the workshop (21.6 mean treatment group 2009 postworkshop vs. 21.9 mean AP pilot group 2009 preworkshop; <italic>p</italic> = 0.88). Higher achievement levels by the AP pilot group teachers prior to the workshop were expected, because that group is normally responsible for teaching this content at a much more detailed level. Therefore, the treatment group teachers&#x02019; content understanding improved significantly from pre-exam to postexam by 4.6 points to 21.6, which is more than one SD above the presurvey score (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, the treatment group preworkshop and postworkshop multiple-choice exam scores are not highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.34, <italic>p</italic> = 0.16) suggesting either that initially poorly performing teachers profited more from the workshop and/or there was a ceiling effect for the initially high-achieving group.

By the end of the 2009 workshop, the treatment group increased their overall self-efficacy significantly to a mean score of 88 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). During the following school year, only the treatment group used SUN materials in the classroom; the control and AP pilot groups conducted business as usual. Over that school year, the treatment group self-efficacy mean increased to 94. This treatment group mean increase in 2010 was not significant relative to the postworkshop mean a year earlier (88, <italic>p</italic> = 0.07) but this sustained increase in self-efficacy was significant relative to that of the control group before they attended the workshop in 2010 (78, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The year-later treatment group mean in 2010 was similar to the pre-2010 workshop score achieved by the AP group. The treatment group mean was 94 in 2010, while the AP pilot group mean was 93 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.76) before they attended the workshop that year. Notably, the treatment group mean 1&#x000a0;yr after the SUN workshop was also not different than the 2010 postworkshop score of 94 achieved by the control group. In addition, even the AP pilot group significantly increased their overall self-efficacy mean as a result of the SUN workshop from 93 to 101 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>The treatment group PSTE subscale mean regarding their personal belief in their ability to teach these topics also improved significantly during the 2009 workshop (from 40 to 47, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and improved significantly <italic>even more</italic> by the 2010 preworkshop test date to 51 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) out of a possible 65 points (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref> for means and SDs). Therefore, the treatment group teachers&#x02019; belief in their ability to teach these energy topics increased significantly relative to controls after the workshop and during the first year they used these materials in their classrooms and attended semiannual meetings. Notably, the control group also significantly increased their mean PSTE score (from 38 to 51, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) as a result of the workshop, but the AP group gain from 50 to 55 out of a possible 65 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.07) was not significant.

While many efforts in the past have used the overall equations for cellular respiration and photosynthesis as the anchor for discussion, the fundamental principle taught here is that energy is released by moving electrons in thermodynamically spontaneous reactions and is available for transfer. The point is driven home by the isomorphism in language used to frame four experiences that highlight this principle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). For each experience, that language describes the ultimate electron donor, the ultimate electron acceptor, and the fact that moving electrons can do work (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). A simple ABC chart represents the standard reduction potentials and, therefore, the potential for electron movement between a variety of organic and inorganic substances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). That point of reference is then used to explain electron movement and energy transfer via moving electrons during four analogous experiences <italic>not</italic> under standard conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>): a hydrogen-plus-oxygen explosion (source experience), a hydrogen fuel cell (target experience 1), and carefully designed manipulatives (metaphor-enhanced learning objects) that allow learners to enact, practice, discuss, compare, solve problems, predict outcomes, and analyze the mechanisms of cellular respiration (target experience 2<bold>)</bold> and photosynthesis (target experience 3).</p><sec><title>Discussion of Teacher Knowledge Effects</title><p>The long-term effects of the SUN Project intervention on teacher knowledge and self-efficacy have been demonstrated in the results reported above. The effect sizes of the change in knowledge as indicated by both the multiple-choice exam mapped to the workshop themes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>) and the drawing with explanation are extremely large, given that an effect size of 0.8 is considered large when comparing across groups, but does not apply to pre- to postworkshop comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Cohen, 1988</xref>). Treatment group regular biology teachers demonstrated a 1.16 effect size gain on the multiple-choice exam as a result of the workshop and maintained a large 0.94 effect size gain a year later relative to the 2009 prescores of the randomly assigned controls. Even the small group of AP pilot teachers benefited from the workshop, demonstrating a 1.80 effect size gain pre- to postworkshop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Because of the structure of the pilot study, it was not possible to assess long-term learning by the AP teachers.</p><p>Similarly, teachers in the treatment group made very large and long-lasting gains in their ability to produce a drawing with written explanation of the process of cellular respiration in the mitochondrion. The effect size of the pre- to postworkshop gain was 3.38, as their raw scores increased from a mean of 3/35 to 23/35 criteria regarding the structures, components, mechanism, and energy transfer process during cellular respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, the treatment group teachers scored significantly higher than the small incoming AP pilot group, with a very large 1.58 effect size difference. One year later, the treatment group retained a very large 2.34 effect size increase over their preworkshop scores, which is remarkable. At that point, their achievement level was similar to the mean of the AP pilot comparison group in the absence of the workshop. As the &#x0201c;high average&#x0201d; example shows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> (with enlargements of each drawing in the Supplemental Material), this teacher was able to produce an enormous amount of accurate detail about this process even 1&#x000a0;yr later and, as she wrote, &#x0201c;without studying.&#x0201d; The year-later drawings suggest that while some detail is no longer present, the treatment group teachers have retained a thorough understanding of cellular respiration. This result for regular biology teachers is not unexpected, given that their classroom instruction focuses on the essential components of the process and not on the details.</p><p>The data also indicate that the randomly assigned treatment group and control group of regular biology teachers (16&#x02013;17% of each group also taught or had taught AP or CAPP biology) were initially equivalent with regard to their content knowledge, both in terms of the multiple-choice exam and the drawing with explanation assessment; and that their knowledge was initially significantly lower than that of a small AP teacher comparison group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). It is interesting that <italic>all</italic> teacher groups, whether those in the regular biology cohort or those teaching AP biology, significantly improved their knowledge as a result of the workshop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The ceiling effect of the multiple-choice exam may be a result of the large percentage (68%) of items requiring only recall or comprehension (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). In future studies, we will increase the number of items requiring higher-level thinking skills and also increase the number of items that focus on fundamental laws of energy transfer.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the prompts within the online implementation survey the treatment group received every 2 mo regarding concepts mentioned in class are quite similar to the concept categories present in the test blueprint (Figure S1). However, in the online data survey, &#x0201c;photosynthesis and cellular respiration&#x0201d; was a single category. For example, the survey prompted teachers to indicate the number of classes in which they mentioned &#x0201c;reactants and products of cellular respiration or photosynthesis&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;ABCs or fuel cell applied to cellular respiration or photosynthesis.&#x0201d; The control group prompts for the implementation data survey every 2 mo merely asked them to respond to an open-ended question regarding which concepts they had mentioned about photosynthesis and cellular respiration and in how many classes. Therefore, the request for data itself became a part of the SUN intervention with regard to long-term, but not short-term outcomes. The last request for online data deposition occurred 3 mo before teachers took the test in August of 2010. Teachers did not receive such prompts during the workshop, and conclusions regarding the immediate effects of the workshop are therefore not affected.</p><p>It is possible that specific recall of the wording of an online survey prompt (through inadvertent teaching to the test) helped to define the choice for one test item and narrow the choice for another. Note, however, the months between the prompt and the test. In the most egregious case, &#x0201c;Law that usable energy is lost with each transfer&#x0201d; is a prompt for online data that closely approximates the correct response among four choices to the test question &#x0201c;Which of the following statements about energy is true?&#x0201d; The correct response is &#x0201c;Some usable energy is converted to an unusable form with each transfer.&#x0201d; Those questions will be pruned as we increase the difficulty of items in future studies. Given the construction required to respond to the drawing assessment, those long-term significant effects are perhaps a more informative indicator of long-term learning, but the content is more specific. The process of asking teachers to monitor concepts taught may in fact be a strategy for long-term retention of ideas presented during professional development, but that question was not asked during this study. The survey prompts were considered necessary to document implementation of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion of Teacher Self-Efficacy Effects</title><p>The data show that treatment group teachers currently teaching regular biology who attended the SUN workshop also significantly improved their overall self-efficacy regarding the teaching of biological energy transfer relative to the randomly assigned controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). Similarly, their confidence in their knowledge increased significantly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>). Interestingly, their belief in their ability to teach these topics as indicated by the PSTE subscale improved even further after using the SUN materials and attending two professional development meetings during the following year (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>).</p><p>Before the 2009 workshop, the SUN treatment and control group teachers had a similar overall self-efficacy and confidence in their knowledge, which was significantly lower than that of the AP pilot group. However, the overall self-efficacy mean scores (out of a possible 125 points) of the SUN treatment group who attended the workshop, even a year later, were similar to the mean scores of the incoming AP pilot group (treatment group year-later mean = 94.2 &#x000b1; 7.6 vs. AP pilot group preworkshop 2010 mean = 93.1 &#x000b1; 4.2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, their confidence in their knowledge, as indicated by their confidence in each response on the multiple-choice exam on a number-line scale from 1, not at all, to 5, extremely, rivaled that of the preworkshop mean of the AP pilot group (treatment group year-later mean = 4.3 &#x000b1; 0.5 vs. AP pilot group preworkshop 2010 mean = 4.3 &#x000b1; 0.4; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>). This trend was already seen with regard to learning effects.</p><p>When the control group and the AP group attended the workshop in 2010, their scores also improved significantly on the overall measure of self-efficacy and the confidence in their answers. Even the AP pilot group of teachers increased their average confidence from &#x0201c;very confident&#x0201d; (4.3 &#x000b1; 0.4) to &#x0201c;extremely confident&#x0201d; (4.9 &#x000b1; 0.1) as a result of the workshop.</p><p>The only nonsignificant improvement was that of the AP pilot group with regard to the PSTE subscale after attending the workshop. The mean score change from 50.3 &#x000b1; 3.4 to 54.6 &#x000b1; 3.8 out of a possible 65 points had a <italic>p</italic> value of 0.07 and may reflect the small sample size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>).</p><p>The changes in both confidence in their answers and self-efficacy as a result of the SUN intervention are evident in teachers&#x02019; responses to the question &#x0201c;What has participation in the SUN Project meant to you professionally?&#x0201d; posed 1&#x000a0;yr after the SUN workshop. The most frequently used words by rank order were: students (1.42%), understanding (1.29%), energy (1.03%), and confidence/teaching (each 0.90%).</p><p>Similarly, enhanced teacher self-efficacy is reflected in comments teachers from all groups made when they were videotaped during the debriefing immediately after their classroom visit in year 2 of the study. By this time, all had brought the SUN materials into their classrooms. Teachers commented on their increased confidence in their own knowledge; the fact that they had effective materials to use in the classroom, which they had not previously had; and their expectations that students could learn the materials.

It is noteworthy that for these experienced teachers, their personal confidence in their ability to teach these topics improved during the intervening year of classroom practice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>). While the effects of the semiannual meetings and other continuing professional development cannot be disentangled, this result confirms what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Palmer (2006)</xref> predicted as a result of his work with preservice teachers.</p></sec><sec><title>Future Plans</title><p>We now have the opportunity to more carefully align our materials with the model-building progression described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Because we have only recently become aware of the literature regarding analogical scaffolding through blended representations, we will review our materials in light of these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Podolefsky and Finkelstein, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2007b</xref>). The cross-cutting energy principles recently articulated as important national educational goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">U.S. Department of Energy, 2012</xref>) require <italic>explicit</italic> use of the universal laws of thermodynamics. Common language specified by our learning progression emphasizes the first law of thermodynamics, conservation of matter and energy, with learners describing the reactants and products for each process and where free energy is stored at the beginning and end of each process. Similarly, attention can be drawn explicitly to the second law of thermodynamics, that some free energy must be converted to an unusable form with each transfer and that therefore the end of the process stores less usable energy than what was present at the beginning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, large blue box). The manipulatives also allow learners to experience conservation of matter when noting how matter is rearranged after electrons move. While we used all of this language in the previous workshop, based on recommendations from Eisenkraft and colleagues from the University of Massachusetts at the recent 2012 National Science Teachers Association meeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Eisenkraft, 2012</xref>), we are currently revising materials so as to more <italic>explicitly</italic> define application of both the first and the second laws of thermodynamics to each experience.</p><p>As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Catley and colleagues (2005)</xref>, &#x0201c;Big ideas are generative. They define a grammar of the discipline, not a simple collection of ideas&#x0201d; (p. 3). The large knowledge effect sizes reported here for the treatment group a full year after the SUN workshop versus the 2009 prescores of the randomized control group (<italic>d</italic> = 1.91 for the drawing with explanation assessment and <italic>d</italic> = 0.94 for the multiple-choice content exam) provide evidence that the SUN approach works and that knowledge gains are sustained. This evidence suggests that approaching biological energy transfer from the perspective of the work that can be done by moving electrons and the common language involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) provides a useful heuristic for teachers to learn this difficult topic. This approach allows teachers to consider why food and oxygen are essential for <italic>our</italic> lives but might not be needed for the microbes we are currently looking for on Mars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Chang, 2012</xref>). Considering energy transfer in terms of ultimate electron donors and acceptors can facilitate conversations about microbes that &#x0201c;eat&#x0201d; rocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Newman, 2010</xref>) or about photosynthetic organisms deep in the ocean that use black-body radiation from a thermal vent as a source of photons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Beatty <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The recent article about personal fuel cells from snails becomes intelligible, with its description of one electrode for the electron donor and one for the electron acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Hal&#x000e1;mkov&#x000e1; <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2012</xref>). It might be interesting to see whether teacher understanding that life is powered by moving electrons facilitates student understanding that life itself depends on physical laws.</p><p>The long-term effects on teacher knowledge and self-efficacy and the initial equivalence of the randomly assigned teacher treatment and control groups suggest this trial is well positioned to provide meaningful data regarding the downstream impact of the SUN intervention on high school biology students (unpublished data). With National Science Foundation (NSF) funding, we are currently developing a SUN Chloroplast e-book and adapting the SUN Project materials for a variety of undergraduate courses.</p></sec></sec>

We appreciate the opportunity to do this work made possible by federal funding and the guidance of retired IES program officer Dr. Harold Himmelfarb. The opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not represent views of the U.S. Department of Education. We thank undergraduate research assistants Ian Ashton, Heather Bobrowitz, Linnea Elliott, Kari Renzelman, Elise Pinkerton, Lindsey White, Anthony Gray, and Benjamin Blair for production of SUN materials within the MSOE Center for BioMolecular Modeling (CBM). The CBM is directed by Dr. Tim Herman, who contributed to a cytochrome <italic>c</italic> activity. We appreciate Mr. Ashton's help in engineering the ATP synthase model and Ms. Bobrowitz's development of a microbial fuel cell given to all participants. We also appreciate Professor Ray Arvidson of Washington University's remote presentation about Mars at the 2009 workshop. We thank the SUN scientist advisory board for their contributions to this project: Professors Rick Amasino (who has emphasized the e<sup>&#x02212;</sup> donor and acceptor in his teaching for years), Patrick Masson, and Ching Kung, as well as Drs. Michael Patrick, Michelle Harris, Jean-Yves Sgro, and Paul Williams of the University of Wisconsin&#x02013;Madison and Professors Jim Mallmann and Mike Swedish, Dean Tom Bray, and Rich Phillips of MSOE. We are also indebted to Professor Bob Blankenship and Dr. Phyllis Balcerzak of Washington University, Professors Wen Luo and Carol Hirschmugl of University of Wisconsin&#x02013;Milwaukee, and Professor Gul Afshan of MSOE for productive conversations. We thank Professor Andy Anderson of Michigan State University for access to his assessments. We especially thank Dr. John Finney, now retired from the Department of Veterans&#x02019; Affairs, for helping to frame the original research design and for his ongoing support. We are indebted to the teacher participants for their evaluations of materials, suggested improvements, and faithful execution of the responsibilities for this project. Their interest and enthusiasm invigorated our work.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Out of thin air</article-title><source>Nature</source><year>2007</year><volume>445</volume><fpage>610</fpage><lpage>611</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17287803</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><element-citation publication-type="book"><collab>American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)</collab><source>Benchmarks for Science Literacy</source><year>1993</year><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Oxford University Press</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="B11"><element-citation publication-type="book"><collab>AAAS</collab><article-title>Vision and Change in Science Education: A Call to Action</article-title><year>2011</year><comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://visionandchange.org/files/2011/03/Revised-Vision-and-Change-Final-Report.pdf">http://visionandchange.org/files/2011/03/Revised-Vision-and-Change-Final-Report.pdf</ext-link> (accessed 4 April 2012)</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Sheldon</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Dubay</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effects of instruction on college nonmajors&#x02019;
