However, several patients randomized to the treatment arm were non-responders with a suboptimal increase in hemoglobin. All patients in the trial also received oral ferrous gluconate, which could have contributed to increases in hemoglobin observed in those receiving placebo. Accordingly, we performed an analysis separating patients into responders <italic>vs.</italic> non-responders in order to determine if measured improvement in anemia would have any effect on clinical endpoints.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 56 patients (age 77 &#x000b1; 11 years, 68% female) were recruited who had anemia defined as a hemoglobin of &#x02264; 12 g/dL (average, 10.4 &#x000b1; 1 g/dL) with HFPEF defined as having NHANES-CHF (National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey: Congestive Heart Failure) criteria score of &#x02265; 3 and an ejection fraction of &#x0003e; 40% (average EF = 63% &#x000b1; 15%). Patients were randomly allocated to receive either ESA and ferrous gluconate or ferrous gluconate only. In this analysis, a responder was defined as a patient with an increase of 1 g/dL in the first 4 weeks of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Nineteen subjects were classified as responders compared to 33 non-responders. While the average hemoglobin increased significantly at the end of 6 months for responders (1.8 &#x000b1; 0.3 <italic>vs</italic>. 0.8 &#x000b1; 0.2 g/dL, <italic>P</italic> = 0.004), 50% of the subjects assigned to ESA were non-responders. Left ventricular function including ejection fraction (<italic>P</italic> = 0.32) and end diastolic volume (<italic>P</italic> = 0.59) was unchanged in responders compared to non-responders. Responders also showed no significant improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, Six Minute Walk Test (6 MWT) and peak VO<sub>2</sub>. Though QOL improved significantly within each group, there was no difference between the two.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A significant hemoglobin response to anemia treatment with ESA and oral iron does not lead to differences in LV remodeling, functional status, or QOL. Additionally, a significant percent of older adults with HFPEF and anemia do not respond to ESA therapy. Given the results of this small trial, it appears as though using objective improvements in anemia as a marker in older adult subjects with HFPEF does not have significant clinical utility.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Heart failure</kwd><kwd>Anemia</kwd><kwd>Erythropoetin stimulating agents</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is a clinical syndrome with an increasing prevalence associated with advancing age.

It had been thought that HF symptoms were produced predominately from abnormalities in diastolic function but meta-analyses of clinical trials have shown that exercise capacity is improved without observed improvements in diastolic function.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Accordingly, some have advocated a shift of focus towards comorbidities,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> including anemia, which has been shown to be a contributor to functional impairments in HFPEF.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref></p><p>Epoetin alfa, a kind of erythropoetin-stimulating agents (ESA) has been shown to be highly effective in treating anemia in patients with CKD on hemodialysis<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> however its role in heart failure is still a subject of debate.

Eligible patients were assigned in a 1: 1 ratio to receive epoetin alfa or placebo subcutaneously every week for the course of the study, which lasted 24 weeks. The primary endpoint in the original study was reduction in end-diastolic volume (EDV).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><label>2.2</label><title>Study patients</title><p>The patients enrolled were primarily older, community-dwelling patients with the diagnosis of both HFPEF and anemia. HFPEF was defined as meeting criteria for NHANES-CHF (National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey: Congestive Heart Failure) with a score of &#x0003e; 3 as well as an EF of &#x0003e; 40%. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin &#x0003c; 12 g/dL, irrespective of gender. The patients were recruited from outpatient clinics at an urban medical center and after acute hospitalizations for decompensated heart failure. Informed consent was obtained in all patients and an institutional review board at Columbia University Medical Center approved the study, which was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 00286182).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><label>2.3</label><title>Administration of study drug</title><p>ESA (Epoetin alpha, Ortho Biotec, Inc.) was administered subcutaneously every week with a pre-specified dosing algorithm. This algorithm was designed to make adjustments based on the rate of rise of hemoglobin during 1-week intervals as well as absolute hemoglobin values. Patients were carefully monitored to avoid rapid increases in hemoglobin or significant increases in blood pressure. Subjects randomized to the treatment arm initially received 7500 U of epoetin alfa while placebo subjects received the same injection volume of normal saline. Hemoglobin was measured weekly on a venous sample obtained in the patient's home via point of care system (Hemocue Inc., Sweden) and the dose of epoetin alfa was adjusted using an algorithm that took into account the current hemoglobin and rate of rise in the previous week.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> All subjects in the trial were given oral iron (ferrous gluconate 325 orally twice a day).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><label>2.4</label><title>Data collection</title><p>Three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography was performed on each patient using a conventional real-time echocardiograph, 3-dimensional acoustic spatial locater, personal computer, and custom software to derive LV chamber EDV (LVEDV), stroke volume, and EF. Functional assessment was assessed by having subjects perform a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) (twice at baseline and at 6 months) and all patients that were capable performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), which was performed at baseline and 6 months. Expired gas analysis was performed with a Metabolic Cart (Medical Graphics) with peak volume of oxygen (VO<sub>2</sub>) defined as the highest value of VO<sub>2</sub> achieved in the final 30 s of exercise. In order to determine QOL, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) was administered to all patients.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> These questionnaires were administered at baseline and at a 6-month follow up.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><label>2.5</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SE unless otherwise specified.

The placebo arm of the trial, however, also had an unanticipated rise in hemoglobin. Both cohorts received oral iron supplementation, which could have treated underlying iron deficiency anemia and contributed to the increase in hemoglobin observed in the placebo arm. This raised the question of whether or not responders to anemia treatment demonstrated improvements in cardiac function or QOL and if hemoglobin could be used as a marker for cardiovascular outcomes in this population, however the results of this analysis are in accordance with the original analysis in showing no significant clinical or structural changes.</p><p>The patients recruited in this trial were primarily older (mean age &#x0003e; 75 years), predominately women (67%), and had multiple comorbidities (including chronic pain and depression). This population mimics what is often seen in community-based studies of heart failure and such patients are characterized by a high percentage of non-responders to ESA therapy. Indeed, analysis of the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events With Aranesp Therapy (TREAT) suggests that non-responders as compared to responders are more often women with high body mass index (BMIs), cardiovascular disease, lower ferritins and high CRPs indicative of chronic inflammation.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> These characteristics are all quite common in the population with HFPEF and this trial further demonstrates the high incidence of ESA non-responders in this population with 50% of the 24 patients randomized to receive ESA failing to have a hemoglobin response of 1 g/dL in the first 4 weeks of therapy.</p><p>Further evidence suggesting a low utility for the use of ESA in heart failure was demonstrated in the Reduction of Events by Darbopoetin Alfa in Heart Failure (RED-HF) trial, which showed no improvement in all cause death or hospitalizations from heart failure but showed a significantly increased rate of thromboembolic adverse events among subjects with heart failure and reduced EF.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> Additionally, results from TREAT trial demonstrated an elevated risk of stroke when darbopoetin alfa was used to achieve a target hemoglobin of 13 g/dL.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref></p><p>ESA are also costly both in terms of monetary expenses of acquiring the medication as well as the cost of health care personnel time in administering the drug. A retrospective analysis of cancer patients receiving ESA for anemia estimated a weekly cost of $645 which would likely prove to be a financial burden in heart failure patients when compounded with a lack of evidence demonstrating reduced hospitalizations or improved symptom burden.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref></p><p>Frailty is another predominant characteristic of older adult patients with HFPEF. Though there was not a formal measure of frailty included in the beginning of the trial, the baseline 6MWT for all patients demonstrated a gait speed of 0.67 m/s which is well in the range to be considered frail. Though low hemoglobin has been independently associated with frailty risk,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> the responders in this trial did not demonstrate significant increases in gait speed when compared to non-responders (0.71 m/s <italic>vs</italic>. 0.66 m/s).</p><p>An important question with regards to anemia in heart failure is whether or not it merely serves as a surrogate marker for a poor prognosis or is itself a clinically important variable to modify. A large trial investigating the use of intravenous iron for iron deficiency with or without anemia in patients that also had heart failure with a reduced EF showed an improvement of symptoms, functional capacity, and QOL.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> This potentially suggests that iron may be possible target for therapy regardless of hemoglobin, perhaps due to the fact that iron is critical for oxidative metabolism. Iron deficiency can lead to decreased exercise capacity secondary to diminished oxygen transport and decreased oxidative capacity of muscle, which can reduce VO<sub>2</sub>.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> And even in the absence of anemia, iron deficiency can lead to increased energy expenditure and fractional utilization of peak oxygen consumption,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and supplementation in iron deficient patients without anemia can correct impaired adaptation in endurance capacity.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> Given that iron has few adverse effects compared to ESA, which have been shown to have an increased risk of thrombosis,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> supplementing with iron appears to be a safer and still effective means of treating anemia in heart failure patients.</p><p>There were several limitations to this study. The sample size was small which would lead to a higher probability of type II error and the duration of the trial was relatively short at 6 months, which makes the results more difficult to translate into clinical practice than if a larger population were studied. A large percentage of patients were also unable to complete cardiopulmonary exercise testing thereby limiting power to detect differences. We did demonstrate a &#x0003e; 1 mL/kg per minute difference in peak VO<sub>2</sub> as would be predicted from the Fick equation with correction of anemia. However, this difference did not translate into a clinically meaningful effect though there was no significant hemoglobin difference between responders and non responders in this small subset of 10 patients (<italic>P</italic> = 0.45). Additionally, the increase in hemoglobin by responders was 1.8 g/dL but because of an increase in hemoglobin of non-responders the difference in hemoglobin throughout the trial was about 1 g/dL and potentially insufficient to effect clinically evident changes, though in the original paper the change in hemoglobin was sufficient enough to provide a statistically significant difference in peak VO<sub>2</sub> in those receiving ESA compared to placebo (+1.0 &#x000b1; 0.5 <italic>vs</italic>. -1.2 &#x000b1; 0.6 mL/kg per minute) based on the Fick equation. However, a trial investigating a hematocrit goal of 42% <italic>vs</italic>. 30% via epoetin administration in patients with congestive heart failure or ischemic heart disease undergoing dialysis showed a trend towards increased mortality and myocardial infarctions,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> so there potentially could be some risk in using higher targets in this population.</p><p>As treatments for HFPEF remain limited at this point, a retrospective analysis was employed to assess improved outcomes purely based on a significant increase in hemoglobin. However, this analysis demonstrates that there is no improvement in ventricular function, QOL, or functional capacity when anemia is corrected in this patient population of older adults with HFPEF. Additionally, half of the patients receiving ESA were non-responders, which adding to the growing evidence for a lack of utility in using these agents in heart failure patients. Given the results of this small trial, treating anemia conservatively with oral therapy appears to be the more indicated course of action and hemoglobin itself does not seem to be directly a clinically important variable to modify.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This material was presented in a poster at the Heart Failure Society of America Annual Meeting, Orlando, FL, in September 2013.
