Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIC) is a physiological phenomenon whereby a brief episode of ischaemia-reperfusion protects against a subsequent longer ischaemic insult. Trials in cardiovascular surgery have shown that RIC can protect patients&#x02019; organs during surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate whether RIC could be successfully introduced in elective AAA repair and to obtain the information needed to design a multi-centre RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Consecutive patients presenting for elective AAA repair, using an endovascular (EVAR) or open procedure, in a single large city hospital in the UK were assessed for trial eligibility. Patients who consented to participate were randomized to receive RIC (three cycles of 5 min ischaemia followed by 5 min reperfusion in the upper arm immediately before surgery) or a sham procedure. Patients were followed up for 6 months. We assessed eligibility and consent rates, the logistics of RIC implementation, randomization, blinding, data capture, patient and staff opinion, and variability and frequency of clinical outcome measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Between January 2010 and December 2012, 98 patients were referred for AAA repair, 93 were screened, 85 (91 %) were eligible, 70 were approached for participation and 69 consented to participate; 34 were randomized to RIC and 35 to the sham procedure. There was a greater than expected variation in the complexity of EVAR that impacted the outcomes. Acute kidney injury occurred in 28 (AKIN 1: 23 %; AKIN 2: 15 % and AKIN 3: 3 %) and 7 (10 %) had a perioperative myocardial infarction. Blinding was successful, and interviews with participants and staff indicated that the procedure was acceptable. There were no adverse events secondary to the intervention in the 6 months following the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provided essential information for the planning and design of a multi-centre RCT to assess effectiveness of RIC for improving clinical outcomes in elective AAA repair. Patient consent was high, and the RIC intervention was carried out with minimal disruption to clinical care. The allocation scheme for a definite trial should take into account both the surgical procedure and its complexity to avoid confounding the effect of the RIC, as was observed in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN19332276">ISRCTN19332276</ext-link> (date of registration: 16 March 2012).

Patients undergoing elective AAA repair are typically a high-risk and vulnerable group with comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. They are at risk of sustaining perioperative myocardial injury (11-22 %), renal impairment (4.2- 20 %) and stroke (1 to 2 %) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Perioperative cardiac injury is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality after AAA repair, and it is associated with poor short and long-term clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Up to 70 % of patients undergoing AAA surgery have significant coronary artery disease, but a large randomised trial failed to demonstrate any significant benefit from prophylactic coronary revascularisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Hence there is a need to find new treatment strategies to reduce the risk of complications following AAA surgery.</p><p>Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIC) is a phenomenon in which a brief period of imposed sub-lethal ischaemia followed by reperfusion in one area of the body can provide systemic protection against cellular injury during a subsequent prolonged ischaemic episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Since the concept of RIC was first described, numerous laboratory studies have shown that RIC elicited through <italic>transient limb ischaemia</italic> can reduce ischaemia-reperfusion injury by a preconditioning signal. The mechanisms involve mediators (for example, adenosine, bradykinin and endogenous opioids) that are generated during ischaemia, a cascade of second messengers and target organ effectors. RIC also activates the autonomic nervous system and humoral mediators to ensure systemic spread of protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Evidence for the clinical effectiveness of RIC is mixed. Several small and one larger randomised controlled trial (RCT) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;329) have shown that RIC is protective in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and in those undergoing cardiovascular surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Significant decreases in troponin-T release were observed, and the larger trial in cardiac surgery patients showed a reduced risk of MI and all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A systematic review in cardiac surgery demonstrated a significant benefit of RIC over controls in reducing the biomarkers of cardiac injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], but a meta-analysis could not demonstrate any advantage of RIC in preventing acute kidney injury after cardiovascular interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In vascular surgery, a Cochrane review identified four small RCTs (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;232) evaluating RIC, and no overall beneficial effect was demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Vascular surgery has undergone significant change in recent years, with an increasing use of endovascular (EVAR) interventions instead of open surgery. In the UK there is also movement towards the centralisation of vascular surgery, and the AAA Quality Improvement Programme supports more emphasis on patient-centred care and an improved patient pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the context of these changes, as patients can have either an endovascular or an open surgical AAA repair, it was not clear that a large, adequately-powered, multi-centre RCT of RIC versus sham, with blinded care providers and outcome assessors, was possible. We conducted an external pilot study to determine whether a trial was feasible and to inform the choice of primary outcome for a future large multi-centre RCT. Here, we report the findings of this feasibility study, which was funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Research for Patient Benefit programme (PB-PG-0609-18150).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was designed as a blinded, single-centre, parallel group feasibility RCT with a 1:1 allocation ratio (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for CONSORT checklist).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients referred for a primary elective AAA repair as an EVAR or open procedure were eligible to take part.

The study was approved by the South West Frenchay Research Ethics Committee (ref. 10/H0107/36) and sponsored by the North Bristol NHS Trust. Patients were informed about the study and given a study information sheet when they attended the consultant-led preoperative assessment clinic 1 to 3 weeks before surgery. Written informed consent was obtained the day before surgery from patients willing to participate, when they attended the hospital for the operation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Interventions</title><p>Participants were randomised to either the RIC or sham procedure. The RIC intervention consisted of three 10-min cycles of 5 min of arm ischaemia (inflation of a blood pressure cuff to 40 mmHg above the patient&#x02019;s systolic blood pressure) followed by 5 min of reperfusion (30 min in total), immediately before surgery. The sham procedure consisted of a pressure cuff inflated for the same periods as the RIC intervention but only to 40 mmHg. Both interventions were carried out by the anaesthetic team as part of the perioperative care.</p><p>Standard surgical and anaesthetic techniques were used in both groups. All participants had an arterial cannula inserted for continuous blood pressure monitoring, and a urinary catheter inserted after induction of anaesthesia and before surgery commenced. Participants who underwent open surgery also had a thoracic epidural and a central venous catheter inserted before surgery commenced. Active warming with fluid warmers and warming blankets were used for every case. Participants were extubated at the end of surgery and transferred to a high dependency area for ongoing care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The study outcomes were as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Number of patients referred for elective AAA repair and the number and proportion eligible for the trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Number of eligible patients approached to participate and reasons for non-approach.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Number and proportion of eligible patients approached who consented to participate and reasons for non-consent.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Success of blinding those not involved directly in administering the intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Impact of the intervention on delivery of care and time taken for anaesthesia (defined as the time from when the patient entered the theatre suite until surgical knife to skin).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participant follow-up to 6 months, numbers and reasons for loss to follow-up</p></list-item><list-item><p>Completeness of clinical outcome data and frequency of the these events, in particular, indices of acute renal injury within the first 48 hours after AAA repair, as defined by the AKIN criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; cardiac events, namely myocardial infarction (MI), new arrhythmias, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and raised troponin T levels in the period prior to discharge; and complications, including stroke and death, up to 6 months after surgery.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Staff and participant views on the intervention and study conduct.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample size</title><p>A sample size of 60 participants, 30 Open and 30 EVAR procedures, was chosen to provide recruitment estimates with sufficient precision to inform a larger definitive trial; for example 50 % eligible patients recruited (worse-case scenario) would be estimated with a 95 % confidence interval of&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13 %.

These latter data were collected by the anaesthetist administering the intervention. Participants were interviewed by a study research nurse before hospital discharge and were contacted again at 6 months by telephone. Their views on the trial and the treatment received (RIC or sham) were sought, and at 6 months, details of any complications following discharge after surgery were collected. Staff interviews were conducted by a research nurse after all clinical staff had some experience of the trial. Responses to nine interview questions were recorded qualitatively and then coded.

Before the start of the study, the project was presented to this latter group. Feedback was provided anonymously.

Fifty (76 %) of the 66 participants indicated that they had no new health complaints since the surgery. The remainder reported complications related to existing co-morbidities (gradual worsening in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, dementia, and depression); or the surgery (six patients reported buttock pain and one wound breakdown).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Interim analysis</title><p>Interim analyses, carried out by a statistician independent of the study team, were planned after 20, 40 and 60 participants had been recruited. No concerns were raised after the first two analyses, but the third analysis identified a greater frequency of renal and cardiac complications in participants undergoing EVAR in the RIC group. As a result, recruitment of patients having an EVAR procedure was temporarily halted while the data were investigated further. This investigation revealed that the increased complication rate was not related to the intervention but to the predicted complexity of the EVAR procedure. The patients who had more complex EVAR surgery stayed in the hospital longer and had more complications. The findings were discussed by the study steering committee and it was agreed that recruitment should be restarted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Participant and staff interviews</title><p>All surviving participants interviewed at 6 months found the intervention acceptable and were supportive of the research. None expressed knowledge of allocation. In total, 20 staff interviews were conducted. The staff interviews covered questions about blinding and the impact of RIC on staff workload and activities. Staff interviews were conducted between August 2011 and April 2013 after the staff all had some experience of the trial. No staff member not involved in the intervention activity itself expressed knowledge of allocation. Of the 20 staff interviewed, nine (45 %) were part of the anaesthetic team responsible for delivering the intervention and 11 (55 %) were members of the theatre team, including four surgeons, one radiologist, and six scrub and theatre staff. From the staff interview questions, 86 % indicated no or minimal effect of the intervention on day-to-day practice, 11 % reported a small effect or minor point, and 1 % a moderate effect or significant point. The surgeons and radiologist all universally rated the intervention as having minimal impact on normal work patterns.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Patient-public involvement</title><p>The patient, carer and public involvement group of the AGWS considered the study important for patients. They advised on how best to integrate the trial into the patient pathway and recommended that when the trial was discussed with potential participants during the preoperative assessment the patient&#x02019;s blood pressure be taken to illustrate the RIC process. Patients who had previous AAA surgery suggested changes to the patient information leaflet and gave feedback on how and by whom patients prefer to be approached for research. The two patient representatives on the Trial Steering Committee wish to continue to be involved in further proposals based on this feasibility study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study shows that an RCT to study the RIC intervention in patients undergoing elective AAA repair is feasible to conduct and acceptable to patients and the clinical team. This study also provides essential information for the planning and structuring of an adequately powered multi-centre RCT to assess whether the RIC intervention can provide any benefit to patients who require elective AAA repair.</p><p>Surgery for AAA repair is undergoing a period of significant change both globally and in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We had intended to recruit 30 participants having an EVAR and 30 having open surgery. This was not achieved because a significantly greater proportion of patients (72 %) were referred for an EVAR procedure than predicted when the study was conceived. We could have chosen to stop recruitment to EVAR once our target of 30 participants was reached, but we decided against this for the following reasons: first, it would have prevented us obtaining recruitment estimates across the two surgical procedures, which reflects current clinical practice, and secondly we wanted to maintain study momentum and recruitment procedures and not disrupt the logistics of the study. We sought and obtained ethical committee approval to continue recruitment of patients presenting for EVAR surgery beyond our original target for this group. The response to RIC might differ between EVAR and open surgery, but this is not something we can evaluate in this study as it was not powered for comparative analysis. Any future trial should include patients from both the open and EVAR groups and be adequately powered to evaluate the effects of RIC on each type of AAA repair in a subgroup analysis.</p><p>There was variation in the complexity of EVAR surgery that might have impacted the clinical outcomes measured in this study. Across the trial, there were proportionally more AKI and cardiac events in the group of 11 complex EVAR procedures (6/11 versus 22/57 AKI events and 3/11 versus 4/58 MI). In all cases the anatomical complexities were identified before the procedure commenced. It has been shown that a high anatomic severity grading score correlates with an increase in surgical operating time, length of hospital stay, blood loss, contrast use and cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Randomization was stratified by type of procedure but did not include stratification or minimization by surgical complexity. By chance, as can happen, particularly when sample sizes are small, a greater number of participants requiring a more complex and longer EVAR procedure were randomized to RIC compared to sham. In participants who had a predicted complex EVAR, the procedure took on average 50 min longer. The randomization scheme for an adequately powered definite RCT should take into account surgical procedure, surgical complexity and participant risk, to avoid the imbalance between groups in these potential confounders, as was observed in this study.</p><p>The incidence of both acute kidney injury and cardiac events after elective AAA surgery were high (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), which is in line with previous reports in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and consistent with a recently published study, where 28/62 (45 %) of patients suffered acute kidney injury after elective open AAA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Pulmonary injury and intestinal injury are also common after elective open AAA repair; another small study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;62) has suggested that RIC might be protective against these complications in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Based on this study, cardiac events or renal injury could be chosen as a primary outcome measure for a future trial; these complications have a high incidence, are important to patients, impact NHS resources and were measured reliably with minimal missing data. This study is the first to report on the acceptability of the RIC intervention to participants and staff. Feedback indicated that it can be incorporated into the day-today clinical setting without affecting anaesthetic or procedure times. No RIC-related safety issues were reported.</p><p>Patients undergoing elective AAA repair are a high risk and vulnerable group with many co-morbidities. The risk profile, measured by V-POSSUM score, for participants undergoing elective AAA surgery in this study was 19 on average, indicating a morbidity prediction of 44.8 % and a mortality prediction of 12.8 % for elective AAA surgery in our usual patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Complications are common after both open and EVAR procedures and lead to prolonged periods in intensive care and delayed recovery, with negative effects for patients and significant costs to health services. The hospital cost per patient is estimated between &#x000a3;9,946 and &#x000a3;13,257 for patients undergoing elective AAA surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Currently the demand for elective AAA repair is increasing and, due to the aging population, as well as the new UK national screening program for men over 65 years, it will continue to increase in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The high cost of AAA repair coupled with the significant morbidity and mortality means that there is a need to identify interventions that can reduce harm and improve patient outcomes. RIC is of great interest because of its simplicity, safety, non-invasive nature and low cost. This makes the RIC intervention attractive for testing in a large pragmatic clinical trial. There have been other small, single-centre, clinical studies on the effect or RIC in patients who are undergoing elective AAA surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Large multi-centre RCTs, with blinded care providers and outcome assessors are now needed to investigate if RIC is safe and can benefit this patient group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study considered the feasibility of undertaking a RCT, and as such, it was not adequately powered to assess the effectiveness of the RIC intervention in the patient population studied. This study provided essential information for the planning and design of a multi-centre RCT to assess effectiveness of RIC for improving clinical outcomes in elective AAA repair. Our data suggest that a large multi-centre trial is feasible with modifications; the majority of patients were eligible, patient consent was high and the RIC intervention can be carried out with minimal disruption to clinical care, but there was imbalance in the surgical complexity between the groups, which impacted outcomes. A future trial would need to minimise the chance of such imbalance.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2015_899_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
