A large part of the decrease in mortality can be ascribed to vaccinations. Recent research has found that vaccines - in addition to the specific disease-preventive effects - also have unexpected general effects <xref rid="pone.0093562-BieringSorensen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093562-Aaby4" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. These so-called non-specific or heterologous effects are often beneficial by decreasing mortality from other infectious diseases than the target disease. Little is known about the biological mechanisms behind the non-specific effects, but since they are observed in areas where mortality is caused by infectious diseases, changes on the immune system may be involved.</p><p>Development of user-friendly immunological methods has made it possible to study the immunological effects of vaccines in population-based studies. At the Bandim Health Project in Guinea-Bissau, we have conducted several randomized trials to assess the impact of vaccines on overall mortality, and in subgroups of trial participants we have studied the effect of vaccines on immunological markers <xref rid="pone.0093562-Diness1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093562-Sartono1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. To understand the mechanisms behind the non-specific effects of vaccines on overall mortality, it is likewise important to identify immunological markers of subsequent mortality. Data to explore such associations are rare. In the present study we linked results of blood sample measurements with data on subsequent mortality to identify potential immunological markers of mortality. The association was studied in a cohort of low-birth-weight (LBW) children with high mortality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting</title><p>The Bandim Health Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bandim.org">www.bandim.org</ext-link>) has implemented a health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) which covers a population of approximately 100,000 people in six suburban districts of Bissau, the capital of Guinea-Bissau.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>We used data from the randomized trial &#x0201c;Should Low Birth Weight Infants Be Vaccinated With BCG Vaccine at Birth in Developing Countries?&#x0201d; (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00146302) <xref rid="pone.0093562-Aaby4" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) vaccination was given at birth to neonates with a low-birth-weight (LBW) below 2.5 kg. From 2002, LBW children born at the national hospital or at two health centers in the study area were randomized to receive early BCG (+BCG) or to follow the local policy to receive BCG when the child had gained weight, often together with DTP and OPV scheduled at 6 weeks of age (&#x02212;BCG). All children were followed up with home visits at 2, 6, and 12 months of age. Causes of death were assessed by verbal autopsy.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Processing of Blood Samples and <italic>in vitro</italic> Stimulations</title><p>From June 2004&#x02013;July 2005 we collected blood samples from a subgroup of participants when they had reached 6 weeks of age. The blood samples, approximately 600 &#x003bc;L, were taken by finger prick into heparinized tubes and kept at a maximum of 4 hours at ambient temperatures until processing. The whole-blood assay and cytokine measurements have been described in detail previously <xref rid="pone.0093562-Diness1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In brief, heparinized whole blood was diluted 1&#x02236;10 with RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) supplemented with 2 mmol glutamate/L, 1 mmol pyruvate/L, 100 IU penicillin, and 100 &#x003bc;g streptomycin/mL. Cultures were established in a total volume of 200 &#x003bc;L in 96-well U plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). Supernatants were collected in cultures stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich chemie, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) (1 day incubation), stimulated with purified protein derivative (PPD) of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (10 &#x003bc;g/mL; Statens Serum Institut, Denmark), phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) (2 &#x003bc;g/ml; Wellcome Diagnostics, Dartford, UK) and tetanus toxoid (TT) (1.5 Lf/ml; NVI, Bilthoven, the Netherlands) (3 days incubation) and in medium-only-control cultures incubated 1 day (C1) and 3 days (C3). The samples were stored at &#x02212;40&#x000b0;C in Bissau and transported to Leiden, The Netherlands on dry ice. All the samples were analyzed in November 2005. Concentrations of interleukin (IL)-5, IL-10, IL-13, interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; were measured simultaneously by the commercial Luminex cytokine kit (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) and buffer reagent kit (BioSource, Camarillo, CA) and run on a Luminex-100 cytometer (Luminex Corporation), equipped with StarStation software (Applied Cytometry Systems, Dinnington, United Kingdom). The lower detection limits (DL) of the assays were 3, 5, 10, 5 and 10 pg/ml for IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;, respectively. Concentrations below the DL were denoted as non-detectable (ND). The samples were measured in two rounds using two different batches.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All analyses were performed using Stata 12 (Statacorp LP, College Station, TX). A significance level of 0.05 was used for all analyses.</p><p>For TT stimulations, the cytokine concentrations were very similar in stimulated and control samples indicating little effect of the stimulation. For all cytokines from the C3 samples (except TNF-&#x003b1;) more than 50% of the measurements were ND leaving very little information to assess the association with mortality. Therefore, these results were not presented. One child who died had a missing measurement of IL-13 to PPD and hence the mortality analysis using this variable as covariate did not include that child.</p><p>The association between cytokine production and mortality was analyzed by standardized z-score variables. The cytokine log<sub>2</sub>-concentrations were standardized by BCG randomization, sex and measurement batch (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) creating log-z-score variables with mean 0 and variance 1.</p><p>Mortality was assessed at 1 year of age. The follow-up time was censored if the family moved and the child was lost to follow-up. If a child died, a medical doctor conducted a verbal autopsy with the mother or relatives. Crude mortality rates (MR) were presented according to percentiles of the log-z-scores. To examine whether very low and very high concentrations were associated with high mortality, the distributions were split at the percentiles: 1&#x02013;10%, 11&#x02013;50%, 51&#x02013;90% and 91&#x02013;100%.</p><p>The association between the mortality rate and a log-z-score was analyzed in a Cox-model with time since bleeding as underlying time and with age and the log-z-score as covariates. ND cytokine concentrations were only known to be below the DL (censored at DL); the true values were not known. Hence, the corresponding covariate-values in the Cox-regression were also censored. Substituting the unknown quantities with a single value (e.g. DL) would likely distort the regression. Instead, we used multiple imputations (MI) to handle this censoring problem (see further details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093562.s004">Methods S1</xref>). V-shaped associations between the log-z-score and the log-MR were estimated as two log-linear relationships below and above the median, restricting the two lines to connect at the median (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093562.s004">Methods S1</xref>). More flexible shapes were illustrated graphically.</p><p>We applied complicated methods of analysis to a dataset with only 22 deaths. The results were therefore sensitive to model assumptions. To accommodate these concerns and to give more simple and transparent illustrations of the associations, we also illustrated the raw cytokine log<sub>2</sub>-concentrations for dead and alive children in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093562.s001">Figures S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093562.s002">S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093562.s003">S3</xref>, we presented more crude analyses stratifying the log-z-scores by percentiles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093562-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093562-t002">2</xref>) and basic information about each of the dead children was presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093562-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The immunological study offered a rare opportunity to explore associations between cytokine responses and subsequent mortality risk. Both low and high cytokine responses to stimulation with LPS and PHA were associated with high mortality during follow-up. Deaths occurring shortly after bleeding were mainly associated with low responses, while deaths occurring longer after bleeding were associated with high responses. In BCG-vaccinated children a higher IFN-&#x003b3; response to PPD was associated with better survival.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Limitations</title><p>Only children surviving to the age of 6 weeks could be included in the immunological study. Thus, the observed associations between cytokine responses and subsequent mortality only applied to surviving children. We measured stimulated cytokine production from whole blood. Pathogens are often fought in less accessible compartments as lymph nodes or mucosa associated lymphoid tissue and whole blood may not reflect the capacity in these compartments. Infants who died shortly after bleeding may have had an ongoing infection. Indeed, we found increased mortality risk in children with a high TNF-&#x003b1; concentration in the control sample. Peripheral mononuclear blood cells could therefore have exited circulation and homed to the secondary lymphoid organs. Unfortunately, we do not have blood cell counts to corroborate this. Hence, it is a concern that the cause of death caused low cytokine production rather than the other way around. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093562-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows that children who had low responses to one stimulant generally had high responses to other stimulants. Thus, there were some cells present in the blood sample to produce cytokines. Overall, the study was small and explorative and the associations should be interpreted with appropriate caution.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Interpretation</title><p>Stimulation of whole blood is a measure of the potential for activated cytokine production. LPS from gram-negative bacteria binds to LPS-binding protein and this complex binds to CD14, which is predominantly found on monocytes or macrophages. CD14 signals through Toll like receptor (TLR)-4, leading to NF-&#x003ba;B activation and the production of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 <xref rid="pone.0093562-Baumgarten1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093562-Beutler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Whole blood cytokine production after LPS stimulation was found to correlate with monocyte production <xref rid="pone.0093562-Damsgaard1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and thus serves as a measure of activation of the innate immune response. Conversely, PHA is a lectin that stimulates T-cells <xref rid="pone.0093562-Licastro1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The subsequent response may be interpreted as the potential for cytokine production by cells partaking in the adaptive immune response. IFN-&#x003b3; is critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral and intracellular bacterial infections <xref rid="pone.0093562-Schroder1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. IL-5 and IL-13 are classical Th2 cytokines, promoting B cell growth and maturation, activating eosinophil granulocytes, promoting the defense against parasites, in addition to playing active roles in asthma and allergy disorders <xref rid="pone.0093562-Okoye1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>In general, mortality was associated with low but also with high cytokine responses to LPS or PHA. We hypothesize that the high mortality among children with a low potential for cytokine production after stimulation of cells from both the innate and adaptive immune system reflects a weakened potential to fight intruding pathogens. The condition could be compared to immune paralysis, a term often used to describe the increased susceptibility to secondary infections after sepsis <xref rid="pone.0093562-Schwandt1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> or the immune exhaustion among patients with untreated HIV <xref rid="pone.0093562-Khaitan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093562-Wherry2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. It was recently reported that an indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB test, due to a very low positive control in terms of the IFN-&#x003b3; response to PHA, was associated with high mortality within the subsequent 6 months of follow-up <xref rid="pone.0093562-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This supports that a low IFN-&#x003b3; response to PHA is a predictor of subsequent mortality. It is interesting that very high cytokine responses also were associated with increased mortality. We speculate that this reflects a higher risk of an exaggerated, harmful immune response among these individuals. Further studies are required to explore this.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Cytokine Production in Response to PPD</title><p>Among the children randomized to receive BCG at birth, there was a significant negative association between the IFN-&#x003b3; response to PPD and subsequent mortality.

It remains to be tested whether a strong response reflects an underlying stronger immune system or whether the association reflects that the children who were vaccinated correctly <xref rid="pone.0093562-Roth2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> had better survival, i.e. a beneficial non-specific effect of BCG.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Perspectives</title><p>Our results support that a well-functioning state of the immune system depends on a subtle balance between strength and moderation in responsiveness to foreign pathogens. Specifically, we showed that both the upper and lower extreme cytokine levels were associated with an increased mortality risk. Several studies have explored associations between cytokines and sudden infant death <xref rid="pone.0093562-Ambalavanan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093562-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. One study concluded that very high cytokine concentrations in serum or cerebrospinal fluid, obtained during autopsy, were a possible explanation for the cause of death <xref rid="pone.0093562-Vennemann1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. A study of extremely low-birth-weight children found bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death to be associated with higher concentrations of IL-1&#x003b2;, -6, -8, -10 and IFN-&#x003b3; and lower concentrations of IL-17 <xref rid="pone.0093562-Ambalavanan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In this study the cytokine concentrations where analyzed as linear risk-factors; the risk was not assessed specifically in the lower and upper extremes. The association between anergy and morbidity has been investigated in a few studies. Anergy is a state of non-responsiveness to stimulation in for instance skin-tests. It may be caused by low inflammatory or high regulatory cytokine responses locally <xref rid="pone.0093562-Enk1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. A study from Bangladesh reported a higher frequency of diarrheal morbidity in children with lack of a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to recall antigens applied by skin test <xref rid="pone.0093562-Koster1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Similarly, a strong associationn was found between the lack of a DTH response and follow-up mortality in hospitalized Canadian adults <xref rid="pone.0093562-Christou1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, the studies did not analyze the association specifically in the upper extreme strata. The present study indicates that <italic>in vitro</italic> cytokine responses may serve as useful surrogate markers of health status, at least in low-birth-weight children, and hence may have potential to serve as outcomes in the testing of vaccines and other health interventions in low-mortality areas.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0093562.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
