Eosinophils are cells recognized to be a key feature of allergic asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], however patients with severe asthma have increases in both eosinophils and neutrophils in their sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, severe asthma exacerbations are associated with bronchial mucosal eosinophilia and neutrophilia, as well as upregulation of CXC chemoattractants and their receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although current asthma therapies such as corticosteroids are effective in inhibiting eosinophilic inflammation through Th2 suppression, they may enhance neutrophil accumulation into the airways and until now therapies that effectively suppress neutrophilic inflammation have been lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The intracellular signalling molecules, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), are implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma; they promote smooth muscle relaxation and inhibit inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A novel approach for therapeutic intervention in asthma is through regulation of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity, which is the only cellular pathway available for degradation of cAMP and cGMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Roflumilast has been shown to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and has recently been approved in the EU and Canada for oral once-daily treatment of severe COPD.</p><p>Roflumilast is a selective inhibitor of the PDE4 isoform which is specific for cAMP degradation, and is expressed in several effector cells central to the pathophysiology of asthma including eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. As a significant increase in PDE4 activity has been reported in patients with asthma or allergy compared with healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], it is therefore of interest to explore PDE4 inhibition as a potential therapeutic option for treatment of atopic asthma, given the proposed anti-inflammatory mode of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Subjects with allergic asthma develop an immediate IgE-mediated early asthmatic response (EAR) following inhalation of a sufficient dose of an allergen to which they are sensitized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Up to 50% of these subjects also develop a late asthmatic response (LAR) beginning 3 to 4 hours after allergen inhalation challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and an associated elevation in levels of eosinophils, basophils and mast cells, other effector cells including T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and Th2-related cytokines and chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Roflumilast is a potent and targeted PDE4 inhibitor, approved by the European Commission as an add-on to bronchodilator therapy for the treatment of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with chronic bronchitis in adults with a history of frequent exacerbations, and targets the underlying inflammation in COPD. We hypothesized that roflumilast would attenuate allergen-induced LAR and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) through inhibition of airway inflammation. Some of the results of this study have been previously reported in the form of an abstract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Forty-seven non-smoking subjects with mild atopic stable asthma underwent screening for this study.

EAR was defined as the largest fall in FEV<sub>1 </sub>within 2 h after allergen challenge, and LAR was defined as the largest fall in FEV<sub>1 </sub>between 3 h and 7 h after allergen challenge. The early and late responses area under the curve (AUC) were calculated from 0-2 h and 3-7 h, respectively (AUC 0-2h, AUC 3-7h) by plotting the response using graphics software that calculated the area of the FEV<sub>1</sub>-time response and expressed as liters by hours (Lxh).</p></sec><sec><title>Sputum Analysis</title><p>Sputum was induced and processed using the method described by Pizzichini and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The total cell count was determined using a Neubauer hemocytometer chamber (Hausser Scientific, Blue Bell, PA) and expressed as the number of cells per gram of sputum. Cells were prepared on 4 glass slides. Two slides were stained with Diff Quik (American Scientific Products, McGaw Park, IL) and duplicate differential counts (400 cells/slide) were averaged. Two slides were fixed in Carnoy's solution (60% ethanol, 30% chloroform and 10% glacial acetic acid), stained with toluidine blue (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,. MO) which stains the nuclei of all cells pale blue, and glycosaminoglycan-containing granules in the cytoplasm of mast cells and basophils stain metachromatically red/purple. Five thousand cells on each of the two slides were assessed for positive metachromatic staining, and expressed as the number of metachromatic cells per gram of sputum. Supernatant was stored at -70&#x000b0;C and assayed in duplicate using commercial ELISAs for interleukin (IL)-8, myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).

We hypothesized that oral roflumilast would also attenuate allergen-induced airway inflammation, including neutrophilia, which is not generally a target for asthma treatment asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This study examined the safety of 14 days' oral treatment with roflumilast 500 mcg in patients with mild asthma and its effects on allergen-induced airway inflammation. The results show that roflumilast attenuated allergen-induced accumulation of inflammatory cells and inflammatory mediators.</p><p>In asthma, there is an increase in the number of inflammatory cells within the airways. It is believed that through the release of their mediators and enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] these effector cells contribute to the persistence of inflammation, AHR and increased bronchial tone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Roflumilast is a selective PDE4 inhibitor, this inhibition leads to increased cAMP levels in inflammatory cells, rendering them less likely to respond to stimuli. Thus, cell functions, including chemotaxis, survival and activation, which are mediated through cAMP, will be impaired with roflumilast treatment. Roflumilast has been shown to block inflammatory cell influx through inhibition of P- and E-selectin expression on endothelial cells, and CD11b expression on neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and blocks the release of various inflammatory mediators including TNF-alpha, LTB<sub>4</sub>, IL-4 and IL-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In keeping with the proposed broad anti-inflammatory effects of roflumilast, the allergen-induced increase in eosinophils, neutrophils, MCC and total leukocyte counts in sputum were inhibited with active treatment. This inhibitory effect on inflammatory cell numbers was also observed in the sputum of subjects with COPD where 500 mcg roflumilast once daily for 4 weeks decreased the total cell count [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that roflumilast would suppress the migration and activation of cells involved in the allergic immune response in the airways following allergen inhalation challenge, and thus reduce the physiological responses of EAR, LAR and AHR. This study demonstrates that roflumilast attenuates allergen-induced physiologic responses in subjects with mild allergic asthma, albeit the effect is small as compared to inhaled corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Inhibition of physiologic responses is coincident with a larger inhibition of airway inflammation, especially the neutrophil population. Airway neutrophilia has been shown to be elevated in severe asthma, however this could be due, in part, to inhaled corticosteroid treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. As such, the role of the neutrophil in asthma is still uncertain. Mast cells and basophils are positioned to play a major role in the development of the EAR following IgE-dependent release of histamine and cysteinyl leukotrienes. Inhibition of activation of MCC in sputum by inhaled allergen provides one mechanism for inhibition of the EAR by roflumilast. Likewise, reduced accumulation of eosinophils, neutrophils and their mediators in the airways post allergen reduces inflammatory signals that contribute to development of the LAR. Inhibition of allergen-induced EAR and LAR and AHR is unlikely to be mediated through smooth muscle relaxation because we did not observe improvements in FEV<sub>1 </sub>post-dosing consistent with the lack of direct bronchodilatory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first study to demonstrate inhibition of both allergen-induced airway eosinophilia and neutrophilia with pharmacological intervention, and suggests that the broad anti-inflammatory properties of roflumilast may be effective in attenuating the airway neutrophilic inflammation, which is not well-controlled by corticosteroids.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>AE: adverse event; AHR: airway hyperresponsiveness; AUC: area under the curve; cAMP: cyclic adenosine monophosphate; cGMP: cyclic guanosine monophosphate; COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; EAR: early asthmatic response; ECP: eosinophil cationic protein; FEV<sub>1 </sub>: forced expiratory volume in one second; IL: interleukin; LAR: late asthmatic response; MCC: metachromatic cells; PC<sub>20 </sub>: The provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV<sub>1</sub>; PDE4: phosphodiesterase 4; PK: pharmacokinetics; SEM: standard error of the mean.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study was funded by NYCOMED.
