Therefore, this study sought to use light microscopy to determine the prevalence of crystalluria and identify the crystals in the urine of HIV/AIDS patients on HAART at the KATH, Kumasi, Ghana.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a simple randomised cross-sectional study conducted at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Kumasi in the Ashanti Region of Ghana from January to April, 2013. A total of 200 HIV positive participants, comprising 150 on HAART and 50 HAART-na&#x000ef;ve were recruited from the HIV clinic. A well-structured pretested questionnaire was used to obtain personal information and clinical history of subjects after written informed consent had been obtained. Ethical approval was obtained from The Committee on Human Research, Publication and Ethics, School of Medical Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (CHRPE/SMS/KNUST) prior to the commencement of the study.</p><p>Persons with any acute or chronic infection (renal or hepatic diseases) or gouty arthritis, family history of recurrent kidney stones as well as those on drugs that can precipitate crystalluria (sulphonamides) were excluded from the study. Patients on HAART but defaulting treatment as prescribed were also excluded.</p><p>Venous blood (3 ml) was collected into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes for the estimation of the CD4+ count. Early morning urine (8-10 ml) was collected into transparent, clean, dry, leak-proof and wide mouth screw-capped plastic containers. The samples were then sent to the parasitology laboratory for routine urinalysis.</p><p>Each specimen was examined macroscopically and its appearance and colour recorded as either clear, hazy, turbid, straw to amber, milky, bloody, or colourless.</p><p>Chemistry analysis was performed on the urine sample for the pH, specific gravity (SG), blood and protein using a dipstick (DIRUI A, China).</p><p>The urine was centrifuged at 500-1000 g for 3-5 minutes and a wet preparation of urine deposits examined using the &#x000d7; 10 and &#x000d7; 40 objectives of a light microscope (Olympus, Olympus Corporation of the Americas, USA) for the presence and identification of crystals.</p><p>The CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was estimated using the BD FACS Count system (FACS Count, California, USA).</p><p>Data was analysed using Microsoft excel 2010 and GraphPad Prism (version 5) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>). Data were summarised using frequency tables and bar charts.

Majority of the participants were females in their third decade of life. Most of the females (61.9%) had basic education with only a few (2.6%) having tertiary education. There was a significantly higher SG among the females compared to the males (<italic>P</italic> = 0.040), and the urine pH was also higher among the females than the males but the difference was not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.570). Eight (5.1%) and 15 (9.5%) females had proteinuria and haematuria, respectively, whereas none of the males had proteinuria and haematuria. Majority of the females had crystalluria compared to the males. The females had an insignificantly higher mean CD4+ count compared to the males.

Several studies conducted in advanced countries used sophisticated methods to examine crystalluria in HIV patients on HAART.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This study used light microscopy to determine the prevalence of crystalluria among HIV/AIDS persons on HAART, and also identified the routine crystals present in their urine. The prevalence of crystalluria, using light microscopy, was higher among HIV-infected persons on HAART than in HAART-na&#x000ef;ve participants, and calcium oxalate and triple phosphate crystals were present in the urine.</p><p>The calcium oxalate and triple phosphate crystals found in this study is consistent with earlier observations made in Milano Italy, which recorded a high prevalence of calcium oxalate and triple phosphate crystals in the normal population.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The presence of calcium oxalate crystals corroborate the findings of,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> who demonstrated a high prevalence of calcium oxalate crystals in the normal population in a cross-sectional study conducted in Morocco. This is expected due to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in normal subjects, often as a consequence of ingestion of vegetable foods,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> in stone formers, in patients with hyperoxaluria, or after ethylene glycol poisoning. Triple phosphate crystals are also mostly found during urinary tract infection caused by urea-splitting bacteria.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Crystal formation in HIV subjects on HAART has been associated with the use of protease inhibitors.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> On the contrary, in this study, only HIV subjects on first line of treatment (without protease inhibitors) presented with crystalluria. This might be due to the use of light microscopy in the examination of the urine samples rather than more specific methods such as infrared spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and phase-contrast microscopy with polarised filters.</p><p>The highest prevalence of crystalluria was found in HIV patients aged between 40 and 50 years. This is concordant with the higher frequency of crystalluria observed in normal adults aged 40 years and above in a cross-sectional study.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>In agreement with observations made in this study, low pH and increased SG (hypersthenuria) have been shown to influence crystals and stone formation in a retrospective descriptive study conducted among proven urolithiaisis patients.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Crystalluria leads to stone formation, which can predispose HIV patients to acute renal failure.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Crystal formation depends mainly on the composition of urine, since urine is a metastable liquid containing several coexisting substances that can crystallise to generate renal calculi.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The presence of crystalluria among HIV patients in our study, suggests that these patients are at risk of urolithiaisis and possibly renal failure, if the necessary corrective measures are not taken.</p><p>Inability to compare our findings with that obtained from the use of more specific methods serves as a major limitation of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>HAART associated crystal formation in urine is common among HIV patients. This is linked with an increased SG and low pH. In low resource settings light microscopy is of diagnostic value in the detection of crystalluria.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>We are grateful to the participants and,
