When placed in foster care, problems tend to persist or even worsen and increase the risk of placement breakdown. Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers is an intensive behavior-focused program for young foster children (3 to 7&#x000a0;years) aiming to provide children with a positive and stimulating foster family setting and individually tailored behavioral interventions. This study will be the first to examine the effectiveness of Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers outside the US and to examine the effectiveness across a broader range of problems related to foster care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a randomized controlled trial, wherein we expect to include 80 child-foster carer dyads. Forty dyads will be assigned to Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers and 40 to treatment as usual, following pre-randomization. Data to be gathered concern problem behavior, symptoms of attachment disorder, post-traumatic stress symptoms, quality of life, hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary axis functioning, parental stress and autonomic reactivity, to be collected via questionnaires, observations, interviews, saliva and recording at six time-points over 24&#x000a0;months. To compare treatment outcomes, Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests and repeated measures (mixed models) and independent t-tests will be used. All analyses will be performed following the intention-to-treat principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Examining the generalizability of previous findings in the US and extending these previous findings is a step towards improving knowledge about treatment of young foster children with severe behavioral, emotional and attachment problems.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1747">NTR1747</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Attachment</kwd><kwd>Autonomic reactivity</kwd><kwd>Behavior</kwd><kwd>Cortisol</kwd><kwd>Foster care</kwd><kwd>Preschool children</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The large proportion of young children in the foster care population is of concern, with children younger than five years old representing over a third of foster children in the US (33% of 400,540 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]) and the Netherlands (36% of 8,944 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Children often enter foster care after serious neglect and abuse. Among foster children, there is wide variation in behavioral and relationship functioning, which is on average more problematic compared with that of children living with biological parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Foster children often suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] as well as more complex traumatic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], more disorganized attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and high frequencies of clinical symptoms of disturbed attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Additionally, adverse or inconsistent caregiving tends to cause atypical functioning of children&#x02019;s biological stress systems, such as changes in the hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary (HPA) axis, represented by abnormal cortisol segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and altered stress regulation activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. After placement in foster care, problems tend to persist or even worsen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and not only negatively affect the parenting behavior of foster carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] but also increase the risk of placement breakdown. Placement breakdown may start a vicious circle in which the chance of another failure increases with every breakdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The last alternative is often residential placement, which fails to provide opportunities for developing attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], causes developmental delays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and places children at further risk. To prevent foster children from further problems, these children are in need of evidence-based programs that combine foster placement with effective treatment of emotional and behavioral disorders and parental stress. Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers (MTFC-P) tends to address these needs, providing a positive and stimulating foster family setting for these children. Foster caregivers are taught effective behavioral management strategies and children receive individually tailored behavioral interventions. Dozier and Rutter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] suggested that when foster carers and children gain control over behavioral problems, the potential for the development of a (secure) attachment relationship increase. The absence of behavioral problems results in less parental stress for the foster carers, allowing them to better respond to the child in a sensitive and nurturing way - supporting children&#x02019;s belief in the caregiver&#x02019;s availability. With the increase of (secure) attachment behaviors, the risk of disturbed attachment declines, because behaviors of either type are theoretically incompatible with one other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies in the US have shown that, relative to children in regular foster care, children in MTFC had fewer placement failures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], improved HPA axis functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], increased secure attachment behavior and less resistant behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Although MTFC-P is quite successful in the US and transportability of the MTFC model for older children has been shown in a Swedish context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the efficacy of the preschool version has not been replicated in other countries where implementation challenges and cultural differences may play a role. Outside the US, in the Netherlands, only a small pilot study was conducted, preliminary to this study. Early findings suggested less problem behavior in the MTFC-P intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>This protocol is for a study intending to examine whether US findings regarding MTFC-P also apply for children in foster care in the Netherlands. The study also aims to extend on previous studies by examining the effects of MTFC-P on post-traumatic stress symptomatology, symptoms of attachment disorder and quality of life. With the present study, we compare the effects of MTFC-P with a treatment as usual (TAU) for foster children at risk for placement breakdown. We hypothesize that MTFC-P is more effective than TAU for young foster children with emotional and behavioral disorders. Effectiveness is measured in terms of decreased problem behavior; fewer symptoms of disturbed attachment; fewer severe post-traumatic stress symptoms; improved quality of life; recovery of HPA-axis functioning, indicated by recovery of atypical cortisol activity; and less parental stress. We expect that, relative to control children, at the end of the treatment children in the MTFC-P group will show less maladaptive responses of the ANS, indicated by heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia and pre-ejection period, to separation and reunion with caregivers and strangers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Eligible participants are children between 3 and 7&#x000a0;years, referred to our department of Treatment Foster Care at De Bascule, Academic Center for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (Amsterdam, Netherlands).

TAU comprises a 3-month diagnostic phase and 9-month treatment phase, delivered by a multidisciplinary team (system therapist, developmental psychologist, child psychiatrist and social worker). Outcomes of the diagnostic phase direct the treatment that will be provided, for example, trauma therapy, parent&#x02013;child interaction therapy, individual therapy, medication or a combination of these. In addition, during the treatment phase, foster carers receive two-weekly coaching from a social worker, to enhance parental skills and to provide the foster carers with support. They also participate in systemic family therapy sessions, together with children and other important family members.</p><p>MTFC-P is an intensive behavior focused program for young foster children (3 to 7&#x000a0;years of age), aiming to decrease children&#x02019;s problem behavior and increase social behaviors to promote further placement stability. For 9&#x000a0;months, children are placed with therapeutic foster carers. Therapeutic foster carers are highly trained foster carers who work as semi-professionals closely with MTFC-P staff. MTFC-P is delivered through a treatment team approach, by a specially trained MTFC-P team led by a program supervisor. Children receive individual training and weekly therapeutic playgroup from a skill trainer. Therapeutic foster carers participate in weekly group meetings and receive frequent home visits and ongoing support from a foster carer consultant. A family therapist supports important members of the biological family. Children receive behavioral interventions that are based upon Patterson&#x02019;s theory of coercion with its principles of social learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], to stimulate pro-social behavior and diminish behavioral problems. A key notion is that behavioral problems result from reinforcing negative behavior and lack of modeling of positive behavior. To tackle this, MTFC-P makes use of two principal techniques. First, skills trainer and therapeutic foster carers reward positive behavior. Second, therapist and foster carers ignore negative behavior; instead, they offer an alternative or put the child on a short time-out from contact. Therapeutic foster carers are responsible for the continuity of children&#x02019;s behavioral interventions. To maintain a beneficial treatment setting for children, therapeutic foster carers are therefore encouraged to stay consistent and responsive toward the child. In addition, they receive parental strategies to promote positive behavior and effective non-abusive limit setting for problem behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. After the initial 9&#x000a0;months, children are transferred to an aftercare setting. Here, the skills trainer continues children&#x02019;s training and foster parents (or birth parents in case of reunification) receive parenting practices for approximately 3&#x000a0;months. Although the US aftercare setting is an adoptive family or the birth family, in the Netherlands children are then placed in a permanent foster family or the birth family. Adoption of foster children in the Netherlands is rare, as the primary aim of foster care services is reunification with the birth parent. Furthermore, because after MTFC-P children no longer need intensive treatment, it is not intended that children stay with the therapeutic foster carers. These trained foster carers will adopt a new child for 9&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>Measures are directed towards primary and secondary objectives.

Heart rate is automatically extracted from VU-AMS in beats per minute. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia, defined as the variability in heart rate based on differences between the largest and shortest inter-beat intervals in milliseconds during respiration, is automatically calculated by the VU-DAMS.

The DAI is a dichotomous measure reflecting symptoms of disturbed attachment (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;not or somewhat present, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;definitely present). From cross-sectional data it is known that the prevalence of symptoms of disturbed attachment in comparable populations is approximately 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Based on unpublished pilot data, which also suggested 40% of participants would be symptomatic at any time-point in the TAU intervention, we expect that in the present randomized controlled trial (RCT), a 40% level of symptomatic individuals will be maintained until the end of the TAU. Based on Fisher and Kim&#x02019;s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], which reported increased secure attachment behavior (behavior that is incompatible with disturbed attachment) after MTFC-P, we expect a decline of disturbed attachment over the course of the MTFC-P. The aim is to reduce the proportion of children with symptoms of disturbed attachment to 5% at the end of MTFC-P. Including 34 children in both conditions can statistically reveal a difference between conditions with 90% power, using Fisher's exact test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level for analysis. The study was initially planned as a &#x02018;normal&#x02019; pre-randomization trial. However, we observed low recruitment of participants because children arrive in a crisis situation and obtaining consent from biological parents was problematic (see below, Randomization). We therefore changed to a pre-randomization with single consent method to allow the birth parents enough time to decide on their participation. Parents of children randomized to MTFC-P who refused consent received TAU after randomization. We expected a 10% cross-over rate. This cross-over rate reduces the efficiency of the trial by 19% and requires a 20% addition to the sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. We therefore augmented the planned sample size from 34 to 40 per treatment arm (under 90% power) to counter the dilution effects by the cross-overs in the intention-to-treat analysis and to diminish the type II error probability.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Eligible children are recruited from the department of Treatment Foster Care at De Bascule, Academic Center for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (Amsterdam, Netherlands). Children&#x02019;s legal authorities and foster carers receive information about the study. After approximately one week, a researcher contacts them and asks if all the information is understood. When children&#x02019;s legal authorities or foster carers are interested in participation, an appointment is made to sign explicit informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Random allocation to either condition is needed to reduce selection bias and to be able to attribute effects to MTFC-P or TAU. However, referral to foster care is often made in crisis and immediate start of care is a prerequisite. The start of foster care is also usually accompanied by resistance or absence of the biological parent (the child&#x02019;s legal authority) or a vacuum in authority. We expect this brief time interval between referral and start of the intervention, together with inaccessibility of a legal authority, to hamper random allocations. Following conventional randomization, researchers are unable to ensure that the child&#x02019;s legal authority has retrieved, understood and signed informed consent before the child must be allocated to a treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. This results in a preliminary loss of participants. A pre-randomization trial, wherein randomization is determined prior to informed consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], is implemented as this promotes the inclusion of participants by extending the time period between referral and start of treatment. Researchers then have more time to obtain informed consent, avoiding preliminary dropout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. An independent researcher makes a random allocation list, varying per time period. Distribution of assignment to both conditions varies over time periods (approximately every six months), based on available treatment places. This is necessary to guarantee that children receive immediate treatment and are not placed on a wait list. Conditions are disclosed to the treatment team and participants immediately after referral. If legal authorities will not sign informed consent, children receive TAU. The condition is not disclosed to any members of the research team concerned with coding data.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Data is collected at six time-points over 24&#x000a0;months: T(1) at start, T(2) 3&#x000a0;months after start, T(3) 6&#x000a0;months after start, T(4) 9&#x000a0;months after start (end of treatment), T(5) 12&#x000a0;months after start and T(6) 24&#x000a0;months after start. Parents and teachers are asked to fill out the questionnaires at all six measurements occasions. Questionnaires are sent to their homes, but when necessary researchers will help them filling out the questionnaires by telephone or face-to-face. The DAI interview is administered by telephone at T(2) and T(4) by a trained interviewer. Saliva is collected at T(2), T(3) and T(4) on five consecutive days, three times a day (see Measures).

The experimental condition, MTFC-P is compared with treatment as usual using randomized allocation. Relevance for this study derives from a shortage in evidence-based programs combining foster care placements with effective treatment of behavioral, emotional and attachment disorders, while the population of young foster children is still growing and problems become more taxing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Various treatment foster care programs have been developed across the world, many lacking a clear treatment protocol or theoretical framework. This partly explains why only a few, diverse and small-scale studies on treatment foster care programs have been published. Although these studies have documented positive outcomes, the generalizability of their outcomes remains uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Fisher&#x02019;s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] is one of the first to examine the effectiveness of foster care placement with active treatment of emotional and behavioral disorders using random allocation. Although MTFC-P is proven successful in the US, its efficacy has only been tested by its developers and not been replicated by other researchers and in other countries where cultural differences may play a role and TAU is country and institution specific. This study will be the first to examine the effectiveness of MTFC-P outside the US and the first to examine the effects of MTFC-P on post-traumatic stress symptomatology, symptoms of attachment disorder and quality of life. A small pilot investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] suggested promising outcomes, with fewer problem behaviors over the course of the intervention. Because this pilot was an uncontrolled and non-randomized trial, the present study was initiated as an addition to it.</p><p>Including sufficient participants using random allocation is a major challenge in this study. Following conventional randomization we do not expect researchers to be able to ensure that the child&#x02019;s legal authority signs informed consent before the child must be allocated to a treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Referral to foster care is often made in crisis and immediate start of care is a prerequisite. Concurrently, start of foster care is usually accompanied with resistance or absence of the biological parent (the child&#x02019;s legal authority) or a vacuum in authority. We expect that this brief time interval between referral and start of the intervention together with inaccessibility of a legal authority will hamper random allocations and causes preliminary loss of participants. A pre-randomization trial, wherein randomization is determined prior to informed consent, is implemented as we expect this design to promote random allocation and improve inclusion of participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] as it extents the time period between referral and start of the treatment. Researchers therefore have more time to obtain informed consent, avoiding preliminary dropout. However, there is a serious statistical drawback to using pre-randomization according to Zelen, through participant crossover to TAU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Crossover would also occur in a normal post-randomization RCT but is likely to be greater in the Zelen design because participants that refuse one of the treatments of interest would be excluded from participation in a normal RCT. These crossovers introduce dilution bias that will lead to an underestimate of the &#x02018;true&#x02019; treatment effect in the intention-to-treat analysis. To cope with this dilution effect, we increased the sample size correspondingly to reduce the likelihood of a type II error. Advantages of the Zelen design are that it is closer to normal clinical practice because the allocated treatment is discussed with the parent who may or may not refuse the treatment on offer. This also results in a more representative sample of participants because, within a usual RCT, refusal of consent usually leads to a trial sample that is different from the general treated population. We therefore will also perform a &#x02018;treatment received&#x02019; analysis in addition to the planned intention-to-treat analysis to represent the more natural state of affairs that results from pre-randomization.</p><p>A second limitation to our RCT is the lack of an adequate baseline measure. Because children are new in the foster family at the start of the intervention, we decided to postpone the first assessment. A new placement is often accompanied by a temporary increase or decrease in problems, and foster carers and children have just met. Adhering to a randomized trial will minimize baseline differences between children in the two conditions. A third limitation is that foster parent&#x02019;s perception of children&#x02019;s behavior is one of the primary focuses of the treatment, but also a primary objective of the present study. We attempt to limit the effect of reactive measures by the inclusion of teachers&#x02019; perceptions of children&#x02019;s behavior. In addition, we inserted the Strange Situation Procedure. Although this observation of attachment is only post-treatment, we expect that the random allocation will diminish selection bias. Other alternatives have been considered, such as observational measures of children&#x02019;s behavior, but their benefits are not expected to compensate for the extra burden they would place on participants. If we are able to meet the challenges and include sufficient participants, we will generate knowledge about the effectiveness of an intensive behavioral focused program, developed to gain stability of placement for young foster children.</p></sec><sec><title>Status of the trial</title><p>The study started in January 2009.
