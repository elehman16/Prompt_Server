Anamorelin (ONO-7643) is a novel selective ghrelin receptor agonist under development for treating cancer cachexia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this double-blind, exploratory phase 2 trial, we examined the efficacy and safety of anamorelin in Japanese patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;181) with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and cancer cachexia (&#x02265;5&#x000a0;% weight loss within the previous 6&#x000a0;months). The participants were randomized into three groups and were administered 50 or 100&#x000a0;mg anamorelin, or placebo, orally every day for 12&#x000a0;weeks. The co-primary endpoints were the changes from baseline over 12&#x000a0;weeks in LBM and handgrip strength (HGS).

However, pre-cachexia may occur in the absence of weight loss, and obesity or prior weight loss may mask its symptoms in some patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Cachexia is a frequent disorder in cancer patients and is cited as the cause of death in about 20&#x000a0;% of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, cancer cachexia may also be accompanied by increased chemotherapy-related toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], as well as poor prognosis and poor quality of life (QOL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>There are several treatment options available for the management of patients with cachexia. For example, megestrol acetate is available for first-line therapy in AIDS-related cachexia in some countries (but not Japan). In a clinical trial of cancer cachexia, megestrol acetate significantly improved appetite and weight gain compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, megestrol acetate tends to increase fat mass rather than muscle mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and in a clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], it did not improve QOL and was associated with a higher incidence of adverse events compared with placebo.</p><p>Ghrelin, a neuropeptide secreted by ghrelinergic cells in the gastrointestinal tract, is a regulator of hunger signals that also prepares the body for food intake. In addition, ghrelin acts as a growth hormone (GH) secretagogue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In humans, ghrelin has antagonistic effects on leptin signaling and significantly increases food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, ghrelin mimetics have been postulated as possible treatments for cachexia by increasing GH secretion and promoting food intake and weight gain.</p><p>Structure&#x02013;function relationship studies have revealed that the C-terminal part of ghrelin plays an important role in its receptor binding and biological activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Accordingly, the structure of this region was used as the basis for the development of anamorelin (ONO-7643), an orally administered low-molecular-weight ghrelin-like agonist with the chemical structure 3-{(2<italic>R</italic>)-3-{(3<italic>R</italic>)-3-benzyl-3-[(trimethylhydrazino) carbonyl] piperidin-1-yl}-2-[(2-methylalanyl) amino]-3-oxopropyl}-1<italic>H</italic>-indole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that anamorelin is a potent ghrelin receptor agonist that significantly increases food intake and body weight in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and does not promote tumor growth, which is a potential concern for molecules that increase GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Subsequent phase 1 and phase 2 studies of anamorelin have been completed in healthy volunteers and patients with cancer cachexia in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These studies confirmed that anamorelin significantly increased body weight and food intake compared with placebo. More recently, two completed phase 3 studies of anamorelin showed that anamorelin for 12&#x000a0;weeks was well tolerated and significantly improved lean body mass (LBM), body weight, and anorexia-cachexia symptoms/concerns in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with cachexia; these multinational trials were conducted in North America, Europe, and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, no studies have examined the effects of anamorelin in Japanese patients with cancer cachexia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of anamorelin in Japanese patients with cancer cachexia as part of the clinical development of anamorelin for the treatment of cachexia.</p><p>This trial included patients with NSCLC because these patients typically show weight loss and are less likely to drop out owing to disease progression than are patients with other cancer types. Additionally, these patients were expected to tolerate food intake and administration of anamorelin. Furthermore, to minimize any potential confounding effects of the cancer itself, only NSCLC patients were chosen to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comprised a 2-week observation/run-in period, a 12-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period, and it was conducted at 32 sites in Japan. Visits during the treatment period were scheduled at weeks 0 (baseline/randomization), 4, 8, and 12. The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the study protocol, Paragraph 3 of Article 14 and Article 80-(2) of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law of Japan, and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines (Ministry of Health and Welfare Ordinance No. 28). The study was approved by ethics committees at all participating institutions.

Randomization was performed using a randomization table and the sealed envelope method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Interventions and concomitant therapy</title><p>Patients were randomized to receive 50 or 100&#x000a0;mg of anamorelin or placebo once daily during the treatment period. To maintain blinding, all patients took two tablets (two 50-mg tablets, one 50-mg tablet plus placebo tablet, or two placebo tablets). The active and placebo tablets were identical in appearance and packaging. The doses of anamorelin and the duration of administration were chosen based on previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>High-emetic-risk chemotherapy (categorized according to the &#x0201c;antiemetics proper use guidelines Version 1&#x0201d; by Japan Society of Clinical Oncology), radiation therapy (except palliative radiotherapy for bone metastasis or radiotherapy for brain metastases), systemic corticosteroids, GH preparations, medroxyprogesterone, megestrol acetate, Chinese herbal medicines (Anchusan, orento, saireito, juzentaihoto, shosaikoto, seishoekkito, ninjin&#x02019;yoeito, heiisan, hochuekkito, rikkunshito, junshousan), antiarrhythmic drugs, antitumor anthracyclines, CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inducers, grapefruit-containing products, and other investigational treatments were prohibited during the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>The primary endpoints were the mean changes in LBM, as measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and grip strength of the non-dominant hand from baseline through to Week 12. Other endpoints included the changes in body composition-related variables, as determined by DEXA and bioimpedance, grip strength, body weight, Japanese Version of the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI-J), QOL Questionnaire for Cancer Patients Treated with Anticancer Drugs (QOL-ACD), ECOG PS, Karnofsky Performance Scale, and serum biomarkers. All efficacy variables were determined at baseline (start of observation) and weeks 4, 8, and 12. The efficacy variables were also measured following treatment discontinuation.</p><p>DEXA was performed using Hologic (Bedford, MA, USA) or GE Lunar (Wauwatosa, WI, USA) systems capable of whole-body scans; scans were performed &#x02265;48&#x000a0;h after any use of contrast medium to avoid interference. DEXA was used to measure LBM, body fat, bone mineral content, and total weight using standard procedures. Bioimpedance was also used to record LBM, body fat, bone mineral content, body cell mass, and body weight using established methods. Bioimpedance was performed using an InBody720 (InBody Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) instrument provided by the sponsor. Grip strength was measured three times for each hand using a grip dynamometer (Tracker Freedom&#x000ae; Wireless Grip; JTECH Medical Midvale, UT, USA). The maximum value of the three measurements was recorded for each hand, and the dominant/non-dominant hand was noted.</p><p>The MDASI-J is a self-rated scale covering 13 symptom items and 6 interference items, which shows good validity and practicality for assessing cancer-related symptoms within the last 24&#x000a0;h by 11 scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The Japanese version has been validated and showed good consistency with the English version. The QOL-ACD (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Materials</xref>) is a self-rated scale evaluating patients&#x02019; status within the past few days by five scales, comprised of four domains (functional, physical, mental, and psychosocial) and a global face scale was developed as a generic questionnaire for evaluating the QOL of Japanese patients undergoing chemotherapy. All four domains displayed moderate&#x02013;strong associations with clinically relevant variables, such as performance status and weight loss in Japanese patients with NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Performance status was examined in terms of the ECOG PS and Karnofsky Performance Scale. Blood samples were collected after a &#x02265;12-h fast to measure the concentrations of IGF-1, IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, prealbumin, acylghrelin, and des-acylghrelin. Laboratory tests were performed at a central laboratory (SRL Medisearch Ltd.).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Safety</title><p>Safety variables included vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiography, tumor status (assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] guidelines), patient outcomes/survival, clinical laboratory tests, and adverse events. Overall survival was determined using the life-table method for each treatment group. Adverse events were assessed using the Japanese version of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ver. 4.0 and were categorized by system organ class/preferred term.</p><p>Adverse events were also assessed in terms of their severity, seriousness, causal relationship to the study drug, outcome, clinical course, and whether the study drug was discontinued.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>In accordance with the pre-specified study protocol and statistical analysis plan, all efficacy variables were first analyzed in the per-protocol set (PPS) and then confirmed using the full analysis set (FAS). The FAS included all eligible subjects who underwent at least one efficacy evaluation after starting the study drug. The PPS comprised all eligible subjects who did not receive any of the prohibited treatments and whose LBM (DEXA) and grip strength were measured during the observation period and at least once after starting the study drug. Safety analyses were performed using the safety analysis set, which was defined as all subjects who were administered the study drug at least once.</p><p>The sample size was calculated based on the result of a phase 2 study in which the mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;standard deviation (SD) difference in LBM (DEXA) between 50&#x000a0;mg anamorelin and placebo was 2.09&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.06&#x000a0;kg. At a significance level of 5&#x000a0;% and power of 80&#x000a0;%, at least 35 subjects were needed per treatment group. Considering that about 35&#x000a0;% of patients were likely to be excluded from the PPS, we planned to enroll 54 patients per group. All efficacy data are presented for the PPS, as specified in the statistical analysis plan, and the results were confirmed using the FAS. Baseline variables were analyzed descriptively to determine the mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD or <italic>n</italic> (%) of patients. Efficacy variables were analyzed using analysis of covariance with treatment group, time-point, and preceding weight loss (5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;% and &#x0003e;15&#x000a0;%) as fixed factors and the baseline value as a covariate. The least squares (LS) mean change from baseline to the indicated time-point was calculated for each group. The LS mean difference in the anamorelin groups relative to the placebo groups was also calculated with 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CIs). An interaction of treatment group&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;time-point was also included for secondary efficacy endpoints (changes in body composition measured by DEXA or bioimpedance, grip strength, body weight, MDASI-J, QOL-ACD, Karnofsky Performance Scale, and serum biomarkers). Safety variables were analyzed descriptively and are shown as <italic>n</italic> (%) patients. Overall survival was determined using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method and was compared among the three groups using log-rank tests. As this was an exploratory study, no adjustment was made for multiplicity of statistical testing, and missing data were not imputed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Protocol modifications</title><p>Some modifications were made to the statistical analysis plan, but all changes were implemented before unblinding. In brief, the study duration and patient enrollment were extended because it took longer than expected to enroll the target number of patients. We also reassessed the target sample size, as we originally planned to enroll 44 patients per group after anticipating that 20&#x000a0;% of treated patients would be excluded from the PPS; this was increased to 35&#x000a0;%. Additionally, because the US Food and Drug Administration issued new guidance on CYP3A4 inhibitors after starting this trial, the use of these drugs was added to the exclusion criteria and list of prohibited drugs. These criteria were retrospectively applied to all patients in the PPS and FAS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Patients</title><p>Between March 2011 and September 2012, 181 subjects were enrolled and randomized to placebo, 50-mg anamorelin, or 100-mg anamorelin groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Consistent with earlier pharmacodynamic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], our study revealed increases in IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels in patients treated with 100&#x000a0;mg anamorelin that are suggestive of increased muscle protein synthesis. These changes are consistent with the increases in LBM. We also observed a significant increase in prealbumin, a marker of the nutritional state.</p><p>Anamorelin (100&#x000a0;mg) was also associated with significant improvements in QOL-ACD, especially items 8 and 9, which focus on appetite and meal enjoyment, and also increases in daily activity, and improvements in physical condition. These findings indicate that patients treated with 100&#x000a0;mg anamorelin reported greater appetite during treatment and were more likely to enjoy their meals as compared with placebo-treated patients. Additionally, the increase in the Karnofsky Performance Scale suggests there were improvements in the functional status of this cohort of patients.</p><p>The overall survival times and tumor responses according to RECIST were generally similar in each treatment group, which indicates that the treatment itself did not modify disease progression. Furthermore, there were no differences in patient characteristics (e.g., disease stage and history of chemotherapy) or existing prognostic factors, among the three groups.</p><p>The incidence of adverse drug reactions was significantly greater in both anamorelin groups than in the placebo group, but there were very few serious drug reactions and the distribution of Grade 3&#x02013;5 events was similar in all three groups.

Although nausea and glycosylated hemoglobin occurred in &#x02265;5&#x000a0;% more patients in the anamorelin groups than in the placebo group, neither adverse event was considered a significant risk. This suggests that anamorelin is tolerable in Japanese patients with cancer cachexia.</p><p>This study has several limitations. Firstly, the efficacy of anamorelin was not confirmed in handgrip strength. Secondary, the bioimpedance might have not been suitable as a method to determine LBM, body fat, etc. for the patients with cancer cachexia.

Treatment with anamorelin was accompanied by increases in IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, which are indicative of an increase in protein synthesis, and an increase in prealbumin, indicative of improved nutritional status. Furthermore, anamorelin was associated with favorable improvements in QOL, appetite, and performance status. Although the incidence of adverse drug reactions and discontinuations because of adverse events were greater in the anamorelin groups, the majority of treatment discontinuations were related to disease progression rather than anamorelin.</p><p>Cancer cachexia requires multimodal treatment such as nutrition, exercise, and pharmacotherapies. The profile of anamorelin shown in this study indicates a great potential of the safe and effective drug as an option for the pharmacotherapies for multimodal treatment of cancer cachexia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary materials</title><sec id="Sec20"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="520_2016_3144_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><caption><p>(DOCX 25&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="520_2016_3144_MOESM2_ESM.docx"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><caption><p>(DOCX 27&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3"><media xlink:href="520_2016_3144_MOESM3_ESM.docx"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><caption><p>(DOCX 29&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM4"><media xlink:href="520_2016_3144_MOESM4_ESM.pptx"><label>Supplementary Fig 1</label><caption><p>Patient disposition. *Patients in whom changes from baseline could not be analyzed for both primary efficacy endpoints by DEXA and grip strength. <italic>DEXA</italic> dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.
