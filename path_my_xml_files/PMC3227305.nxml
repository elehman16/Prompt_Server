The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of nalbuphine given before induction of general anesthesia for cesarean section on quality of general anesthesia, maternal stress response, and neonatal outcome.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty full term pregnant women scheduled for elective cesarean section, randomly classified into two equal groups, group N received nalbuphine 0.2 mg/kg diluted in 10 ml of normal saline (<italic>n</italic>=30), and group C placebo (<italic>n</italic>=30) received 10 ml of normal saline 1 min before the induction of general anesthesia. Maternal heart rate and blood pressure were measured before, after induction, during surgery, and after recovery. Neonates were assisted by using APGAR0 scores, time to sustained respiration, and umbilical cord blood gas analysis.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Result:</title><p>Maternal heart rate showed significant increase in control group than nalbuphine group after intubation (88.2&#x000b1;4.47 versus 80.1&#x000b1;4.23, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) and during surgery till delivery of baby (90.8&#x000b1;2.39 versus 82.6&#x000b1;2.60, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) and no significant changes between both groups after delivery. MABP increased in control group than nalbuphine group after intubation (100.55&#x000b1;6.29 versus 88.75&#x000b1;6.09, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) and during surgery till delivery of baby (98.50&#x000b1;2.01 versus 90.50&#x000b1;2.01, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) and no significant changes between both groups after delivery.

Missing one of these limbs will lead to serious effect on the patients, for example, lack of hypnosis lead to awareness; also lack of analgesia will lead to exaggerated response to painful stimulus with increased catecholamine levels in the blood, which increase the blood pressure, heart rate, and intracranial pressure. The anesthetists use different drugs with the objective to achieve a balance between analgesia and hypnosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Opioids are considered the gold standard for achieving good anesthetic practice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] However, in obstetric anesthesia the use of opioids was omitted until the delivery of baby because of fear of placental transfer and neonatal respiratory depression.</p><p>In full term pregnancy, the uterine vasculature is maximally dilated but still respond to vasopressor substance such as catecholamine,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] which released as a part of stress response during anesthesia and surgery causing uterine vasoconstriction and decrease the utroplacental blood flow[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] and adversely affect the neonates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Preventing stress response during intubation and surgery decrease the level of catecholamine and will be beneficial for the mother and neonates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Nalbuphine hydrochloride is classified as a synthetic opioid agonist-antagonist. It is a potent analgesic and its analgesic potency is essentially equivalent to morphine. It can also be used as a supplement to balanced anesthesia, for preoperative and postoperative analgesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of nalbuphine given before induction of general anesthesia for cesarean section on quality of general anesthesia, maternal stress response, and neonatal outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This randomized, controlled study was approved by hospital ethics committee and after obtaining written informed consent, the study was carried out in 60 full term pregnant patients scheduled for elective cesarean section American Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) I and II.</p><p>Inclusion criteria included: Elective full term, single fetus with no signs of fetal distress, and elective cesarean section, while exclusion criteria include emergency situations, fetal distress, multiple gestation, and refusal of patients. The patients were randomly classified into two groups</p><p>Group N: Patients received 0.2 mg/kg nalbuphine diluted in 10 ml of normal saline one minute before induction of general anesthesia.</p><p>Group C: Patients received placebo 10 ml of normal saline one minute before induction of general anesthesia.</p><p>The study used a double-blind design. The patients were randomized into two equal groups. Sixty envelopes were prepared.

After the patients had arrived to operating room, uterine displacement was done by tilting the operating table to the left to decrease aortocaval compression and supine hypotension syndrome. Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation) were measured and large bore intravenous line was inserted under complete aseptic technique.</p><p>Standard patient monitoring (electrocardiogram, non-invasive arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>) were used during anesthesia. While the patients were prepared for surgery by sterilization of the abdomen and were covered by sterile gowns, preoxygenation was done by allowing the patients to breath 100% O<sub>2</sub> for 3 minutes. The patients were randomly classified to receive either 0.2 mg/kg nalbuphine, diluted in 10 ml of normal saline (group N) or control group (group C) received 10 ml saline, which was drawn into an identically labeled syringe.</p><p>The study drug was injected one minute before induction of anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced by thiopental 5 mg/kg, succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg. Endotracheal intubation was done using direct laryngoscope after 30 seconds and anesthesia was maintained by isoflurane 1% in oxygen and atracurium 0.25 mg/kg and artificial ventilation was adjusted to maintain end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> around 35 mmHg.</p><p>The induction&#x02013;delivery time and uterine incision-delivery time were recorded. After delivery 0.1 mg/kg morphine were given to control group and same amount of saline to nalbuphine group.</p><p>Midazolam 2 mg and 5 units of oxytocine were given as bolus intravenously over 3 minutes for both groups. Oxytocine 10 units in 500 ml ringer solution was infused in both groups to maintain the uterine contraction. After completion of surgery, residual neuromuscular block was antagonized using neostigmine and atropine and the patients was extubated and transported to recovery room.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Maternal measurements</title><p>Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were measured before induction of anesthesia, five min after intubation, during surgery, and after delivery of baby.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Neonatal outcome measures</title><p>This is the job of pediatrician who was unaware of maternal group assignment.
