Patients in arm 1 received tapered corticosteroids, stopped after day 10, whereas patients in arm 2 received no steroids after the intraoperative bolus. The primary efficacy variable was the diagnosis of PTDM as per American Diabetes Association criteria (2010) at any point up to 24 weeks postkidney transplantation. Secondary efficacy variables included incidence of composite efficacy failure (graft loss, biopsy-proven acute rejection or severe graft dysfunction: estimated glomerular filtration rate (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-4) &#x0003c;30 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), acute rejection and graft and patient survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The full-analysis set included 1081 patients (arm 1: n = 528, arm 2: n = 553). Baseline characteristics and mean tacrolimus trough levels were comparable between arms. Week 24 Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates of PTDM were similar for arm 1 versus arm 2 (17.4% vs 16.6%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.579). Incidence of composite efficacy failure, graft and patient survival, and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate were also comparable between arms. Biopsy-proven acute rejection and acute rejection were significantly higher in arm 2 versus arm 1 (13.6% vs 8.7%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.006 and 25.9% vs 18.2%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001, respectively). Tolerability profiles were comparable between arms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A prolonged-release tacrolimus, basiliximab, and mycophenolate mofetil immunosuppressive regimen is efficacious, with a low incidence of PTDM and a manageable tolerability profile over 24 weeks of treatment. A lower incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection was seen in patients receiving corticosteroids tapered over 10 days plus an intraoperative corticosteroid bolus versus those receiving an intraoperative bolus only.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>This large, multicenter, prospective and randomized study shows no difference in the incidence of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus but higher incidence of acute rejection with a steroid avoidance versus a steroid sparing regimen in kidney transplant recipients receiving basiliximab, prolonged-release tacrolimus and mycophenolate.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="0"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The prevalence of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) has increased in recent years and remains high, despite therapeutic advances that have significantly improved graft and patient survival outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Development of PTDM occurs primarily in the first 3 to 6 months posttransplant and has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and poor graft and patient survival.<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>In addition to demographic factors, such as increasing age and higher body mass index, risk factors associated with PTDM in de novo kidney transplantation include the type of immunosuppressive regimen used, which is estimated to account for 74% of the risk of PTDM during the first year posttransplant.<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Steroid use has been associated with an increased risk of PTDM, whereas steroid cessation or withdrawal protocols have been associated with a significant decrease.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Some studies have reported that the absence of steroid treatment was associated with increased rates of acute rejection (AR), although others have found rates of rejection to be comparable.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>In the optimizing immunosuppression after kidney transplantation with Advagraf (OSAKA) study, patients who received perioperative corticosteroids only, together with once-daily, prolonged-release tacrolimus at an initial dose of 0.2 mg/kg per day, plus basiliximab and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) had comparable biopsy-confirmed AR rates and received significantly less anti-diabetic and insulin treatment at week 24 compared with patients receiving corticosteroids tapered over 24 weeks, although the rates of PTDM were comparable between arms.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Definitions of PTDM vary considerably between studies and, as in the OSAKA study, often include reporting of PTDM as an adverse event (AE) without predefined criteria.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Consequently, this makes meaningful comparisons of the incidence of PTDM between studies difficult. Optimization of immunosuppressive regimens to reduce the risk of the occurrence of PTDM, while maintaining efficacy, remains an ongoing challenge for transplant physicians, especially as an increased risk of PTDM has been associated with the use of tacrolimus, sirolimus, and everolimus.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Advagraf-based immunosuppression regimen examining new onset diabetes mellitus in kidney transplant recipients (ADVANCE) was designed specifically to investigate the incidence of PTDM with prolonged-release tacrolimus-based immunosuppression in de novo kidney transplant recipients. The 24-week study was designed to determine whether prolonged-release tacrolimus-based regimens with posttransplant steroids tapered over a 10-day period (arm 1) or no postoperative steroids (arm 2) affected the incidence of PTDM differently. In this study, PTDM was defined using the comprehensive American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria as recommended by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes clinical practice guidelines.<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>; NCT01304836)</title><p>ADVANCE was a phase 4, multicenter, 24-week, prospectively randomized, open-label, parallel-group study conducted at 99 sites in 24 countries between January 2011 and May 2013. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice, International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and applicable laws and regulations. An independent ethics committee or institutional review board granted approval before shipment of medication to the study sites. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p>Eligible patients (&#x02265;18 years old) underwent primary renal transplantation or retransplantation (unless the graft was lost within 1 year due to immunological reasons). Patients who received an organ transplant other than a kidney, or in cases where donation occurred after cardiac death, were also excluded. Other reasons for exclusion from the study included a positive test for hepatitis B or C, or a cold ischemia time greater than 30 hours. Patients were also excluded if they had a panel-reactive antibody (PRA) score greater than 20% (highest PRA value in 6 months before transplant used for all PRA measurements, measured according to individual center policy), significant liver disease, or a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus before transplantation. Patients were considered to have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus if they had previously been treated with prescribed medication or controlled diet for diabetes mellitus, if there was evidence of a previous positive oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), prebaseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 6.5% or greater, or gestational diabetes recorded in the patients' medical history. Patients receiving ongoing systemic immunosuppressive drugs before transplantation (with the exception of minimal levels of immunosuppressant after a previous failed transplantation without nephrectomy) and those requiring long-term steroid treatment were also excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The randomization scheme was prepared by Pierrel Research Europe GmbH, Essen, Germany, under the responsibility of Astellas Pharma Europe BV, Netherlands. Randomization and distribution of the study medication was coordinated centrally using an interactive voice response system. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 treatment arms and stratified according to study center.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title><p>All patients received prolonged-release tacrolimus (Advagraf; Astellas Pharma Europe BV, Netherlands), intravenous basiliximab (20 mg on day 0 and day 4) and oral MMF (1 g twice-daily [BD] preoperatively and until day 14; 0.5 g BD thereafter). Prolonged-release tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg) was administered preoperatively; 0.2 mg/kg was administered for the initial postoperative dose. Postoperative, prolonged-release tacrolimus was taken orally once a day in the morning with the dose adjusted on the basis of clinical evidence and tolerability (target trough levels 11-15 ng/mL on days 0-21, 8-12 ng/mL on days 22-42, and 5-9 ng/mL on days 43-168).</p><p>The use of an intraoperative, intravenous bolus of corticosteroid was permitted in both arms on day 0. The bolus dose was according to center policy (up to a maximum of 1000 mg of methylprednisolone or equivalent); all patients at a participating center received the same dose. In arm 1, postoperative prednisolone (or equivalent oral corticosteroid) was administered for 10 days (20 mg/day on days 1-4, 15 mg/day on days 5-6, 10 mg/day on days 7-8, and 5 mg/day on days 9-10) and then discontinued after day 10; the total cumulative mandatory corticosteroid dose per patient in arm 1 was 140 mg.

Patients in arm 1 continued to receive oral steroids as per protocol. Patients receiving treatment for AR were permitted to remain in the study. Subsequent episodes of AR were treated according to center policy. Steroid resistance was identified according to each investigator. Cytomegalovirus and <italic>Pneumocystis jiroveci</italic> pneumonia prophylaxes were administered as per each center's local policy. Routine laboratory assessments were performed locally; urine analysis for protein concentration was undertaken at week 24 only.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary Efficacy Variable</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of PTDM, diagnosed as per ADA-suggested criteria. The ADA criteria for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus include HbA1c of 6.5% or greater, fasting plasma glucose of 7.0 mmol/L or greater, 2-hour plasma glucose of 11.1 mmol/L or greater during an OGTT or, for a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, a random plasma glucose of 11.1 mmol/L or greater.<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> HbA1c and plasma glucose were assessed on an ongoing basis throughout the study period. An OGTT was performed at weeks 8 and 24 only.

The incidence of composite efficacy failure (defined as graft loss, BPAR or severe graft dysfunction) and composite efficacy failure including PTDM were assessed at week 24. Other outcomes assessed included incidence of patient survival and AR. Renal function at week 24 was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-4 (MDRD4) formula and by creatinine clearance calculated using the Cockcroft&#x02013;Gault formula. Delayed graft function (DGF) was defined as dialysis for more than 1 day during days 1 to 7, and severe graft dysfunction was defined as eGFR (MDRD4) less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional Analyses</title><p>Mean and median exposure to steroids were reported in the subgroups of patients with and without PTDM and with and without AR.

The full-analysis set (FAS) included patients who were randomized, received a transplant, received 1 dose or greater of study drug, and recorded 1 postbaseline or greater estimation of the primary variable (all other patients were excluded from this population). The per-protocol set (PPS) population included all patients from the FAS population who did not have any major protocol deviations. A 33% reduction in the incidence of PTDM was considered clinically relevant. Assuming an incidence of PTDM of 20% in arm 1 (reference arm), a sample size of 548 patients per arm provided 80% power to detect a clinically relevant 6.5% difference in PTDM incidence (that is, a reduction to 13.5% in arm 2) using a 2-sided type 1 error rate of 5%. The number of randomized and transplanted patients required to reach the planned number of evaluable patients, assuming a dropout rate of 6%, was 1166 patients (583 per arm). For all comparisons, a <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>For the primary efficacy variable, the incidence of PTDM was analyzed by Kaplan&#x02013;Meier procedures using the FAS population; the differences between arms were assessed using 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and <italic>P</italic> values were calculated using the Wilcoxon&#x02013;Gehan test. The primary analysis was repeated using the PPS population.</p><p>Secondary efficacy variables were analyzed using the intention-to-treat population. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates of composite efficacy failure, composite efficacy failure including PTDM, graft and patient survival, and BPAR at week 24 were calculated for each treatment arm. Differences between arms (arm 1&#x02013;arm 2 for event-free survival) were assessed, with the corresponding 95% CIs and <italic>P</italic> values calculated using the Wilcoxon&#x02013;Gehan test, and were confirmed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Differences between arms in eGFR (MDRD4), creatinine clearance (Cockcroft&#x02013;Gault), and mean change in HbA1c from baseline were assessed by analysis of variance. The incidence of graft dysfunction was analyzed using a Cox proportional-hazards model. The incidence of patients with DGF and 2-hour plasma glucose &#x02265;11.1 mmol/L during the OGTT was analyzed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test.</p><p>For the additional post-hoc analyses, the incidence of PTDM in subgroups of patients defined by AR status was analyzed over 24 weeks using the FAS. <italic>P</italic> values were calculated using the Wilcoxon&#x02013;Gehan test.

Prolonged-release tacrolimus plus MMF and a 10-day steroid tapering regimen had a lower incidence of BPAR, a specific risk factor for PTDM, versus prolonged-release tacrolimus plus MMF and a single bolus of steroid.</p><p>It has been reported previously that most PTDM occurs in the first 3 months after transplantation and that the choice of immunosuppressive regimen (including the use of steroids and tacrolimus) accounts for a large proportion of diabetes risk posttransplant.<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Previously, comparable AR rates were reported with tacrolimus plus MMF and induction therapy in a steroid-free regimen compared with tacrolimus plus MMF and corticosteroids.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, another study associated steroid withdrawal with an increased risk of AR and poorer long-term graft outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The regimens in our study were designed to balance the benefit-to-risk ratio associated with steroid use and to assess optimal steroid administration in combination with prolonged-release tacrolimus plus MMF early posttransplant.</p><p>Overall, the incidence of PTDM in this study was lower than anticipated, and generally comparable to published data with prolonged-release tacrolimus-based regimens, although reported incidence varies depending on the definition of PTDM and length of follow-up.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Previous studies have reported PTDM as an AE, often as a post hoc analysis,<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> or use insulin 30 days or longer as a diagnostic criterion, which could underestimate the incidence of PTDM.<sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In contrast, the use of 1 measurement or more of fasting plasma glucose of 7 mmol/L or more to diagnose PTDM in other trials could overestimate the incidence.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> ADVANCE was the first large, randomized controlled trial of its kind to use a stringent definition of PTDM including OGTT. Therefore, the low incidence of PTDM in this study, with prolonged-release tacrolimus-based immunosuppression, is likely to be reflective of the &#x0201c;real world.&#x0201d;</p><p>When assessing the impact of treatment on the study outcomes, it is interesting to note that the mean cumulative steroid dose was higher in arm 2 compared with arm 1. Post hoc analyses of those patients with PTDM showed a similar pattern between arms. It is likely that the higher incidence of AR and BPAR reported in arm 2 versus arm 1, necessitating additional steroid treatment could, at least in part, account for this observation. Additional analyses confirmed that patients with AR received a mean cumulative dose of steroid approximately 4-fold higher than patients without AR, regardless of treatment arm. Because the incidence of PTDM was comparable between arms at the end of the study, these data indicate that 3 boluses of corticosteroid represent a risk factor for the development of PTDM in kidney transplant recipients receiving prolonged-release tacrolimus and basiliximab plus MMF. The findings from this study are consistent with the previously described association between steroid use and PTDM occurrence<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and suggest that 10 days of tapered corticosteroids postkidney transplant reduces the risk of PTDM by reducing the incidence of AR and BPAR, and consequently the need for pulse steroids.</p><p>Overall, the incidences of BPAR and AR were low in both arms and consistent with previously published data.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The incidence of BPAR in this study was lower than a study of kidney transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus BD-based regimens, with or without steroid treatment.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Our results showed no significant differences in the incidence of corticosteroid-resistant BPAR between arms. However, AR and BPAR were significantly lower in arm 1 versus arm 2 at week 24, suggesting that a prolonged-release tacrolimus-based regimen with a short period of posttransplant steroid treatment could be effective while minimizing the risk of PTDM. Interestingly, a meta-analysis of 34 studies by Knight and Morris<sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> reported that steroid avoidance or withdrawal protocols postkidney transplant, used alongside various immunosuppressive regimens, increased the risk of AR but decreased cardiovascular risk.</p><p>The incidence of composite efficacy failure was comparable between arms. Graft and patient survival at week 24 was good, and comparable, both between arms and with previously published studies (despite low steroids limited to 10 days).<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> There was also no significant difference in the incidence of DGF between arms; however, there was a higher incidence of AR by day 7 in arm 2, indicating that patients with DGF could benefit from steroid administration, beyond a single bolus, in the early posttransplant period. This observation is supported by a recent review of clinical trials that found a reduced risk of DGF when steroids were used for the first 3 to 7 days posttransplantation versus steroid-free protocols.<sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>This study had limitations, including the fact that the patients, the majority of whom were white, were generally at low immunological risk. Therefore, the population may not have been representative of other transplant populations. Moreover, the open-label design and the relatively short (6-month) duration of follow-up could have affected the results. It is important to note, however, that the study included the first 3 to 6 months after transplantation when PTDM typically develops. Intraoperative steroids were permitted as per center policy, that is, all patients in each center received the same intraoperative dose. However, the differences in the minimum and maximum values of intraoperative steroid dose suggest that there could have been a number of protocol violations. The more frequent use of steroid treatment for AR and BPAR in the minimized steroid arm (arm 2) meant that there was little difference between arms in the actual cumulative dose of steroid administered. Median cumulative doses are potentially more representative than the mean due to some patients requiring treatment for greater than 1 AR episode. It should be noted that at the time of the study design, the recommended tacrolimus trough levels were higher than those often used in clinical practice and in other reported studies, and bolus-only steroid was standard clinical practice for the treatment of AR, which is now not the case in all transplant centers. Renal function was estimated using MDRD4, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, and Cockcroft&#x02013;Gault methodologies as opposed to criterion standard measurements using iohexol clearance and isotope-dilution mass spectrometry. Donor-specific antibody data were not widely collected for patients with BPAR; however, this would be of interest to the transplant community and should be considered for future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, the ADVANCE study was the first study specifically designed to investigate the impact of posttransplant steroids on the development of PTDM in patients receiving prolonged-release tacrolimus-based immunosuppression. Although the rates of PTDM were low and comparable between arms, prolonged-release tacrolimus and basiliximab plus MMF and steroid tapering for 10 days might be the preferred regimen in de novo kidney transplant recipients due to a potential lower risk of AR and BPAR. It remains to be determined if there are subgroups of patients at particularly high risk of PTDM for whom total steroid avoidance may be advantageous.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Participating Investigators: <italic>Argentina</italic>: M. del Carmen Rial; <italic>Australia</italic>: J.
