We have studied a unique, naturally occurring purine alkaloid, present in <italic>Camellia assamica</italic> variety kucha tea (amongst other botanical sources) that acts on both adenosinergic and dopaminergic pathways that appears to influence multiple neurochemical pathways. As a first step in a series of experiments, we examined the effects of TeaCrine<sup>&#x02122;</sup>, a nature-identical, chemically equivalent bioactive compound known as theacrine (1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric acid), in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Using a randomized, double-blinded, within-subject (crossover) design, 15 healthy subjects (mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, wgt, BMI: 28.3 &#x000b1; 6.1 y, 175.7 &#x000b1; 11.5 cm, 89.8 &#x000b1; 21.7 kg, 29.1 &#x000b1; 4.7) volunteered to ingest 200 mg of TeaCrine<sup>&#x02122;</sup> (Compound Solutions, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) (TC) or Placebo (PLA). Anchored VAS questionnaires were used to detect changes in various aspects of physical and mental energy and performance; side effect profiles, hemodynamics and biochemical markers of safety were also collected over a 3-hr post-dosing period. A subset of 6 subjects underwent a separate 7-day, open-label, repeated dose study comparing 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg of TC. Consent to publish the results was obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The 200 mg dose of TC caused significant improvements in energy (TC: +8.6% vs. PLA: -5.7%, P=0.049) and reductions in fatigue (TC: -6.7% vs. PLA: +5.8%, P=0.04). A trend for improved concentration was also noted (TC: +2.4% vs. PLA: -1.3%, P=0.07). No changes in systemic hemodynamics or side effect profiles were noted. The N=6 cohort study demonstrated moderate to large effect sizes (0.50 to 0.71) with the 200 mg dose of TC over a 7-day period of assessment for the following subjective measures: energy, fatigue, concentration, anxiety, motivation to exercise and libido.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These preliminary data support the benefits of acute TeaCrine<sup>&#x02122;</sup> supplementation on subjective &#x0201c;energy&#x0201d; levels and some indices of mental performance. Future studies are underway to confirm these neurotropic effects and also explore potential benefits of TeaCrine<sup>&#x02122;</sup> on objective measures of cognitive and physical performance, inflammation, pain perception, and functional capacity.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>Partial funding for this study was provided by Compound Solutions, Inc (Carlsbad, CA)</p></sec></back></article>
