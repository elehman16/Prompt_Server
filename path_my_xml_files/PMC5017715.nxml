in experimental stroke. Recovery may also be dependent on an enriched environment and physical activity. G-CSF may have the potential to enhance recovery when used in combination with physiotherapy, in patients with disability late after stroke.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>A pilot 2 x 2 factorial randomised (1:1) placebo-controlled trial of G-CSF (double-blind), and/or a 6 week course of physiotherapy, in 60 participants with disability (mRS &#x0003e;1), at least 3 months after stroke. Primary outcome was feasibility, acceptability and tolerability. Secondary outcomes included death, dependency, motor function and quality of life measured 90 and 365 days after enrolment.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Recruitment to the trial was feasible and acceptable; of 118 screened patients, 92 were eligible and 32 declined to participate. 60 patients were recruited between November 2011 and July 2013. All participants received some allocated treatment. Although 29 out of 30 participants received all 5 G-CSF/placebo injections, only 7 of 30 participants received all 18 therapy sessions. G-CSF was well tolerated but associated with a tendency to more adverse events than placebo (16 vs 10 patients, p = 0.12) and serious adverse events (SAE) (9 vs 3, p = 0.10). On average, patients received 14 (out of 18 planned) therapy sessions, interquartile range [<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161359.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Only a minority (23%) of participants completed all physiotherapy sessions, a large proportion of sessions (114 of 540, 21%) were cancelled due to patient (94, 17%) and therapist factors (20, 4%). No significant differences in functional outcomes were detected in either the G-CSF or physiotherapy group at day 90 or 365.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Delivery of G-CSF is feasible in chronic stroke. However, the study failed to demonstrate feasibility for delivering additional physiotherapy sessions late after stroke therefore a definitive study using this trial design is not supported. Future work should occur earlier after stroke, alongside on-going clinical rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ISRCTN.com <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN16714730">ISRCTN16714730</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PB-PG-0909-19113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sprigg</surname><given-names>Nikola</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>STEMS3 is funded by NIHR Research for Patient Benefit (PB-PG-0909-19113), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding/research-for-patient-benefit.htm">http://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding/research-for-patient-benefit.htm</ext-link>.

The incidence of stroke increases almost exponentially with age and, in combination with an aging population, the burden of stroke to survivors, their families and society is increasing.</p><p>Rehabilitation is thought to promote functional recovery through neuroplastic changes and evidence suggests plasticity extends beyond the sub-acute stage.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Despite this, the majority of patients do not receive rehabilitation therapy beyond three months, although some receive community input for up to six months post stroke. The dose, method and intensity of therapy appear to be important and most effective when delivered as high intensity task specific practice.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Therapy at home may be beneficial,[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] but the long term benefit of therapy in chronic stroke is not known.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In experimental stroke, &#x02018;top-up&#x02019; bursts of therapy improve functional outcome[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] but this has not been demonstrated in clinical studies.</p><p>Pharmacological agents may increase the benefit of intensive therapy.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Potential therapeutic options for pharmacological enhancement of recovery include neurochemical approaches, using agents such as amphetamines,[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or SSRI&#x02019;s.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Another approach is a neuroreparative paradigm, using agents such as stem cells, or agents that release endogenous stem cells.</p><p>Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) mobilises endogenous haematopoietic (CD34+) bone marrow stem cells into the circulation and is routinely used in stem cell transplantation in haematological malignancy.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] G-CSF has a multi-modal action that has the potential to be both neuroprotective (anti-apoptotic) and neuroreparative, the latter through mechanisms that include stem cell mobilisation, neurogenesis and angiogenesis. In experimental models of stroke, when given soon after infarct, G-CSF improves recovery.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161359.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In clinical stroke, G-CSF when given in similar doses as used in haematology, was effective at mobilising CD34+ stem cells[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and a number of trials have since been completed in acute[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161359.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and sub acute stroke.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In the largest study,[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] G-CSF showed no evidence of efficacy in 328 patients with hyperacute stroke. However, G-CSF was given intravenously and unexpected haemodynamic effects were reported potentially counteracting any potential beneficial effects of G-CSF. Meta-analysis of all studies to date showed a non-significant reduction in early impairment but no effect on functional outcome.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In an experimental model of later administration, G-CSF when given with Stem cell factor improved outcome even when given late after infarct.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] To date, in one small clinical study of G-CSF in chronic stroke, G-CSF was tolerable but no beneficial effect was seen on outcome, although its administration was not combined with rehabilitation therapy.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In experimental stroke, pharmacological augmentation of recovery is dependent on enriched environment and stimulation&#x02013;hence the rationale for combining G-CSF and physiotherapy.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] We hypothesised that in chronic stroke intensive therapy can stimulate use dependent plasticity, which may be augmented by G-CSF. The factorial design of this pilot randomised controlled trial tests the feasibility of investigating this theory further.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a prospective blinded-outcome, single-centre, two-by-two factorial randomised (1:1) placebo-controlled trial of G-CSF (Filgastrim, 1x10E6 iu/kg) and/or rehabilitation therapy in 60 adults three months to two years post stroke. Participants had to demonstrate residual disability (modified Rankin scale, mRS &#x0003e;1) and no longer be receiving on-going rehabilitation. Exclusion criteria were inability to provide informed consent; lack of residual motor deficit; significant cognitive impairment that will impede ability to complete assessments; diagnosis likely to interfere with outcome or rehabilitation (e.g. terminal illness); still receiving post stroke rehabilitation; pregnancy; and other exclusions of G-CSF as listed in the British National Formulary. Potentially eligible patients were identified by clinical staff from Nottingham University Hospital stroke service, NHS Nottingham City and NHS Nottinghamshire County community stroke teams, who sought verbal permission from the patient or representative to be screened for eligibility for the study. Eligible patients were then approached for participation by the research team. All participants provided written informed consent.</p><p>The study was approved by the Yorkshire and Humber Research Committee (11/YH/0138, 20/06/2011), had a Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency Clinical Trial Authorisation (13/05/2011-11015). The study was prospectively submitted for ISRCTN registration on 28/07/2015 before the recruitment of the first participant.

Recruitment was as planned and potential participants straightforward to identify. Two thirds of potentially eligible participants chose to participate, higher than seen in other studies.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] This perhaps reflects both the burden of need amongst stroke survivors and their carers, and willingness to explore the potential of drugs to improve outcome after stroke.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] It was feasible to deliver the drug G-CSF in the community, and G-CSF was, on the whole, well tolerated. However, not all participants randomised to physiotherapy received the planned quantity of sessions. This was despite the therapist being flexible regarding timing of therapy sessions. Anecdotally, participants and their clinicians reported that they found randomisation to no additional physiotherapy less acceptable. This is being explored in a qualitative sub-study that is being prepared for publication.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Exploratory measures of efficacy showed no differences in outcome in the G-CSF group, although the trial was not powered to test outcome and a difference cannot be excluded. Although there was significant improvement in quality of life this finding could be due to chance, as we did not perform multiple statistical tests. The only other study of G-CSF in chronic stroke included participants with very minor residual motor deficit. Although trends to improved outcomes were demonstrated with G-CSF, methodological issues limit interpretation of this study.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Any potential benefit in chronic stroke would be in contrast to results in hyperacute stroke. In the large AXIS-2 study,[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] G-CSF showed no evidence of efficacy in 328 patients with hyperacute stroke. However, AXIS-2, was testing a neuroprotective paradigm, rather than the neuroreparative one tested here. Furthermore, recent experimental data has shown that the dose used in AXIS-2 is likely to have lead to significant immunomodulation, with possible modulation of T cell response and dendritic cells,[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] the safety consequences of which are unknown in acute stroke.</p><p>This study provides more safety data on the use of G-CSF after stroke. Despite an expected increase in reported adverse events, all but one participant tolerated a full 5 day course of G-CSF. As seen in previous stroke studies, there were more SAEs in the G-CSF group, and some of these (infections, vascular events) were possibly related to G-CSF treatment. This is in keeping with data from haematology and oncology studies over many decades, where G-CSF was well tolerated,[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and side effects of G-CSF treatment are self-limiting and clinically acceptable.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>The rehabilitation intervention was safe and there were no increase in falls or SAEs. Participants allocated to therapy did show improvement in function at day 45 (end-of-treatment) although this was not statistically significant at end-of-follow up. However, less than a quarter of patients received all of their allocated therapy sessions, predominantly due to patient factors rather than therapist availability. There was no difference in therapy session delivery between the G-CSF group and the placebo group. The feasibility of delivering such a therapy intervention (3 sessions/week) so long after stroke therefore appears to be sub-optimal. This lower-than-expected uptake of therapy sessions is in contrast to some other research studies,[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161359.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and may relate to a number of factors including type of participants (with varying deficits) and limited staff (with only one physiotherapist available). However another therapy intervention delivered to chronic stroke survivors has also shown limited uptake of sessions. [<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] This may reflect clinical practice, where in reality many patients miss sessions for a variety of reasons.</p><p>Assessing fidelity of the therapy intervention also needs to capture more subjective factors such as content of therapy, patient motivation and patient relationship with the therapist. For instance, the number of sessions attended or length of therapy session may not be the best way to record intensity.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] These factors would be best explored through qualitative research, beyond the scope of the present work.</p><p>Feedback from participants highlighted a number of issues with the trial design. In order to allow for a control therapy group we deliberately only included patients who had already been discharged from therapy prior to enrolment. Despite undergoing a comprehensive informed consent process, some patients were unsurprisingly disappointed to not receive additional therapy. This led to selection bias when clinicians recognised that emotional distress caused by randomisation to the control (no physical therapy) group would not be well tolerated and did not recommend patients for participation in the trial. Hence, this design may not be appropriate for future studies, where it may be preferable to deliver G-CSF alongside on-going rehabilitation. We did not deliver a cross over design as this would have precluded long term follow-up, which is critical when measuring recovery after stroke.</p><p>This study has a number of limitations; foremost this was a feasibility study performed in a single centre, and experience of participants may not reflect those seen in other centres. Furthermore, a heterogeneous group of participants was included, and this may limit potential to detect efficacy. Animal data is based on models of large artery occlusion, as seen clinically in cortical infarction&#x02013;there is no experimental data in lacunar stroke or small vessel disease.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] However, the only clinical study of G-CSF in chronic stroke was performed in elderly patients with white matter disease.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] When this study was developed in conjunction with stroke survivors, they strongly argued for broad inclusion criteria, to make the study more accessible and the results generalizable. Whilst this is important in a definitive phase 3 study, it may have compromised the likelihood of achieving interpretable findings in this phase 2 study. Unfortunately study funding did not permit multi-disciplinary rehabilitation therapy input so physiotherapy was chosen to focus on motor recovery. We did however explore efficacy in other domains including cognition, mood and quality of life. A number of studies have recently shown significant differences in the outcome of patient reported quality of life,[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] as we did here with G-CSF. This finding warrants further exploration. Finally, the timing and duration of the therapy intervention in this population may have been too little too late. Experimental models showing that plasticity is greatest earlier after stroke,[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and that recovery is related to use-dependent.[<xref rid="pone.0161359.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] Therapy so late after stroke may be better aimed at preventing deterioration, rather than stimulating plasticity. Future work should focus on participants where stimulating plasticity is more like, earlier after stroke.</p><p>In summary, this is the first study to assess the feasibly of testing the combination of G-CSF and physiotherapy in chronic stroke. Whilst delivery of G-CSF in chronic stroke was feasible and well tolerated, the acceptability of being randomised to no physiotherapy was a limiting factor, and we failed to achieve the planned quantity of additional therapy. As such, we believe larger factorial trials to study the combination of G-SF and physiotherapy using this design are not supported. Future work should focus on safety and efficacy of G-CSF given earlier after stroke onset, alongside on-going clinical rehabilitation, to stimulate use dependent plasticity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0161359.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>Consort Checklist: CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0161359.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0161359.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Additional result tables.</title><p>(A) Side effects reported by drug treatment group.
