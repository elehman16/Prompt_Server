Patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not they experienced vomiting and/or moderate-to-severe nausea during the acute phase (high- and low-risk groups, respectively). Primary efficacy endpoint was the complete protection (CP) against delayed vomiting and moderate-to-severe nausea. Patient&#x02019;s satisfaction (0&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mm visual analog scale) was also analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among the 209 low-risk patients undergoing MEC, delayed CP occurred in 82.9&#x000a0;% of those who received single-dose dexamethasone and 89.8&#x000a0;% of those who received 3-day dexamethasone (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.165). Of the 271 low-risk patients undergoing AC, CP was achieved in 71.7&#x000a0;% of those treated with single-dose dexamethasone and 84.2&#x000a0;% treated with 3-day dexamethasone (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.019). In spite of these observations, the patient satisfaction data was not influenced by dexamethasone regimen. In both cohorts, occurrence of acute vomiting or moderate-to-severe nausea was the key independent-predictor for delayed vomiting or nausea, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The dexamethasone-sparing regimen provides adequate delayed protection in patients undergoing MEC who are at low risk for delayed symptoms, and can still be discussed for low-risk AC patients as the daily difference in control is modest. Additional dexamethasone doses can be customized on the basis of occurrence or absence of acute symptoms in the first cycle of MEC and even AC.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Palonosetron</kwd><kwd>Dexamethasone</kwd><kwd>Delayed CINV</kwd><kwd>MEC</kwd><kwd>AC</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Optimal prevention for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) depends on recognition of the intrinsic emetogenicity of a chemotherapeutic agent as well as an understanding of its potential to induce acute symptoms (within the first 24&#x000a0;h) or delayed symptoms (typically between days 2 and 5 after single-day chemotherapy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Delayed CINV may occur in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) containing cyclophosphamide, anthracyclines, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, or irinotecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, combination chemotherapy regimens often increase the potential to induce CINV compared to most individual agents. Accordingly, women who receive the combination of an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) are at a particularly high risk of acute and delayed CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In light of this, some of the major anti-emetic guidelines have reclassified this combination as highly emetogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], while those of the MASCC organization have categorized MEC as AC or non-AC MEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Two recent phase III trials comparing a 1-day dexamethasone regimen to a 3-day dexamethasone regimen, both combined with palonosetron on day 1, in patients undergoing either a broad range of MEC regimens or AC showed similar outcomes with the two regimens in both settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, a meta-analysis of individual patient data from these two studies provided evidence that, irrespective of age, the 1-day regimen is not associated with a loss in overall anti-emetic protection in women undergoing AC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In spite of routine use of prophylactic dexamethasone in oncology practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], concerns remain about tolerability of this agent, especially when administered as part of multi-day anti-emetic regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is well known that the occurrence of delayed nausea and vomiting may be strongly influenced by the control of these symptoms within the first 24&#x000a0;h after chemotherapy initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This evidence prompted us to reanalyze data from the cohorts of patients undergoing either MEC or AC who were included in the two clinical trials of the dexamethasone-sparing regimen to provide separate estimates of effectiveness against delayed CINV depending on whether or not vomiting and significant (i.e., moderate-to-severe) nausea were controlled in the acute phase. In the current analysis, efficacy findings from the high-risk cohort of AC can provide a framework for interpretation of the results from the cohort of MEC. Overall, the estimates may permit to evaluate anti-emetic effectiveness in the delayed phase without the confounding effect due to the occurrence of acute symptoms. They also should help clinicians in customized decision making about whether or not to administer additional dexamethasone doses in prevention of delayed CINV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and treatment</title><p>The present reanalysis is based on two cohorts of chemo-naive patients who were included in two randomized clinical studies investigating the dexamethasone-sparing regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Patients who received either MEC for a solid tumor or AC-containing chemotherapy for breast cancer, took the study medication, and completed the follow-up period (days 1&#x02013;5 following chemotherapy initiation) were evaluable according to a modified intention-to-treat analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Assessments</title><p>Patients made daily entries in their diary for 5&#x000a0;days after starting chemotherapy. Patients included in the analysis assessed the severity of nausea by either a visual analog scale (VAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] or a verbal category scale (no nausea, mild&#x02009;=&#x02009;did not interfere with normal daily life; moderate&#x02009;=&#x02009;interfered with normal daily life; or severe&#x02009;=&#x02009;required the patient to be bedridden) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For the purpose of this post hoc analysis, patients were divided into two groups according to the effectiveness of prophylaxis against nausea and vomiting during the first 24&#x000a0;h (acute phase): a low-risk group, which included patients who experienced neither vomiting nor moderate-to-severe nausea within the acute phase, and a high-risk group, which included patients who experienced one or both of these symptoms. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients with protection against both vomiting and moderate-to-severe nausea on days 2 through 5 (delayed phase) after the first cycle of chemotherapy. The secondary end points were protection against delayed vomiting, protection against delayed moderate-to-severe nausea, duration of delayed symptoms, and maximum severity of delayed nausea. Duration was defined according to the number of days during the delayed phase (4-day period) when patients experienced either vomiting or nausea: &#x02265;2 out of the 4&#x000a0;days was considered severe, and 1 out of the 4&#x000a0;days was considered less severe. The patient&#x02019;s satisfaction with anti-emetic coverage was assessed by a satisfaction VAS that was a 100-mm line marked &#x0201c;not at all satisfied&#x0201d; at the left-hand end and &#x0201c;totally satisfied&#x0201d; at the right-hand end. Patients completed the satisfaction VAS on day 6 during their first cycle of chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For patients who rated the severity of their nausea on a VAS, the daily scores were converted into verbal categories according to the following schema: no nausea defined as a VAS score of less than 5&#x000a0;mm; mild nausea defined as a VAS score of 5 to 24&#x000a0;mm; moderate nausea defined as a VAS score of 25 to 74&#x000a0;mm; and severe nausea defined as a VAS score of 75 to 100&#x000a0;mm. The cutoff selected for severe nausea was defined according to the results of a prospective study evaluating the concordance between a four-point verbal category scale and a VAS in assessing nausea severity in patients undergoing chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to compare categorical variables in the low-risk and high-risk groups.</p><p>Multivariable logistic-regression models with occurrence (yes vs. no) of either delayed vomiting or nausea (moderate-to-severe or mild) as the dependent variable were generated to test for differences between anti-emetic regimens, while controlling for standard covariates (i.e., age, gender, and alcohol consumption as appropriate) and the occurrence of acute vomiting and moderate-to-severe nausea. To determine the occurrence of first-order interactions between anti-emetic regimen and standard covariates, they were included one by one into the statistical model. If the interaction term was not statistically significant, it was removed from the model. Results were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with associated 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CIs) and two-tailed <italic>P</italic> values. All the secondary analyses were evaluated in an explorative or descriptive manner, and therefore, no adjustment for multiplicity was applied.

All <italic>P</italic> values were two-tailed, and a <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 624 evaluable patients who were enrolled in the two clinical trials, 237 received a MEC regimen for a solid tumor and 380 received AC for breast cancer.

However, any clinical benefit conferred by reducing the overall exposure to dexamethasone should not compromise the ability to effectively control CINV. Hence, we investigated the impact of vomiting or significant nausea occurring in the first 24&#x000a0;h after chemotherapy initiation, the most important risk factor for delayed CINV, on delayed outcome of palonosetron plus single-dose dexamethasone in patients included in two randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

In addition, there were no between-treatment differences in the duration of delayed symptoms as well as the severity of delayed nausea occurring in patients at low risk. Since both duration and severity of delayed symptoms may impact on health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the finding can be considered as further proof of the effectiveness of the dexamethasone-sparing regimen in the setting of MEC. More recently, a phase III, noninferiority trial involving 305 patients undergoing mainly oxaliplatin-, irinotecan-, or carboplatin-based MEC (73, 13, and 12&#x000a0;% of the enrolled patients, respectively) also demonstrated that palonosetron plus single-dose dexamethasone provide protection against CINV which was noninferior to that of the same regimen with dexamethasone for 3&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>We showed that, among low-risk AC patients, there is a statistically significant improvement associated with additional dexamethasone doses in protection against delayed vomiting and significant nausea, and this benefit is due to an improved control of moderate-to-severe nausea. However, clinicians should also keep in mind that the between-treatment difference in daily control of delayed moderate-to-severe nausea is of only modest magnitude (less than 10&#x000a0;% on each single day) among low-risk patients. It is interesting to note that the occurrence of significant nausea in the acute phase was the only independent predictor for delayed nausea in the AC cohort, and there was no apparent impact on the overall patient&#x02019;s satisfaction with the 3-day dexamethasone regimen. Overall, the results from the current analysis should encourage clinicians to discuss the dexamethasone-sparing regimen for low-risk AC patients. To put the findings in a proper clinical perspective, we must consider that current guidelines recommend adding a neurokinin-1 (NK<sub>1</sub>) receptor antagonist (RA) to the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA and dexamethasone regimen for the optimal prevention of CINV caused by AC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A recent phase III, superiority trial comparing palonosetron, dexamethasone, and aprepitant on day 1 followed by either aprepitant or dexamethasone on days 2 and 3 in this setting failed to detect any dexamethasone-induced improvement in the rate of delayed complete response (primary end point) as well as in any secondary end point including no nausea, no significant nausea, maximum severity of nausea, and duration of nausea in the delayed phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, significantly more women receiving dexamethasone on days 2 and 3 experienced insomnia or heartburn in the delayed period following the first cycle of AC. Since most of the improvement produced by the three-drug regimen is expected to occur in patients at low risk, these findings support the view that the potential benefit of further dexamethasone in these patients may be overcome when a NK<sub>1</sub>RA is given on day 1. Consistent with this supposition, in a recent trial of breast cancer patients receiving AC, 67&#x000a0;% had delayed complete protection, 82&#x000a0;% had no delayed vomiting and 77&#x000a0;% experienced no delayed moderate-to-severe nausea among patients given the 1-day three-drug regimen of NEPA (a combination of the novel NK<sub>1</sub>RA netupitant and palonosetron) and dexamethasone, versus 60, 76, and 71&#x000a0;%, respectively, of patients who received palonosetron plus single-dose dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Given the consistency of results and the total number of patients enrolled onto these two trials with NK<sub>1</sub>RAs, we suggest that in breast cancer patients at low risk treated with the 1-day three-drug regimen the benefit of further dexamethasone may have little relevance for the control of delayed CINV. Interestingly, it has been reported that in breast cancer patients undergoing the first cycle of AC nausea continued to affect more patients than vomiting, even when they received aprepitant plus dexamethasone on days 2 and 3 post-chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. If a NK<sub>1</sub>RA is not available, the clinicians should consider that there are currently no data from adequately powered randomized trials that evaluated the efficacy of a dexamethasone-sparing approach with an older 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RA compared to the same approach with palonosetron in the setting of AC. It also should be noted that the dexamethasone-sparing approach has been developed taking advantage of the superiority of palonosetron, when administered alone or in combination with dexamethasone, compared to a single dose of older antagonists in the control of delayed CINV caused by non-AC and AC MEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>One limitation of this study is that it is a post hoc analysis. In spite of this, the overall results we gathered on the effectiveness of the dexamethasone-sparing regimen in the homogeneous cohort of AC, which has a particularly high-risk for CINV as a whole, support and extend the clinical relevance of the findings observed in the MEC cohort at lower risk. Another limitation is that pre-chemotherapy patient&#x02019;s anxiety and personal history of nausea or vomiting were not recorded, and these data might help the decision-making process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The current analysis strongly supports the position that optimizing the overall risk-benefit ratio for dexamethasone is possible because the choice of using additional steroid doses can be customized on the basis of the occurrence or absence of acute CINV in the first cycle of MEC, and possibly in AC. Accordingly, additional dexamethasone doses could be offered selectively to patients receiving the dexamethasone-sparing regimen who experienced vomiting or significant nausea in the acute or delayed phases following the first cycle of MEC or AC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>L.
