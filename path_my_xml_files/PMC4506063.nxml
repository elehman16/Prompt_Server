As fruit and vegetables are the main dietary sources of carotenoids, skin yellowness may be a function of regular fruit and vegetable consumption. However, most previous studies have used tablets or capsules to supplement carotenoid intake, and less is known of the impact of increased fruit and vegetable consumption on skin color. Here, we examined skin color changes in an Asian population (Malaysian Chinese ethnicity) over a six week dietary intervention with a carotenoid-rich fruit smoothie. Eighty one university students (34 males, 47 females; mean age 20.48) were assigned randomly to consuming either a fruit smoothie (intervention group) or mineral water (control group) daily for six weeks. Participants&#x02019; skin yellowness (CIELab b*), redness (a*) and luminance (L*) were measured at baseline, twice during the intervention period and at a two-week follow-up, using a handheld reflectance spectrophotometer. Results showed a large increment in skin yellowness (p&#x0003c;0.001) and slight increment in skin redness (p&#x0003c;0.001) after 4 weeks of intervention for participants in the intervention group. Skin yellowness and skin redness remained elevated at the two week follow up measurement. In conclusion, intervention with a carotenoid-rich fruit smoothie is associated with increased skin redness and yellowness in an Asian population. Changes in the reflectance spectrum of the skin suggest that this color change was caused by carotenoid deposition in the skin.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by an informal grant from the Crops for the Future Research Centre (CFFRC) at University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus.

In the skin, carotenoids can act as antioxidants, potentially benefitting the reproductive and immune systems [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and contributing to protection against the damaging effects of UV light [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Carotenoids cannot be synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> in the human body, so must be obtained from dietary sources, primarily from fruit and vegetables [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Dietary carotenoids can accumulate in human skin and generate measurable changes in skin color&#x02013;particularly yellowness (CIELab b*) [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A number of previous studies have examined the impact of carotenoid supplementation&#x02014;in the form of capsules or tablets&#x02014;on skin color. Stahl and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] found an increment in carotenoid levels in human skin after participants consumed capsules containing 25 mg of beta-carotene per day for 12 weeks. A similar effect was obtained with a supplement containing 24 mg (total) of three common dietary carotenoids (beta-carotene, lutein and lycopene) daily for 12 weeks. An increment in skin yellowness (b*) was observed after 6 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Correlational studies have examined the relationship between regular dietary fruit and vegetable intake and skin color [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Individuals with a higher estimated regular dietary carotenoid intake (based on analysis of food frequency questionnaire data) had a yellower (higher b*) skin tone [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Naturally increased fruit and vegetable intake over a six-week period has also been associated with increased skin yellowness (b*) and redness (a*)[<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, previous studies have not included control groups, exposing them to the possibility that confounding variables (such as increased sun exposure) may be contributing to the effect. Similarly, the impact of dietary intervention with fruit and vegetables (as opposed to supplementation tablets) on skin color has not previously been examined.</p><p>Most previous studies have focused on Caucasian populations, though Coetzee and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] report that intervention with 15 mg beta-carotene capsules for 8 weeks had no measurable color change effect on the darker, sun-exposed facial and outer-arm skin of black Africans, though color change effects were found in photoprotected skin areas. To our knowledge, the impact of carotenoid intervention has not previously been investigated in an Asian population.</p><p>In the current study, we examine the impact of dietary intervention with a carotenoid-rich fruit and vegetable smoothie on the skin color of an Asian population in a randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and all work was approved by the Faculty of Science Ethics Committee at the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus.

For each item, participants indicated how frequently they consumed it (never, once a week, 2&#x02013;4 times a week, 5&#x02013;6 times a week, once per day, 2&#x02013;3 times per day, 4&#x02013;5 times per day), and the number of standard portions consumed per sitting. A photograph of a standard portion of the relevant food item was provided alongside each question in order to aid identification and to serve as a reference for standard portion size.</p><p>Total carotenoid and energy intake was estimated for each participant based on the &#x0201c;Nutrient Composition of Malaysian Foods&#x0201d; by Tee et al. [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Values for items not found in Tee et al.

[<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (honey dew). Total daily carotenoid intake was calculated by multiplying the carotenoid content of one portion of each food item by the number of portions consumed per sitting, by the number of times the participant consumed that food item per week (where the response in the FFQ was a range of days, the mid-point was used), divided by 7 to give per day consumption, and finally summed across all food items to give an estimate of total daily carotenoid intake at baseline. A similar process was used to calculate daily energy intake.</p><p>Participants were pseudo-randomly assigned into the control or intervention group based on their baseline total carotenoid intake using the following procedure. Participants were ranked by carotenoid intake and randomly assigned in pairs, such that one of the two participants with the highest daily carotenoid intakes was randomly assigned to the intervention group and one to the control group, and so on, to ensure a balanced distribution of high and low carotenoid consumers in each group.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Dietary intervention</title><p>Participants in the intervention group received a fresh fruit smoothie (500 mL), and control group participants received a bottle of filtered water (500 mL; described as &#x0201c;purified, detoxifying water&#x0201d;) every weekday for six weeks. Both groups were told that both the smoothie and the water have potentially beneficial effects on skin health. Six different smoothie recipes were created to deliver variations in flavor (<xref rid="pone.0133445.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Each smoothie contained freshly prepared carrot juice (250 mL per smoothie), and locally grown tropical Malaysian fruit (kedongdong, chiku, pulasan, starfruit and red dragonfruit). Depending on availability of raw ingredients, recipes A&#x02013;F were prepared on 9, 8, 2, 7, 7 and 4 of the days, respectively. Each smoothie contained 3% (w/w) lipids, in the form of milk, cream or oil to ensure optimal bioavailability of carotenoids from an aqueous food matrix [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and lipids were provided in the form of milk, cream or oil. All fruit and vegetables were peeled and juiced with the exception of chiku, banana and red dragon fruit, where fruit pieces were blended with the mixed juices and the lipid source using a standard kitchen blender. After blending the mix thoroughly for 5 minutes the fresh smoothie was distributed to participants in reusable opaque plastic drinking bottles (to reduce possible photo-degradation of carotenoids; unpublished data suggests that carotenoid degradation in our smoothies in the bottles was negligible). Participants were asked to consume the smoothie within 3 hours of preparation. Participants from the control group collected five bottles of mineral water at the beginning of each week, and were asked to drink one bottle each weekday. Six different smoothie recipes (A&#x02013;F) were created to deliver variations in taste. Energy content of the smoothie recipes was calculated using Tee et al.

A Konica Minolta CM2600D reflectance spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure skin color in CIELab color space&#x02013;this has the advantage of taking accurate measurements in a perceptually uniform color space in which color axes are based on the opponent color properties of the human visual system, therefore representing color in a perceptually meaningful way. CIELab color space consists of luminance (L*), red-green (a*) and blue-yellow (b*) axes (see [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for a detailed description). Color was measured at right cheek, left cheek and forehead (<xref rid="pone.0133445.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). All measurements were conducted in duplicate, and the mean value of all measurements at the three face locations was taken as the measured value for analysis. Skin reflectance was measured at 10 nm intervals across from 360&#x02013;740 nm (a range which encompasses the visual spectrum and extends slightly into the ultraviolet and infrared regions of the spectrum).</p><fig id="pone.0133445.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0133445.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Skin color measurement of face regions.</title><p>Locations of skin color measurements.

Smoothie samples were freeze dried and carotenoids were extracted using ethanol/hexane (4:3, v/v) in 5 consecutive extraction cycles. Each smoothie sample was extracted and analyzed in triplicate. Extracts were kept at -20&#x000b0; C until HPLC-UV analysis. A Varian HPLC was used comprising of two solvent pumps (Varian 212-LC, CA, USA), a degasser (Degassit, MetaChem, Ludenscheid, Germany), an autosampler (Varian 410, CA, USA), and a UV-VIS detector (Varian 325, Agilent Technologies, Germany). Mobile phase A (MPA) consisted of methanol/water/ammonium acetate (1M) (97:3:0.2, v/v) and mobile phase B (MPB) consisted of MTBE. Carotenoids were separated on a Phenomenex Ultracarb ODS (30) HPLC column, with a length of 150 x 4.60 mm and 5 &#x003bc;m particle size (Phenomenex, CA, USA). Analysis was conducted at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 mL/min using a gradient from 0 to 10% MPB from 0 to 15 min, 10 to 50% MPB from 15 to 45 min, followed by a wash step consisting of 50 to 100% MPB from 45 to 50 min, 100 to 0% MPB from 50 to 51 min and an equilibration phase from 51 to 65 min at 0% MPB. Carotenoids were identified based on their co-elution with authentic standards. &#x003b2;-carotene was purchased from Nacalaitesque Inc. (Kyoto, Japan), while &#x003b1;-carotene and lycopene (and other carotenoids) were received from DSM (The Netherlands/Germany). Carotenoid quantification was based on absorption at 450 nm and calibration curves were prepared using standard solutions whose carotenoid content was precisely determined following quantitative spectrophotometry and the Beer Lambert law (as described in [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]).

This color change remained constant over the rest of the study period (measurement in week 7), and at the follow up measurement two weeks after the end of the intervention (measurement in week 9).

This effect was seen only in the intervention, and not the control group. Further, the change in skin reflectance spectra is consistent with an increase in skin carotenoid content, rather than melanin or hemoglobin.</p><p>While previous studies have examined only the b* (yellowness) axis [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we also examined the L* and a* axes. Participants in the intervention but not control group exhibited increased skin redness (a*). Carotenoids are a group of pigments that range in color from yellow to red [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and we find that the change in skin reflectance is consistent with deposition of both yellow (&#x003b2;-carotene) and red (lycopene) carotenoids in the skin. This finding is consistent with previous evidence that consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated with increment in skin redness (a*) [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and suggests that skin color changes are due to increased skin carotenoid deposition, and not sun tanning or skin blood perfusion. Further, our use of a control group that consumed filtered water instead of smoothie, and in whom the skin color changes were not observed, adds to our confidence that the skin color changes can be attributed to carotenoid consumption.</p><p>Deposition of carotenoids on the body surface has been widely reported for birds, where bright red and yellow carotenoid-based ornaments are displayed on the feathers (e.g. the red-winged blackbird, <italic>Agelaius phoeniceus</italic>, displays red epaulets based on red ketocarotenoids [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], or the yellow plumage of the greenfinch, <italic>Carduelis chloris</italic>, is based on yellow carotenoids [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). The color of male birds&#x02019; plumage is thought to be related to the consumed component of carotenoids, their relative concentrations, and the total concentration of all carotenoids [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Since yellow carotenoids are known to be deposited in human skin, impacting skin color [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], it may be that the red carotenoid compounds also impact human skin color.</p><p>Other red-purple pigments may have been present in the fruits used to prepare the smoothie, for example betacyanin, a red-violet-colored pigment found in dragon fruit [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], though we are unaware of studies documenting the deposition of these pigments in human skin. Finally, it may be suggested that the increment of skin redness may also be due to increased blood perfusion in the intervention group, though we are unaware of any documented mechanism by which this may occur.</p><p>There was also a slight change in skin lightness between baseline measurement and the third measurement. However, this change also occurred in the control group, suggesting that it was not caused by the carotenoids contained in the fruit smoothie. Instead, we suggest that the slight decrement in skin luminance may have been due to an increase in skin melanin levels, which impacts skin reflectance across the visible and ultraviolet light spectrum [<xref rid="pone.0133445.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], due to the increment of the exposure to sunlight during the duration of intervention.

Nevertheless, since the smoothie recipes contained between 276 and 380 kcal, caution should be exercised to ensure that consumption of carotenoid-rich fruit smoothies takes place as part of a balanced diet.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have demonstrated for the first time that dietary supplementation with a carotenoid-rich fruit smoothie causes skin color changes in an Asian sample. In addition to increased yellowness, an increment in redness was also identified, suggesting that red carotenoid pigments (such as lycopene) may also be deposited in the skin. Analysis of the reflectance spectra of participants&#x02019; skin supported this hypothesis. Since appearance provides a powerful motivation for improved health behaviors, increased skin redness and yellowness have been shown to enhance healthy appearance in Caucasian samples, and a large number of people consume less than the recommended allowance of fruit and vegetables, intervention with a carotenoid-rich fruit smoothie may represent a viable mechanism for increasing fruit and vegetable intake, though this should take place as part of a healthy and balanced diet. Finally, this study suggests that skin color may serve as a non-invasive biomarker of fruit and vegetable intake.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The significant contribution of PhD student Cho Eun Seon is gratefully acknowledged: Cho Eun Seon quantified carotenoid content in smoothies using HPLC-UV/VIS analysis.
