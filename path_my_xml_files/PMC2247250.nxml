A total of 569 patients with cancer of the breast and involvement of axillary lymph nodes were randomised, after simple mastectomy with axillary sampling, to receive either no adjuvant treatment or intravenous adriamycin 50 mg, vincristine 1 mg, cyclophosphamide 250 mg, methotrexate 150 mg and fluorouracil 250 mg (AVCMF) every 21 days for eight cycles. Randomisation was stratified according to menopausal status and tumour size. Treatment was started within 14 days of surgery in 94% of patients. Eighty-eight per cent of patients received at least seven cycles of chemotherapy with no dose reduction. The median relapse-free survival was prolonged by 14 months in patients treated with AVCMF (chi2 1 = 11.7; P = 0.0006). In the premenopausal group this period was 17 months (chi2 1 = 8.8; P = 0.003) compared with 8 months in the post-menopausal group (chi2 1 = 3.3; P = 0.07). Neither overall survival nor survival in these subgroups was significantly influenced by treatment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00122-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="911" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00122-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="912" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00122-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="913" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00122-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="914" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00122-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="915" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00122-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="916" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00122-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="917" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00122-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="918" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
