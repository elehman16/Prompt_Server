Group II: Patients received placebo tablets identical in appearance to atenolol tablets for the same period and interval.</p><p>The randomization was performed using sealed envelopes indicating the group of the assignment at the time of preoperative assessment. A blinded anesthesiologist who did not participate in the study or data collection, read the number contained in the envelope and made group assignments.</p><p>A blinded chief nurse who did not participate in the study confirmed that each patient ingested the tablets as scheduled. Patients were monitored for the side effects of atenolol, including arrythmia, confusion, chest pain, tingling, or numbness in the hands or feet, and signs of an allergic reaction.</p><p>Patients were premedicated with 0.05 mg/kg midazolam intravenously 15 min before entering the operating room. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg, and vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg to facilitate endotracheal intubation. We used an armored endotracheal tube to minimize the risk of kinking and to ensure that the tube is well secured before and after turning the patient. Central venous and radial artery catheter was inserted and Foley catheter was used to decompress the urinary bladder.</p><p>Patients were placed in prone position and precautions were taken to avoid abdominal compression. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 1.5%, and top up dose of vecuronium was 0.01 mg/kg every 30 min. Signs of awareness (eg, increase in arterial pressure greater than the targeted MAP, tearing, or sweating) were managed with additional boluses of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl. Ventilator settings were adjusted to maintain endtidal CO<sub>2</sub> around 35 mmHg.</p><p>All patients in both the groups received intraoperative SNP as hypotensive agent, SNP was infused 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g/kg/min by infusion pump (injectomat MC Agilia, Fresenius Kabi AG, Homburg - Germany) to maintain MABP between 55 and 60 mmHg. SNP solution was prepared by the addition of 25 mg to 500 mL of 5% dextrose.

Quality of surgical field was better in the atenolol group.</p><p>Operative bleeding resulting from cut vessels may be arterial, dependent on the MABP; capillary, which is dependent on blood flow in the capillary bed; or venous, dependent on venous return and venous tone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Anesthetic agents alone can affect the amount of blood loss through their pharmacologic effects on the degree of vasodilation and heart rate. Inhalational agents have a vasodilatory effect in a concentration-dependent manner.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] However, the extent of reflex tachycardia is quite variable. Regarding the apparent reflex tachycardia in isoflurane, sevoflurane is considered as more beneficial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] However, in this study we used isoflurane to clarify the potential benefits of beta-blockers in reducing heart rate and lack of availability of sevoflurane in our hospital.</p><p>SNP is one of the most commonly used agents for controlled hypotension. It is a direct-acting, nonselective peripheral vasodilator that primarily dilates resistance vessels leading to venous pooling and decrease SVR systemic vascular resistance. Peripheral vasodilation results in baroreceptor-mediated sympathetic responses with tachycardia and increased myocardial contractility. The renin&#x02013;angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system are also activated. These changes increase cardiac output, which may offset the initial decrease in MABP. Plasma catecholamine and renin activity may remain elevated after discontinuation of nitroprusside, resulting in rebound hypertension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>So the combination of &#x003b2;-blocker and nitroprusside to induce controlled hypotensive anesthesia for spinal surgeries will improve the quality of surgical field, reduce adverse effects of nitroprusside, and decrease the amount of nitroprusside used through negative inotropic and chronotropic effect of &#x003b2;-blocker. Also, this combination will prevent the postoperative rebound hypertension after discontinuation of SNP.</p><p>The target MABP was achieved easily and rapidly with low dose in patients who received preoperative atenolol even so the quality of surgical field was better at high level of MABP than in the patients in control group. Also, atenolol group showed less intraoperative blood loss and less amount of blood transfused than the other group.</p><p>Our study was in agreement with the study by Apipan <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] which used oral propranolol premedication during hypotensive anesthesia with nitroprusside in orognathic surgery and concluded that premedication with oral propranolol is safe and effective to reduce reflex tachycardia and the amount of SNP used.</p><p>The effect of oral &#x003b2;-blocker premedication was previously studied by Nair <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] who concluded that optimum conditions were present in the patients received &#x003b2;-blocker in comparison to placebo. However, the crucial finding in Nair's study was the significant correlation between the surgical grade and heart rate without any correlation with the MABP.</p><p>Also Marshall <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] examined the effects of controlled hypotension induced with SNP with or without propranolol on cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renin-angiotensin system, and concluded that propranolol, when given during SNP hypotension, exhibits an early cardiovascular response manifested as a decrease in cardiac output and heart rate and a delayed action on the kidney resulting in an inhibition of renin release and decrease the amount of SNP.</p><p>This study had several limitations including lack of control group who were given placebo because of the proven benefit of controlled hypotension. These patients had no comorbid illness. The quality of the operative field was subjectively evaluated by surgeons, which may predispose to inaccuracy in collecting data.
