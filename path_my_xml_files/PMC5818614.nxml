We aimed to test whether processing in the striatum is under causal control by cortical regions in the human brain by investigating the effects of offline transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over distinct frontal regions associated with motivational, cognitive and action goal processing. Using a three-session counterbalanced within-subject crossover design, continuous theta burst stimulation was applied over the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, or premotor cortex, immediately after which participants (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) performed a paradigm assessing reward anticipation (motivation), task (cognitive) switching, and response (action) switching. Using task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed the effects of stimulation on processing in distinct regions of the striatum. To account for non-specific effects, each session consisted of a baseline (no-TMS) and a stimulation (post-TMS) fMRI run. Stimulation of the aPFC tended to decrease reward-related processing in the caudate nucleus, while stimulation of the other sites was unsuccessful. A follow-up analysis revealed that aPFC stimulation also decreased processing in the putamen as a function of the interaction between all factors (reward, cognition and action), suggesting stimulation modulated the transfer of motivational information to cortico-striatal circuitry associated with action control.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The frontal cortex is responsible for many higher-order functions, such as goal setting, planning, and action selection. The frontal cortical regions involved in these functions are connected with anatomically distinct sub-regions of the striatum, organized in topographically specific circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Connections between ventral/anterior parts of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the ventral/anterior caudate nucleus form a reward circuit, and have been associated with motivational goal setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Another circuit, connecting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) with more dorsal/posterior parts of the caudate nucleus, is associated with cognitive control processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Finally, in the action circuit, (pre-)motor cortices are connected with the posterior parts of the striatum, the putamen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Initial evidence for the existence of these topographically specific cortico-striatal circuits came from work with experimental animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Although this animal work generally converges with human work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, the majority of techniques (i.e. neuroimaging) used to investigate circuits in the human brain are correlational, and thus do not inform about whether activity in one region <italic>causes</italic> a change in another region. Several studies have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to show that frontal regions can exert control over striatal processing. In the absence of any specific behavioral task, offline TMS applied over the dlPFC and the motor cortex affected processing in the striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Such cortical control over striatal processing was shown to be functionally specific, at least in the motor domain: TMS over cortical motor areas changed processing in the putamen during tasks that depend critically on the motor circuit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Whether motivational reward processing in the striatum is under control of (more ventral/anterior) cortical regions in the human brain remains unclear. Here we aimed to test this, while also assessing the functional and anatomical (topographic) specificity of such fronto-striatal control.</p><p id="Par4">We employed an offline TMS protocol, continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, aimed at decreasing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> neural signaling in the three frontal regions embedded within functionally distinct cortico-striatal circuits known to implement motivational, cognitive and action goal processing. Using data from an independent fMRI dataset with the same paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, we selected three cortical stimulation sites for this study. We did so by assessing the main effect of reward, switching between tasks (cognition), and switching between response buttons (action). Thus, a reward-related region in the aPFC was selected as being part of the reward circuit, a task-switch-related region in the dlPFC as part of the cognitive circuit, and a response-switch-related region in the premotor cortex (PMC) as part of the action circuit. TMS was followed immediately by task-related blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to measure the consequences of these interventions on the task-evoked BOLD signal in the striatal subregions embedded within each functionally distinct circuit: the ventral/anterior caudate nucleus, dorsal/posterior caudate nucleus, and the putamen. Task-related processing was assessed using an established paradigm that we have used extensively to investigate reward anticipation (reward) and cognition (switching between tasks)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To assess task-related processing in each of these cortico-striatal circuits, we stimulated these three cortical sites on three separate days, using a counterbalanced within-subject crossover design. Moreover, to account for non-specific effects related to the day rather than to the stimulation, each session consisted of two task-related fMRI runs: a no-TMS baseline and a post-TMS stimulation run (in counterbalanced order).</p><p id="Par5">Based on <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence about the topography of human cortico-striatal connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, we predicted that TMS over each cortical target site would attenuate functionally specific activity in its striatal target site. Specifically, we predicted a) that TMS over the aPFC would attenuate activity in the ventral/anterior caudate nucleus, the main striatal target of the aPFC specifically related to one functional domain (reward-processing), but not another (task switching or response switching). We furthermore set out to test the prediction that b) TMS over the dlPFC would attenuate activity related specifically to task switching in the posterior caudate nucleus, the main striatal target of the dlPFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and c) that TMS over the PMC would attenuate activity related specifically to switching between response buttons in the putamen, the main striatal target of the PMC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In addition, we anticipated these effects to be anatomically specific at the level of the striatum: i.e., we anticipated that cortical stimulation of one frontal region (e.g. TMS over the aPFC) would alter processing in a distinct region of the striatum (e.g. caudate nucleus) and not in another region (e.g. putamen). Finally, we anticipated this effect would be anatomically specific at the level of the cortex: i.e., specific to TMS over one frontal region (e.g. TMS over the aPFC, but not of the dlPFC or PMC, would alter processing in the caudate nucleus).</p><p id="Par6">We performed additional exploratory analyses of the effect of TMS over the aPFC. These analyses were based on the idea that the organization of cortico-striatal circuits is not strictly parallel. Instead, signals from each cortico-striatal circuit can be transferred to other circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, thereby providing a mechanism by which reward-predictive signals (in the reward circuit) can engage and alter cognitive processes (in the cognitive circuit) and guide action selection (in the action circuit). We tested this possibility in two ways. First, we assessed the effect of aPFC stimulation as a function of the two-way interaction between reward anticipation and task switching, expecting modulation in more dorsal/posterior parts of the caudate nucleus, which is part of the cognitive control circuit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Second, we assessed the effect of aPFC stimulation as a function of the three-way interaction between reward, task switching and response switching, expecting to observe modulation in the sub-region of the striatum that is part of the action circuit, namely the putamen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par7">Of the 31 healthy participants who started the main experiment, 27 participants (ranging from 18&#x02013;25 (mean 21.7, SD 1.95) years old; 14 men) completed all sessions and were included in the analyses (Supplementary Information). Of the 13 females, 9 used hormonal contraceptives. The menstrual cycle of the remaining 4 females was not related to the cTBS session: i.e., the aPFC, dlPFC and PMC sessions all took place on average 2.75 weeks after the last menstrual period. The experimental protocol was approved by -and the study carried out in accordance with the guidelines of -the local ethics committee (CMO Arnhem/Nijmegen: 2011/244).

Finally, to control for order effects, we counterbalanced the order in which the stimulation fMRI and baseline fMRI runs were completed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Specifically, 14 participants first performed the baseline fMRI run, followed by TMS, followed by the second fMRI run (stimulation fMRI; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The remaining 13 participants started with TMS and fMRI (stimulation fMRI), followed by a 30-minute break - to allow for the TMS effects to wear off - and then the second fMRI run (baseline fMRI; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) (Supplementary Information: Order effects).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Experimental design. Each participant received continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) (indicated with thunderbolts) on three occasions. On each occasion, a different cortical region was targeted with TMS: anterior prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal premotor cortex (indicated with distinctly shaded thunderbolts in the top panels of a and b). The order in which each participant received cTBS over these regions was counterbalanced between participants. During each session, each participant completed two fMRI runs; one after TMS (stimulation fMRI) and one without prior influence of cTBS (baseline fMRI).

Participants always had to respond to response-incongruent arrow-word combinations (targets) with a left or right button press, either by responding to the direction indicated by the arrow (i.e. [&#x02190;] or [&#x02192;]) or to the direction indicated by the word (i.e. &#x02018;left&#x02019; or &#x02018;right&#x02019;). A task cue preceding the target (by 400&#x02009;ms) indicated which task (arrow or word) the participant had to respond to on the current trial. The task on the current trial could either change (unpredictably) with respect to the preceding trial (i.e. task switch trial; arrow-word as in trial 4, or word-arrow as in trial 2) or remain the same (i.e. task repeat trial; arrow-arrow (trial 3), or word-word). In addition to such task switches, the paradigm allowed us to look at response switches, i.e. whether the correct response (left or right button, the correct response is printed in bold), remained the same (i.e. response repeat trial; left-left as in trial 2, or right-right) or switched (i.e. response switch trial; right-left, as in trial 4 or left-right as in trial 3) compared with the previous trial. In the current version of the paradigm we made sure that the task switches occurred independently from response switches; half of the task-repeat trials and half of the task-switch trials required a switch of the response button (e.g. trial 3 and 4 respectively), whereas the remaining half of the trials required a response repetition (e.g. trial 2). In addition, as in previous versions, we manipulated the amount of anticipated reward (&#x020ac;0.01 vs. &#x020ac;0.15) on a trial-by-trial basis by means of a reward anticipation cue. At the start of each trial this reward cue indicated the amount of reward for that trial, contingent on a correct and sufficiently fast button press (see paradigm). Immediately following the response, feedback was given (e.g., &#x0201c;correct! 15 cents&#x0201d; in green ink, or &#x0201c;incorrect! 0 cents&#x0201d; in red ink) see also ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_21346_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e611"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">Each session started with a number of practice blocks (Supplementary Information).

The main effect of reward was modelled at the onset of the reward cue (high/low). For the main effects of task switching, response switching and the interaction between task factors, the following events were modelled at the presentation of the arrow-word target: [the type of reward trial (high/low) x the task cue (arrow/word) x task (switch/repeat) x response (switch/repeat)]. We additionally modelled the feedback (correct low/correct high/incorrect/too late), breaks (duration&#x02009;=&#x02009;30&#x02009;s), the first trial of each block, and response omissions.

Secondly, we addressed our primary question: whether stimulation of the prefrontal cortex <italic>influences</italic> task-related striatal processing. To this end, we assessed whether stimulation of the aPFC, relative to baseline (i.e. the contrast aPFC<sub>BASE-STIM</sub>), changed Reward-related processing in the striatum. More specifically, we anticipated that stimulation of the aPFC (vs. baseline) would reduce the BOLD response exclusively as a function of the main effect of Reward, and not as a function of the main effect of Task switching or Response switching (functional specificity), selectively in the caudate nucleus and not in the putamen (anatomical specificity at the level of the striatum) and exclusively after stimulation of the aPFC and not after stimulation of the dlPFC or PMC (anatomical specificity at the level of the cortex) (see Supplementary Information for a more detailed description of these analyses). In addition, we assessed whether stimulation of the dlPFC (dlPFC<sub>BASE-STIM</sub>) and the PMC (PMC<sub>BASE-STIM</sub>) changed processing related to Task-switching and Response-switching in the striatum. More specifically, we predicted TMS would modulate the BOLD response selectively in a more dorsal/posterior portion of the caudate nucleus and in the putamen, respectively. Finally, we performed two post-hoc exploratory analyses to further explore the effects of aPFC stimulation. Here, we aimed to test whether stimulation of the aPFC would not only affect processing as a function of Reward, but also processing as a function of the integration between Reward and Task switching, or between Reward, Task switching and Response switching. This was based on the idea that the organization of cortico-striatal circuits is not strictly parallel, but that signals from each cortico-striatal circuit can be transferred to other circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

Therefore -in supplementary analyses- we investigated the data from each of the three fMRI sessions separately, to determine whether there was a main effect of Task switching during the baseline run of the dlPFC session, and a main effect of Response switching during the baseline run of the PMC session. These analyses also did not reveal any significant clusters in the striatum. The absence of effects in the striatum undermines the logic of testing whether cTBS decreases the BOLD response in the striatum during the stimulation vs. baseline run if no significant activation is detected during the baseline run. In addition, activated voxels for the main effect of Task switching were located up to 3.2&#x02009;cm away from the dlPFC stimulation site, and the activated voxels for the main effect of Response switching were located up to 4.6&#x02009;cm from the PMC stimulation site. By contrast, the stimulation coordinate for the aPFC was located within 1&#x02009;cm of the cluster that was activated by the main effect of reward.

Assessment of the effect of aPFC stimulation on this integration (4-way interaction: aPFC<sub>BASE-STIM</sub> x Reward<sub>HIGH vs. LOW</sub> x Task<sub>SWITCH vs. REPEAT</sub> x Response<sub>SWITCH vs. REPEAT</sub>) revealed that aPFC stimulation decreased signaling in the left putamen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) (left: P<sub>SVC_FWE</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.020, t&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.96, k&#x02009;=&#x02009;66; z&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.86, peak x, y, z&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;28, &#x02212;8, 8).

This was driven by a Reward effect on trials where the Task and Response either both switched, or both repeated, i.e. Task-Response congruent trials, with no Reward effect on Task-Response incongruent trials. This was confirmed by post-hoc tests on beta-values extracted from the anatomical (AAL) left putamen (see methods). This analysis revealed, on trials when the task repeated, a larger reward-related BOLD response during congruent (response repeat) vs. incongruent (response switch) trials (Reward x Response: F(1, 26)&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.341, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.047).

Moreover, the reward, cognition and action circuits are organized in an anterior to posterior and ventral to dorsal gradient, both in the frontal cortex and the striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In the current study we aimed to assess these cortico-striatal circuits by asking whether task-related processing in the striatum is under control of the functionally homogenous region of the prefrontal cortex. For example, we aimed to assess whether reward-related processing in the caudate nucleus is under control of processing in the anterior PFC. To assess these hypothesized cortico-striatal causal interactions, we employed an offline TMS protocol aimed at decreasing neural signaling. In a three-session baseline-controlled counterbalanced within-subject crossover design, cTBS was applied over three distinct cortical sites, associated with motivational reward processing (anterior PFC), cognitive control (dorsolateral PFC) and action control (premotor cortex). Immediately following the application of cTBS, participants performed a rewarded task-switching paradigm in the MRI scanner. The paradigm tapped into all three cognitive domains: reward processing, task switching (cognitive control) and response switching (action control), allowing the assessment of task-related processing in distinct sub regions of the striatum (the caudate nucleus and the putamen).</p><p id="Par44">We first assessed whether stimulation of the aPFC (compared with baseline) altered reward-related processing in the caudate nucleus. To correct for the comparison between two search volumes (caudate nucleus and putamen), we considered an effect P<sub>SVC-FWE</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.025 as significant. We observed a marginal decrease (P<sub>SVC-FWE</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.040) in the reward-related BOLD response in the striatum after aPFC stimulation compared with baseline. However, this effect did not reach significance according to our statistical threshold. Accordingly, we question its reproducibility, particularly given the relatively low physiological plausibility of the effect (with the cluster extending into the cerebrospinal fluid) and the lateralization to the right, non-stimulated hemisphere.</p><p id="Par45">Next, we tested whether information from the reward circuit (i.e. the aPFC) could be transferred to another cortico-striatal circuit. We observed that stimulation of the aPFC altered processing in the putamen, the sub-region of the striatum that is part of the action circuit, but only when assessed as a function of the interaction between reward, cognitive control and action control. Specifically, aPFC stimulation elicited a reduction in task-related BOLD response (compared with the aPFC baseline fMRI run). Importantly, we also found that this aPFC<sub>(BASE vs. STIM)</sub> effect was different from the effect in the dlPFC<sub>(BASE vs. STIM)</sub> and PMC<sub>(BASE vs. STIM)</sub> sessions. This is an important finding, because it shows that the effect of aPFC stimulation on task-related processing in the striatum was not likely related to non-specific effects such as the sensation of cTBS. These findings provide causal evidence in humans that stimulation of the aPFC causes a change in task-related processing in the striatum and, moreover, show that such distally induced task-related modulation is not restricted to the targeted cortico-striatal circuit (reward), but that modulated processing in the reward circuit can alter processing in another circuit (i.e. in the action circuit). Previous work has shown that cTBS over the aPFC can alter processing in regions distant from the site of stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, in that study perfusion-MRI, instead of BOLD was used. In addition, the effects of aPFC stimulation were observed in the amygdala during the processing of emotional stimuli. We show here that the more commonly used BOLD-fMRI technique can be used successfully to assess cTBS-induced changes in task-related striatal processing.</p><p id="Par46">The current study does not directly address the mechanisms by which aPFC stimulation affects processing in the putamen. However, based on previous work, two potential routes are most plausible. First, signals from the aPFC could reach the putamen via direct cortico-striatal connections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Second, the signal from the aPFC could be conveyed to the putamen via spiraling dopaminergic connections between the striatum and the midbrain, i.e. striatal-nigro-striatal (SNS) connections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Although results are largely consistent across species, it should be noted that these theories are derived primarily from work with non-human primates or rodents.</p><p id="Par47">The anatomical specificity of the effects at the level of the cortex should be interpreted with caution. It cannot be argued that specifically aPFC stimulation, and not stimulation of the other two regions, can affect the integration between reward, cognition and action in the putamen. For this claim to hold, it would be necessary to show that stimulation of the dlPFC or PMC was effective. The absence of any task-related effects on striatal processing after stimulation of the dlPFC or PMC in this study thus precludes this claim. The null-effect following stimulation of the dlPFC and PMC was unexpected, especially considering previous work showing that stimulation of the dlPFC and the motor cortex can alter processing in the striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, contrary to those other studies, the current study is the first to assess the effect of cTBS on task-related processing in the striatum. Although Ko and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> applied cTBS over the prefrontal cortex, they did not assess task-related processing, nor did they assess effects with BOLD-fMRI. While two other studies did observe effects of cortical TMS on task-related BOLD-fMRI in the striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, those studies did not stimulate the PMC, but the primary motor cortex, using a different TMS protocol (rTMS: 1&#x02013;10&#x02009;Hz instead of cTBS).</p><p id="Par48">One explanation of the null effect after dlPFC and PMC stimulation is that - irrespective of TMS - we did not observe an effect of task switching or response switching in the striatum. This was true both across all sessions, and during the relevant baseline session (e.g. the baseline dlPFC session for the effect of task switching). The logic of testing whether stimulation of a cortical region will reduce striatal BOLD response does not hold unless there is a measurable BOLD response in the striatum during baseline. Alternatively, it is conceivable that the cortical regions we stimulated do not have a (causal) role in switching between tasks (dlPFC) or response buttons (PMC). This is consistent with the distance between the peak of the task-related fMRI activity (white circles in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d&#x02013;f</xref>) and the stimulation sites (arrow in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d&#x02013;f</xref><bold>)</bold>. Stimulation was targeted based on fMRI coordinates from a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, the coordinates functionally activated in the present study, both for task-switching (dlPFC) and response switching (PMC), differed from the previous sample to the extent that no task-related activation actually overlapped with the coordinates at which TMS was applied. Although the exact spatial resolution of TMS is highly dependent on several factors, a resolution in the range of millimeters up to several centimeters has been suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In any case, the field induced by TMS declines rapidly with distance from the coil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In the current study, this implies that we might have failed to stimulate the task-relevant circuits for the dlPFC and PMC but not for the aPFC sessions. More specifically, a meta-analysis of fMRI coordinates associated with task switching has identified the inferior frontal junction as a key node<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The region reported in the meta-analysis (x, y, z coordinates: &#x02212;40, 4, 30) overlaps with a cluster activated by the task-switching contrast in the current study (x, y, z coordinates: &#x02212;40, 4, 30). This same cluster in the inferior frontal gyrus has been observed in two previous studies using the same paradigm (x, y, z coordinates: &#x02212;52, 6&#x02212;, 34<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>; x, y, z coordinates: &#x02212;48, 12, 28<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>). In combination, this suggests that the main effect of task switching in the inferior frontal gyrus observed in the current study was most likely a reliable effect, and that the dlPFC region we stimulated was too anterior to target the cortico-striatal circuitry crucial for task switching.</p><p id="Par49">In terms of response switching, previous fMRI studies assessing effects of response switching embedded in a task-switching paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, reported effects more posterior (y&#x02009;=&#x02009;0) than our stimulation coordinate (y&#x02009;=&#x02009;10). Interestingly, both studies reported peak coordinates that are located within the parietal cluster we report, suggesting that this may have been a more successful target for cTBS in the current study.</p><p id="Par50">We previously reported modulation of the BOLD response in dorsal parts of the striatum during the integration between reward and task switching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This interaction was not observed in the current dataset. An important feature of the previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> however was that those effects were revealed exclusively as a function of inter-individual variance in the dopamine transporter (<italic>DAT1</italic>) genotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par51">The current study was designed to modulate processing in the striatum. In keeping with this hypothesis, we showed that stimulation of the aPFC modulates BOLD responses in the striatum. However it did not induce any behavioral changes, which is not uncommon with offline TMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The absence of a behavioral effect precludes us from making any claims about whether stimulation of the aPFC and the consequent effects on the striatum were behaviorally relevant. On the other hand, it simplifies the interpretation of the observed BOLD changes. If stimulation had also changed behavior, this in itself would be expected to alter task-related signal in the striatum, complicating interpretation. In the absence of such effects, the observed changes in brain activity can be straightforwardly attributed to a causal effect of cortical TMS.</p><p id="Par52">Several neuropsychiatric/neurological disorders, such as substance use disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease are accompanied by altered processing in cortico-striatal circuits for reviews see refs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

The current work adds to the knowledge required for a better understanding of ways by which subcortical circuits can be targeted effectively via non-invasive cortical stimulation. We show that stimulation with cTBS, which is well tolerated over the anterior prefrontal cortex, can alter processing in the striatum.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec27"><p>
