joint mobilization and flexion-distraction techniques on chronic low back pain and disc
heights. [Subjects] This study was conducted with 31 chronic low back pain patients who
were divided into a manual therapy group (MTG; n=16) and a spinal decompression therapy
group (SDTG; n=15). [Methods] The MTG was treated using joint mobilization techniques and
flexion-distraction techniques, and the SDTG was treated using spinal decompression
therapeutic apparatuses. Conservative physical therapy was used in both groups, and the
therapy was implemented three times per week for 6 weeks. The visual analog scale (VAS)
was used to measure patient&#x02019;s low back pain scores, and a picture archiving and
communication system was used to measure disc height by comparing and analyzing the
images. [Results] In comparisons of the VAS within each of the two groups, both the MTG
and the SDTG showed significant decreases. In comparisons of disc height within each of
the two groups, the MTG showed statistically significant increases. [Conclusion] Manual
therapy using joint mobilization techniques and flexion-distraction techniques is
considered an effective intervention for addressing low back pain and disc heights in
patients with chronic low back pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Manual therapy</kwd><kwd>Joint mobilization techniques</kwd><kwd>Spinal decompression therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Among the many musculoskeletal system diseases, low back pain is one that frequently occurs
on a daily basis. It is also a factor that greatly affects quality of life, leading to
socioeconomic problems due to increases in treatment expenses and other troubles that affect
a person&#x02019;s life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The causes of low back pain include structural causes that arise due to lesions in the
spine, psychological causes due to stress, and biodynamic causes resulting from declines in
musculoskeletal system functions. The pain restricts activities, reduces use of joints,
weakens secondary muscle strength, and leads to a vicious cycle that curtails physical
functions and productive activities<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
There are diverse treatment methods for low back pain. In most cases, these treatment
methods include bed rest, wearing of assistive devices, traction therapy, thermotherapy,
electrical stimulation therapy, exercise therapy, drug treatment, spinal decompression
therapy, or manual therapy, and surgery is performed when treatment is not effective or
conditions are serious<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among manual therapy techniques, joint mobilization techniques affect the
neurophysiological and mechanical aspects of pain, pain arc, or muscle spasm, and they are
effectively used in treating joints with hypomobility, those that gradually show mobility
restrictions, and those that are functionally fixed<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treatment with flexion-distraction techniques, which is another
method of manual therapy, is used to restore damaged spinal nerves and surrounding
structures by reducing the stricture of the paraspinal ligaments, increasing the movement of
metabolites in discs, reducing the stress and internal pressure imposed on the posterior
discs through the opening of the spinal facet joints, and expansion intervertebral
foramens<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Spinal decompression therapy is used to treat radiating pain resulting from chronic low
back pain. This is a treatment method that alleviates disc problems and removes the pressure
imposed on the discs by creating zero gravity or negative pressure conditions inside the
spinal canal so that nutritive substances and oxygen are supplied to the discs. This reduces
pressure inside the intervertebral discs by softly extending certain parts of the discs
through the decompression of lesion sites<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although there have been many studies of manual therapy methods for chronic low back pain
patients, few studies have compared manual therapy using joint mobilization techniques and
flexion-distraction techniques with spinal decompression therapy. Therefore, the aim of this
study was to examine the effects of manual therapy using joint mobilization techniques and
flexion-distraction techniques and using spinal decompression therapy on the low back pain
and disc heights of patients with chronic low back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with 31 patients (eight male, 23 female) who visited S Orthopedic
Hospital located in Daegu, Korea, because their low back pain had persisted for at least
three months. These patients had been diagnosed by orthopedic specialists as having
radiating pain resulting from chronic low back pain. Among the study subjects, the manual
therapy group&#x02019;s (MTG; n=16) mean age was 45.75&#x000b1;8.51&#x02005;years, mean height was 162.00&#x000b1;8.98&#x02005;cm,
and mean weight was 59.00&#x000b1;12.22&#x02005;kg. The spinal decompression therapy group&#x02019;s (SDTG, n=15)
mean age was 48.25&#x000b1;9.53&#x02005;years, mean height was 160.25&#x000b1;6.14&#x02005;cm, and mean weight was
62.25&#x000b1;11.96&#x02005;kg. All the subjects read and signed consent forms, in accordance with the
ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study subjects were selected from
among those who had no history of surgery in the region of their lumbar vertebrae, spinal
tumor or intervertebral disc infection, inflammatory disease (such as rheumatism), or
findings of fracture and were diagnosed as having no contraindication to manual therapy.</p><p>All the subjects were treated three times per week for 6 weeks. The MTG was treated with
joint mobilization techniques and flexion-distraction techniques for 15 minutes per time,
and the SDTG was treated with spinal decompression therapy for 20 minutes per time. Both
groups were treated with a hot pack (20 minutes), ICT (15 minutes), and ultrasound (10
minutes) from among conservative physical therapy techniques for approximately 45 minutes
per time.</p><p>The joint mobilization techniques used on the MTG included two techniques. Lumbar segmental
flexion mobilization was applied as the first technique as follows: When the patient was
lying on his/her side on a hospital bed, the patient&#x02019;s hip joint and knee joints were bent.
While facing the patient, the therapist placed his right hand (fixed hand) on the lumbar
vertebrae of the patient and fixed his fingers on the transverse process or spinous process
of the vertebra to be treated. The therapist&#x02019;s left hand (moving hand) was placed on the
sacral vertebrae of the patient, and his fingers were placed on the transverse process or
spinous process of the vertebra to be treated. The therapist&#x02019;s chest was put into tight
contact with the two knee joints of the patient to move the patient&#x02019;s pelvis in a
caudal&#x02013;ventral direction. Second, lumbar segmental extension mobilization was applied as the
second technique as follows: In the same position as used for lumbar segmental flexion
mobilization, the fingers of the theraphist&#x02019;s right hand were placed and fixed on the
spinous process of the vertebra, and the therapist&#x02019;s left hand was placed behind the two
knees of the patient to extend the patient&#x02019;s pelvis in a cranial-dorsal direction with the
patient&#x02019;s lower extremities lifted slightly from the floor.</p><p>Flexion-distraction techniques were implemented using a Zenith-Cox flexion table
(Zenith-100, Williams Healthcare Systems, Elgin, IL, USA). In a prone position on the table,
the patient fixed his/her two ankles, and the therapist fixed his right hand&#x02019;s thenar
eminence on the spinous process of the vertebra of the patient and grabbed the handle above
the fixed ankles with his left hand. The therapist moved his left hand slowly down to below
the table to move the patient&#x02019;s pelvis in a caudal-ventral direction and maintained this for
approximately 4 seconds. Flexion-distraction motions were applied five times to cause
flexion-distraction for a total of 20 seconds. Five repetitions of the motions were defined
as one set, and three sets were performed.</p><p>The SDTG was treated using a spinal decompression therapeutic apparatus (MID 4&#x02005;M Series;
WIZ Medical, Geumsan, Republic of Korea). The patient took a supine position on the
therapeutic apparatus, and the pelvic and thoracic regions were fixed using air belts; a
sacrum extension was applied so that lumbar lordosis could be maintained. A traction power
equivalent to one-quarter of the weight of the subject was first applied, and the level of
traction power was increased by one level at a time at a certain rate. When the patient felt
pain due to the increased traction power, the traction power was reduced or maintained. The
ratio between hold time and rest time was set to 2:1 for the treatment.</p><p>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess pain scales. To measure disc heights,
images of discs were taken using radiation tomography equipment (R-630-150; Dongkwang,
Republic of Korea), and the images were magnified three times using a picture archiving and
communication system (PACS; Infinitt, Healthcare, Seoul, Republic of Korea). Intervertebral
disc (L4&#x02013;5) heights were measured by summing disc heights measured from the front, middle,
and rear of the intervertebral disc and dividing the sum by 3. The measurement formula was
(a+b+c/3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig 1.</label><caption><p> A: Lateral plain film for lumbar spine. B: Disc heights of the anterior (a), middle

significance level &#x003b1; was set to 0.05. To examine the pain scales and disc heights of the
chronic low back pain patients, paired sample t-tests were conducted for comparison within
groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Both the MTG and the SDTG showed significant decreases (p&#x0003c;0.05) in VAS in within-group

joint motions. Godges et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that
among manual therapy methods, joint mobilization techniques are valuable for clinical
utilization in the treatment of low back pain. Cox et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when manual flexion-distraction correction was applied
to 94 out of 100 patients with low back pain or lower extremity pain, good or excellent
results were obtained by 73%, and low back pain and lower extremity pain were reduced by 50%
in 15.95 days. In a study conducted by Ferreira et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, when manual spinal therapy was administered to chronic low back
pain patients, statistically significant decreases were found in VAS scores. Kruse and
Cambron<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when Cox&#x02019;s
flexion-distraction therapy was implemented 16 times on patients with L3&#x02013;4 and L4&#x02013;5
intervertebral disc herniation who reported lumbar neuropathy, the patients&#x02019; numeric pain
scale scores significantly decreased. Wheeler and Hanley<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> applied Cox&#x02019;s flexion-distraction therapy 12 times to sprain or
strain patients, and the patients showed good or excellent responses in the L4&#x02013;5 region at
rates of 83.1% and 83.5% respectively. Gose et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that decompression therapy reduced pain, increased
mobility, and showed significant effects through changes in MRI images.</p><p>In the present study, both the MTG and the DTG showed significant decreases in VAS score
within each of the groups. The significant decreases in VAS score in the MTG are considered
to have occurred because the joint mobilization techniques and flexion-distraction
techniques applied to the spine stimulate the mechanical receptor that suppresses the
transmission of pain stimuli at the level of the spinal cord and brain stem to produce
pain-reducing effects; in the manual spinal therapy, the movements of the joints reduce the
transmission of stimuli by the ligaments and articular capsules, which are pain-sensitive
tissues, in the spine to reduce pain. The significant decreases in VAS scores in the SDTG
occurred because spinal decompression therapy generates a negative pressure to reduce the
pressure inside the intervertebral disc to below &#x02212;100 mmHg, increases the diameter of the
intervertebral foramen through separation of the centrum, and relieves the pressure on the
nervous tissues, thereby reducing radiating pain and the neurologic defect<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
An increase in the diameter of the intervertebral foramen can induce an increase in blood
flow through the blood vessels in spinal nerves and the intervertebral foramen, and the
increased blood flows can remove inflammatory exudate. In addition, spinal decompression
therapy increases the generation of constituents through decompression to improve the
ability to bind to water so that the water content increases, and the relief of degenerative
changes enables increased nutrition supply. Therefore, the space in the spinal cavity is
widened, and the paraspinal muscles and ligaments are extended to reduce secondary
myofascial pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study of the relationship between flexion-distraction therapy and intervertebral disc
spaces, Gudavalli<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> experimented with the
lumbar vertebrae in dead bodies and reported that the L4&#x02013;5 disc space increased by
approximately 1.87&#x02005;mm, the intervertebral disc angle increased by approximately 3.5&#x000b0;, and
the L5&#x02013;S1 disc space and angle increased by approximately 3&#x02005;mm and 6&#x000b0;, respectively. Gay et
al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported distraction techniques
performed on 15 dead bodies, and measurements of nucleus pulposus pressure and annulus
fibrosus compressive stress indicated a pressure decrease in the intervertebral disc of 99%
using distraction techniques, 73% using extension-distraction techniques, and 65% using
flexion-distraction techniques. Ozturk et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that patients with herniated intervertebral disks treated
with traction therapy showed significant effects in straight leg raise and disc herniation
indexes.</p><p>In the present study, comparisons within groups showed that disc heights significantly
increased in the MTG treated with joint mobilization techniques and flexion-distraction
techniques but showed no significant difference in the SDTG. The reason for these results is
that the application of joint mobilization techniques and flexion-distraction techniques
produced negative pressure in the intervertebral disc space so that the disc part that was
pushed to the rear of the intervertebral disc went inside and the vertebral pulp was
positioned in the center of the annulus fibrosus. This removed stimuli from the annulus
fibrosus fibers that feel pain and restored the physiological movements of the spinal
joints, reducing low back pain and inducing structural changes, i.e., widening the spaces
between spinous processes to widen the spaces between intervertebral discs<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the aforementioned
techniques increase the diameter of the intervertebral foramen, reduce pressure on the
nervous tissues, widen the spaces between the intervertebral discs, and open the posterior
motor units by enlarging the sagittal diameter in the spinal canal<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The stress imposed on the posterior disc decreases as the
spinal facet joints are opened by flexion-distraction correction, and the incompletely
dislocated spinal facet joints recover to provide the normal range of posterior spinal
movements.</p><p>There were several limitations of this study. First, the number of subjects was small
because the subjects were selected from those who visited the hospital for 6 weeks. Second,
the subjects&#x02019; daily lives could not be completely controlled. Third, the treatment period
was short, and thus long-term monitoring was not possible. In future studies, the effects of
long-term decompression therapy and manual therapy should be examined using a large group of
patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="ths"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name></person-group>: Effect of manual adjustment and gym-ball exercise on sEMG, cobb&#x02019;s angle,
