craniovertebral angle, cervical range of motion, pain, and muscle fatigue in subjects with
a forward head posture (FHP). [Subjects and Methods] A total of 28 sedentary females (age
20 to 39&#x02005;years) with FHP were randomly assigned to pilates (n=14) and combined (n=14)
exercise groups. The study was a randomized, controlled, double-blind study with the two
groups performing exercise 50&#x02005;min/day, 3 days/week, with an intensity of 11&#x02013;15 rating of
perceived exertion (RPE) for ten weeks. The main outcome measures were craniovertebral
angle, cervical range of motion (ROM), pain levels assessed by visual analog scale (VAS),
and neck disability index (NDI). Surface electromyography was also used to measure muscle
fatigue. [Results] There were significant increases in craniovertebral angle and cervical
ROM in the pilates group, but none in the control group. The only significant differences
in muscle activity were recorded in the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the pilates group.
Both exercise programs had positive effects on pain measures, as VAS and NDI were
significantly decreased. [Conclusion] The results suggest that pilates could be
recommended as an appropriate exercise for treatment of FHP in sedentary individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Forward head posture</kwd><kwd>Pilates</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The increasing use of electronic screens, such as smart phones and personal computers, to
an average of about 8 hours per day<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, has
led to an increasing number of people with forward head posture (FHP). FHP is defined as the
anterior positioning of the cervical spine<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> and is associated with muscle imbalance, pain, fatigue, and limited
motion of the cervical spine<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. FHP may
cause herniated cervical intervertebral discs and other adverse effects, such as chronic low
back pain and temporomandibular disorder<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The craniovertebral angle (CVA) is defined as the angle of the horizontal line running
through the C7 spinous process and the line connecting the C7 spinous process to the tragus
of the ear. Yip et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
participants with significantly smaller craniovertebral angles had FHP and tended to have
increased levels of neck pain. Similarly, Sohn and associates<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that participants with smaller craniovertebral angles tended
to have more tension-type headaches, and lower cervical range of motion. Szeto et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a higher frequency of neck and
shoulder pain in individuals who spent long periods using computers. Previous research<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> suggests that weakened postural muscles
should be strengthened and shortened muscles should be lengthened in order to improve
postural alignment and alleviate FHP.</p><p>A variety of therapeutic exercises designed to mitigate the symptoms of FHP have been
examined<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The majority of treatments have focused on the deep neck flexors,
as they play a major role in stabilizing the alignment of the cervical spine<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, one drawback of focusing on this
alignment alone is that the treatment focuses on the symptom and not the reasons why the
misalignment has developed. FHP may develop due to genetic and behavioral reasons, such as
reading from a sitting position with reading material on a horizontal surface; i.e. looking
down at a desk. Individuals may not be aware of their bad posture and thus remain in this
straining posture for prolonged periods.</p><p>Pilates training is designed to improve general body flexibility and health by emphasizing
core strength, posture, and coordination of breathing with movement<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. It improves posture by enhancing body awareness<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and can be used as self-exercise, and can
be easily tailored for treatment of specific postural misalignments. Based on Kuo et
al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> report that pilates can improve
thoracic kyphosis in older adults, we infer that pilates may improve cervical spine health
by increasing the craniovertebral angle. Therefore, this study compares the effects of
pilates and combined stretching and strengthening exercise programs on CVA, cervical range
of motion (ROM), neck and shoulder pain, and muscle fatigue in individuals with FHP. We
hypothesize that pilates may be an effective exercise method for alleviating FHP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>After the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Pusan National University
Medical Center (05-2011-038), informed consent was obtained from each participant.
Participants were screened primarily on the severity of FHP (when the tragus was in front of
the center of shoulder; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Craniovertebral angle measurement</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-2009-g001"/></fig>), and secondarily via e-mail questionnaire to exclude any spinal problems, pain or
dysfunction or a visual analogue pain score above 3 of the neck and shoulder region,
temporomandibular disease, as well as any other confounding health problems. Additionally
any participants with experience in pilates and who were not sedentary were excluded from
the study.

into a pilates (PG, n=14) or combined (CG, n=14) exercise groups. All participants were
unaware of the exact exercise type until the end of testing period. The pilates and combined
exercise instructors were placed in their respective areas and were blinded to the study
purpose.</p><p>Both groups exercised for 50 minutes a day, three days a week at an intensity of 11&#x02013;15
rating of perceived exertion (RPE), with added load each week for ten weeks. The Pilates
exercise program consisted of modern pilates that focused on balancing FHP-related major
muscle group-stretching of the neck extensors and pectoral muscles and strengthening of the
deep neck flexors, shoulder retractors, back, and abdominal muscles with co-activation of
the core muscles by focusing on breathing technique<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. We used thera-bands to more effectively strengthen the muscles. If
any motion caused pain during exercise, the participant was instructed to rest until the
pain subsided. The combined exercise program consisted of stretching and strengthening
exercises typically used to balance posture<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This exercise also focused on balancing the FHP-related major
muscle groups, although without co-activation of the core muscles. Thera-bands were also
used to strengthen muscles. All sessions were supervised by either pilates or exercise
instructors.</p><p>After receiving an oral explanation and reviewing the institutional review board&#x02019;s informed
consent form, the participants underwent screening for FHP. FHP was determined by measuring
the CVA<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> from a sagittal plane x-ray
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). To maximize compliance, participants
were instructed to report after work to the hospital to participate. Initial testing was
conducted after participant screening and selection. Prior to their participation in the
treatment programs, cervical flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation were tested
using CROM (Performance Attainment Associates, MN, USA), which was specially designed to
measure cervical ROM. All cervical ROM assessments were performed starting at a natural head
posture and explained with demonstrations. After performing each exercise three times, the
average value was recorded. The visual analogue scale (VAS), a simple, sensitive, and highly
reproducible method for measuring pain<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>,
was assessed before and after treatment. Likewise, the neck disability index questionnaire
(NDI), a widely used questionnaire that determines how neck pain affects daily life<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, was also completed before and after
treatment. Electromyography (Telemyo 2400t G2, NORAXON, USA) measurements of the right-side
muscles known to have excessive fatigue and affect FHP; i.e., the upper trapezius,
sternocleidomastoid (SCM), and C4 paraspinals, were recorded at 1,500&#x02005;Hz before and after
the ten-week treatments<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. To obtain each muscle fatigue measurement, the reference
voluntary contraction (RVC) values for three seconds in the sitting position were
measured.</p><p>Noraxon was used to record, analyze, and calculate electromyography-related data. The
median frequency (MDF) was calculated as an index of muscle fatigue, with lower median
frequency corresponding to increased muscle fatigue. Statistical analyses were performed
using PASW Statistics for Windows, version 18.0, and p&#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically
significant differences. To test for the homogeneity of each group, an independent t-test
was used before intervention. To verify the interaction between the groups and periods, we
used split-plot one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). In addition, post
hoc tests were used to analyze the significant differences between each factor in the group
before and after intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Descriptive statistics for the two groups and the pre- and post-treatment measurements are

a total of 12 participants were analyzed in the pilates group. There were no statistical
differences between the pre-treatment descriptive characteristics and variables of the study
participants. There was significant improvement in CVA in the pilates group between the pre-
(65.65 &#x000b1; 4.53&#x000b0;) and post-treatment (70.09 &#x000b1; 4.78&#x000b0;) measurements (p=0.002). However, there

3.19&#x000b0;). Among cervical ROM measurements, there were significant changes in flexion (p=0.017)
and right rotation (p=0.034) in the pilates group, but no significant differences in these
measurements in the combined exercise group. Similarly, there were significant improvements
in extension (p=0.037), right lateral flexion (p=0.006), right rotation (p=0.045), and left
rotation (p=0.033) in the pilates group, but not in the combined exercise group. There were
no significant differences in VAS between groups. Pain decreased significantly in both the
pilates (p&#x0003c;0.001) and combined exercise groups (p&#x0003c;0.0001) after intervention.
Likewise, there were no significant changes between groups in NDI (p&#x0003c;0.001 for both),
which decreased significantly after intervention. The only significant difference between
the Pilates and combined exercise groups in median EMG frequency data was for the SCM
(p=0.026).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>CVA is commonly used as an indicator of FHP, which is due to muscle imbalance, related to
pain, fatigue, and limited motion of the cervical spine<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Increased CVA improves FHP, which suggests the potential to
mitigate the FHP problem. In this study, Pilates, and not combined exercises, resulted in
significantly increased CVA. The Pilates treatment program appeared to significantly improve
head posture in participants with FHP. In a similar study, Emery et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a 12-week pilates training program
strengthened core muscles and improved thoracic kyphosis. Kuo and associates<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> similarly illustrated that even a ten-week
pilates training program in individuals aged above 60&#x02005;years could slightly reduce thoracic
kyphosis angle. Additionally, Parrott<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that a 14-week pilates exercise program improved standing alignment. FHP in a
standing posture is linked with a lack of control of the abdominal muscles, which aggravates
thoracic kyphosis, making it more difficult to hold the head sufficiently high to maintain
normal eye level<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on the results
of these previous studies, any improvement in thoracic kyphosis is closely related to an
improvement in FHP. Therefore, it seems likely that pilates training, which helps spinal
realignment, may improve FHP. The pilates program in this study focused on improving
systematic balances rather than specific (cervical or thoracic) regions, which emphasizes
core stability and spinal separation. Furthermore, the additional benefits of pilates
exercises include decreased hypertension in shortened and weakened muscles during
exercise<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>; improved breathing methods
(diaphragmatic and rib breathing) that improve core stability; and increased awareness of
postural misalignments. The results of this study indicate that pilates training results in
whole-body muscle retraining, which strengthens the deep neck muscles to improve CVA and
thus reduce neck pain. In contrast, Kuo et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that combined stretching and strengthening exercises
using a ball and foam roller improved FHP and round shoulder in eight weeks. Similarly,
Harman et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that ten weeks
of combined exercise improved FHP.</p><p>In this study, all categories, except left-side flexion in the pilates group, showed
significant increase in the cervical ROM. Although the results of the left-side flexion were
not statistically significant, they did show a slight increasing tendency. A lack of ROM in
cervical rotation has been associated with chronic headaches<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The International Headache Society, defines headaches associated
with soft tissue or bone structures of the neck as cervicogenic headaches. Headache patients
with neck and shoulder pain can decrease their pain and increase cervical ROM by practicing
Pilates exercises. It is unclear why only the pilates group experienced increased cervical
ROM, as resistive exercises for spinal, scapular, and pelvic stability reportedly optimize
mechanical movement and increase ROM<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We hypothesized that the results of the combined exercise group contradicts what we would
expect for the following reasons. First, in our study, the combined exercise treatment used
a range of exercises that focused on correcting systematic muscle imbalances rather than
only focusing on the deep neck muscles, which reduced the amount of time devoted to the neck
muscles. Second, using resistance training may prove counterproductive in women with FHP due
to overwork of the structures of the weak and unstable cervical disks, creating more
movement dysfunction<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Third, pain is
associated with altered muscle recruitment patterns; thus, it may be useful to include
exercises that can retrain muscle recruitment patterns, especially ones that focus on the
theory of stabilizing locally before moving globally<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, as pain increases, muscle guarding becomes pronounced,
leading to limited motion and constant muscle contraction. This high level of muscle
contraction and tone shortens muscles and creates exaggerated muscle imbalances and thus
more pain<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Future studies should
include treatments with specific phases to correct postural malalignments, such as an
initial phase focusing on correcting local malalignments, with a second phase focusing on
global malalignments, and finally a phase devoted to generalized strengthening and
flexibility.</p><p>The results of this study showed significant decreases in VAS and NDI scores for the
pilates and combined exercise groups. Our study agrees other study findings<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> that the CVA is significantly lower in
groups with more self-reported neck pain. In addition, Sohn et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that tension-type headaches become more common with
decreasing CVA. Likewise, individuals with neck and shoulder pain tend to have higher
incidences of headaches<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, as
Pilates exercise increases CVA, its practice should results in a subsequent decrease in neck
and shoulder pain, which may inhibit potential headaches<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Szeto et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> observed higher muscle
fatigue in the trapezius muscle in groups of people with FHP. They also reported that
excessive computer use tends to exacerbate FHP. In this study, the Pilates group did not
have a significant reduction in upper trapezius muscle fatigue, but did show a significant
reduction in SCM fatigue. On the contrary, the combined exercise program did not have
significantly reduced muscle fatigue, and had increased upper trapezius muscle fatigue.
Combined exercise while there is muscle tension around the neck and shoulders due to muscle
imbalance maybe counterproductive as other muscles are forced to compensate; that is, become
overworked and fatigued.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the pilates program was more
effective in improving CVA, cervical ROM, and muscle fatigue than the combination of
stretching and resistance exercise. Pilates focuses on strengthening the core muscles, which
improves an individual&#x02019;s overall posture and postural awareness, which in turn increases
global and local stability. Therefore, pilates should be recommended as an appropriate
method for treatment and prevention of FHP.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hanten</surname><given-names>WP</given-names></name><name><surname>Lucio</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Assessment of total head excursion and resting head
