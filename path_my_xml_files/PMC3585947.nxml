COCs have undergone considerable development since their introduction in the 1960s, including reductions in the dose of synthetic estrogen (i.e. ethinylestradiol)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the incorporation of progestogens with more favorable clinical profiles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]</p><p>However, COCs that contain ethinylestradiol and its prodrug mestranol have been associated with a slight increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as venous thromboembolism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] Nevertheless, these events occur rarely, and the increased risk of thromboembolism during pregnancy and the puerperium must be considered.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] Risk factors for thrombotic or thromboembolic events include age, smoking, a positive family history, genetic thrombophilias (e.g. Factor V Leiden mutation), obesity, dyslipoproteinemia, hypertension, migraine, valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, prolonged immobilization, major surgery, any surgery to the legs, and major trauma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]</p><p>It is well established that the hormonal components of COCs have various effects on hemostasis. Moreover, the adverse effects on hemostatic variables are most likely to be influenced by the estrogen type and dose rather than the type of progestogen used. Although hemostatic surrogate parameters are not predictive of the occurrence of thromboembolic events, their evaluation is part of the development process of COCs. Epidemiologic studies are required to evaluate the incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolism in COC users, since these events are so rare that they cannot be accurately assessed in phase III clinical studies.</p><p>Several attempts to develop COCs containing 17&#x003b2;-estradiol as the estrogenic component have been made based on the hope that this will (i) improve their tolerability and acceptability; and (ii) broaden the choice for COC users.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]</p><p>To prevent the poor cycle control that has been observed with previous 17&#x003b2;-estradiol-containing COCs,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] a novel COC containing estradiol valerate (1 mg estradiol valerate corresponds to 0.76 mg 17&#x003b2;-estradiol) and dienogest with a fixed estrogen step-down/progestogen step-up dynamic dosing regimen has been developed. Estradiol valerate/dienogest has been shown to be associated with reliable contraceptive efficacy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and good cycle control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] Moreover, 17&#x003b2;-estradiol levels have been shown to be stable throughout the cycle, with estrogen levels remaining comparable with those during the early follicular phase.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]</p><p>Based on studies that have evaluated the effect of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol versus ethinylestradiol on hepatic protein synthesis,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] it is expected that estradiol valerate/dienogest will have a considerably reduced hepatic effect compared with COCs containing ethinylestradiol with regard to proteins controlling the hemostatic balance.</p><p>The current study was conducted to quantify the effects of estradiol valerate/dienogest on various key parameters of the coagulation system, indicating changes in the pro-coagulatory, anti-coagulatory, and fibrinolytic activity.

This was manifested in a significantly smaller increase in D-dimer levels (37% vs 88% for estradiol valerate/dienogest and ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel, respectively) and by less pronounced increases in the levels of prothrombin and fibrinogen. The APC resistance, as measured by the partial thromboplastin time, remained unchanged in both groups, whereas the mean APC sensitivity ratio (measured using the Rosing test[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] ) showed a distinctly and statistically significant greater increase in the ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel group. It should be noted that both tests reflect the protein C mediated anti-coagulatory activity in plasma, but the Rosing test shows a higher sensitivity towards concentration changes of the proteins involved. Although no significant differences between treatments were observed in the majority of parameters measured, at cycle three, the proportion of women who had several values outside of the reference range was higher with ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel treatment than with estradiol valerate/dienogest treatment.</p><p>It is generally well accepted that the influence of COCs on coagulation and fibrinolysis depends mainly on the estrogen component of the regimen. The reduced impact of estradiol valerate/dienogest on hemostatic parameters observed in the current study is probably due to the inclusion of estradiol valerate instead of ethinylestradiol as the estrogenic component. Estradiol valerate is considerably less potent than ethinylestradiol in terms of hepatic protein synthesis induction, as demonstrated in clinical studies assessing SHBG, angiotensinogen, and hemostatic parameters.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] However, changes observed with COCs reflect not only influences of the estrogen component, but also those of the progestogen component; indeed, progestogen can affect the binding of testosterone or cortisol to transport proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and the clearance time from serum.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]</p><p>The findings of the current study are also consistent with those of a study that compared the metabolic effects of estradiol valerate/dienogest with a triphasic regimen of ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] In the comparative study with triphasic ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel, levels of factors associated with activation of coagulation increased slightly with both study preparations, but generally remained well within the normal reference range. Observed changes were consistently less pronounced with estradiol valerate/dienogest relative to ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel. Furthermore, increases in the levels of SHBG were observed in both groups, with increases being less marked in women who received estradiol valerate/dienogest compared with women who received ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel. Despite the fact that levels of SHBG increased in the estradiol valerate/dienogest group, mean levels remained within the normal range, whereas in the ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel group, the mean levels of SHBG increased to exceed the normal range.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] It is, however, questionable whether measuring SHBG levels is the most appropriate way of assessing estrogen-induced effects of COCs. SHBG levels increase with use of COCs, with the observed net effect resulting from effects exerted by both components. Estrogen increases SHBG levels in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, at the dose required to produce similar effects on follicle-stimulating hormone suppression, ethinylestradiol increases levels of SHBG to a greater extent than 17&#x003b2;-estradiol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] SHBG levels are decreased by androgens and some progestogens with partial androgenic activity, including levonorgestrel. In contrast, dienogest, drospirenone, and cyprotenone acetate do not counteract the estrogen-induced increases of SHBG.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] Nevertheless, in the current study, increases in SHBG were more pronounced with ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel than with estradiol valerate/dienogest. This is possibly consistent with the inclusion of estradiol valerate instead of ethinylestradiol as the estrogenic component, with estradiol valerate being less potent than ethinylestradiol in terms of hepatic protein synthesis induction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]</p><p>A prudent approach is necessary when attempting to interpret surrogate parameters for clinical outcomes. Hemostaseologic surrogate parameters have not been proven to capture the modifying effect of COCs on the risk of thromboembolic events.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] Biomarkers and surrogate endpoints have important roles to play in exploratory research and development trials, but cannot be used clinically until validated, no matter how intuitively appealing the biomarker may be.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] For a surrogate endpoint to be an effective substitute for the clinical outcome, effects of the intervention on the surrogate must reliably predict the overall effect on the clinical outcome. However, the validity of a surrogate endpoint has rarely been rigorously established.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, it is important that caution is applied in the interpretation of the observed differences in surrogate hemostatic parameters between estradiol valerate/dienogest and ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel since these parameters have not been proven to be predictive of the occurrence of actual clinical events. Nevertheless, the current study is a useful comparison of the impact on hemostatic parameters of a novel dynamically dosed COC containing estradiol valerate/dienogest with that of the established COC regimen containing ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel.</p><p>As such, a COC containing estradiol valerate at dosages of 1&#x02013;3 mg (as used in the current study) may induce less estrogen-related responses in the liver than currently available ethinylestradiol-containing COCs. However, further clinical and epidemiologic studies will be needed to confirm whether this translates into better clinical outcomes over the long term.</p><p>Since the estradiol valerate/dienogest COC is new to the market, epidemiologic study data on cardiovascular safety are currently not available. Moreover, the information from clinical trials is limited, based on the rarity of events such as venous thromboembolism and the limited number of patients investigated in phase III trials. Therefore, it is reassuring that estradiol valerate/dienogest has a similar or less pronounced hemostatic impact than the well established monophasic ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel, a COC that has been comprehensively studied and extensively marketed. Furthermore, results of a double-blind, randomized study suggest that a monophasic COC combining nomegestrol acetate 2.5 mg with 17&#x003b2;-estradiol 1.5 mg might have less of an impact on hemostatic parameters compared with levonorgestrel 0.10 mg/ethinylestradiol 0.02 mg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] The overall magnitude of changes in hemostatic parameters is comparable with those observed with estradiol valerate/dienogest in the current study as shown, for example, by a similar increase in SHBG and by similarly less pronounced increases in prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and fibrinogen and thrombin generation (determined either by the APC sensitivity ratio[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] or by APC resistance as measured by the endogenous thrombin generation method).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] This suggests that COCs comprising either 17&#x003b2;-estradiol or estradiol valerate in equimolar doses may have very similar effects on hemostatic parameters.</p><p>It is possible that lower doses of ethinylestradiol (e.g. 0.02 mg) may have reduced hemostatic effects compared with COCs containing 0.03 mg of ethinylestradiol, such as the comparator used in our study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] However, whether the impact on hemostatic effects is further reduced with even lower doses of ethinylestradiol than 0.02 mg, down to 0.015 mg, may be questionable,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and may also be associated with increased bleeding irregularities; overall incidences of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting of 21%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and 29%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] with 0.015 mg ethinylestradiol have been reported.</p><p>An international prospective, controlled, non-interventional cohort active surveillance study (INAS-SCORE [International Active Surveillance Study&#x02013;Safety of Contraceptives: Role of Estrogens]), which is currently underway, was designed to assess the risks of short- and long-term use of estradiol valerate/dienogest and of established COCs in a study population that is representative of actual users of the individual preparations. A total of 50 000 new users of a COC (starters or switchers) will be followed-up over a 3- to 5-year period to allow documentation of approximately 150 000 women-years. The main clinical outcomes of interest for the short- and long-term follow-up are cardiovascular events, primarily deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular accidents.</p><p>In the current study, there were no safety concerns raised with estradiol valerate/dienogest, and both study treatments were similarly well tolerated. None of the adverse events during the study were rated as serious and only three adverse events in one subject led to premature study discontinuation in the ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel group. Exposure to either of the study treatments was not associated with severe, rare side effects of COCs; there were no cases of venous or arterial thromboembolism reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, a dynamically dosed estrogen step-down/progestogen step-up estradiol valerate/dienogest COC regimen had a minimal impact on hemostatic parameters and was well tolerated.
