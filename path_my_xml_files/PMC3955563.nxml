<bold>Objective</bold>: To Compare the Specific Lumber Mobilization (SLM) techniques and Core-Stability (CS) Exercises with Core-Stability Exercises Alone in Mechanical low back pain (MLP)</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>: A 6 month pretest-posttest design, quasi experimental study was conducted at department of physiotherapy Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH) Peshawar, Pakistan. We conveniently selected a sample 40 patients and placed into two groups. The SLM techniques with CS exercises was applied in group A and CS exercises alone in group B for 6 weeks. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Visual analog scale (VAS) for mechanical low back pain were assessment tools assessed for all patients before and after 6 weeks of physical therapy intervention. Data was analyzed by SPSS and statistical test were applied at 95% level of significance determine the efficacy of both the treatments regimes and compared with each other. </p><p>
<bold>Results: </bold>After comparison between two groups, the group A treated with specific lumber mobilization techniques shows better results in improving pain (p=0.008) and reducing physical disability (p=0.004) as compared to the group B treated with specific lumber mobilization techniques alone (pain intensity: p= 0.172 and physical disability: p=0.201). </p><p>
<bold>Conclusion: </bold>It is concluded that patients with mechanical low back pain will show more improvement in pain and function while treated by specific lumber mobilization and core stability exercises as compared to those patients who will be treated by specific joint mobilization techniques. </p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>Specific lumber Mobilization</kwd><kwd>Core Satiability Exercises</kwd><kwd>Mechanical Low Back Pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain is a common neuro-musculo-skeletal problem affecting 40% of population worldwide at some point in their life and causes significant disability with loss of productive working hours. <sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The common sign and symptoms are local or radicular pain, tenderness, spam, which is aggravated by movement with loss of function. <sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The physical or mechanical causes of low back pain are osteoarthritis,&#x000a0;rheumatoid arthritis,&#x000a0;degeneration of the discs between the&#x000a0;vertebrae&#x000a0;or a&#x000a0;spinal disc herniation, a vertebral fracture (such as from&#x000a0;osteoporosis), or rarely, an infection or tumor.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
</p><p>Diagnosis of mechanical low back pain is commonly made by physical examination, physical tests, palpation, imaging such as x-rays, MRI, and CT scan. <sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Medication, physical therapy, and surgery are most commonly used managements of mechanical low back pain. <sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The physical therapy management varies according to the patient condition, and includes; modalities, exercise therapy, manual therapy and patient&#x02019;s education with a comprehensive home plan of care. <sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>The individual effectiveness of manual physical therapy and core stability exercises therapy are evident in the management of mechanical low back pain, but there is no single study available in the literature on the combined effects of manual physical therapy and core stability exercise therapy. The objective of the current study was to determine the combined effect of manual physical therapy and core stability exercise therapy in the management of mechanical low back pain. <sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>The manual therapy is a commonly used management of mechanical low back pain to improve the mobility of the lumbar spine. These techniques are based on glides passively procured in prone position by manual physical therapists. The techniques used in this research study were central anterior-posterior glides, and unilateral anterior-posterior glides. The aim of specific lumber mobilization techniques is to improve pain and increase mobility <sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. </p><p>The core stabilization exercises for strengthening of spinal muscles to improve their ability to maintain neutral spine using the abdominal, back, neck and shoulder girdle muscles as stabilisers rather than movers. There are two types of core stability exercises; the static activities exercises and dynamic floor exercise. Here in this research study we use Plank, Side plunk, Bridge, and Superman as static activities core stabilization exercise and Side lying with abduction, Oblique crunch, Straight leg raise, and Lying wind screen as dynamic floor core stability exercises <sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.

The specific lumber mobilization techniques ( central antero-posterior -CPA, and unilateral antero-posterior-UPA) were applied in prone lying position at 6-8 glides per session from T12 to L5 and followed by core stability exercises for local muscles (multifidus, transverse abdominis, diaphragm, pelvic floor muscles) and global dynamic muscles (rectus abdominis, internal oblique, external oblique, erector spine) muscles. The physical activities for these core stability exercises are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table-I</xref> and all the activity positions were maintained for 5-10 seconds for 10 repetitions.

Delitto and colleagues developed the clinical practice guidelines on low back pain under the orthopedic section of American Physical Therapy association. They recommended that the non-thrust mobilization improves pain, spinal mobility, and disability in both acute and chronic pain and pain related to lower extremity. These recommendations are based on strong evidence. <sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table-I</label><caption><p>static and dynamic activates for stability exercises</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
