Prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin in women at risk for PE may substantially reduce the prevalence of the disease. Effective screening for PE requiring delivery before 37&#x02005;weeks (preterm PE) can be provided by a combination of maternal factors, uterine artery Doppler, mean arterial pressure, maternal serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A and placental growth factor at 11&#x02013;13&#x02005;weeks' gestation, with a detection rate of 75% at a false-positive rate of 10%. We present a protocol (V.6, date 25 January 2016) for the ASpirin for evidence-based PREeclampsia prevention (ASPRE) trial, which is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial (RCT) that uses an effective PE screening programme to determine whether low-dose aspirin given to women from 11 to 13&#x02005;weeks' gestation will reduce the incidence of preterm PE.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>All eligible women attending for their first trimester scan will be invited to participate in the screening study for preterm PE. Those found to be at high risk of developing preterm PE will be invited to participate in the RCT. Further scans will be conducted for assessment of fetal growth and biomarkers. Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes will be collected and analysed. The first enrolment for the pilot study was in April 2014. As of April 2016, 26 670 women have been screened and 1760 recruited to the RCT. The study is registered on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN13633058.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the largest multicentre, double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled trial to examine the effect of aspirin in women who are high risk of developing pre-eclampsia.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The screening will occur in the first trimester as to allow for the maximum benefit of aspirin.</p></list-item><list-item><p>One hundred and fifty milligrams of aspirin will be used to reduce the incidence of aspirin resistance and maximise the effect.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Follow-up of the offspring is limited to the early postnatal phase.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Pre-eclampsia (PE) is an important cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. There is extensive evidence that the risk of adverse outcome in relation to PE is much higher when the disease is severe and of early onset requiring delivery before 37&#x02005;weeks' gestation (preterm PE), than at term.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> A major challenge in modern obstetrics is early identification of pregnancies at high risk of preterm PE and undertaking the necessary measures to improve placentation and reduce the prevalence of the disease.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Prediction of preterm PE</title><p>Extensive research in the past 20&#x02005;years, mainly as a consequence of the shift in screening for aneuploidies from the second to the first trimester of pregnancy, has identified a series of early biophysical and biochemical markers of impaired placentation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A combination of maternal demographic characteristics, including medical and obstetric history, uterine artery pulsatility index (PI), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and maternal serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) at 11&#x02013;13&#x02005;weeks' gestation can identify a high proportion of pregnancies at high risk for PE.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A recent study involving 58&#x02005;800 singleton pregnancies examined at 11&#x02013;13 weeks&#x02019; gestation has further refined the prediction algorithm for PE. Using this algorithm, the estimated detection rate of preterm PE was 75%, at a false-positive rate of 10%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Prevention of preterm PE</title><p>The prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin for prevention of PE has been an important research question in obstetrics for the past three decades. In 1979, Crandon and Isherwood<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> observed that nulliparous women who had taken aspirin regularly during pregnancy were less likely to have PE than those who did not. There have been two meta-analyses published reporting that the administration of low-dose aspirin in high-risk pregnancies is associated with a decrease in the rate of PE.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, there are also other possible pathways which lead to the development of PE among different risk groups, and it is not known which risk factors or pathological processes may be responsive to early initiation of low-dose aspirin.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Initiation of low-dose aspirin in early pregnancy</title><p>In most studies that evaluated aspirin for the prevention of PE, the initiation of treatment was at or after 16&#x02005;weeks' gestation. Examination of a small number of randomised trials of low-dose aspirin in women at high risk for PE suggests that the effectiveness of therapy is related to the gestational age at the initiation of treatment. A meta-analysis by Bujold <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> reported that low-dose aspirin started at 16&#x02005;weeks or earlier was associated with a significant reduction in the relative risk (RR) for PE (0.47, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.65) and fetal growth restriction (FGR; 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.65). In contrast, aspirin started after 16&#x02005;weeks did not have a significant benefit (PE: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.03; FGR: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.10). More detailed analyses of these data on PE demonstrated that low-dose aspirin started at or before 16&#x02005;weeks' gestation was particularly effective in preventing preterm PE rather than term PE (RR: 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.33 vs RR: 0.98, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.33).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The small number and small size of individual trials preclude definitive conclusions to be drawn regarding the effectiveness of aspirin starting before 16&#x02005;weeks and the results need to be examined in a prospective major randomised trial.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Aspirin resistance</title><p>There is evidence that &#x0223c;30%, 10% and 5% of pregnant women are &#x02018;aspirin resistant&#x02019; with dosage of 81, 121 and 162&#x02005;mg, respectively.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Furthermore, a retrospective cohort study reported that women who were identified by the PFA-100 test as being resistant to 81&#x02005;mg of aspirin were less likely to develop severe PE when the dose of aspirin was increased from 81 to 162&#x02005;mg, compared with those who continued with 81&#x02005;mg.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Consequently, a trial investigating the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in the prevention of preterm PE should use a dose closer to 160 than 80&#x02005;mg.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Safety of low-dose aspirin</title><p>The relative safety of first trimester use of low-dose aspirin has been demonstrated in large cohort and case&#x02013;control studies, which reported that the drug is not associated with increase in risk of congenital heart defects or other structural or developmental anomalies.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref></p><p>Randomised studies reported that &#x0223c;10% of women receiving low-dose aspirin presented with gastrointestinal symptoms; however, there was no evidence of increase in any type of maternal bleeding.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref> Similarly, the best evidence suggests that low-dose aspirin started before 16&#x02005;weeks' gestation does not increase the risk of placental abruption (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.03).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> No additional adverse effects related to epidural anaesthesia have been reported in women taking low-dose aspirin compared with those taking placebo.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Prospective and case&#x02013;control studies did not find an association between daily consumption of 60&#x02013;150&#x02005;mg of aspirin during the third trimester and antenatal closure of the ductus arteriosus.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref> A meta-analysis including more than 26&#x02005;000 women randomised to low-dose (80&#x02013;150&#x02005;mg) aspirin or placebo/no treatment during pregnancy demonstrated that the use of aspirin was not associated with an increase in intraventricular haemorrhage or other neonatal bleeding.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> On the basis of currently available evidence, it would be reasonable to continue with low-dose aspirin well into the third trimester of pregnancy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>We hypothesise that prophylactic low-dose aspirin administered from first trimester of pregnancy in women at increased risk for preterm PE will reduce the incidence and severity of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Aim</title><p>To examine if the prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin administered from the first trimester of pregnancy in women at increased risk for preterm PE can reduce the incidence and severity of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Primary objective</title><p>To determine the efficacy of low-dose aspirin (150&#x02005;mg daily), given to high-risk women from 11&#x02013;14&#x000a0;to 36&#x02005;weeks' gestation, in reducing the incidence of preterm PE, requiring delivery before 37&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Secondary objectives</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To determine the effect of low-dose aspirin on adverse outcome of pregnancy at &#x0003c;37&#x02005;weeks.

In total, 1106 participants have been consented into the screening study and 56 participants to the randomised controlled trial (RCT). This pilot study has been used to assess the feasibility of recruitment to the screening study and RCT, and the ability of the centre to ensure successful compliance. A review by the ASpirin for evidence-based PREeclampsia prevention (ASPRE) Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) and Trial Steering Committee (TSC) of the internal pilot study has demonstrated the study has been successful with respect to recruitment to the screening study and RCT; however, it has also highlighted the complexity of the main ASPRE trial and confirmed the need for enhanced quality systems to be in place in advance of starting the main ASPRE trial in order to ensure the quality of pivotal data.</p></sec><sec id="s6b"><title>Screening quality study</title><p>A screening quality study, with a minimum recruitment period of 1&#x02013;3&#x02005;months (dependent on sites' performance) at each site, has been introduced to precede the main ASPRE trial. The aim of this study is to establish systems that will monitor quality of the measurement of uterine artery PI, MAP, PAPP-A and PlGF in a more detailed, formalised manner at sites and use these systems to assess quality, identify areas for improvement and, where required, implement strategies to improve quality, for example, retraining. This is based on the Down's syndrome screening quality assurance support service (DQASS) system that has been successful for improving the quality of the ultrasound and biochemical measurements in the National Health Service (NHS) fetal anomaly screening programme.</p><p>Recruitment rates have also been monitored. Furthermore, an assessment of data quality was made by the trial team at University College London Comprehensive Clinical Trials Unit (UCL CCTU) and any site-specific operational issues, which could not have been foreseen by the site assessment process, were identified, and addressed in advance of starting the main ASPRE trial.</p></sec><sec id="s6c"><title>Screening study and RCT</title><p>Following receipt of the results of the screening study, eligible high-risk women will be invited to take part in the RCT designated by the trial teams.

The treatment allocation will only be revealed to the researchers after completion of the study or where clinically essential.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Concealment of allocation</title><p>Mawdsley Brooks and Co will provide labelling (for all cartons and blister sheets) ensuring complete blinding of the IMP to all investigators and participants in the study, which includes the principal investigator, participating research doctors, pharmacists at the local clinical trial pharmacy, project managers and others involved in the trial. They are all blinded to the IMP allocation. Matching placebo tablets will be identical to the intervention (aspirin) in such parameters as size, thickness, physical properties and appearance. A film coating will be applied to the placebo tablets for aesthetic and taste reasons.</p><p>Mawdsley Brooks and Co will keep the randomisation code list confidential to maintain the blind; however, the randomisation code list will be transferred to Sealed Envelope to enable online randomisation and unblinding service to be established.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Intervention</title><p>Participants will take one tablet per night of either aspirin 150&#x02005;mg or matched placebo.

In the event, neonates are admitted to special care baby unit (SCBU), additional neonatal outcomes will be collected from the discharge summary of SCBU.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Side effects and adverse events reporting</title><p>Adverse event (AE) and reaction (AR) data are not being collected for participants of the screening quality study, or the screen-negative participants in main ASPRE RCT, as they are non-Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (CTIMP), which do not expose participants to any additional risk over and above that of routine clinical care.</p><p>Safety evaluations will be conducted at each of the RCT participants' follow-up visits. AEs include any unwanted side effects, sensitivity reactions, abnormal laboratory results, injury or intercurrent illnesses, and may be expected or unexpected. The period for AE reporting will be from the time of first dose until 30&#x02005;days postfinal IMP administration. The participants will be followed up by a telephone interview 30&#x02005;days after the last dose of IMP.

If the event is deemed to be part of the routine progress of the pregnancy concerned, these events should be reported to the sponsor as a protocol-defined exception to SAE reporting, within the respective reporting timelines.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Statistical analysis plan including sample size and power calculation</title><p>The sample size calculation is based on a 76% detection rate of the first trimester combined screening for preterm PE at a screen-positive rate of 10%. With the aim to achieve a significant 50% reduction in the prevalence of preterm PE from 7.6% in the placebo group to 3.8% in the aspirin group, with a power of 90%, and 5% significance level, it is necessary to randomise 1600 high-risk pregnancies. If we allow for 10% loss to follow-up, it will be necessary to randomise a total of 1760 high-risk pregnancies, 880 women in each of the aspirin and placebo arms. On the assumption that 60% of high-risk pregnancies will agree to randomisation, we need to identify 2933 high-risk pregnancies (which will constitute 10% of the screened population). We will therefore have to recruit a total of 29&#x02005;330 pregnancies to the screening study.</p><sec id="s16a"><title>Type of analysis and statistical tests</title><p>The primary analysis will be a mixed-effects logistic regression analysis of the incidence of preterm PE with fixed effects for treatment and risk, and random effects for centre. A choice of transformation of risk (eg, logit transform) or grouping into levels will be made on the basis of a blinded review of the data. The treatment effect will be tested at the two-sided 5% level. Ninety-five per cent CIs will be produced for the proportions developing preterm PE in each of the two groups and for the treatment effect (active&#x02013;placebo).</p><p>Planned secondary analysis of the primary outcome will include a survival analysis of the time to delivery with PE treating births for other causes as censoring. Prespecified baseline variables considered to be predictive will be included as appropriate. Their interactions with the treatment effect will be investigated. Gestational age at randomisation and its interaction with treatment will also be investigated. This analysis of treatment interactions will be considered as exploratory.</p></sec><sec id="s16b"><title>Descriptive statistics</title><p>A full set of descriptive statistics for all variables, overall and by treatment group, will be produced.
