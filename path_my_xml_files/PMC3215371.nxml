The computer has become a common item in today's society. It is estimated that approximately 45 million workers directly use computers by staring into VDTs for hours continuously. Computers have increased the work efficiency and communications and have opened access to information like never before. Despite these contributions to the society, prolonged exposure to VDTs has been the cause of a visual and ergonomic disorder called &#x0201c;Computer Vision Syndrome&#x0201d; (CVS).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] CVS is a group of symptoms which crop up from the extended viewing of the VDT, when the demands of the task exceed the abilities of the viewer. Symptoms comprising CVS are dry and irritated eyes, eye strain/fatigue, blurred vision, red eyes, burning eyes, excessive tear secretion, double vision, headache, light or glare sensitivity, contact lens discomfort, slowness in changing focus, changes in color perception, and neck, shoulder and backache. These symptoms of CVS are due to ocular (ocular-surface abnormalities or accommodative spasms) and/or extra ocular (ergonomic) etiologies. It has also been shown that VDT users also have a higher incidence of complaints than non-VDT users in the same environment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>The catastrophic effect of the CVS has resulted in low performance and extreme discomfort to the sufferer. The symptoms being vague and slow in onset drift to intolerable severity by the time the sufferer seeks medical advice.</p><p>This problem is very new to medical science and is under investigation to explain the mechanism of the disease and to find a solution. The current understanding upholds meticulous work environment as a precaution and use of artificial tear or contact lens wetting solutions to suffice the symptoms. But with these treatments, the patients of CVS get only symptomatic relief.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] So, to find a better solution to this burning problem, this study was designed.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Drug selection</title><p>Though the ailment is a consequence of modern invention, <italic>Ayurveda</italic>, the ancient science of life can be of great help in dealing the modern occupational ailments by its preventive and therapeutic principles. Considering the <italic>Dosha</italic> involvement on the basis of symptoms, Ayurvedic remedies can be used to treat the condition. Therapeutic measures like <italic>Kriya Kalpa, Shamana Aushadhis, Chakshushya</italic> and <italic>Rasayanas</italic>, etc., which improve the homeostasis and ocular strength can be practised. CVS can be managed by Ayurvedic <italic>Chakshushya</italic> and <italic>Vata</italic>-<italic>pitta</italic> pacifying therapies. <italic>Triphala</italic> and <italic>Saptamrita Lauha</italic> are the formulations which have been extensively used for various eye disorders. The formulation selected is from reference quoted in <italic>Bhaishajya Ratnavali</italic>, <italic>Netra Roga Prakarna</italic> 64th chapter.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] <italic>Triphala Arka</italic> is prepared according to the <italic>Arka Kalpana</italic> and it was selected on the following grounds for topical application.</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Triphala</italic> is used for both local and internal administration in many forms for treating many of the ocular conditions.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Triphala</italic> acts as the best <italic>Rasayana</italic> and <italic>Chakshushya</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] drug without much discomfort.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Among the four methods (eye drops, eye ointment, gel, ocuserts) of delivering ocular pharmaco-therapeutics, eye drop is the most commonly employed mode of administration.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Eye drop is the simplest and most convenient method of topical application, especially for daytime use.

</p><p>So, <italic>Triphala Arka</italic> for topical application and <italic>Saptamrita Lauha</italic> for internal administration have been selected.</p><p><italic>Saptamrita Lauha</italic> tablets were prepared in the pharmacy of Gujarat Ayurved University and <italic>Triphala Arka</italic> was prepared at Pharmaceutical laboratory of Gujarat Ayurved University and sterile packing was done at Indian Opthalmics, Surendranagar.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The aim of present research was to evaluate the efficacy of <italic>Triphala</italic> eye drops and <italic>Saptamrita Lauha</italic> in the management of CVS.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study design</title><p>In this clinical study, 151 patients from the Out-patient Department of <italic>Shalakya Tantra</italic> of I.P.G.T. &#x00026; R.A., G.A.U, Jamnagar, who were suffering from CVS and fulfilling the criteria of inclusion for the present study, were registered and divided randomly into three groups. An elaborative research proforma was specially designed for the purpose of incorporating all aspects of the disease on Ayurvedic and Modern parlance. Selected patients were randomly divided into three groups with the following drug schedule in a particular group:</p><p>Group A: <italic>Triphala</italic> eye drops; one drop in each eye, 4 times/day for 30 days;</p><p>Group B: oral administration of <italic>Saptamrita Lauha</italic> tablets, 500 mg BD with unequal quantity of <italic>Madhu</italic> and <italic>Ghrita</italic> and <italic>Triphala</italic> eye drops one drop in each eye, 4 times/day for 30 days and</p><p>Group C: oral administration of placebo tablets 500 mg, 2 times/day, and distilled water eye drops one drop in each eye, 4 times/day for 30 days.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Diagnostic criteria</title><p>To evaluate the <italic>Chakshushya</italic> activity of both the drugs, whole importance was given to the subjective complaints as no particular objective findings have been mentioned or available for diagnosis of this disease so far.

All the constituents of <italic>Saptamrita Lauha</italic>, i.e., <italic>Haritaki, Vibhitaki, Aamalaki, Yashtimadhu, Lauha Bhasma</italic> have the Tridoshagna properties, especially helping in <italic>Vata-Pitta</italic> Shamana by their Gunas like <italic>Guru</italic>, <italic>Snigdha, Mridhu, Ushna, Sheeta, Rooksha, Laghu</italic>.

Only <italic>Madhu</italic> has <italic>Katu Vipaka</italic>. <italic>Ghrita</italic> is the drug of choice in <italic>Netra Rogas</italic>. Because of its <italic>Sanskaranuvaratana Guna, Sheeta Veerya</italic> and <italic>Madhura Vipaka</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] it helps in pacifying the <italic>Pitta Dosha</italic>.

Because computer use is such a high visual demanding task, vision problems and symptoms have become very common at today's workplace. The symptoms can vary but mostly include eye strain, headache, dry and irritated eyes, light sensitivity and double vision. The causes for these symptoms are a combination of individual problems, poor workplace conditions and improper work habits.</p><p>Computer users are invariably exposed to the risk of developing &#x0201c;CVS&#x0201d; leading to marked deterioration in performance owing to the severity and persistence of disorders. So, abstinence from cause is the ideal solution but it is far from practicality in the case of CVS.</p><p>The application of eye drops constitutes the basic therapeutic approach in combating most of the symptoms of CVS. Hence, it can be implemented in all the areas of computer utility; it is most feasible, economical and easily accessible.</p><p>Further studies can be done at the campus level of computer users, so that the observations can be noted well and can be better suggested when there is regular communication between the computer professionals and the research scholar.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to express sincere thanks to Dr. Manjusha Rajagopala M.D. (Ayu.), Ph.D., for her constant support and innovative suggestions, without which this study would have not been possible.
