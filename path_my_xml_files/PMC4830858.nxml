The SDQ is increasingly used as the primary outcome measure in population health interventions involving children, but it is not preference based; therefore, its role in allocative economic evaluation is limited. The Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D) is a generic preference-based health-related quality of-life measure. This study investigates the applicability of the SDQ outcome measure for use in economic evaluations and examines its relationship with the CHU9D by testing previously published mapping algorithms. The aim of the paper is to explore the feasibility of using the SDQ within economic evaluations of school-based population health interventions.
</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Data were available from children participating in a cluster randomised controlled trial of the school-based roots of empathy programme in Northern Ireland. Utility was calculated using the original and alternative CHU9D tariffs along with two SDQ mapping algorithms. <italic>t</italic> tests were performed for pairwise differences in utility values from the preference-based tariffs and mapping algorithms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean (standard deviation) SDQ total difficulties and prosocial scores were 12 (3.2) and 8.3 (2.1). Utility values obtained from the original tariff, alternative tariff, and mapping algorithms using five and three SDQ subscales were 0.84 (0.11), 0.80 (0.13), 0.84 (0.05), and 0.83 (0.04), respectively. Each method for calculating utility produced statistically significantly different values except the original tariff and five SDQ subscale algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Initial evidence suggests the SDQ and CHU9D are related in some of their measurement properties. The mapping algorithm using five SDQ subscales was found to be optimal in predicting mean child health utility. Future research valuing changes in the SDQ scores would contribute to this research.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SDQ</kwd><kwd>CHU9D</kwd><kwd>Child health utility</kwd><kwd>Health outcomes</kwd><kwd>School-based intervention</kwd><kwd>Population health</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10/3006/02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Connolly</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The importance of children&#x02019;s social and emotional well-being (SEW) is gaining increased attention in educational and policy circles with growing evidence linking early SEW to later academic performance and various health outcomes including mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Research suggests social&#x02013;emotional competency at a young age is associated with increased well-being and school performance, while problems with these competencies can lead to personal, social, and academic difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Children with emotional and behavioural problems are more likely to develop mental health disorders (which predict social mobility and unemployment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], be involved in crime or violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], practice unsafe sex, and misuse drugs and alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Increased interest exists in the role of school-based programmes to improve SEW as a means to promote children&#x02019;s successes in school and life. A recent meta-analysis of school-based social and emotional learning programmes found participants to have significantly improved social and emotional skills, attitudes, behaviour, and academic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Effects diminished in follow-up, but remained statistically significant for 6&#x000a0;months after intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Few studies report follow-up longer than 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these programmes are uncertain. The long-term broader impacts of school-based SEW programmes on educational outcomes, health behaviours, adult unemployment, crime, and health-related outcomes are important to identify as these potential impacts inform any comprehensive economic evaluation of SEW programmes.</p><p>Roots of Empathy (RoE) was developed in Canada with aims of increasing empathy, prosocial behaviour and decreasing aggressive behaviour in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. At the heart of the programme is the development of empathy among children. RoE consists of 27 lessons based on a monthly visit from an infant and parent whom the class &#x02018;adopts&#x02019; at the beginning of the school year.</p><p>A characteristic of RoE is that it is a mentalisation-based programme. Mentalisation is the ability to focus on mental states in oneself and others to understand behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The labelling of feelings and exploration of the relationship between feelings and behaviour is achieved through observation of the mother&#x02013;infant interaction in the classroom. Clearly, the baby cannot communicate in words and can only express his/her feelings through behaviour. For this reason, the baby in RoE provides an ideal opportunity for children to learn mentalisation skills through interpreting and labelling the baby&#x02019;s emotions. They learn affective and cognitive components of empathy, enabling them to empathise with others.</p><p>The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a behavioural screening tool which has been widely validated and used in a number of studies internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The 25-item behavioural and emotional assessment tool is shorter than other instruments such as the Child Behaviour Checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The SDQ is also less dated with a focus on identifying children&#x02019;s strengths rather than focusing on their deficits as with the traditional yet well-established Rutter Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The SDQ consists of five symptom scales (emotional, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, and prosocial behaviour) with five items each. A further sixth scale, total difficulties, is the sum of symptom scale scores excluding prosocial behaviour. It is clear the SDQ is a favoured primary outcome measure of SEW in school-based interventions; however, due to its measurement properties, (i.e. lack of a value-based outcome) its applicability in economic evaluation is limited. The SDQ has been widely used in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) throughout the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] providing routinely collected data that could be readily translated into health utilities (via appropriate means), thus providing an additional tool for the facilitation of economic evaluation; however, its use and applicability for economic evaluations within a school-based context is under-researched.</p><p>Measuring SEW in a school environment is highly challenging as it is recognised that a lack of valid methods exists for primary school children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A recent review of eleven mental health outcome measures found none to have sufficient psychometric evidence to reliably measure severity and change over time in key groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite this, the use of the SDQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] has been viewed positively by staff in preschool establishments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and is recently being used in school-based settings to assess SEW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. There is an added need for research into measuring the effectiveness of SEW interventions outwith health care CAMHS settings and within the school context, in particular how SEW is valued within cost&#x02013;utility analysis of school-based interventions, which tools are best placed to do this valuing, and how these short-term outcomes translate to meaningful long-term outcomes within economic evaluations.</p><p>Measuring and valuing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is fundamental in determining the cost-effectiveness of health improvement programmes such as RoE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Where such interventions have a claim on society&#x02019;s scarce resources, their worthwhileness must be evidenced so as to ensure optimal allocation of resources. HRQoL instruments are generally categorised into two groups, preference and non-preference based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. During development, HRQoL items or attributes in the former are weighted by the populations&#x02019; preferences using methods such as the standard gamble (SG), time-trade-off (TTO), or ranked or scaling methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In the area of child health, however, the latter is more widely used due to a lack of validated preference-based measures of quality of life (QoL) for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Preference-based measures such as the EuroQol EQ-5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and Health Utilities Index (HUI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] are generic, can be applied over a range of disease and population areas, and can be used in calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to facilitate cost&#x02013;utility analysis.</p><p>An advantage of using preference-based measures is that their descriptive systems have been valued, so changes in health states can be directly linked to utility values. Utilities are cardinal values that represent individuals&#x02019; preferences for health states. Instruments such as EQ-5D typically measure utility on a scale between 0 and 1 where 0 represents death and 1 represents full health. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), a decision-making body in the UK, recommends QALYs as the preferred measure of health outcome. Resource allocation decisions include cost-effectiveness criteria with a willingness-to-pay threshold of around &#x000a3;20,000&#x02013;&#x000a3;30,000 per QALY. Non-preference-based measures such as the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] exist for measuring HRQoL in children; however, because they are not preference-based, they cannot be used in cost&#x02013;utility analysis. Another problem with these types of measures is that they usually have separate scores for different domains; so it can be difficult to value overall change if some domains show improvements, while others deteriorate.</p><p>Two key challenges exist when performing economic evaluations of paediatric population health interventions: (1) lack of suitable preference-based outcome measures for all age ranges and (2) importance of, and requirement for, longer-term extrapolation of multi-sector costs and benefits. The NICE preferred measure of HRQoL is EQ-5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], which was developed for adults. A youth version was derived from the adult version, the EQ-5D-Y; however, there is debate over the appropriateness of using adult preference-based measures to derive paediatric QALYs and more generally, whose values are relevant in economic evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Moreover, the existing social value sets for EQ-5D are not appropriate preference weights for paediatric populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; thus, this missing value set is a limitation to use of the EQ-5D-Y in economic evaluation. The use of adult preference-based measures may not be appropriate for children and adolescents, and direct elicitation methods such as the SG or TTO pose challenges due to age, ethical, and cognitive limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>The Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D) is a generic preference-based HRQoL instrument suitable for use with children ages 7&#x02013;17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Qualitative and quantitative research was undertaken with children during its development to identify and assess dimensions of HRQoL and ensure the measure is child-centred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It has demonstrated itself as a practical and valid measure for use in economic evaluation of child and adolescent health care programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The CHU9D consists of nine dimensions: worried, sad, pain, tired, annoyed, school work, sleep, daily routine, and ability to join in activities, with five levels each. Each level of the nine dimensions is scored from 1 to 5, 1 representing perfect health and 5 the worst health state.</p><p>Two value sets containing preference weights for each health state are currently available as valuation of the CHU9D was directly elicited from both adult and adolescent populations. The original tariff was derived from 300 members of the UK adult population using a SG technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Subsequently, an alternative tariff was developed; preference weights were derived from Best&#x02013;Worst Scaling (BSW) discrete choice experiment interviews of 590 Australian adolescents aged 11&#x02013;17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These value sets allow calculation of QALYs in economic evaluation of paediatric programmes. Additionally, two algorithms are available to predict mean group utility from three and five subscales of the SDQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>NICE has developed separate guidance for technology appraisals of public health interventions recognising the differences in the nature and scope of population-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The public health reference case encourages a broader perspective in economic evaluation with methods such as cost&#x02013;consequence analysis and cost&#x02013;benefit analysis (CBA). In CBA, health and non-health outcomes are valued in monetary terms which address the allocative efficiency question of whether a new programme such as RoE is a worthwhile programme to invest in, given the alternative health and well-being outcomes which could be achieved from use of classroom resources. Methodological challenges arise when considering how to capture these broader, multi-sector costs and benefits, and how these might be extrapolated over the lifetime of a child. Use of non-traditional economic outcomes such as the SDQ may provide a useful starting point for health economists as it is now established in long-term cohort studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] as well as being recently mandated for use in Australia&#x02019;s specialised CAMH services as a consumer-oriented outcome assessment tool. Furber et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] outlines that national and international data coordination efforts (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]) have led to the creation of large SDQ datasets, which represent thousands of episodes of care in CAMH services across Australia and the UK. Transforming SDQ scores to utility values would facilitate cost&#x02013;utility analyses of not only routine CAMHS data but would open up school-based SDQ data to the possibility of economic evaluation.</p><p>This study aims to contribute to the outcomes&#x02019; evidence base for economic evaluation of school-based population health interventions by testing and validating previously published mapping algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] to translate SDQ scores to utility values. Given this aim, our research question asks, &#x02018;can SDQ scores elicited within an educational context be mapped using published algorithms to preference-based CHU9D utilities with a view to incorporating such utilities within an economic evaluation framework?&#x02019; An economic evaluation has been designed alongside the National Institute for Health Research funded RoE cluster randomised controlled trial evaluation in Northern Ireland (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register: ISRCTN07540423). Primary outcome measures collected for the economic evaluation are the SDQ and CHU9D. Utility mapping methods have been conducted to transform SDQ scores into CHU9D values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]; beyond that, we are unaware of any completed economic evaluations using these two measures together or indeed externally validating the algorithms. Use of preliminary non-randomised data from the RoE trial provided a unique opportunity to explore the relationship between these two measures as well as externally validate the SDQ mapping algorithm developed by Furber et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>The RoE programme was aimed at primary five pupils (aged 8&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years).

The teacher complete version is a proxy for child behaviour outcome, as a self-complete version is available for older children aged 11&#x02013;17. Experienced fieldworkers visited schools and administered CHU9D questionnaires to the whole class. Children were asked not to confer, and this was ensured by the fieldworker and class teacher. Each question was read aloud to the class, and any words or phrases that were difficult were explained. Consent forms were sent home with children prior to baseline data collection. Deprivation was measured by the Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure 2010 (NIMDM) which is a relative measure of deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire</title><p>The primary outcome measure for the trial was the SDQ.

This involved assigning a score from 0 to 2 (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;no difficulties, 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;many difficulties) for each item of the questionnaire and summing the total for each scale. Totals from all scales (excluding prosocial behaviour) were then summed to generate the total difficulties score.</p><p>SDQ scores can be classified into four bands that reflect the general population; these bandings were based on a large UK community sample provided elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

Total difficulties, conduct, and peer problems were classified as &#x02018;slightly raised&#x02019; in comparison with a large UK sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Sample mean scores in each subscale were higher (indicating more difficulties) than UK average, except in prosocial behaviour where the sample mean was higher (indicating greater prosocial behaviour) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In terms of economic evaluation, this outcome on its own is less useful because the &#x02018;value&#x02019; associated with unit changes in SDQ scores is unknown. For CHU9D, the majority of the sample was in the &#x02018;no problems&#x02019; category, with the exception of &#x02018;tired&#x02019; (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). With these differences between the two measures, there does not seem to be large overlap between descriptive systems. This is due to differences on a conceptual basis; the SDQ is a behavioural screening tool designed to assess emotional and behavioural functioning, while the CHU9D assesses the child&#x02019;s broader functioning and HRQoL. However, when comparing single dimensions of the two measures in terms of frequency of responses (see Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), there is some overlap. Worried and Sad dimensions of the CHU9D overlap the Emotional symptom scale of the SDQ well.</p><p>It is also important to note that despite all of the correlations between the SDQ and CHU9D being significant they were not very high; the statistical correlation may simply be a result of the large sample size. The SDQ alone cannot provide insight into resource allocation decision-making, and whether the programme is a worthwhile use of educational resources (or indeed an argument for investing health care resources). Yet, the SDQ is a common primary outcome measure in many paediatric population health interventions. For economic evaluation, the CHU9D is useful because it has value associated with incremental change.</p><p>The mean utility generated for the original tariff CHU9D was 0.84 which compares with the range of mean values reported in previous studies (0.803&#x02013;0.86) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The studies varied in context, setting, and age groups, but were included for comparison as so few studies have published CHU9D outcomes. The mean utility from alternative tariff CHU9D was lower than the original tariff which is consistent with recent Chinese and Australian studies that applied both tariffs to their samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Ratcliffe and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] have compared the adult (original) and adolescent (alternative) tariffs using the responses to a web-based survey of 500 Australian adolescents, aged 11&#x02013;17. They found differences in adult and adolescent values for identical health states may have enough significance to impact on health care policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Differences between the instruments may be due to differences in descriptive systems, size and nature of the samples, and the valuation methods used to develop each scoring algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Nevertheless, the Chinese version CHU9D found utilities generated discriminated well in relation to self-reported health status, regardless of which value set was employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. By applying the mapping algorithms to an external dataset, this research contributes to the existing evidence base around the suitability of the use of the five SDQ subscale mapping algorithm for eliciting utilities.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The advantage the CHU9D brings to the evaluation of paediatric interventions is that they can now be assessed using a preference-based measure, combined with costs and judgements made in relation to their relative cost-effectiveness. It is now possible to compare paediatric programmes from a range of areas that aim to improve different aspects of children&#x02019;s health and well-being by including a measure such as CHU9D. Changes in effectiveness as measured using the SDQ and mapped to CHU9D can now be readily compared in terms of their costs required to achieve those changes in outcomes. For example, a cost per three-point change in the SDQ could not readily be compared to a cost per three-point increase on a national examination. Having a uniform measure of QoL that has been valued by the population allows comparison of programmes in terms of both costs and effects as they have been measured on the same generic scale.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the preliminary mapping algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] to an external dataset. The caregiver version of the SDQ was used in development of these algorithms as opposed the teacher-rated version used in the current study. Additionally, parent-completed proxy report CHU9D was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], as opposed to child-completed CHU9D in the current study. This is a limitation as the validity of applying the mapping algorithms to different versions of SDQ and CHU9D is questioned (i.e. the validity of mapping from parent complete SDQ to child complete CHU9D). However, the CHU9D was intended to be completed by children, and our current sample was too young to fill in the child complete version of the SDQ (intended for ages 11&#x02013;17).</p><p>Utilities derived from the four different approaches were all significantly different, and the only pair that was not was the original tariff and five SDQ subscale algorithm. This is an interesting finding because the population from which the algorithm was developed was sampled from CAMHS. These children would be expected to have lower QoL than a general school-aged population. Also, these algorithms were developed using the alternative tariff, and it is of note that in our results the five SDQ subscale algorithm better predicts the original tariff. Nonetheless, this study adds to the evidence and generalisability of the mapping algorithm using all five of the SDQ subscales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>Economic evaluation is now feasible in studies where SDQ data (but not utility data) have been collected and our results suggest the algorithm containing all five SDQ subscales to be superior. This is in line with recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]; however, future studies should replicate use of these algorithms to confirm these results.</p><p>The use of mapping to derive generic preference-based indices from disease specific measures raises a fundamental concern as mapping methods assume overlap in each measure&#x02019;s descriptive systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Stronger mapping functions will have greater overlap between the descriptive systems. One method for assessing these functions is to evaluate the difference between predicted and observed values by calculating the root-mean-square error (RMSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The RMSE gives an indication of the size of the prediction errors between predicted and observed values. With the mapping algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], RMSE indicated large differences between predicted and observed values at the individual level. However, the purpose of mapping methods is to predict differences across groups or between trial arms, not at the individual level. Due to the lacking overlap between the SDQ and CHU9D descriptive systems, the use of the mapping algorithm is a second best option to the use of preference-based HRQoL measures, but it may be necessary in population health programmes for pragmatic reasons.</p><p>This study has demonstrated initial evidence for the use of the SDQ in economic evaluation of school-based interventions. In broader settings outside of the adult health care sector (i.e. education, paediatric, and population health), industry-specific primary outcome measures such as the SDQ may be the only measure of effect collected. In these instances, this study indicates the five SDQ subscale algorithm as a useful instrument, affording health economists&#x02019; the opportunity to conduct preferred cost&#x02013;utility analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The SDQ and CHU9D are able to measure outcomes in children aged 8&#x02013;13&#x000a0;years within a school-based setting, and there is initial evidence that they are related in their measurement properties. When conducting economic evaluation of population-based interventions where traditional utility measurement methods are missing, preliminary findings suggest the mapping algorithm using five SDQ subscales optimal for predicting mean utility. This allows analysts the opportunity to conduct cost&#x02013;utility analysis in paediatric or school-based programmes where previously this would have been challenging due to a lack of preference-based outcome measures. To our knowledge, the SDQ and CHU9D have not yet been used to predict longer-term outcomes within an economic evaluation context. This is an important avenue for further research as issues remain as to how these childhood measures extrapolate into adulthood.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>SEW</term><def><p>Social and emotional well-being</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RoE</term><def><p>Roots of Empathy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDQ</term><def><p>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p>United Kingdom</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQoL</term><def><p>Health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SG</term><def><p>Standard gamble</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TTO</term><def><p>Time trade-off</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HUI</term><def><p>Health Utilities Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>Quality-adjusted life year</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PedsQL</term><def><p>Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHQ</term><def><p>Child Health Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICE</term><def><p>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHU9D</term><def><p>Child Health Utility&#x000a0;9D</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BWS</term><def><p>Best&#x02013;worst Scaling</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBA</term><def><p>Cost&#x02013;benefit analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GEE</term><def><p>Generalised estimating equations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIMDM</term><def><p>Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MI</term><def><p>Multiple imputation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RMSE</term><def><p>Root-mean-square error</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We would like to thank Professor David Parkin for his discussion on the first draft of this work presented at the Health Economists Study Group (HESG), Glasgow Caledonian University, 23&#x02013;25t June 2014.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>A cluster randomised controlled trial evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis of the roots of empathy programme are funded by the National Institute for Health Research Public Health Research programme (Project Ref: 10/3006/02).</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="conflict-interest"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Ethical standard</title><p>Ethical approval was granted by the School of Education, Queen&#x02019;s University Belfast, Research Ethics Committee on 2 September 2011.
