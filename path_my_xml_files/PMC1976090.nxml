In 1994, 7,340 patients in the Netherlands were receiving renal replacement therapy, incurring direct medical costs of NLG 584 million (262 million 1994 &#x020ac;) and indirect costs of NLG 3.5 million (1.6 million 1994 &#x020ac;). De Wit et al estimated that in 2003, there would be 11,500 patients receiving renal replacement therapy at a cost to society of over NLG 900 million (405 million 1994 &#x020ac;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Systemic hypertension frequently accompanies chronic renal failure (CRF) and is a strong risk factor for the development of ESRD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Thus current drugs target systemic hypertension in addition to proteinuria in an attempt to slow the progression of renal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are the treatment of choice for hypertensive patients with CRF, with the addition of diuretics for inadequate blood pressure control. Patients often require athird drug to control hypertension effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Moxonidine may be a good candidate for adjunctive treatment to standard therapy as it interferes with the sympathetic nervous system overactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] which may contribute to hypertension in CRF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The short term benefits of adjunctive treatment with moxonidine on top of standard antihypertensive therapy have been shown, versus adjunctive nitrendipine, in a single randomised double-blind 24-week trial in hypertensive patients with advanced renal failure. Most patients received standard therapy of ACEI or ARB plus diuretics. Although this study was primarily a safety and tolerability study, a significant difference was seen in creatinine clearance decline between the moxonidine group and the comparator group after 24 weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This was the only study found comparing moxonidine to nitrendipine in a review of the literature to date. Creatinine clearance is an indicator of the glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys. A reduction in creatinine clearance levels indicates a decline in kidney function. The trial measured baseline proteinuria in around 60% of patients in each group and found levels were similar across both groups. But proteinuria levels were not available in 40% of patients and therefore it is not possible to know this impact on the overall trial outcomes, as proteinuria is a risk factor for renal disease progression. Therefore a major assumption of our study was that the differences in creatinine clearance decline were not caused by other risk factors (such as underlying disease or proteinuria level). Based on this assumption, it was hypothesised that adjunctive moxonidine in hypertensive patients with renal failure may contribute to decreasing the burden of ESRD.</p><p>In order to understand the effects of moxonidine on renal progression and on costs over a longer period, a decision analytic model was developed and a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed on the basis of the Dutch healthcare setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Decision-Analytic Model and assumptions</title><p>A Markov model was built in MS Excel to extrapolate results from the six-month trial, of adjunctive moxonidine versus adjunctive nitrendipine, over three years (or six cycles of six months). This time horizon of three years closely approximates the maximum follow-up period of cohorts of ESRD patients found in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the model, all patients started in a non-ESRD state (NESRD). NESRD was defined as patients with advanced renal failure and hypertension, with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) above 15 ml/min, not treated with dialysis or transplant. After each cycle of six months, patients with a GFR below 15 ml/min were considered to have progressed to the ESRD state. This cut-off value of 15 ml/min was based on the European Renal Association (ERA) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and US National Kidney Foundation guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Once in the ESRD state, patients could not go back to the NESRD state, they could either remain in this state or progress to death.

The Cockcroft-Gault equation is frequently used for estimating GFR in adults. Although it was originally developed for estimating creatinine clearance, it has been widely tested as a good predictor of GFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Age, gender, and body weight are used to correct for the differences in muscle mass, and hence creatinine generation rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Transition probabilities</title><p>Transition probabilities for moving from the NESRD (GFR &#x0003e; 15 ml/min) to ESRD (GFR &#x0003c; 15 ml/min) state were based on extrapolations of the trial results. The average GFR decline over the three year time horizon was assumed to be linear. A linear progression was judged to be acceptable in these very renally-impaired patients. The mean decline in GFR over the trial period &#x02013; from baseline (visit 2) to week 24 (visit 9) &#x02013; was 0.7 ml/min for the moxonidine group and 1.8 ml/min for the nitrendipine group. This average decline over a six-month period was applied to each six-month period in the model, with accompanying standard deviations (SD) keeping the ratio of mean/SD constant throughout the cycles. Based on the given and estimated means and SD, the percentage of patients with ESRD (GFR &#x0003c; 15 ml/min) was then calculated for each six-month period using the gamma distribution (parameters Moxonidine &#x003b1; = 1.445, &#x003b2; = 83.555, Nitrendipine: &#x003b1; = 12.403, &#x003b2; = 66.597). The gamma distribution was found to best describe the trial data compared to the normal or lognormal distribution (skewed to the right with no negative values) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A consequence of this method is that there were some patients with ESRD at baseline in both groups, and these patients were not receiving dialysis or transplants. Therefore only new cases of ESRD were used to derive transition probabilities for the model.</p><p>For each six-month period: <italic>Transition probability = new cases ESRD/NESRD population </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.)</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Transition probabilities of moving from NESRD state to ESRD state</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">Cycle</td><td align="center" colspan="2">NESRD to ESRD<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center">NESRD to Death<sup>&#x02020;&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" colspan="4">ESRD to Death<sup>&#x02021;</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td align="center">moxonidine</td><td align="center">nitrendipine</td><td align="center">all-cause</td><td align="center">Dialysis</td><td align="center">Transplant</td><td align="center">Dial/Trans 64%/34%</td><td align="center">Dial/Trans 50%/50%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">0.019</td><td align="center">0.077</td><td align="center">0.0042</td><td align="center">0.067</td><td align="center">0.013</td><td align="center">0.048</td><td align="center">0.040</td></tr><tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">0.012</td><td align="center">0.053</td><td align="center">0.0042</td><td align="center">0.067</td><td align="center">0.013</td><td align="center">0.048</td><td align="center">0.040</td></tr><tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">0.013</td><td align="center">0.069</td><td align="center">0.0042</td><td align="center">0.067</td><td align="center">0.013</td><td align="center">0.048</td><td align="center">0.040</td></tr><tr><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">0.014</td><td align="center">0.089</td><td align="center">0.0042</td><td align="center">0.067</td><td align="center">0.013</td><td align="center">0.048</td><td align="center">0.040</td></tr><tr><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">0.016</td><td align="center">0.118</td><td align="center">0.0042</td><td align="center">0.067</td><td align="center">0.013</td><td align="center">0.048</td><td align="center">0.040</td></tr><tr><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">0.017</td><td align="center">0.157</td><td align="center">0.0042</td><td align="center">0.067</td><td align="center">0.013</td><td align="center">0.048</td><td align="center">0.040</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>&#x02020;</sup>Based on data from Vonend <italic>et al </italic>2003.</p><p><sup>&#x02020;&#x02020;</sup>Based on Dutch all-cause mortality 2005 (8.4 per 1,000 inhabitants), (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek)</p><p><sup>&#x02021;</sup>Based on data from ERA EDTA Annual report 2002.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Transition probabilities for moving from the ESRD state to Death were based on Dutch mortality rates for patients on dialysis and transplanted patients.

The cost of treating the moxonidine group would be &#x020ac;985,800 versus &#x020ac;3,747,200 for the nitrendipine group, due to the high cost of treating patients who have progressed to ESRD.</p></sec><sec><title>Scenario analyses</title><p>The proportion of ESRD patients receiving dialysis or transplantations was varied in sensitivity analyses. The model showed that when 64% of patients received dialysis (and 34% received transplantations), the cumulative 3-year costs remained lower with moxonidine versus nitrendipine (&#x020ac;8,496 (95% CI 4,920&#x02013;13,367) versus &#x020ac;31,035 (95% CI 23,618&#x02013;40,163) respectively), and life-years remained higher in the moxonidine arm (2.954 (95% CI 2.944&#x02013;2.960) versus 2.923 (95% CI 2.907&#x02013;2.936) respectively). When 50% of patients received dialysis (and 50% transplantation), the cumulative 3-year costs and LYL continued to favour the moxonidine strategy versus nitrendipine (&#x020ac;7,953 (95% CI 4,603&#x02013;12,546) and 2.955 (95%CI 2.946&#x02013;2.960) for moxonidine versus &#x020ac;28,649 (95% CI 21,938&#x02013;36,392) and 2.929 (95% CI 2.915&#x02013;2.941) for nitrendipine).</p><p>When a 0% discount rate was applied to costs and effects the following results were found: Cumulative costs were &#x020ac;10,349 (95%CI 5,572&#x02013;17,282) with moxonidine and &#x020ac;39,035 (95% CI 29,324&#x02013;50,003) with nitrendipine, resulting in a cost saving of &#x020ac;28,686 (95% CI 17,772&#x02013;41,347) with moxonidine. Life-years lived were 2.987 (95% CI 2.971&#x02013;2.996) for moxonidine and 2.943 (95% CI 2.919&#x02013;2.963) for nitrendipine, resulting in 0.044 (95% CI 0.019&#x02013;0.070) life-years gained with moxonidine.</p><p>When the average GFR decline was assumed to decrease exponentially, the results still supported moxonidine over nitrendipine; all patients on nitrendipine had progressed to ESRD after 2 years versus 25% of patients on moxonidine (or 74% after 3 years). Thus moxonidine would provide 0.084 (95%CI 0.059&#x02013;0.108) additional life-years at a cost saving of &#x020ac;48,364 (95%CI 37,966&#x02013;59,198) after 3 years.</p><p>When Dutch all-cause mortality was incorporated to the NESRD arm, the life-years gained with moxonidine was 0.041 (95%CI -0.035&#x02013;0.112) years at a cost saving of &#x020ac;27,252 (95%CI 16,652&#x02013;38,854). Moxonidine was dominant in 90% of cases.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>With this model, moxonidine treatment on top of standard therapy in severely renally-impaired patients appears to be cost-effective versus adjunctive nitrendipine, resulting in lower treatment costs (&#x020ac;27,615 lower (95%CI 16,894&#x02013;39,583)) and a greater number of life-years lived 0.044 (with 95% CI 0.020&#x02013;0.070) when the results of the six month trial are extrapolated over three years. Sensitivity analyses have shown that these results are robust. Thus given the assumptions of the model, we can conclude that moxonidine could delay progression to ESRD in a large number of patients, thereby reducing the numbers of patients requiring dialysis or transplants compared to standard treatment with adjunctive nitrendipine. Treatment with moxonidine could therefore contribute to reducing the economic burden of ESRD and allow patients to live longer in a non-ESRD state.</p><sec><title>Limitations of the model</title><p>Data used in the model was taken from the only study available at the time of moxonidine versus nitrendipine, which was a six-month trial, in 171 patients, with proteinuria levels measured in 103 patients. In the trial, creatinine clearance was calculated using the Cockcroft &#x00026; Gault equation. As creatinine clearance is the result of clearance due to GFR and secretion of creatinine in the tubules, the model assumed that both treatments had no effect on secretion, thus GFR was equated to creatinine clearance measures alone.</p><p>The difference in GFR decline in the trial was assumed not to be due to differences in risk factors for renal progression such as level of proteinuria like albuminuria. Data on albuminuria were only available for a subset of patients in the trial (52/89 moxonidine patients and 51/82 nitrendipine patients). These data showed no significant differences between groups, although mean and median albuminuria values were lower in the moxonidine group (1.3 &#x000b1; 1.8; 0.8 versus 1.9 &#x000b1; 2.1; 1.1 at baseline). A limitation of this study is that the missing data for the remaining patients may mean that the two groups were not well matched for albuminuria, a major prognostic factor for renal decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The average GFR decline over the three year time horizon was assumed to be linear. This is not uncommon in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The extrapolation of GFR values from the six month trial also implied that the decline in the first three months after starting treatment was not significantly different than the decline in the following periods, as is sometimes suggested in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However some clinicians assume an exponential decline over time. If the decline is exponential, and disease progression occurs faster, the benefit of moxonidine will be even greater as it appears to delay progression compared to nitrendipine. The results of the scenario analysis show that all nitrendipine patients would have progressed to ESRD compared to 25% of moxonidine patients after two years.</p><p>The model only included direct costs. The addition of indirect costs would however be expected to increase the benefit seen with moxonidine, as patients remain in a better state of health for longer and are therefore able to be more productive.</p><p>Patients with ESRD are presumed to have much worse quality of life than patients at earlier stages of the disease. Utility values found in the literature report measures of 0.41 for patients on kidney dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] compared to 0.60 for patients with chronic renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A higher utility value is associated with a better state of health. As such, a cost-utility analysis would be expected to produce even better results for moxonidine compared to standard treatment with nitrendipine, as patients treated with moxonidine remained in a non-ESRD state for longer.</p><p>Adjunctive treatment with moxonidine was assumed to have a renoprotective effect occurring independently of blood pressure control in the six month trial. This effect may be supported by the results of a recent study in which moxonidine was the only factor that significantly reduced the risk of a decrease of 50% or more in creatinine clearance rate, or the need for dialysis, or death, in patients following renal transplant. The relative risk reduction due to moxonidine was 0.3 (95% CI 0.1 &#x02013; 0.6) in the multivariate analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Results of a small study in the Netherlands may also support the benefits of adjunctive moxonidine in chronic renal failure. In this study, moxonidine normalised sympathetic hyperactivity, which plays a role in renal hypertension, in patients on chronic eprosartan treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The model extrapolated results from a 6-month trial over three years. Treatment with standard antihypertensive therapy (ACE inhibitor or ARB and loop diuretics) and adjunctive moxonidine in hypertensive patients with advanced renal failure was predicted to reduce the number of ESRD cases by 81% over three years compared to adjunctive nitrendipine. The model showed moxonidine to be dominant compared to nitrendipine, increasing life-years lived by 0.044 (95%CI 0.020&#x02013;0.070) years and at a cost-saving of &#x020ac;27,615 (95%CI 16,894&#x02013;39,583) per patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study was sponsored by Solvay Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Hannover, Germany.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KL, YZ and DB contributed to the design of the study, data collection and analysis.
