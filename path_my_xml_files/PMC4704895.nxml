There have been successful trials of PCHMS in various health settings. However, there is mixed evidence for whether consumers will use these systems over the long term and whether they ultimately lead to improved health outcomes and behaviors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>The aim was to test whether use of a PCHMS by consumers can increase the uptake or updating of a written asthma action plan (AAP) among adults with asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A 12-month parallel 2-group randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants living with asthma were recruited nationally in Australia between April and August 2013, and randomized 1:1 to either the PCHMS group or control group (online static educational content). The primary outcome measure was possession of an up-to-date written AAP poststudy. Secondary measures included (1) utilizing the AAP; (2) planned or unplanned visits to a health care professional for asthma-related concerns; (3) severe asthma exacerbation, inadequately controlled asthma, or worsening of asthma that required a change in treatment; and (4) number of days lost from work or study due to asthma. Ancillary analyses examined reasons for adoption or nonadoption of the intervention. Outcome measures were collected by online questionnaire prestudy, monthly, and poststudy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 330 eligible participants were randomized into 1 of 2 arms (intervention: n=154; control: n=176).

Consumers must perceive the need for assistance with a task and assign priority to the task supported by the eHealth intervention. Additionally, the cost of adopting the intervention (eg, additional effort, time spent learning the new system) must be lower than the benefit. Otherwise, there is high risk consumers will not adopt the eHealth intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): ACTRN12612000716864; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=362714 (Archived by WebCite&#x000ae; at http://www.webcitation.org/6dMV6hg4A)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>asthma</kwd><kwd>self-management</kwd><kwd>personal health record</kwd><kwd>personally controlled health management system</kwd><kwd>eHealth</kwd><kwd>Internet</kwd><kwd>intervention</kwd><kwd>adult</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Personally controlled health management systems (PCHMS), which may include a personal health record (PHR), health management tools, and information resources, have been advocated as a next-generation technology to improve health behaviors and outcomes [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Trials of PCHMS have been undertaken in various health settings, including in vitro fertilization [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], hypertension [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], diabetes [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], influenza vaccination [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], sexually transmitted infection [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], medication accuracy [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], breast cancer management [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and physical and emotional well-being [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, there is mixed evidence for whether consumers will use these systems over the long term and whether they ultimately lead to improved health outcomes and behaviors [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Lack of engagement in digital interventions is a common phenomenon [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the reasons for adoption or nonadoption remain underreported. An early analysis of the reasons that led to the abandonment of a national PHR in the United Kingdom concluded that unless a system aligned closely with people&#x02019;s attitudes, practices, information needs, and preexisting health services, then the risk it will not be adopted is substantial [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. More recent analyses suggest that for chronic illnesses, PCHMS work best when there is a feedback loop between monitoring in the PHR and behaviors that could be self-managed by a consumer [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we examine how effective a PCHMS is in encouraging adults with a chronic condition&#x02014;asthma&#x02014;to obtain a written asthma action plan (AAP) from their primary care practitioner over a 12-month period. We also explored the reasons that underlay the adoption or nonadoption of the intervention.</p><sec><title>Asthma and the Written Asthma Action Plan</title><p>Asthma is a chronic condition [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The prevalence of asthma is significant; worldwide, the number of people suffering from asthma is approximately 300 million [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. According to a Cochrane review, one of the most efficient tools that patients can use to manage their asthma is a written AAP [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The AAP is a set of instructions prepared with a health care professional that helps recognize signs that asthma is worsening, indicates which medication to use, or provides nonmedication strategies to keep asthma under control [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Written AAPs are individualized documents that must be updated (eg, once a year) by a clinician to match the evolution of the individual&#x02019;s asthma condition [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>When properly used, written AAPs are associated with fewer visits to the emergency department with an asthma exacerbation, fewer hospital admissions, better lung function, and an overall improvement of asthma symptoms [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although having an up-to-date AAP is highly recommended, written AAPs are widely underused among adults; only 1 in 5 patients actually possess an up-to-date and usable AAP [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Most initiatives to improve the uptake of the written AAP have been targeted at health care professionals. Few have targeted patients.</p><p>This randomized controlled trial (RCT) is designed to test whether a PCHMS, tailored to help adults with asthma, would increase their rate of obtaining or updating a written AAP from a health care professional and whether this would lead to an improvement in asthma control.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypotheses</title><p>Compared to participants allocated to the control group (ie, static online educational page), we hypothesized that those using a PCHMS are</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>More likely to obtain or update a written AAP;</p></list-item><list-item><p>More likely to make planned visits to a health care professional for asthma;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Less likely to make unplanned visits to a health care professional for asthma; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Less likely to experience (1) severe asthma exacerbation, (2) inadequately controlled asthma, (3) worsening of asthma that requires a change in treatment, or (4) days lost from work or study due to asthma.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Details on participants, recruitment strategy, intervention description, data collection, ethical considerations, and study procedure are described in the study protocol [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

During the study, Healthy.me provided participants with evidence-based information about asthma, the importance of a written AAP, and ways of obtaining a plan from a health care professional. Additionally, participants received monthly email reminders about the various interactive features of Healthy.me (eg, forum, poll, PHR).</p><p>An expert steering group was formed to tailor educational content for patients with asthma and to customize the interactive features of Healthy.me to deliver this content over the 12 months. Three asthma &#x0201c;journeys&#x0201d; were developed, providing evidence-based material to consumers about the written AAP. A usability study with 10 individuals was conducted and all major usability issues associated with the content and the intervention were addressed before commencing the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Theoretical Framework of the Intervention</title><p>A review of online interventions found that those built on a theoretical framework demonstrated greater efficacy [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

However, the priority they placed on asthma was not as high (control: mean 4.3, SD 2.2; intervention: mean 3.8, SD 2.3).

These priorities ranged from issues related to work, family/relationship, and money. Health was not always mentioned in this list of priorities. On average, participants reported approximately 2 health issues per month (control: mean 1.9, SD 1.0; intervention: mean 1.5, SD 0.9). These issues are related to a range of bodily systems (eg, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, psychological, neurological) and not only restricted to the respiratory system.</p></sec><sec><title>Usage and Perception of Healthy.me</title><p>Participant usage and perceptions of the Healthy.me intervention are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">6</xref>.

These results are in stark contrast to earlier trials of the same PCHMS, which showed significant improvements in outcomes associated with consumer behavior change, including influenza vaccination [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and sexually transmitted infection screening [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The negative results also occur in a context where intervention and study designs were in accord with factors typically associated with successful uptake and efficacy of online consumer interventions.</p><p>High attrition rates are common in eHealth intervention studies [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], with a recent systematic review revealing that completion of protocol rates for depression sites ranged from 43% to 99% [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This study suffered from moderate to high rates of attrition in the intervention (64%) and control (45%) groups. A previous study of Healthy.me did not experience this degree of attrition [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, that study was conducted in 2009, its duration was shorter, and the mean participant age was 26.2 years compared to 40 years among those allocated to the intervention in this RCT [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Utilization and Benefit</title><p>In decision theoretic terms, the expected utility of any eHealth intervention is a product of the utility or benefit of each individual interaction with the system to the user and the number of times the interaction takes place [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Systems that engage their users and, as a result, are used frequently are theoretically more likely to deliver benefit. This is reflected in the research evidence, where consumer eHealth systems seem to demonstrate a clear dose-response relationship between use and benefit [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In this trial, some participants suggested that they saw little benefit in using the system, either because they or their health professionals saw little value in having an AAP, because asthma management was not a major priority in their life compared to other competing priorities, or that they have already developed their own strategies to manage the condition and needed no further assistance. Perhaps as suggested by some participants, the intervention would be more helpful for those who are newly diagnosed with asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison With Prior Work</title><p>A systematic review of PHRs used for chronic conditions found that unless a system clearly assisted consumers in self-management tasks, they were unlikely to be successful [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This benefit might come from tracking important parameters to control an illness, such as blood pressure or glucose levels, or by delivering feedback when changes to management are needed. That review identified diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV, fertility management, glaucoma, and hyperlipidemia as having the most evidence for PHR benefit. However, only one study in that review actually included asthma patients and these were grouped together with other patients who had diabetes or hypertension [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The only outcome measure was patient activation, and asthma patients represented only 7% of the sample, providing weak evidence of PHR benefit in asthma management outcomes.</p><p>Recent systematic reviews concluded that although there is evidence that some digital interventions are associated with positive asthma self-management outcomes [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], most interventions do not use behavioral change theory, clinical guidelines, and/or assessment tools to inform their design [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A Cochrane review on smartphone apps for asthma concluded there is currently lack of evidence to advise clinical practitioners, policy makers, and the general public on ways to implement these interventions for asthma self-management programs [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Relevant to the AAP, a theoretical model has proposed 4 elements that are essential in facilitating the &#x0201c;right&#x0201d; contexts between patients and professionals, but few studies have used all these elements in their implementation [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Our own earlier trials of this intervention focused on supporting preventive health tasks. A trial aimed at encouraging influenza vaccination demonstrated a significant doubling in vaccination rates, most likely because the system allowed easy and immediate access to booking a vaccination with a primary care center, for a condition where seasonality and acting in a timely manner is important [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similar benefits were demonstrated when the system was targeted at increasing screening rates among young adults for sexually transmitted infections, where use of an online booking system may have additionally reduced any sense of stigma associated with making a decision to act [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Lessons Learned</title><p>Although the lack of uptake of eHealth interventions is a widely known phenomenon [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the literature on negative findings in this field is still scarce. Our study provides a number of lessons:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>
<italic>Consumers must perceive the need for assistance with a task.</italic> Even though the research evidence clearly demonstrates the value of an AAP, its low level of adoption in the population and the commentary received in this study suggests that at least some adults with asthma either do not agree or have yet to be convinced.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Consumers must assign priority to the tasks supported by the intervention.</italic> Participants in this study assigned a low priority to their asthma management compared with other life priorities. The mean age of participants in this study was 40 and most reported living with multiple competing priorities (eg, work commitment, lack of time) and other health concerns (eg, multimorbidity).</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>The cost of adoption of the intervention must be lower than the benefit.</italic> Our PCHMS was a stand-alone system that did not integrate into other apps participants might already have been using, such as diaries and social media. It consequently required additional effort to use. A substantial number of participants were recruited via a Facebook social network related to asthma and used Facebook several times a day. These individuals may have had higher expectations of the intervention regarding the degree of system integration, content, social network size, and the overall &#x0201c;polish&#x0201d; of the system.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Outcome measures must be relevant to consumers and providers.</italic> Although the primary outcome used in this RCT&#x02014;possession of an up-to-date written AAP&#x02014;is an indicator of recommended care for asthma [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], it is essential to consider how relevant and important the outcome measure is to <italic>both</italic> consumers and providers. Although there is evidence supporting the efficacy of the written AAP, there is possibly the misconception that it is only useful for those newly diagnosed with asthma. Perhaps there needs to be more emphasis on uncovering how relevant an outcome measure is to both consumers and providers before attempts are made to influence behavior change.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Implications for Consumer eHealth Design</title><sec><title>Design for Attrition</title><p>Although current evidence advocates the importance of having a theoretical basis to direct behavioral changes, it is equally important to consider whether such theories can be used to minimize participant attrition. For example, identifying early on those who are truly uninterested and focus instead on those who are likely to continue could potentially reduce participant attrition [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Perhaps all interventions should be designed with a plan to minimize participant dropout before commencing participant recruitment.</p></sec><sec><title>Design for Implementation</title><p>Studies have confirmed once again that implementation uptake is often the biggest challenge in any eHealth project, both for consumers and clinicians. Trials that focus on implementation of asthma interventions are emerging in clinical settings [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Yet, implementation strategies that consider consumer settings, their comorbidities, and their competing demands are lacking. Understanding how these consumer factors affect the uptake of an intervention is important. A recent review on digital interventions for asthma concluded patient perspectives are often largely ignored [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Perhaps the next generation of digital intervention should incorporate consumer-clinician implementation strategies at the core of every digital intervention design.</p></sec><sec><title>Design for Context</title><p>Rather than attempting to &#x0201c;perfect&#x0201d; the design of an intervention to exist on its own, interventions should be designed for the context. When designing an intervention for consumers and patients, it is important to identify early on whether the intervention should focus on task support or on belief change. Moreover, research should focus on how we can design consumer eHealth interventions that are integrated in health care settings and/or how such interventions would function in the consumer circle of care (eg, caregivers).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Study strengths include nationwide recruitment, use of recommended care indicators for outcome measures, and triangulation of participant feedback with quantitative results.</p><p>Notable limitations of this study include the gender and age distribution of participants, the attrition rate, and the use of self-reported data. The majority of participants were female in their late thirties / early forties and it is possible this population sample behaved differently than a more representative sample.</p><p>Participants had a higher rate of AAP possession than reported in other studies. As a result, as a cohort, they may already be better engaged and confident in their self-management and less likely to benefit from the intervention compared to the population average, reducing the potential effect size. Further, because the outcome measure was focused on having an up-to-date written AAP that was updated by a clinician (eg, once a year), we may have missed some participants as the study duration was only 12 months. Future studies should consider extending the trial period to more than 12 months.</p><p>Our primary recruitment strategy is online, which has a number of limitations, such as high rates of attrition. More effective recruitment could potentially result when it is channeled through influencers such as health care providers or with the encouragement of caregivers who help patients to deal with issues every day. However, this is an intervention designed primarily for consumers, to be delivered online, thus it is important that there is a direct channel to recruit consumers who are already online.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Consumers are increasingly turning to the Internet and social media for health advice, yet we still do not fully understand why some online interventions work and others do not. In this study, participant goals were poorly aligned with the clinical goals of the system despite there being clear evidence underpinning these latter clinical goals. It may be that a different approach is required in the domain of asthma management in adults, at least as far as AAPs are concerned, focusing not so much on task support as on belief change. More generally, researchers should not feel discouraged to publish negative findings because in failure many significant lessons can be learned.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Sara Morgan from the Asthma Foundation New South Wales for her assistance in designing the intervention content and Nathan Mortimer for his assistance in forum moderation.
