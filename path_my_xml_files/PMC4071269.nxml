Background</title><p>Caesarean section is a relatively common procedure to terminate pregnancy. Currently, it is performed under spinal anesthesia, which has fewer complications compared with the general anesthesia. Anxiety is an unpleasant experience that may have adverse effects on the process of anesthesia, caesarean delivery, recovery, and postoperative pain. Anxiety can also affect maternal satisfaction with regard to the medical care (<xref rid="A16662R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p> It has been reported that performing caesarean section under spinal anesthesia is associated with too much anxiety (<xref rid="A16662R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="A16662R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This very fact that caesarean section is performed on the patient's abdomen while she is awake can cause anxiety (<xref rid="A16662R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="A16662R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, relieving anxiety may change caesarean section and childbirth into a pleasant experience (<xref rid="A16662R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>One of the medications which its anxiolytic effects have been studied in dental procedures and on patients with cancer is nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) (<xref rid="A16662R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="A16662R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Administration of 50% N2O causes analgesia and reduces fear of pain and anxiety in patients, but has mild and self-limited side effects (<xref rid="A16662R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="A16662R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Considering the adverse effects of anxiety on patients and also the side effects of usual anxiolytic medications, efforts to achieve an effective modality to treat anxiety in pregnant women who undergo caesarean section are important.</p></sec><sec id="sec56521"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>We aimed to assess the anxiolytic effects of inhalational 50% N<sub>2</sub>O in primigravid parturients who were candidates for elective caesarean section under spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="sec56525"><title>3. Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec56522"><title>3.1. Study Population</title><p>This study was a double-blind, randomized, clinical trial performed at a teaching University hospital (affiliated to Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran) during 2008-2009. The protocol of the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University. The participants consisted of 56 primigravid parturients who were candidates for elective caesarean section under spinal anesthesia and had T4&#x02013;T6 spinal anesthesia level. Exclusion criteria were as follows: personality disorder, addiction, complicated pregnancy, including preeclampsia, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, valvular heart disease, upper respiratory tract infection or sinus obstruction, recent history of middle or inner ear disease or surgery, and history of asthma.</p><p> The participants were assigned into two groups according to the block randomization method. After obtaining the written informed consent, participants in the N<sub>2</sub>O group (28 parturients) received 50% N<sub>2</sub>O during spinal anesthesia and caesarean section, and the control group (28 parturients) received just oxygen. Flowmeters were covered by a dark shield, and an experienced anesthesia nurse monitored them continuously. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11396">Figure 1</xref> shows the flowchart of the trial.</p><fig id="fig11396" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Flowchart of the Trial</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="aapm-04-02-16662-i001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec56523"><title>3.2. Anxiety and Pain Assessment</title><p>For the measurement of anxiety, we used a visual analogue scale (VAS), designed as a 10-cm horizontal line (scored from 0 to 10). After explaining the procedure for the patients, they were asked to mark their anxiety on the scale (0 = no anxiety to 10 = maximum anxiety). A similar VAS was used for pain measurment. Anxiety and pain assessments were performed in six stages:</p><list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p>before entering the operating room,</p></list-item><list-item><p>after entering the operating room and placing on the operating table,</p></list-item><list-item><p>during induction of spinal anesthesia,</p></list-item><list-item><p>during skin and uterus incision,</p></list-item><list-item><p>at the time of delivery, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>at the end of the caesarean section and upon transfer of the patient to the recovery unit.</p></list-item></list><p>Maternal blood pressure and heart rate were measured before and after inducing the spinal anesthesia and then every 5 minutes up to 15 minutes and every 15 minutes up to the end of the operation. Pain and anxiety of the patients were measured by a nurse who was uninvolved in the anesthesia process and unaware of the participants' allocation and inhalational agents.</p></sec><sec id="sec56524"><title>3.3. Anesthesia Method</title><p>All parturients after receiving 10 mL/kg serum Ringer underwent spinal anesthesia in sitting position using 25-gauge Quincke spinal needle by median approach and then 2.5 ml of bupivacaine 0.5% (12.5 mg) was injected intrathecally. The sensory block levels were assessed by pinprick sensation before surgery the patients with sensory block levels T4-T6 were included in our study. All steps of anesthesia were performed by a single anesthesiologist who was not aware of the study protocol.</p><p>Three minutes before inducing spinal anesthesia, 50% N<sub>2</sub>O (3 liters of nitrous oxide and 3 liters of oxygen by anesthesia mask) was administered to the N<sub>2</sub>O group and O<sub>2</sub> (6 liters of oxygen by anesthesia mask) for the control group by a semi-closed anesthesia circle system. Nitrous oxide or oxygen administration was continued until delivery.</p><p>In order to assess the patient&#x02019;s sedation, we used the Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) (<xref rid="A16662R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This scale is used for evaluating the sedation rate in hospital inpatients and categorized in six scores as follows:</p><list list-type="order" id="L2"><list-item><p>anxious, restless, agitated;</p></list-item><list-item><p>cooperative and calm;</p></list-item><list-item><p>responsive to commands only;</p></list-item><list-item><p>brisk response to stimulus;</p></list-item><list-item><p>sluggish response to stimulus; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>unresponsive.</p></list-item></list><p>For hemodynamic assessment, maternal vital signs, arterial oxygen saturation percentage (SPaO<sub>2</sub>, using pulse oxymetry A520, Oxypleth, Germany), nausea, vomiting, amnesia, total dosages of ephedrine used, any indication of caesarean section, level of spinal anesthesia, duration of surgery, delivery duration, as well as demographic data were recorded. The neonates Apgar score were recorded as well. The Apgar scoring system (which is based on physiological responses of a neonate to birth), is a good method for determining the need of a neonate for resuscitation. We measured and documented this score 1 and 5 minutes after delivery (<xref rid="A16662R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="A16662R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p> Sample size was determined at 95% confidence interval and a difference in the expected mean anxiety scores in cases and controls (&#x003bc; 1 - &#x003bc; 2 = 14) with standard deviation of 11 (taken from previous study of Valleio et al. (<xref rid="A16662R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)) which estimated to be at least 28 patients.</p><p>The results were reported as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) for the quantitative variables and percentages for the categorical variables. The groups were compared using the Student t test for the continuous variables and the chi-square test (or the Fisher's exact test if required) for the categorical variables. Correlation between the variables was examined by the Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient test. A P value &#x02264; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec56526"><title>4.

In all stages of anesthesia, VAS scores showed that anxiety was more severe in the control group compared with the experimental group, particularly during skin incision, childbirth, and at the end of operation. Although there are reports regarding the beneficial effects of N<sub>2</sub>O on pain, fear, and anxiety of the patients undergoing dental procedures or among patients with cancer, there are few studies about such beneficial effects of N<sub>2</sub>O during caesarean section (<xref rid="A16662R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="A16662R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Vallejo and colleagues studied the effects of N<sub>2</sub>O on anxiety and pain of 30 patients who were candidate for caesarean section (<xref rid="A16662R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). They reported that the mean VAS anxiety score measured in the N<sub>2</sub>O group was significantly lower than the O<sub>2</sub> group, which is consistent with our results. Furthermore, they examined the difference between anxious (anxiety VAS &#x0003e; 50) and calm participants (anxiety VAS &#x0003c; 50); they concluded that in the first group, N<sub>2</sub>O administration significantly decreased anxiety VAS, but in low anxiety group no significant difference was observed between N<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> groups.</p><p> Vallejo and colleagues also compared the rate of VAS pain in the two groups, but found no significant difference between the two groups in mean pain scores (<xref rid="A16662R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).

Nitrous oxide has been effective as an intramuscular analgesic for the treatment of fractures with a more rapid onset and higher patient satisfaction (<xref rid="A16662R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="A16662R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The analgesic effect of N<sub>2</sub>O during labor is known for a long time, and it is used widely in different countries (<xref rid="A16662R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Maximum analgesic effect was reported in 70% concentration (<xref rid="A16662R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Our results regarding the sedation level showed that N<sub>2</sub>O has induced increased drowsiness in pregnant women, but this drowsiness was not clinically significant. Nitrous oxide did not have significant effects on the caesarean process and operating duration. Delivery duration was also similar between the two groups. Even the delivery time was shorter in N<sub>2</sub>O received parturients. No significant complication was seen in the study and only one patient in the N<sub>2</sub>O group experienced severe nausea and vomiting, which were resolved with hydration.</p><p>There are concerns about possible effects of N<sub>2</sub>O on arterial blood oxygen desaturation or increasing emesis in recipients. We did not find any oxygen desaturation in the studied parturients. This finding has also been noted in a randomized clinical trial which showed self-administered 50% N2O did not seem to predispose parturients to hemoglobin oxygen desaturation (<xref rid="A16662R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Anxiety is an unpleasant emotion and may affect the operation process; also anxiety is normally concomitant with pain. There are many methods for detecting anxiety before operation, but we used VAS for determination of anxiety before operation like Kindler et al. and Dubois D et al. did (<xref rid="A16662R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="A16662R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Administration of N<sub>2</sub>O can significantly decrease anxiety and pain in parturients who inhale 50% concentration of this agent by facemask in comparison with those who received oxygen in the control group. No clinically important side effect such as hypotension, severe nausea and vomiting, or arterial blood oxygen desaturation was seen in N<sub>2</sub>O-received parturients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors acknowledge the recovery anesthesia nurses of Fatemie Hospital, Hamadan, Iran.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="afn30198" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:</bold>Inhalation of 50% N<sub>2O</sub> by parturients can significantly reduce anxiety and pain in comparison with oxygen inhalation in the control group.
