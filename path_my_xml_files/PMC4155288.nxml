However, a commonly used anaesthetic like lidocaine has neurotoxic effects and this has been been largely replaced by other agents such as bupivacaine. The routine doses of bupivacaine are associated with prolonged and intense sensory and motor block and significant sympathetic block, which may not be desirable in some patients. Low dose diluted bupivacaine limits the distribution of spinal block and yield a comparably rapid recovery, but may not provide an adequate level of sensory block.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The potentiating effect of short acting lipophilic opioid fentanyl and a more selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist dexmedetomidine is used to reduce the dose requirement of bupivacaine and its adverse effects. These spinal adjuncts are used not only to reduce side-effects of local anaesthetics, but also to prolong analgesia.</p><p>For lipophilic opioids like fentanyl and sufentanil, the risk of respiratory depression is predominantly limited to the first 2 h after intrathecal injection.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Since fentanyl is more lipid soluble than morphine, the risk of delayed respiratory depression due to rostral spread of intraspinally administered narcotic to respiratory centres is greatly reduced.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Intrathecal &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptor agonists have antinociceptive action for both somatic and visceral pain. Dexmedetomidine shows more specificity towards &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptor (&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>/&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> 1600:1) compared with clonidine (&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> /&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> 200:1).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Several studies have shown that &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptor agonists when administered intrathecally will enhance the analgesia provided by subtherapeutic doses of local anaesthetics like bupivacaine due to synergistic effects with minimal haemodynamic effects.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] We aimed to find out whether quality of anaesthesia is better with low dose bupivacaine and fentanyl or with low dose bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After obtaining Institutional Ethical Committee approval, this prospective randomised double-blinded study was carried out in a tertiary health care centre on 150 patients of both sex aged between 18 and 60 years, belonging to American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status Grade I and II undergoing elective lower abdominal surgeries (viz. urological and general surgical procedures) under spinal anaesthesia. Patients with a history of spine surgery, infection at the injection site, coagulopathy, hypovolemia, increased intracranial pressure, indeterminate neurologic disease, spinal deformities, communication problems, known hypersensitivity to local anaesthetics, opioids or dexmedetomidine were excluded from the study.</p><p>Sample size was calculated based on previous study,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] using the standard deviation of time to first analgesic request (TFAR). To detect a mean difference of 2 h between the groups in terms of TFAR with &#x003b1; = 5% and 1&#x02212; &#x003b2; = 90%, 74 patients per study group were needed. Hence, 75 patients were included in each group.</p><p>A randomisation list was computer generated and patients were randomly allocated to two groups, (Group F &#x02013; fentanyl group and Group D &#x02013; dexmedetomidine group) 75 patients in each group and informed consent was obtained. Patients received no premedication and no preloading was undertaken. The age, sex, weight and height of the patients were recorded. Vital parameters were monitored using electrocardiogram, non-invasive arterial pressure, and peripheral oxygen saturation. Intrathecal drugs were prepared by an anaesthesiologist not involved in the study and were administered by another anaesthesiologist who was blinded and performed spinal anaesthesia. Volume of the drug, size of the syringe and colour of the drug of interest were similar in both groups.</p><p>Spinal anaesthesia was performed in all patients in the lateral decubitus position with operating table tilted 5-10&#x000b0; in Trendelenberg position. Trendelenberg position was maintained throughout the surgery. Under strict aseptic precautions, using 25G Quincke needle mid-line spinal puncture was performed at L2-L3 level.</p><p>In Group F, injection bupivacaine 0.5% (0.8 ml) + fentanyl 0.5 ml (25 &#x003bc;g) + normal saline 0.3 ml, (for a final concentration of 0.25% and volume of 1.6 ml of bupivacaine) was administered intrathecally. In Group D, dexmedetomidine was first diluted in normal saline to obtain a dose of 5 &#x003bc;g in 0.5 ml. Then, injection bupivacaine 0.5% (0.8 ml) + dexmedetomidine 0.5 ml (5 &#x003bc;g) + normal saline 0.3 ml (for a final concentration of 0.25% and volume of 1.6 ml of bupivacaine) was administered intrathecally. Drug was administered over 10 seconds (s) using 2 cc syringes with cephalad orientation of the spinal needle bevel. The patients were turned supine immediately after the injection of the drug. The completion of the injection was taken as zero time of the induction of anaesthesia.</p><p>Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) were recorded every 5 min up to 15 min and then every 15 min up to 90 min irrespective of the duration of surgery. Hypotension, defined as SBP &#x0003c;90 mm Hg or &#x0003e;30% fall from the baseline value was treated by injection mephentermine 3 mg intravenous (i.v) and i.v crystalloids. Bradycardia was defined as HR &#x0003c;60 beats/min or &#x0003e;30% decrease from the baseline value and was treated with i.v atropine 0.3 mg increments. We assessed time to reach T10 block level, peak sensory block level (PSBL), time to reach peak block level, time to two segment regression (TTSR) and degree of motor blockade.</p><p>Sensory block level which was defined as the loss of pain sensation to pin prick test in the midclavicular line, was measured every 1 min until it reached T10 level, and the surgeons were asked to start and then every 2 min until it reached PSBL. Peak block level was defined as the level that remained same during four consecutive tests. TTSR was noted by checking every 10 min after the peak block level was reached. The degree of motor blockade at the time of peak sensory block was scored using a modified Bromage scale (MBS)[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] - (1) Complete motor block, (2) Almost complete motor block, patient is able to move only feet, (3) Partial motor block, patient is able to move the knees, (4) Detectable weakness of hip flexion, patient is able to raise the leg but is unable to keep it raised, (5) No detectable weakness of hip flexion, patient is able to keep the leg raised for 10s at least, (6) No weakness at all). The quality of anaesthesia was assessed as excellent (no discomfort or pain), good (mild pain or discomfort and no need for additional analgesics), fair (pain that required analgesics), poor (severe pain that required analgesics). Tramadol 100 mg IV supplemented by intramuscular diclofenac 75 mg were administered on request as rescue analgesic. Supplemental analgesic use, TFAR (in hours) post-operatively and side-effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, pruritus, vomiting, respiratory depression were also monitored. Pruritus was managed with i.v chlorpheniramine maleate.</p><p>The primary outcome of the study was to assess which group produced a longer duration of analgesia measured in terms of the first request for analgesia post-operatively. The secondary outcome was to compare the two groups in terms of time of onset of analgesia (T10 block level assessed by pin prick), peak sensory level, and time to reach peak block, TTSR, degree of motor blockade and haemodynamic profile of the two groups.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) for Windows version 16.0 software, Chicago, SPSS Inc. Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used to analyse age, weight, height, pulse rate, SBP, DBP, time to T10 block, time to PSBL, TTSR, and TFAR. Chi-square was used to analyse sex, ASA, PSBL, maximum motor blockade and side-effects.

Since almost all lower abdominal surgeries that can be done in the supine position were included, we need an appropriate block level to provide an optimal patient comfort. The cephalad spread of analgesia after spinal block was found to be higher in head tilt group (10&#x000b0; Trendelenberg position) than the horizontal group (supine position) in a previous study.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Hence, we decided to tilt the table 5-10&#x000b0; in Trendelenberg position to achieve a desired level.</p><p>The use of low dose diluted anaesthetic can shorten recovery time from spinal anaesthesia in addition to limiting the distribution of the block. However, it may not provide an adequate level of sensory block.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The addition of fentanyl (25 &#x003bc;g) to low dose bupivacaine (4 mg) has been reported to increase the perioperative quality of spinal blocks with fewer cardiovascular changes,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] as has the addition of dexmedetomidine (3 &#x003bc;g) in combination with low dose bupivacaine (6 mg).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Kim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] observed that fentanyl beyond 25 &#x003bc;g intrathecally produced no benefit in regard to the duration of analgesia. However, fentanyl 25 &#x003bc;g intrathecally with low dose bupivacaine improves post-operative analgesia and haemodynamic stability.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] At the same time, fentanyl 20&#x003bc;g with bupivacaine 4 mg intrathecally provides spinal anaesthesia with less hypotension[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; TFAR is also reported to be longer in groups where fentanyl 25 &#x003bc;g was added to low dose bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, dexmedetomidine 3 &#x003bc;g with bupivacaine produced a shorter onset of motor blockade, prolonged duration of motor and sensory block with haemodynamic stability and lack of sedation.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] observed that 5 &#x003bc;g dexmedetomidine with ropivacaine provided excellent quality of post-operative analgesia with minimal side-effects; and 5 &#x003bc;g dexmedetomidine seems to be an attractive alternative as adjuvant to spinal bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Intrathecal dexmedetomidine in doses of 10 &#x003bc;g and 15 &#x003bc;g significantly prolong the anaesthetic and analgesic effects of spinal bupivacaine in a dose dependent manner.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Based on the above studies, we had concluded that fentanyl 25 &#x003bc;g and dexmedetomidine 5 &#x003bc;g would be safe and appropriate for our study.</p><p>Intrathecally fentanyl exerts its effects by combining with opioid receptors in the dorsal horn of spinal cord and may have a supraspinal spread and action. Intrathecal fentanyl when added to spinal local anaesthetics reduces visceral and somatic pain.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Intrathecal &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptor agonists have antinociceptive actions for both somatic and visceral pain. Intrathecal dexmedetomidine when combined with spinal bupivacaine prolongs the sensory block by depressing the release of C fibres transmitters and by hyperpolarisation of post synaptic dorsal horn neurons.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The density of compounds is believed to be a major determinant in controlling the extent of neural block.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is denser than fentanyl and the density of sodium chloride (0.9%) is higher than that of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine. In our study, fentanyl group consisted of bupivacaine 0.8 ml, fentanyl 0.5 ml and normal saline 0.3 ml and dexmedetomidine group consisted of bupivacaine 0.8 ml, dexmedetomidine 0.05 ml and normal saline 0.75 ml. Therefore, the solution with dexmedetomidine was denser and this could be an explanation for the increased level of blockade in dexmedetomidine group as compared with the fentanyl group.</p><p>Regarding haemodynamics, no significant difference was observed which is consistent with studies by Ben-David <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Atallah <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] where fentanyl was used. In another study where the same dose like our study (fentanyl group) was used for ambulatory arthroscopic knee surgery, no incidence of significant hypotension and HR changes were reported.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Ben-David <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] found that fentanyl 20 &#x003bc;g with 4 mg bupivacaine provided complete and satisfactory spinal anaesthesia with dramatically less hypotension.</p><p>In our study, the time to reach peak sensory block (in min) was higher in Group D (12.92 &#x000b1; 3.131 vs. 11.88 &#x000b1; 2.156: <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) compared to Group F.
