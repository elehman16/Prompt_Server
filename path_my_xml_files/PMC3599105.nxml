Measurement of the degree of joint damage represents an important tool to assess disease progression and effectiveness of current treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Periarticular osteopenia, erosions and joint space narrowing are radiographic features of RA that can be seen on conventional radiography of the hands and feet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Of these, periarticular osteopenia, reflecting a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), is one of the earliest manifestations, and may precede erosion and joint space narrowing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]; it may be caused by local release of inflammatory mediators and immobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The sensitivity of conventional radiography regarding osteopenia is limited, as it can only be detected if the reduction of bone density is more than 35&#x02013;50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In recent years, studies have been presented on an alternative method for ascertaining inflammation-related osteopenia in patients with RA, measuring BMD in the diaphyses of the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> metacarpal bone on conventional radiographs of the hands by digital X-ray radiogrammetry (DXR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. DXR is a computerized version of the earlier technique of radiogrammetry, measuring cortical bone thickness as originally proposed by Barnett and Nordin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Prior studies have suggested that this new technique has predictive value for RA-related joint damages and radiological progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Here, we present data on hand BMD change measured by DXR based on part of the SWEFOT (SWEdish PharmacOTherapy) early RA trial population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to determine whether hand bone loss (HBL) analysed with DXR correlated with radiographic progression, as measured by van der Heijde modified Sharp score (SHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] in patients with early RA and to compare HBL and radiographic progression in the three treatment groups of this trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>This study consisted of 159 of the 487 patients with early RA who participated in the SWEFOT trial and had correctly timed hand radiographs with sufficient quality to be analyzed with DXR. The SWEFOT trial was a collaboration of 15 rheumatology units in Sweden between 2002 and 2008. At inclusion (baseline), all patients started treatment with methotrexate (MTX) at a dose of 10&#x02009;mg weekly, which was escalated every 2&#x02009;weeks by 5&#x02009;mg up to 20&#x02009;mg weekly as target dose. All patients received folic acid supplements and their liver enzymes and blood count tests were monitored according to the local guidelines, with dose adjustments if needed, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>After 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;months, patients with disease activity score based on 28 joints count (DAS28) &#x0003e;3.2 were randomized in two arms; combination of methotrexate and infliximab [MTX&#x02009;+&#x02009;INF] or MTX, sulfasalazine (SSZ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) [triple therapy]. A total of 147 patients reached low disease activity score (DAS28 &#x02264;3.2) [MTX monotherapy] and were not randomized in the trial but were followed up in regular care as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The study was approved by regional ethics committees of all participating units [Karolinska Institute 02-211, &#x000d6;rebro 2002/202 500:16, Ume&#x000e5; 2002, Link&#x000f6;ping 02-186, Uppsala Ups 02-241, G&#x000f6;teborg Gbg &#x000d6; 282-01, M 088-02, Lund: LU 398-01 and Stockholm Central Ethical Review Board (EPN)2005/1361, 2006/248-3].

ESR was replaced by C-reactive protein (CRP) where ESR was missing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Analysis of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) was made with the standard Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (Immunoscan-RA Mark2 ELISA test, Euro-Diagnostica, Malm&#x000f6;, Sweden). Rheumatoid factor (RF) was measured by standard laboratory methods at the participating clinics. The functional disability was evaluated using the Swedish version of the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Radiographic assessment and digital X-ray radiogrammetry (DXR)</title><p>Radiographs of hands and feet were performed at baseline, after 12 and 24&#x02009;months. The radiographic damage was assessed in 144 of 159 patients according to the van der Heijde modified Sharp score (SHS) allowing presentation of total score [T-SHS (range 0&#x02013;448)], erosion score [ES (range 0&#x02013;280)] and joint space narrowing score [JSNS (range 0&#x02013;168)] separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. One of two certified readers (KA, KF) who were blinded for the treatment assignment read each set of radiographs in chronological order. The inter-class correlation coefficient between the readers was 0.94 and smallest detectable change (SDC) was 5.8, calculated by the formula described by Bruynesteyn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

With this method, the narrowest part of the second, third and forth metacarpal bones are identified. In each area, the thickness and porosity of bone cortex are analyzed around the centre and mid-shaft of the metacarpal bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

For non-normally distributed data, and in particular for the radiological scores, the Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal Wallis test were used for the comparison between two and three groups, respectively.

The main reason for excluding radiographs was that different radiographic modalities had been used at baseline and after 12&#x02009;months in the same patient. No patient was removed due to severe joint damage or prosthesis since this was an early RA population.These 159 patients did not differ from the whole study population in baseline characteristics, see Table&#x02009;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The number of patients (%) in the MTX responder, triple therapy and combination MTX&#x02009;+&#x02009;INF groups was 49 (30.8%), 55 (34.6%) and 55 (34.6%), respectively. There was no difference in the baseline DAS28 values between the randomized groups (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0), but the MTX responders had lower DAS28, compared with the other two groups (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 for comparison with those groups combined or each at a time). The MTX responders group had also a better functional status (measured by HAQ) than the other two groups (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Patients with triple therapy had higher ESR and CRP at baseline, in comparison with the other groups (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

We show that HBL over the first 12&#x02009;months, measured by DXR is a predictor for radiographic progression at 24&#x02009;months as well as between 12 and 24&#x02009;months. This is in agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Less HBL was observed in patients who had a good clinical response to MTX after 3&#x02009;months. Patients who were randomized to triple therapy had more often HBL than MTX&#x02009;+&#x02009;INF group, and they also had a greater risk for radiographic progression if they had HBL. Thus, our findings confirm and extend previous findings on the predictive value of HBL measurement for radiographic progression. Stewart et al. have previously shown in an observational study that measurement of HBL, using DXR, at 12&#x02009;months correlated with erosive changes in patients with early RA and predicted radiographic progression at 48&#x02009;months follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Hoff et al. also showed that patients with HBL at 12&#x02009;months had more radiographic damage at 5 and 10&#x02009;years in comparison with patients without HBL. In line with our results, mean SHS change was 3.6 and 7.1 after 12 and 24&#x02009;months, respectively. Patients with HBL had higher risk for radiographic damage after 5 and 10&#x02009;years with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 3.5 (1.42&#x02013;8.75) and 3.5 (1.43&#x02013;8.35), respectively. In our study, the corresponding value is 3.09 (1.20&#x02013;7.79) after 24&#x02009;months. In Hoff&#x000b4;s study, the least significant change (LSC) was calculated and used as cut-off to define HBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In the study by Forslind et al. in patients from the BARFOT study, HBL was defined as a change in DXR-BMD by more than 0.0048&#x02009;g/cm<sup>2</sup> (4.8&#x02009;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>/12&#x02009;month), the smallest detectable change (SDC), during the first 12&#x02009;month. Significant correlation was observed between HBL during the first 12&#x02009;months and T-SHS, ES and JSNS during 24&#x02009;months. Patients with HBL also had a greater risk for radiographic progression with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 3.0 (1.3&#x02013;7.4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] which is in line with this study. In another study from &#x0201c;the Lund early RA cohort&#x0201d;, the same cut-off (4.8&#x02009;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>/12&#x02009;month) was used. In that study, it was demonstrated that HBL at 12&#x02009;months was associated with an elevated Larsen score at year 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The main difference between the present and prior studies is that the fixed threshold levels, recommended by the device manufacturer (Sectra, Sweden), were used for analysis, to make the findings as usable as possible for clinical interpretations as well as for the ability to compare it with other cohorts. DXR-BMD change rates were grouped into normal, elevated and highly elevated bone loss, with threshold levels of 0.25&#x02009;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>/month and 2.5&#x02009;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>/month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and HBL was defined as DXR-BMD change rate&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2.5&#x02009;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>/month. This value is higher than the thresholds used in previous studies. Nevertheless, the findings are similar using different cut-offs in different studies, indicating that the correlation between HBL and radiologic progression is not only dependent on the particular threshold used in each study cohort.</p><p>Good responders to MTX after 3&#x02009;months were not randomized in the SWEFOT trial and just continued MTX as monotherapy. This group had less HBL, but radiographic damage was more pronounced compared to the patients who received combination MTX&#x02009;+&#x02009;INF. In the BeSt study, patients with initial monotherapy had significantly more HBL than patients on the initial combination therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In the PREMIER study, HBL was also less pronounced in patients with combination therapy and significant differences in HBL and radiographic progression were seen between combination therapy (adalimumab&#x02009;+&#x02009;MTX) and MTX monotherapy at 12 and 24&#x02009;months follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The difference between this study and those studies is that our patients who had good clinical response to MTX monotherapy had less HBL, and a plausible explanation is that our patients had already demonstrated good clinical response to MTX as monotherapy whereas in BeSt and PREMIER, patients were randomized from baseline. However, in this study, patients in the MTX monotherapy group also had more radiographic progression according to T-SHS than patients with combination MTX&#x02009;+&#x02009;INF, confirming the previously shown positive effect of anti-TNF therapy on radiographic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>One limitation of this study was that the radiographs were not taken for the aim of DXR analysis from the beginning of the trial. As a consequence, for some patients, the baseline and 12-month radiographs were not taken using the same type of instrument and these images could not be analyzed, but if that would not have been the case, few images would have had to be excluded from the study. Thus, if the DXR technology is considered in advance and the images taken consistently with the same equipment, there should not be a significant limitation for DXR in practice. The manufacturer reports a failure rate below 1/100. Another limitation of our study was the relatively small number of patients (23 patients with HBL at 12&#x02009;months) which limited the power of the study to detected small differences and associations. This small number of patients also resulted in low sensitivity.</p><p>Another disadvantage of the current study design was that the assessment of HBL by DXR was done after 12&#x02009;months. According to current recommendations, treatments of early RA should be evaluated earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Therefore, future studies should preferably investigate whether DXR after 3 or 6&#x02009;months could provide useful information.</p><p>However we agree with Forslind et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] that DXR may have a role in predicting destructive rheumatoid arthritis in clinical praxis where/when the radiographs cannot be analyzed according to the scoring systems used in trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, DXR provides information on HBL, observed in patients with early RA. Non-responders to MTX had significantly greater risk for HBL than MTX-responders despite the add-on therapies, and patients with HBL had significantly greater radiographic damage after 24&#x02009;months. Thus, information from DXR may be complementary to that obtained by clinical assessments and standard radiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>KF has received honoraria from Abbott and Bristol-Myers Squibb, not related to this study.</p><p>RvV has received research funding and/or honoraria from Abbott, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GSK, Merck, Pfizer, Roche, and UCB Pharma.</p><p>IP has received research funding and/or honoraria from Abbott and Pfizer, not related to this study.</p><p>The other authors have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors have collaborated in writing and review of this manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-publication history</title><p>The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/14/79/prepub">http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/14/79/prepub</ext-link></p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p><bold>The SWEFOT trial investigators group, besides the authors:</bold> Johan Bratt, Stockholm; Sofia Ernestam, Stockholm; Kristina Albertsson, Stockholm; Lars C&#x000f6;ster, Link&#x000f6;ping; Eva Waltbrand, Bor&#x000e5;s; Agneta Zickert, Stockholm; Jan Theander, Kristianstad; &#x000c5;ke Th&#x000f6;rner, Eskilstuna; Helena Hellstr&#x000f6;m, Falun; Annika Teleman, Halmstad; Christina Dackhammar, M&#x000f6;lndal; Finn Akre, &#x000d6;rebro; Lotta Ljung, Ume&#x000e5;; Rolf Oding, V&#x000e4;ster&#x000e5;s; Katerina Chatzidionysiou, Stockholm; Margareta W&#x000f6;rnert, Stockholm.</p><p>We would like to thank all participating patients, as well as the study nurses, co-investigators, and colleagues who made this trial possible.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The study was supported in part by a grant from the Swedish Rheumatism Association.
