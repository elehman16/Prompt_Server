This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of viusid in patients with HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>A randomised double-blind and placebo-controlled study was conducted in a tertiary care academic centre (National Institute of Gastroenterology, Havana, Cuba). The authors randomly assigned 100 patients with HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis to receive viusid (three oral sachets daily, n=50) or placebo (n=50) during 96&#x02005;weeks. The primary outcome of the study was overall survival at 96&#x02005;weeks, and the secondary outcomes included time to disease progression, time to HCC diagnosis, time to worsening of the prognostic scoring systems Child&#x02013;Pugh and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, and time to a new occurrence or relapse for each one of the main clinical complications secondary to portal hypertension at 96&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Viusid led to a significant improvement in overall survival (90%) versus placebo (74%) (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.92; p=0.036). A similar improvement in disease progression was seen in viusid-treated patients (28%), compared with placebo-treated patients (48%) (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89; p=0.044). However, the beneficial effects of viusid were wholly observed among patients with Child&#x02013;Pugh classes B or C, but not among patients with Child&#x02013;Pugh class A. The cumulative incidence of HCC was significantly reduced in patients treated with viusid (2%) as compared with placebo (12%) (HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.019 to 0.90; p=0.046). Viusid was well tolerated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results indicate that treatment with viusid leads to a notable improvement in overall clinical outcomes such as survival, disease progression and development of HCC in patients with HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">http://ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT00502086).</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Article summary</title><sec><title>Article focus</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related decompensated cirrhotic patients have a poor therapeutic response and reduced tolerance to the current standard of care therapy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Therapeutic goals in these patients should be directed towards reducing liver-related morbidity and mortality, and the need for liver transplantation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Viusid is a nutritional supplement with recognised antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties that could modulate the histological pattern of CHC, especially inflammation and fibrosis, in an attempt to halt disease progression and consequently improve liver function and liver-related morbidity and mortality, and prevent development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The administration of viusid to HCV-related decompensated cirrhotic patients induced a significant improvement of overall survival, a significant reduction in the disease progression and development of HCC.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The benefit of viusid was also seen in the secondary end point of worsening of the prognostic scores such as Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and Child&#x02013;Pugh scores.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The viusid effects on survival and disease progression were selective for patients with advanced stage of liver disease (Child&#x02013;Pugh B or C).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Viusid was well tolerated, and only minor transient adverse events such as nausea and diarrhoea were reported.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The main strength of this study was to demonstrate that viusid improves overall clinical outcomes (survival, HCC and disease progression) in cirrhotic patients who have failed to achieve sustained virological response with standard of care, and these benefits appear to be more prominent in patients with poorer liver function (Child&#x02013;Pugh B or C).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study was designed with a small sample size.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Further multicentre and large-scale studies are needed to corroborate the impact of viusid on the clinical outcomes in patients with HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis.</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> and the most common indication for orthotopic liver transplantation in the western world.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> Once HCV cirrhosis has developed, the risk of clinical decompensation is about 5% per year,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3 b4 b5">3&#x02013;5</xref> and the risk of mortality is considerably high with a survival rate of 50% at 5&#x02005;years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> Cumulative data of patients with compensated cirrhosis indicate that the 5-year risk of decompensation is estimated to be 15&#x02013;28%, and the annual risk of developing HCC is 1.4&#x02013;6.7%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> Liver-related mortality increases considerably as soon as decompensation is established, and then liver transplantation is the only successful therapeutic option.

Additionally, primary and secondary outcomes are in accordance with standardised terminology used in the majority of the trials evaluating the impact of treatments on patients with HCV-related cirrhosis.</p><p>The primary outcome of the study was overall survival (OS), which was measured from the date of randomisation until the date of death (related to liver disease). Patients with liver-unrelated death or lost to follow-up were censored at the time of death or discontinuation, and patients undergoing liver transplantation were censored at the transplant date.</p><p>Secondary outcomes included the time to disease progression, time to diagnosis of HCC, time to worsening of the prognostic scoring systems Child&#x02013;Pugh and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), time to a new occurrence or relapse for each of the main clinical complications secondary to portal hypertension and safety.</p><p>The time to disease progression was reflected as the time between random assignment and disease progression, defined as the incidence of liver-related death, the development of HCC or the first occurrence or relapse (only for those patients with a previous history of clinical decompensation) of at least one of the following clinical conditions: ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome or upper-gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to portal hypertension.</p><p>The time to diagnosis of HCC was calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of occurrence of HCC. Diagnosis of HCC was implemented using currently accepted diagnostic criteria for HCC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34 b35 b36">34&#x02013;36</xref></p><p>The time to worsening of the prognostic scores was defined as the time from randomisation to worsening of the Child&#x02013;Pugh score in at least two points and the MELD score in at least four points on the basis of independent clinical evaluation on two consecutive study visits. The Child&#x02013;Pugh and MELD scores are measures of the severity of liver disease, with higher numbers indicating greater decompensation.</p><p>The time to a new occurrence or relapse for each of the main clinical complications secondary to portal hypertension was defined from the date of randomisation to the date of a new occurrence or relapse (only for those patients with a previous history of clinical complications) of the following clinical conditions: ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, upper-gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatorenal syndrome and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.</p><p>The evidence for each end point was verified and confirmed by two blinded independent hepatologists.</p><p>Safety was assessed by dynamic reports of AEs, clinical laboratory test (haematological and biochemical analysis), physical examination and measurement of vital signs. The presence of sepsis and hospitalisation were included in the safety reports. Episodes of sepsis were recorded, and they were diagnosed and treated according to recommended guidelines. Sepsis was graded as severe if requiring hospitalisation or treatment discontinuation.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The baseline characteristics were summarised in percentage for categorical variables and as mean&#x000b1;SD for continuous variables. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was applied to categorical variables. The two-sample t test was used to compare means, and the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test if they were not normally distributed. Outcome measurements included all patients who were randomised and received at least one dose of study medication (intention-to-treat analysis). The safety analysis included all treated patients who had at least one safety evaluation after baseline.</p><p>Both primary and secondary outcomes were analysed by the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method, and differences were compared using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted by sex and age, baseline CP and MELD scores, previous history of clinical decompensation, and current use of diuretics and propranolol.</p><p>We defined OS time at 96&#x02005;weeks as a primary end point to compute sample size. The study was designed to have a statistical power of 80% to detect an absolute difference of 25% in the survival rates at 96&#x02005;weeks (95% in the experimental group vs 70% in the control group). Considering a type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.20, 43 patients per arm were needed to reach statistical significance. After considering patient loss as a result of dropout, we set the target number of patients at 50 per arm, or 100 in total.</p><p>All CIs, significance tests and resulting p values were two-sided, with an &#x003b1; level of 0.05.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using STATA software, release 11.</p><p>The study was designed by Catalysis Laboratory in conjunction with the principal investigator. The data were collected and analysed by the investigators. All authors had access to the data.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Between May 2005 and June 2007, 124 patients were screened. One hundred of these patients met the eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to the viusid (n=50) and the placebo arms (n=50).

Unfortunately, current antiviral therapy, especially for patients with decompensated disease, is generally limited by side effects, and early discontinuation is common. Therefore, liver transplantation is the most appropriate therapeutic option for these patients. Recent studies have demonstrated encouraging SVR rates and, consequently, clinical outcome improvements (OS, HCC and hepatic decompensation) in decompensated cirrhotic patients, but this was only achieved in a minority of patients (SVR, 5&#x02013;25%) infected with genotype 1&#x02013;4.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> Therefore, there is a critical need to explore new therapeutic options for patients with HCV-related end-stage liver disease who are never listed for liver transplant and could receive a beneficial impact on their clinical outcomes.</p><p>The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of viusid in a particular population of older cirrhotic patients who had a previous history or current evidence of clinical hepatic decompensation and genotype 1 infection, and therefore the poorest chance of achieving SVR and elevated probabilities of adverse clinical outcome in their next years of follow-up.</p><p>In the current study, we demonstrated that administration of a nutritional supplement to HCV-related decompensated cirrhotic patients induced a significant improvement in OS, compared with placebo. Similarly, a significant reduction in the disease progression, defined as the presence of liver-related death, the development of HCC or a first occurrence or relapse of at least one of the main portal hypertension-related clinical complications, was observed in patients treated with viusid in comparison with those patients treated with placebo. However, the effect of viusid on survival and disease progression was irrelevant for patients with CP classes A, in contrast with those patients with CP classes B or C. Interestingly, the cumulative incidence of HCC was notably reduced in those patients assigned to experimental arm, compared with placebo arm. However, a stratified analysis according to Child&#x02013;Pugh classes was not performed, owing to a small proportion of patients with presence of HCC, which could generate a bias in the interpretation of the results.</p><p>In the present study, we found increased rates of mortality, disease progression and cumulative incidence of HCC in the placebo group than previously reported rates in a large, prospective and multicentre trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> The most likely explanation for the disparity between these rates appears to be related to the difference in the study design. Our study was designed to include a large proportion of patients who had a previous history or current evidence of clinical hepatic decompensation (poor hepatic reserve), subjects who were excluded from the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> A recent controlled study has validated the efficacy and safety of IFN-based therapy for HCV-related decompensated cirrhotic patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> One of the main advantages of the study was to include a group of untreated patients (controls) with decompensated events who were enrolled to define survival and progression disease during 30&#x02005;months of follow-up. The results obtained in this study show that this group of patients have a poor chance to survive (68%) and increased rates of hepatic decompensation (88%) and HCC (10%). These results suggest that the natural history of HCV-related cirrhotic patients is more accelerated in patients with a previous history or current evidence of clinical hepatic decompensation.</p><p>Data from the HALT-C study show an increased annual risk of HCC in patients with a low platelet count and the presence of esophageal varices. This could be another reasonable theory to explain the increased risk of HCC in our study. In the current study, an elevated percentage of patients (&#x0223c;50%) had evidence of esophageal varices and/or thrombocytopenia (&#x0003c;100&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>/&#x003bc;l).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref></p><p>Finally, an increased prevalence of diabetes was reported in our study (42% in placebo group and 34% in viusid group), which has been associated with the development of HCC and accelerated disease progression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref></p><p>In the current study, the rate of new occurrence or relapse of overall clinical outcome secondary to portal hypertension was statistically reduced in the patients assigned to viusid in comparison with those allocated to placebo. The cumulative incidence of ascites was the only remarkable clinical condition reduced in the patients treated with viusid as compared with placebo. In contrast, no differences were observed between the treatment groups for hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome and upper-gastrointestinal bleeding.</p><p>The benefit of viusid was also seen in the secondary end point of worsening of the prognostic scores. A significant increase in the CP and MELD scores was observed in the placebo-treated patients compared with the experimental group.</p><p>During the viusid therapy, the risk of bacterial infections decreased independently from neutropenia, which could suggest an improvement in the qualitative neutrophil function, but this effect should be additionally studied.</p><p>Viusid was well tolerated, and only minor transient AEs such as nausea and diarrhoea were reported.</p><p>The mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of viusid on the clinical outcomes such as survival, development of HCC and disease progression have not yet been fully studied. However, there are several reasons to understand why its administration might improve overall clinical end points.</p><p>A recent trial has suggested that viusid therapy combined with SOC in patients with chronic hepatitis C may reduce inflammation and fibrosis, irrespective of virological response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> Another recently published study has reported a dual role to explain possible mechanisms of action of viusid on liver histology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> The authors found that MDA and 4-hydroxyalkenal levels were significantly reduced in patients treated with viusid, indicating an important effect on lipid peroxidation products. Furthermore, viusid provided immunomodulatory effects on cytokine secretion via increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) and decreased or stabilised production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#x003b1; and tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1;). Current studies are focusing on the biological effects of viusid on hepatic stellate cell apoptosis as a critical step to clarify the potential mechanism of viusid in liver fibrogenesis. On the other hand, it would be important to evaluate whether the viusid effects on the clinical outcomes are directly related to the significant reduction in portal pressure in cirrhotic patients. Further studies should be addressed to answer this concern.</p><p>Recently, the HALT-C study was designed to determine whether low-dose peginterferon &#x003b1; 2a maintenance therapy over 3.5&#x02005;years could reduce hepatic decompensation, HCC and mortality in patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who failed to achieve SVR with SOC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> Unfortunately, no overall reduction in any of these clinical end points was achieved. Like the HALT-C study, two other studies (COPILOT and EPIC) failed to demonstrate any overall benefit on clinical outcomes in HCV-related cirrhotic patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> A recent analysis of the HALT-C trial has demonstrated that benefits on clinical outcomes could only be reached in patients with profound viral suppression obtained with full-dose peginterferon and ribavirin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref></p><p>The main strength of this study was to demonstrate that viusid improves overall clinical outcomes (survival, HCC, and disease progression) in cirrhotic patients who have failed to achieve SVR with SOC, and these benefits appear not to be associated with viral suppression rates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref></p><p>Our study was designed with a small sample size. Therefore, further multicentre and large-scale studies are needed to corroborate the impact of viusid on the clinical outcomes in patients with HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis.</p><p>In conclusion, the study supports the use of viusid in patients with HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis who have failed to achieve SVR, with full-dose peginterferon and ribavirin in an attempt to prevent disease progression and improve OS. However, additional studies are required to confirm the long-term effect of viusid in patients with poorer liver function (Child&#x02013;Pugh B or C).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000140-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d32e1380" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e182" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000140.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e183" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000140.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>To cite:</bold> Vilar Gomez E, Sanchez Rodriguez Y, Torres Gonzalez A, <italic>et al</italic>.
