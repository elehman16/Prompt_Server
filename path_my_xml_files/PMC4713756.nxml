stability exercise on pain and function in neck pain patients. [Subjects] The study design
consisted of a shoulder stability exercise group and a control group. [Methods] The
effects of the therapies were evaluated using a visual analog scale of pain, a pressure
pain threshold, neck disability index, cervical range of motion, and a closed kinetic
chain test. Each group received treatment five times per week for 4 weeks. [Results] Pain
levels showed no significant differences between groups, while pain threshold in all
muscles, showed significant increases for both control groups. Neck disability
significantly decreased for both groups and the differences between the groups were
statistically significant. Ranges of motion and limb stability were measured before and
after the exercise period. Flexion, extension, and right rotation were not significantly
different between groups. The results showed no significant differences in shoulder
stability between the groups. [Conclusion] The use of this exercise should have pronounced
effects on pain reduction and functional improvement and should also improve the quality
of life in patients with neck pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Neck pain</kwd><kwd>Shoulder stabilization training</kwd><kwd>Neck stabilization training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neck pain may originate from muscle, ligament, bursa, disc, neuromuscular junction, or from
other problems that result in pain. Neck pain can develop in any individual, generally first
presenting as a headache, but also sometimes as shoulder pain. It is a cumulative condition
occurring because of musculoskeletal damage to the cervical muscles, joints, nerves and is
often caused by stressful work related conditions and long working hours. Changes in working
conditions in recent years have led to an increase in the number of patients being referred
to the hospital for neck pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. When
applying the scapula calibration strategy for patients with neck pain, improving the
position of the scapula and trapezius creates an activity ratio of the upper parts that is
close to the ratio of normal subjects<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Modifying the position of the scapula in patients with neck pain passively reduces pain
levels. Additionally, the improvement range of motion and rotation of the neck and the
proprioceptive have been reported to improve the position in relation to the position of the
shoulder<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although clear evidence
exists for the efficacy of stabilization exercises in reducing neck pain, clear evidence for
the other effects shown by several previous studies is lacking<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, results from previous studies remain controversial because most of the studies
on the effects of shoulder stabilization exercises for reducing neck pain are
cross-sectional studies with no control group for comparison<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this reason, exercise treatments for neck pain patients tend to
be based on the subjective judgment of the therapist, rather than on scientific
evidence<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study examined, it was
necessary to consider the impact of the neck muscles around the scapula that can contribute
to neck pain, the control of pain, the function of the neck, and whether shoulder
stabilization exercises to strengthen the large muscles of the shoulder have any effect on
the symptoms of neck pain. The effects of the addition of shoulder exercises to standard
neck exercises were also examined in order to present a more effective rehabilitation method
for the treatment of neck pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study involved 30 patients between 20 and 60&#x02005;years old who were diagnosed with neck
pain by rehabilitation specialists at Hospital, Dae-Jeon. Patient inclusion criteria was a
new diagnosis with complaints of neck pain of 3&#x02013;7 on a visual analog scale (VAS), a neck
disability index (NDI) of 15 points or more, and the ability to clearly hear and understand
the exercises. Subjects were excluded if they had neurological symptoms due to problems with
their cervical vertebrae, pain caused by vascular problems, severe orthopedic problems in
the shoulder, other medical conditions, or if they were involved in another experiment for
the duration of the study. A number of measurements were taken before the experiment began.
The pressure pain threshold (PPT) was measured using the VAS and the pressure that
reproduced that same level of pain in the neck was quantified. Function was measured using
the cervical NDI and cervical range of motion (CROM) was determined using a cervical tilt
sensor to directly record the range of motion<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Upper limb stability was measured using a closed kinetic chain test
(CKCT) to test the stability of the shoulder<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects were randomized into either the shoulder stabilization
exercise group (SSEG) or the control group, with 15 people in each. At the end of the
experiment, the SSEG included 14 people, as one person dropped out due to poor physical
condition, and the control group included 12 people, with three people being excluded
because of low participation rates. Prior to the subject&#x02019;s participation, all procedures
were explained, and each subject provided his or her written informed consent to
participate. This study was approved by the ethics committees of the Sahm-Yook University
institutions. The shoulder stabilization exercise and the control groups both received
conservative physical therapy, involving a 10-minute hot pack application, 10-minute
electrical treatment, 3-minute ultrasound treatment, and 15-minute neck stability exercise
rehimen, for a total of up to 40 minutes of treatment<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The SSEG received 20-minutes of shoulder stabilization exercises in
addition to the 40-minute conservative physical therapy, for a total of up to 60 minutes of
treatment. The exercise sessions were conducted five times per week, for 4 weeks<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The SSEG and the control group all
received the same number of sessions in a similar environment. All statistical analyses in
this study were performed using the SPSS ver. 21.0 statistical software was used for all
analyses. Results were calculated using the mean and standard deviation. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the normality of the general characteristics
and the parameters of the test subjects&#x02019; homogeneity were tested by using an independent
samples t-test and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Changes in the dependent variable between the
pre-test and post-test values were analyzed using a paired t-test. In order to compare the
group effects, the independent samples t-test was used. The level of significance for all
results was set at p-value &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The subjects&#x02019; general characteristics are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of study participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameters</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SSEG (n=14)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=12)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">162.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD).</p><p>SSEG: Shoulder stabilization exercise group</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

correlation with increased levels of neck pain. In a study in the United Kingdom of 151
patients with non-specific neck pain, neck pain and upper limb dysfunction showed a high
positive correlation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.799 between the two variables<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are a number of explanations for
the correlation between neck pain, upper limb dysfunction, and reduced upper extremity
strength. The first is the structural connectivity of the cervical spine and shoulders. The
bones and muscles of the cervical spine and the shoulders are connected to each other
mechanically, thus a continuously applied mechanical load on the shoulders directly
increases the load on the cervical region, which may cause joint and ligament pain. This can
be seen in certain occupational groups who use their shoulders more often than most workers.
The second explanation is damage to peripheral nerves. The brachial nerves are linked
structures that pass from the cervical spine to the shoulders. If shoulder movements result
in cervical tissue elongation and sliding, this may cause symptoms typically seen in neck
pain suffers. Sustained and repetitive movements of the shoulder and elongation of the
nerves<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> may cause damage to the fine
neural tissue leading to it becoming brittle and causing neck pain. In addition, movement of
the shoulder may be limited because it induces neck pain in patients. The last explanation
is the physical deterioration associated with neck pain. Neck pain leads to a rediction in
the levels of activities that require the use of the neck and shoulder. This can lead to
physical deterioration through a decrease in muscle strength, cardiovascular endurance, and
ability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, the neck disability index rates patients&#x02019;
ability to eat, to do housework, and to carry heavy objects. Another study found that, when
evaluating the performance of activities of daily living in patients with more severe neck
pain it was found that they had more difficulty in performing the activities mentioned in
the survey<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other studies, on the
treatment and management of patients with severe neck pain, the effects of shoulder
calibration and other current treatment approaches, have already been presented. This
comprehensive foundation can be seen as an opportunity to examine the effects of these
different approaches<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research has
shown that the active range of cervical rotation increases significantly when the shoulder
of a healthy young adult is supported by placing the scapula in the neutral position<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.This maneuver can also reduce symptoms of
neck pain<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study, examining
cervicogenic headaches, compared the activity of the middle trapezius, lower trapezius, and
serratus anterior when 30&#x000b0;, 60&#x000b0;, 90&#x000b0;, and 120&#x000b0; of flexion were applied with the shoulder in
a flexion, extension position<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Interventional approaches aimed at reducing uneven alignment, including repositioning of the
scapula, have shown of a significantly decreased NDI score after 3 months, and a
significantly increased CROM<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has
been reported that cervical rotation increases with the shoulder abduction angle<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. This, in relation to the present study,
can be best explained by the increased stabilization of that occurs during cervical
rotation. In a study on healthy young adults, it was shown that, by supporting the upper
limbs the active cervical rotation range was significantly increased when release the
scapula was released to the neutral position. Therefore, when a neck pain patient raise
their scapula, thereby increasing stability and supporting the weight of the upper limb,
this rotation relieves the symptoms of cervical neck pain, indicating that the cause of the
neck pain is through an injury affecting the scapular muscles. Comparing these results to
those of the study, the previous results showed that there were no significant differences
between groups in the stability of the upper limb, whereas in the current study, there was a
significant difference between the SSEG and the control group. The current study shows that
the occurs due to the manipulation of the scapula performed in the shoulder stabilization
exercise and massage groups, compared to upper trapezius elongation per during shoulder
stabilization exercise, provides greater relief to neck pain patients. This conclusion is
supported by a study that shows a link between the cervical and scapular muscles<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have reported increased
levels of stability in groups undergoing stretching exercises and massage, but these
differences were not significantly different<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hwangbo</surname><given-names>PN</given-names></name><name><surname>Hwangbo</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of thoracic joint mobilization and
