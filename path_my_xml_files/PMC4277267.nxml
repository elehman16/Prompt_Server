Further criteria included (1) best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of at least 10 letters on the ETDRS chart, (2) central retinal thickening (CRT) of at least 400 &#x000b5;m (with foveal involvement); measured by spectral domain OCT [(SD-OCT) Spectralis OCT, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany] and, based on clinical examination made by two experienced retina specialists, (3) no ischemic maculopathy seen in fluorescein angiography, (4) no severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or macular edema due to other underlying retinal vascular disease, vitreomacular traction or epiretinal membranes, (5) no previous anti-VEGF, MLT or other major ocular surgeries within the last 4 months, (6) no pre-existing ocular conditions that would preclude improvement in visual acuity despite reduction of the edema, (7) no pregnant or lactating subjects and (8) no subjects currently enrolled in other clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Standardized Treatment Regimen</title><p>All patients underwent a baseline examination including best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, dilated fundoscopy, OCT-imaging and measurement and fluorescein angiography. We assessed BCVA at every study visit using ETDRS charts at a starting distance of 4 meters. OCT imaging was performed on spectral domain OCT with eye-tracking and rescan support in follow-up measurements (Spectralis OCT, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany).</p><p>After eligibility was confirmed, all participants then received intravitreal injection therapy (IVT) with 0.5 mg ranibizumab (Rbz) closely following the European label, which details a <italic>pro re nata</italic> (PRN) protocol based on the RESTORE study with or without adjunct MLT. It must be noted, that this treatment paradigm differs in this regard from the U.S. label for 0.3 mg ranibizumab in DME.</p><p>As outlined above, navigated MLT was applied only to cohort 2, while cohort 1 received Rbz monotherapy:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Cohort 1 &#x02013; Ranibizumab Monotherapy: Patients were initially treated with three anti-VEGF injections in one-month intervals.

Patients were followed monthly with BCVA and CRT obtained at each visit and intravitreal injections were resumed if a reduction in BCVA of more than 5 letters compared to baseline BCVA or an increase of CRT of at least 20% was observed. Retreatment was continued until BCVA and CRT were again stable for at least two consecutive visits.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intravitreal injections</title><p>Patients received intravitreal injections of ranibizumab as delineated above. Injections were performed according to a standard procedure: topical antibiotics were used both pre and post injection under aseptic operating theatre conditions.

The cannula was then withdrawn and a sterile cotton tip was placed on the injection site.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Navigated MLT</title><p>Navigated MLT procedures were performed with the scanning slit laser photocoagulator, Navilas Laser System (OD-OS GmbH, Teltow, Germany), which was CE-marked and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2009. Its principal operation has been described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0113981-Kernt2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In brief, it combines imaging, laser application planning, and treatment in a computer-based device. It fundamentally differs from other laser devices by using a scanning slit-based principle to acquire and display high-resolution images on a touch screen monitor.</p><p>Navigated MLT procedures in this study were digitally planned on Color and FA images acquired by the instrument and/or imported OCT thickness maps by placing single spots and grid patterns according to ETDRS guidelines. The spot size was typically set to 100 &#x000b5;m and applied with a pulse duration of 100 ms. Based on color snap images taken during treatment, laser power was individually adjusted to values around 100 mW to achieve a pale grayish, barely visible laser burn. The treatment was administered using the plan overlay and laser-beam prepositioning features of the device.</p><p>In cases were navigated MLT and anti-VEGF injections were given on the same day, we always delivered navigated MLT first and anti-VEGF injections at minimum two hours afterwards.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>All data were collected in a MS-Excel 2010 spreadsheet (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 21.0 for Windows (IBM, New York, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 66 patients were included into this prospective comparison: 34 patients received ranibizumab/navigated laser combination therapy and 32 patients received ranibizumab monotherapy.

Combination therapy gains were in trend higher (8.6 ETDRS letters) and non-inferior to Rbz monotherapy gains (6.3 letters, difference n.s.). Combination therapy patients had a significantly lower retreatment rate with 65% (vs. 16%) of patients not receiving further Rbz after loading/navigated MLT. On average, less than one injection was required after Rbz loading, corresponding to a reduction of 3 injections vs. Rbz monotherapy.(<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113981-t003">Table 3</xref>) Therefore, the application of navigated MLT after Rbz loading appears to reduce the injection burden considerably without compromising anti-VEGF visual gains.</p><p>With regard to similar combination therapies using conventional laser instead of navigated MLT, evidence from pivotal trials is inconclusive. In the RESTORE study, patients received a minimum of 3 initial injections until BCVA was stable at two consecutive visits and in one arm of this study patients received conventional laser photocoagulation at baseline and as needed at 3 month intervals <xref rid="pone.0113981-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. As in this study, follow-up was 12 months from baseline, conventional laser combination therapy and Rbz monotherapy reached average BCVA gains of 6.1 and 5.9 ETDRS letters, requiring a mean of 7.0 and 6.8 injections, respectively. These insignificant differences between study arms indicate no benefit from adding conventional laser. Similarly, the DRCR.net trial using a different treatment and retreatment algorithm, did not demonstrate significant differences between a prompt laser arm and a deferred laser arm (no laser in 70% of patients during year one) <xref rid="pone.0113981-Elman1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Median visual gains were 9 letters each achieved with 8 and 9 injections median, respectively. In contrast, the smaller READ-2 study did show a reduced number of 4.9 vs. 9.3 injections in a 24-month period, when adding a mean number of 2.7 conventional laser treatments to anti-VEGF therapy. However, visual gains were slightly, but not significantly lower in the combination arm (6.8 vs. 7.7 letters gain) <xref rid="pone.0113981-Nguyen2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, no consistent benefit from added conventional laser can be inferred. Reasons, besides a different study objective, may include the lack of standardization and accuracy of slit-lamp based laser application in the clinical setting.</p><p>Navigated MLT was developed to overcome these limitations with multimodal planning and treatment functions (&#x0201c;eye tracking&#x0201d;), e.g. accurately pinpointing microaneurysms on fluorescein angiography images and outlining edematous areas on OCT thickness maps for subsequent grid laser treatment. During treatment each spot is prepositioned and tracked with the physician remaining in control. We observed a significantly lower retreatment rate of navigated MLT monotherapy compared to conventional laser in a previous study, suggesting stabilization may be reached earlier after navigated therapy (i.e. frequently after the first treatment).</p><p>In contrast, most Rbz monotherapy patients in this study required retreatment within the first 3 months after Rbz loading (Median: 63 days). This may highlight the importance of using a standardized, fast-acting MLT that achieves most of its effects with the first treatment in order to reduce the requirements for additional injections.</p><p>Our study supports the results of a similar study conducted by the University of California in San Diego that included patients that had been treated with a similar standardized combination therapy regimen utilizing navigated MLT and bevacizumab.
