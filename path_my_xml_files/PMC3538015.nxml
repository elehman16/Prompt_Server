The strongest of patient-related factors are generally assumed to be gender and age. Women have an increased risk of CINV, and patients less than 50&#x000a0;years old are also more likely than older patients to suffer from CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Both female gender and younger age affect the intrinsic emetogenicity of the chemotherapy regimen that has been described as the most important risk factor for CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although agents such as cyclophosphamide and anthracyclines (doxorubicin and epirubicin) are individually considered as being moderately emetogenic, combinations of emetogenic agents may have additive effects on the overall emetogenicity of a regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It has been recognized that women receiving the combination of an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) are at a particularly high risk of nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The second-generation serotonin (5-HT<sub>3</sub>)-receptor antagonist palonosetron is the only agent in the class that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting after single-day administration of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In a recently reported double-blind, randomized phase III trial in patients undergoing either cisplatin or AC-containing chemotherapy, palonosetron plus dexamethasone for 3&#x000a0;days provided complete protection against delayed CINV that was superior to a single-dose of granisetron plus 3-day dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, dexamethasone for prophylaxis of delayed emesis after MEC induces moderate-to-severe adverse effects that may have a substantial impact on the quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There is also an interest in reducing the dose of dexamethasone in certain clinical situations and/or in subsets of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. More recently, two similarly designed randomized phase III trials have evaluated the efficacy of a dexamethasone-sparing regimen for prevention of acute and delayed CINV due to single-day MEC regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In one trial, the patient population consisted of women with breast cancer undergoing AC-containing chemotherapy, while patients with solid tumors undergoing a broad range of MEC regimens were enrolled into the second trial. In both studies, palonosetron plus a single-dose of dexamethasone provided complete protection against CINV (primary endpoint) which was non-inferior to that of palonosetron plus 3-day dexamethasone in the overall 5-day study period.</p><p>The purpose of this retrospective post hoc analysis was to assess the impact of age on prevention of CINV in the pooled data set of women with breast cancer undergoing anthracycline and/or cyclophosphamide-containing chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A pre-specified retrospective analysis was conducted using individual patient data from women with breast cancer receiving specific chemotherapy regimens who were enrolled in two multicenter, randomized, phase III, comparative trials. Both studies tested the non-inferiority of a single-day regimen of palonosetron and dexamethasone, compared with the same regimen on day&#x000a0;1 followed by dexamethasone on days&#x000a0;2 and 3, for the prevention of acute and delayed CINV after the first cycle of chemotherapy. Detailed descriptions of the design (including eligibility criteria) and primary efficacy and tolerability results of these studies have been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Both studies had local institutional review board approval and written informed consent was obtained when patients entered each individual trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients and treatment</title><p>Chemo-na&#x000ef;ve women, aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years old with histologically confirmed breast cancer, scheduled to receive a single dose of intravenous anthracycline (doxorubicin &#x02264;60&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> or epirubicin &#x02264;100&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and/or cyclophosphamide (&#x0003c;1,500&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day&#x000a0;1), were eligible for enrolment. Additional chemotherapeutic agents of Hesketh emetogenic level 2 or lower could be added to the above regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. All patients had an adequate Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. In both studies, regardless of assignment to either study arm, all patients received a single intravenous dose of palonosetron (0.25&#x000a0;mg) as a bolus given 30&#x000a0;min before initiation of chemotherapy on day&#x000a0;1. Administration of prophylactic dexamethasone (8&#x000a0;mg intravenously) before the initiation of chemotherapy on day&#x000a0;1 was also required. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of two delayed anti-emetic regimens: no additional treatment (1-day regimen) or dexamethasone (8&#x000a0;mg orally) on days&#x000a0;2 and 3 (3-day regimen). After chemotherapy, rescue medication for treatment of nausea and vomiting was permitted on an as-needed basis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assessments</title><p>Patients made daily entries in their diary for 5&#x000a0;days after starting chemotherapy to record emetic events and severity of nausea in the previous 24&#x000a0;h, as well as any use of rescue medication. The primary efficacy endpoint of both studies was the proportion of patients with complete response (CR; defined as no emetic episodes and no rescue anti-emetics) during the overall 5-day study period after the first cycle of chemotherapy.</p><p>A modified intention-to-treat analysis was conducted, including all women who received chemotherapy, took the study medication, and completed the follow-up period (days&#x000a0;1&#x02013;5 following the initiation of chemotherapy). The post hoc analysis was conducted on the pre-specified endpoint of CR during the overall 5-day study period. The impact of the 1-day regimen on CR and on age as a pre-specified baseline risk factor (&#x0003c;50 years, &#x02265;50&#x000a0;years) for CINV was investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Treatment effects were also estimated within each age category for the acute (0&#x02013;24&#x000a0;h) and the delayed (24&#x02013;120&#x000a0;h) time periods. Secondary efficacy endpoints of no vomiting and no nausea were also assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Individual patient data for randomly assigned women with breast cancer undergoing specific chemotherapy regimens were included in the pooled analysis. A meta-analysis of individual patient data was performed using the CR in the overall 5-day study period as dependent variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A generalized mixed linear model with study and treatment group as dummy-fixed effect was implemented with binomial distribution, identity link function (non-canonical link function) and heterogeneity (non constant) within study variance. The treatment-by-study interaction was planned to be added to the original model (fixed-effect meta-analysis) as an additional random effect in order to investigate and adjust estimates for the heterogeneity across studies (random-effect meta-analysis). The treatment-by-study interaction was considered statistically significant if the <italic>P</italic> value was &#x02264;0.10. Since the random-effect model did not converge, the between-group difference with its associated 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) was estimated using only the fixed-effect model. The effect of age on treatment outcome was evaluated using an extension of the original model with age as a subject-level covariate. Results were reported as risk differences (RDs) that allowed a straightforward comparison between the two-sided 95&#x000a0;% CI of the between-group difference in CR to anti-emetic treatment for testing the non-inferiority hypothesis of the 1-day regimen (preset threshold of a &#x02212;15&#x000a0;% difference between groups in both original studies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to compare proportions of the other categorical variables.

We assessed pooled data from two phase III studies to investigate the potential effect of age on outcome of a dexamethasone-sparing regimen in women with breast cancer undergoing a highly emetogenic AC combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The retrospective post hoc analysis described here yielded two key findings: (1) the non-inferiority hypothesis of palonosetron plus single-dose dexamethasone could be confirmed in an adjusted model studying the influence of age and (2) an age younger than 50&#x000a0;years was not an independent predictor for poorer outcome in terms of overall CR to anti-emetic treatment.</p><p>The finding that the non-inferiority of the 1-day regimen was confirmed even after adjustment for age is of particular interest as it was obtained in a homogeneous cohort of female patients receiving a very uniform emetogenic stimulus, and further demonstrates the clinical value of palonosetron plus single-dose dexamethasone in this high-risk population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Another key finding of this study is that an age less than 50&#x000a0;years was not significantly associated with overall CR to anti-emetic treatment in an adjusted analysis. In spite of the relatively small sample size, the more likely explanation for this finding is that age was an unimportant predictor in this analysis because of the modest impact of additional dexamethasone doses on treatment outcome in this cohort of patients. In an exploratory analysis, inclusion of dexamethasone on days&#x000a0;2 and 3 after the initiation of chemotherapy revealed a different emetic risk profile between the age subgroups in the delayed time period. Among younger patients, both vomiting and nausea control rates were similar between treatment groups with a clear increase of protection from days&#x000a0;1 to 5. This finding suggests that the unique mechanism of action for palonosetron may at least in part neutralize the impact of additional dexamethasone in this subgroup at potentially higher risk. It is also interesting to observe that inter-individual variations concerning the metabolism of endogenous cortisol have been reported to contribute to the individual risk profile for CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, in ovarian cancer patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy dexamethasone added to the anti-emetic effect of ondansetron primarily in women with lower basal urinary excretion of cortisol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Since younger individuals tend to have lower cortisol levels than older subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we speculate that differences in endogenous cortisol secretion can partly explain the age variations in risk for CINV. Therefore, our findings in the subgroup of younger patients probably reflect the very modest impact of additional dexamethasone doses on anti-emetic control in individuals who generally have low total exposure to endogenous cortisol. As expected, for the delayed time interval, there were lower control rates of both vomiting and nausea among older patients receiving single-dose dexamethasone, when compared with older patients receiving dexamethasone for 3&#x000a0;days. In the face of age-related increases in total exposure to endogenous cortisol, we suggest that further improvement in control of delayed CINV in older patients following the 3-day regimen may be likely due to the effect of additional dexamethasone doses primarily in old women with relatively lower cortisol levels. Clinical investigations addressing relationship between patient&#x02019;s corticosteroid milieu and anti-emetic efficacy of dexamethasone in patients undergoing emetogenic chemotherapy should be conducted to substantiate these hypotheses.</p><p>It should be kept in mind that approximately 40&#x000a0;% of women with breast cancer is over the age of 65&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and the increased age generally puts them in a lower risk category for CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, older patients warrant particular attention in the selection of an anti-emetic regimen because older age is associated with decreased drug metabolism and clearance and increased co-morbidity which, coupled with increased frequency of poly-pharmacy, greatly increases the risk of unwanted drug interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In spite of the potential for lower control rates of delayed symptoms among older patients receiving 1-day dexamethasone dosing, several observations indicate that our results may support clinicians who desire to tailor the therapy in these patients by reducing the overall exposure to dexamethasone. In the exploratory evaluation of daily occurrence of symptoms, the rates of older patients with no vomiting or no nausea receiving palonosetron plus single-dose dexamethasone were high (&#x02265;85% for vomiting control and &#x0003e;55% for nausea control) and maintained from days&#x000a0;1 to 5, suggesting that it is difficult to accurately evaluate the clinical impact of the differences compared with older patients receiving the 3-day regimen. In spite of the intrinsic limitations of inter-study comparisons, a post hoc analysis of a large phase III trial in a similar population of breast cancer patients undergoing AC-containing chemotherapy randomized to either a triple regimen, including the NK-1 receptor antagonist aprepitant, or a control regimen (single-dose dexamethasone plus 3-day ondansetron), appears to support this interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although no data concerning the incidence of no nausea were available for the aprepitant study, when compared with the efficacy results of the triple regimen by age the overall proportion of older patients with no vomiting in the palonosetron and 1-day dexamethasone group was consistent with that seen among older patients (&#x02265;55&#x000a0;years) receiving aprepitant for 3&#x000a0;days (73&#x000a0;% vs. 79&#x000a0;%). Likewise, the overall proportion of younger patients with no vomiting in the palonosetron and 1-day dexamethasone group was consistent with the results observed among younger patients (&#x0003c;55&#x000a0;years) receiving aprepitant for 3&#x000a0;days (70&#x000a0;% vs. 73&#x000a0;%). It also should be noted that optimal nausea control remains an unmeet need in CINV research and the NK-1 receptor antagonists have not been shown to be effective in improving nausea control in patients receiving AC-containing chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Current guidelines recommend a triple regimen consisting of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub>-receptor antagonist plus dexamethasone and an NK-1 receptor antagonist for the prevention of CINV due to the combination of AC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, if an NK-1 antagonist is not available, women undergoing AC-containing chemotherapy should receive palonosetron plus 3-day dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Our findings indicate that, irrespective of age, the 1-day regimen offers high and similar overall control of symptoms as the 3-day regimen in this population.</p><p>One limitation of this analysis is that we were unable to assess the impact of age in an adjusted model including terms for other possible risk factors for CINV in breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Very few patients in the pooled sample consumed alcohol regularly, while no data were collected on other risk factors in the individual trials. A second limitation of our study is that all patients had early-stage disease and an excellent performance status. However, since AC-containing regimens are the mainstay of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and the majority of patients undergo adjuvant therapy, the present findings should have widespread applicability.</p><p>This post hoc analysis confirms the non-inferiority of palonosetron plus single-dose dexamethasone for the prevention of CINV associated with the highly emetogenic combination of AC in breast cancer patients, even after adjusting for the influence of age. The current findings also indicate that younger age does not predict decreased efficacy in terms of overall CR to the dexamethasone-sparing regimen. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that tailoring dexamethasone dosing to reduce exposure in women treated with palonosetron on day&#x000a0;1 is not associated with a clinically significant loss in anti-emetic protection during the 5-day observation period. Since a triple regimen including aprepitant is the guideline-recommended treatment in the setting of AC-containing chemotherapy and no randomized data about palonosetron plus aprepitant are still available, additional randomized studies of the dexamethasone-sparing regimen with or without aprepitant to separate the anti-emetic effects of palonosetron and aprepitant are needed to validate this interesting observation. Although some older women receiving dexamethasone for 3&#x000a0;days may experience improved control of delayed CINV, the potential additional benefit of taking dexamethasone for 3&#x000a0;days in older patients needs to be weighed against the increased risk for drug&#x02013;drug interactions and problems with compliance in multiple-dosing regimens. Our findings may be also of help to clinicians who strive to reduce the total dexamethasone dose administered in patients who have relative contraindications against the use of corticosteroids.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the clinicians, patients, nurses, and data managers who participated in the two trials.</p><sec id="d29e1377"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>S.
