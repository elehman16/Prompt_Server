Either prostaglandin analogs,<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> laser trabeculoplasty,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> or trabeculectomy<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> have been reported to reduce the mean IOP and IOP fluctuations. Many studies investigating the efficacy of SLT as a primary treatment for POAG and NTG have reported favorable results,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> and a previous randomized trial has suggested that the efficacy of SLT for reduction of IOP is similar to that obtained with prostaglandin analogs.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>The present study evaluated 360&#x000b0; SLT as the primary treatment. We evaluated 360&#x000b0; SLT instead of 180&#x000b0; SLT because the odds of achieving IOP fluctuations &#x0003c;3&#x0200a;mm Hg were approximately 6 times greater with 360&#x000b0; SLT than with 180&#x000b0; SLT.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> We confirmed that eyes in the SLT and the travoprost groups both achieved a significant reductions compared with baseline IOP values (&#x02212;3.7 [<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002] vs &#x02212;4.1 [<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001], respectively). We observed comparable and significant IOP reductions of average IOP, peak IOP, and trough IOP using both treatments for POAG and NTG patients when compared with baseline values. Regarding circadian IOP variations, we found the effect of travoprost on IOP reduction was significant both during daytime and nighttime, while the 360&#x000b0; SLT IOP reduction was significant only during nighttime. After treatment, the percentage of POAG and NTG eyes in the travoprost group achieved significantly more IOP fluctuations &#x0003c;3&#x0200a;mm Hg than those in the SLT group during the diurnal period.</p><p>Few studies have investigated the effect of SLT on 24-hour IOP fluctuations.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Nagar et al<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> evaluated the effects of SLT and latanoprost on 24-hour IOP fluctuations. A diurnal tension curve was obtained using IOPs recorded at 8 <sc>am</sc>, 11 <sc>am</sc>, 2 <sc>pm</sc>, and 6 <sc>pm</sc>. They found that both SLT and latanoprost were effective in achieving IOP control when compared with baseline IOP values. Lee et al investigated 24-hour IOP related patterns recording with a contact lens sensor (CLS) before and after SLT for medically treated NTG patients. They demonstrated that patients with SLT success had a reduction in IOP fluctuations. Higher diurnal variability of the CLS pattern was observed after SLT in nonsuccess subjects (IOP reduction&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;20% from the pre-SLT levels) led to an increase in 24-hour IOP fluctuations.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>A prospective noncomparative study by Lee et al<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> reported the effects of 180&#x000b0; SLT as adjunctive therapy in drug-treated OAG patients. The mean IOP and peak IOP reductions after SLT, compared with baseline values, were not significant during the daytime, either in the sitting or the supine position. The mean IOP and peak IOP were significantly reduced during the nighttime period in the supine position. They concluded that 180&#x000b0; SLT reduced IOP more consistently during the nighttime than during the daytime. We have also found that the effect of SLT on the habitual IOP curves in POAG and NTG patients was significant only during 9 <sc>pm</sc> to 7 <sc>am</sc>. This is of interest and possibly a result of the low baseline untreated IOP of patients in our study.</p><p>To study intravisit IOP fluctuations, IOP fluctuations &#x0003c;3&#x0200a;mm Hg were used to compare IOP fluctuations on the basis of the AGIS study that suggested that IOP fluctuations &#x0003c;3&#x0200a;mm Hg were beneficial in preventing visual field progression.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> We found both SLT and travoprost achieved IOP fluctuations &#x0003c;3&#x0200a;mm Hg during the night time. During the daytime, POAG and NTG eyes in the travoprost group had significantly less IOP fluctuations than the SLT group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05). Nagar et al<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> reported that SLT treatment decreased IOP fluctuations by an average of 2.5&#x0200a;mm Hg, and latanoprost decreased IOP fluctuations by an average of 3.6&#x0200a;mm Hg (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04). Success in IOP fluctuation reduction (defined as &#x02265;50% reduction in fluctuations) was higher in the latanoprost group than in the SLT group (83% vs 50%, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.045). We found a comparable result that showed that fluctuation reduction success was 92% for the travoprost group and 75% for the SLT group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.005). The percentage difference may partly be explained by the use of different prostaglandin analogs, the racial group of the patients, and/or the times after treatments when IOP measurements were performed.</p><p>The reason why patients treated with SLT during the diurnal period<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> had more IOP fluctuations than those treated with travoprost or latanoprost<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> is still not known. However, this difference might result from the differences in the aqueous humor pathways leaving the eye, although the exact mechanisms still need to be further investigated.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first large prospective, randomized trial that investigated the effects of 360&#x000b0; SLT and 0.004% travoprost on 24-hour circadian IOP fluctuations in habitual positions. Nonetheless, there are some limitations of the study. We enrolled only Asian participants who were evaluated for short-term IOP fluctuations, and the circadian curves were only recorded at 2&#x0200a;hours intervals. We did not use an instrument such as a CLS to continuously monitor 24-hour IOP fluctuations in habitual positions. The nocturnal IOP measurements were obtained requiring nocturnal awakenings. This possibly disrupted the normal sleep&#x02013;wake cycle and circadian IOP rhythm.</p><p>We used 2 different devices for IOP monitoring based on habitual positions during the diurnal and nocturnal period. Furthermore, the criteria for inclusion and exclusion may not be applicable for other types of glaucoma. Long-term studies would therefore provide more reliable results concerning which treatment modality provides better long-term control of IOP fluctuations and its effect on the progression of glaucoma.</p><p>In conclusion, treatments with both travoprost and 360&#x000b0; SLT significantly reduced the average IOP, peak IOP, and trough IOP in patients with POAG and NTG. Both treatment modalities can achieve nocturnal short-term control of IOP fluctuations. However, SLT has less control of diurnal IOP fluctuations than travoprost, when based on habitual positions.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank the Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University for funded support.
