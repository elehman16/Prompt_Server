This study assessed the cost-utility of LC compared to standard education (standard) as part of a rehabilitation programme for patients with ischemic heart disease and heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study was conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial with 825 patients who were allocated to LC or standard rehabilitation and followed for 5&#x000a0;months. The LC approach was identical to the standard approach in terms of physical training and education, but with the addition of individual interviews and weekly team evaluations by professionals. A societal cost perspective including the cost of intervention, health care, informal time and productivity loss was applied. Cost was based on a micro-costing approach for the intervention and national administrative registries for other cost categories. Quality adjusted life years (QALY) were based on SF-6D measurements at baseline, after intervention and follow-up using British preference weights. Multiple imputation was used to handle non-response on the SF-6D. Conventional cost effectiveness methodology was employed to estimate the net benefit of the LC and to illustrate cost effectiveness acceptability curves. The statistical analysis was based on means and bootstrapped standard errors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>An additional cost of DKK 6,043 (95&#x000a0;% CI &#x02212;5,697; 17,783) and a QALY gain of 0.005 (95&#x000a0;% CI &#x02212;0.001; 0.012) was estimated for LC. However, better utility scores in both arms were due to higher utility while receiving the intervention than better health after the intervention. The probability that LC would be cost-effective did not exceed 29&#x000a0;% for any threshold values of willingness to pay per QALY. The alternative scenario analysis was restricted to a health care perspective and showed that the probability of cost-effectiveness increased to 62&#x000a0;% over the threshold values.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The LC was unlikely to be cost-effective within 5&#x000a0;months of follow-up from a societal perspective, but longer-term follow-up should be evaluated before a definite conclusion is drawn.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Future research should assess the LC strategies' long-term efficacy and cost-utility.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01668394?term=NCT01668394&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01668394</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cost-utility analysis</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Patient education</kwd><kwd>Ischemic heart disease</kwd><kwd>Heart failure</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programmes have become an integral part of the standard of care in modern cardiology. These programmes rely on early detection of the disease process and the application of interventions to prevent disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, few patients complete CR or succeed with lasting lifestyle improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite the established value of CR, the participation rates are disappointingly low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and there is a lack of visibility and recognition of the importance of CR by the public [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In the light of the favourable effects of CR, it is important to develop patient education strategies which can help patients to improve adherence to CR and make changes towards a healthier lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. To enhance patient attendance in the cardiac rehabilitation programme, a patient-education strategy called &#x0201c;Learning and Coping (LC)&#x0201d; was implemented within a randomised controlled trial (RCT) at the Regional Hospitals West Jutland in Denmark. This method was developed in Norway to address some of the challenges in patient education. Theoretical basis and study protocol of LC strategies has been published before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Economic evaluation of CR has been reported since the 1980s, and all of the studies have supported the implementation of CR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The cost-effectiveness of CR is supported by evidence from 15 health economic evaluations conducted in North America and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recent studies have focused on comparison among various modes of delivery of CR, such as programmes that were outpatient, inpatient, home-based or telephone coaching programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a LC method was cost-effective compared with the standard rehabilitation of patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and heart failure (HF).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and population</title><p>The study was conducted alongside a RCT of patient education in cardiac rehabilitation. The participants in this trial included 827 patients over 18&#x000a0;years who had been admitted with IHD or HF. Two patients were excluded; one because he was mistakenly randomised twice and the other because she was due for an eye operation and could not start the CR program. A total of 825 patients undergoing the CR programme, were randomised in to one of two education methods. Randomisation was computer generated and stratified by hospitals, diagnosis and gender. Use of stratified randomisation should be viewed as an insurance policy against a potential imbalance and, because it has virtually no cost, it should be routinely used in RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Of these patients, 413 were randomised to the LC group and 412 to the control group. All of the patients received 8&#x000a0;weeks (approximately 2&#x000a0;months) of training and education and were followed for an additional 3&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention</title><p>In this study, LC strategies were applied and compared with the standard education in CR at three hospitals in the western part of Central Denmark Region (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

A micro-costing approach was used to calculate the cost of intervention. Micro costing is a method that provides crucial and detailed cost data. An accurate cost of the intervention at the micro-level is required to perform accurate economic analysis, such as cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analyses, which gives a complete analysis of outcomes alongside the cost at which they are achievable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The cost of implementing the intervention was not included in the present analysis; it should be seen as estimating the long-term average costs of implementing the intervention in routine practice. The intervention includes the cost of both formal and informal time of all persons involved.</p><p>A load factor of 1.5 was applied to the cost of health professional&#x02019;s formal time to account for non-productive time. Their productive time was assumed to amount to 45&#x000a0;min of an hour (load of 0.25) due to pauses, walking distance between locations, private time, etc. The remainder load (0.25) was considered to include vacation, sickness, participation in seminars and educational courses etc.</p><p>The valuation of formal care was based on the average gross salary of nurses and physiotherapists involved in patient education, which was provided by Regional Hospital West Jutland. Regional hospital&#x02019;s standard overhead rate of 21&#x000a0;% was applied to account for capital costs.</p><p>The valuation of informal time; time spent by patients and expert patients, was undertaken using the opportunity cost method, in which the value of a person&#x02019;s time is reflected by his or her wage rate. The average age of expert patients was 65&#x000a0;years, and the valuation of their time was based on their net salary assuming they are pensioner. National average gender- and age-matched salaries were used to value the leisure time (net salary) and productive time (gross salary) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The patient&#x02019;s time was calculated based on the recorded data on the number of training and education sessions they attended in both arms.</p><p>Transportation cost was assumed to be 20&#x000a0;min and 10 km each way for all patients and all contacts. The government tariff for transportation by private car for 2013 was used. Regional Hospital West Jutland paid the transportation cost of the expert patients during the intervention. To value the transportation time of the expert patient, 20&#x000a0;min in each way was assumed (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Item costs used for estimating the costs of patient education in cardiac rehabilitation programme</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Resources</th><th>Cost</th><th>Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Time cost of formal care</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Nurse (DKK /hour)</td><td>197</td><td>Regional Hospital West Jutland</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Physiotherapist (DKK/hour)</td><td>160</td><td>Regional Hospital West Jutland</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Load-factor for personnel time (weight)<sup>a</sup>

Productivity losses are due to sickness leave, early pension and re-schooling and, were calculated using weeks of inability to work for those who did not reach the age for pension during follow-up (67&#x000a0;years old). All cost estimates were adjusted for time preference and, inflated to the common price year of 2013, using the consumer price index where relevant (DKK 100&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;GBP 10&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;USD 18).</p><p>Data on primary health care use (number of visits and the related activity-based tariffs) were extracted from the National Health insurance service register [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and the data on the use of secondary health care services (number of services and national average Diagnostic-related grouping (DRG) tariffs) were extracted from the National Patient Registry (NPR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

To avoid the loss of information on the outcome parameters, the missing values were replaced using multiple imputation, which is generally used to address data missing at random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Imputation was produced using a chained equation approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] because the non-response was of a non-monotonic character (e.g., a non-response at baseline could return and become a response after intervention or follow-up). Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was conducted for the alternative analytical choice of carrying the baseline observation to impute missing values after the intervention and carry the after intervention observation to impute missing values on the 3-month follow-ups.</p><p>The data on patient attendance at education sessions were not registered in the first six months of the study. In this case, missing data was completely random and did not depend on observed or unobserved values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and to avoid loss of information, the missing values were imputed by a mean within the randomisation groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Baseline characteristics were summarised using conventional summary statistics. The comparative analysis of the individual parameters and of the net benefit was based on the means with bootstrapped standard error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Non-parametric bootstrapping with 10,000 replications was applied due to the skewed nature of both resource use and cost, and a general significance level of 0.05 was used.</p><p>The analytical strategy was implemented for two scenarios: cases with a complete response of the outcome parameter and, an imputed dataset in which missing values of the outcome parameter were imputed. Although both scenarios are shown, the latter was considered the main analysis.</p><p>Economic evaluation is subject to uncertainty not only because of sample variation but also because of assumptions made and generalisability issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We therefore conducted an analysis of alternative scenarios to test the methodological uncertainty of the imputation procedure and costs. The impact of the alternative scenarios was also illustrated using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. All analyses were conducted in STATA version 13.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Cost-utility evaluation</title><p>We estimated the net benefit using a range of hypothetical threshold values for decision-makers&#x02019; willingness to pay for a QALY (from DKK 0 to DKK 500000) and presented the incremental cost and incremental effects visually in a so-called cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). The CEAC was used to illustrate the probability of the intervention being cost-effective for the range of threshold values for willingness to pay for a QALY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

The main finding was that LC is unlikely to be cost-effective because it led to a higher average usage of all care categories except inpatient care, and the additional QALY generated was not statistically significant. The LC education was also associated with higher costs compared with standard education. This higher cost was primarily driven by higher outpatient costs, productivity loss costs and patient time costs.</p><p>The lower rate of hospital admissions in the LC arm could be due to more effective education, which may have led to seeking medical interventions earlier in the disease process. Because we analysed health care utilisation during a limited period of 5&#x000a0;months, the longer-term health care utilisation and costs are unclear.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on cost-utility of various patient education strategies in CR of patients with IHD or HF in Denmark. In a review of patient education in the management of coronary heart disease, James P.R. Brown stated that five studies reported healthcare utilisation and costs, but no study reported on cost-effectiveness. Reflecting on the various education modalities and intensities of the intervention, the reported cost of provision per patient varied from 49 to 453 lb. He found no strong evidence that education reduced all-cause mortality, cardiac morbidity, revascularisation or hospitalisation compared with the control. However, there is some evidence that patient education may be cost saving compared with usual care because of a reduction in downstream healthcare utilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>In a systematic review on patient education strategies for hospitalised cardiovascular patients, Yvonne Commodore-Mensah stated that it is unclear which educational intervention elements or strategies are most effective for educating hospitalised cardiovascular patients and their families. Her review showed that there are various patient education strategies that can be implemented for hospitalised cardiovascular patients and families; however, interventions need to be feasible as well as cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>In a recent study in Australia, Sangster et al. compared the cost-effectiveness of a telephone-delivered Healthy Weight intervention to a telephone-delivered Physical Activity intervention and reported an average gain of 0.007 additional QALY and a difference of $852 in cost, both in favor of the Healthy Weight intervention.</p><p>We did not find a significant improvement in health status as assessed with the SF-6D in both the LC and standard groups. Additional studies have also indicated that if the follow-up period is 6&#x000a0;months or less, no significant improvement in quality of life or functional status of patients with coronary heart disease is found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis performed by Rod S. Taylor on exercise-based rehabilitation for patients with coronary heart disease identified 12 trials that assessed health-related quality of life using a range of outcome measures. Although all trials demonstrated an improvement in quality of life with cardiac rehabilitation, an improvement was also reported consistently in control patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title><p>Complete data on the costs derived from the national registries was one of the strong aspects of this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Additionally, using the SF-6D is suitable to measure health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Another strength of the study was that rather than ignoring non-responders, we chose to use a multiple imputation strategy. The validity of the imputation procedure was based on the assumption that the data were missing at random.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated that there were no significant differences in either costs or outcomes between LC and standard education methods from a societal perspective during 5&#x000a0;months follow-up. We concluded that LC was not a cost-effective intervention in the short term; however, analysing a longer period of follow-up seems necessary because a higher cost of outpatient care in LC may result in future cost saving. Therefore, it could be suggested that health problems may be identified at an earlier stage, thereby resulting in better health outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contribution</bold></p><p>NTD designed the cost analysis, undertook all economic analyses and drafted the manuscript.
