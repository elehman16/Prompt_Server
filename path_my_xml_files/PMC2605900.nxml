<named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium falciparum</named-content>, a mosquito-borne parasite that causes malaria, kills nearly one million people every year. Although most deaths occur among young children, malaria during pregnancy is also an important public-health problem. In areas where malaria transmission is high (stable transmission), women acquire a degree of immunity. Although less symptomatic than women who lack natural protection, their babies are often small and sickly because malaria-related anemia (lack of red blood cells) and parasites in the placenta limit the nutrients supplied to the baby before birth. By contrast, in areas where malaria transmission is low (unstable transmission or sporadic outbreaks), women have little immunity to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content>. If these women become infected during pregnancy, &#x0201c;uncomplicated&#x0201d; malaria (fever, chills, and anemia) can rapidly progress to &#x0201c;severe&#x0201d; malaria (in which vital organs are damaged), which can be fatal to the mother and/or her unborn child unless prompt and effective treatment is given.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Malaria parasites are now resistant to many of the older antimalarial drugs (for example, quinine). So, since 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that uncomplicated malaria during the second and third trimester of pregnancy is treated with short course (3 d) fixed-dose artemisinin combination therapy (ACT; quinine is still used in early pregnancy because it is not known whether ACT damages fetal development, which mainly occurs during the first 3 mo of pregnancy). Artemisinin derivatives are fast-acting antimalarial agents that are used in combination with another antimalarial drug to reduce the chances of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> becoming resistant to either drug. The most widely used fixed-dose ACT is artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine (AL) but, although several trials have examined the safety and efficacy of this treatment in non-pregnant women, little is known about how well it works in pregnant women. In this study, the researchers compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of AL with a 7-d course of artesunate monotherapy (AS7; another artemisinin derivative) in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy in northwest Thailand, an area with unstable but highly drug resistant malaria transmission.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers enrolled 253 women with uncomplicated malaria during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy into their open-label trial (a trial in which the patients and their health-care workers know who is receiving which drug regimen). Half the women received each type of treatment. The trial's main outcome was the &#x0201c;PCR-adjusted cure rate&#x0201d; at delivery or 42 d after treatment if this occurred after delivery. This cure rate was assessed by examining blood smears for parasites and then using a technique called PCR to determine which cases of malaria were new infections (classified as treatment successes along with negative blood smears) and which were recurrences of an old infection (classified as treatment failures). The PCR-adjusted cure rates were 89.7&#x00025; and 81.2&#x00025; for AS7 and AL, respectively. Both treatments were well tolerated, few side effects were seen with either treatment, and infant health and development at birth and up to 1 y old were similar with both regimens. Finally, an analysis of blood samples taken 7 d after treatment with AL showed that blood levels of lumefantrine were below those previously associated with treatment failure in about a third of the women tested.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>Although these findings indicate that the AL regimen is a well tolerated and safe treatment for uncomplicated malaria in pregnant women living in northwest Thailand, the efficacy of this treatment was lower than that of artesunate monotherapy. In fact, neither treatment reached the 90&#x00025; cure rate recommended by WHO for ACTs and it is likely that cure rates in a more realistic situation (that is, not in a trial where efforts are made to make sure everyone completes their treatment) would be even lower. The findings also suggest that the reduced efficacy of the AL regimen in pregnant women compared to the efficacy previously seen in non-pregnant women may be caused by lower drug blood levels during pregnancy. Thus, a higher-dose AL regimen (or an alternative ACT) may be needed to successfully treat uncomplicated malaria during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050253">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050253</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000621.htm">MedlinePlus encyclopedia</ext-link> contains a page on malaria (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information is available from the World Health Organization on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/topics/malaria/en/">malaria</ext-link> (in several languages), and their <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/malaria/docs/TreatmentGuidelines2006.pdf">2006 Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria</ext-link> includes specific recommendations for the treatment of pregnant women</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/">malaria</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/pregnancy.htm">malaria during pregnancy</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information is available from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rbm.who.int/">Roll Back Malaria Partnership</ext-link> on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/369/RBMInfosheet_4.htm">malaria during pregnancy</ext-link>, on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/364/RBMInfosheet_9.htm">artemisinin-based combination therapies</ext-link>, and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rbm.who.int/wmr2005/profiles/thailand.pdf">malaria in Thailand</ext-link>

<named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium falciparum</named-content> infections in pregnancy account for a high proportion of maternal mortality in malaria-endemic countries [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], particularly in areas of low and unstable transmission. The northwestern border of Thailand is an area of low seasonal malaria transmission complicated by high levels of multidrug resistance in <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content>. In this region in 1986 an estimated 1&#x00025; of all pregnant women died from malaria annually. Since then there has been no safe and effective chemoprophylaxis that could be offered to pregnant women. A system of weekly antenatal clinics (ANCs) was therefore started. The ANCs provided early detection and treatment of malaria and reduced both morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Other malaria-preventive approaches in pregnancy such as insecticide-treated nets [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and insect repellents applied to the skin [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] did not show a significant preventive effect in this area. The therapeutic responses to various antimalarial drug treatments of multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria in pregnancy have been disappointing. In this geographic area, quinine currently cures less than 60&#x00025; of pregnant patients [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This low cure rate is improved by combining quinine with clindamycin, but the poor tolerability of quinine and the consequent poor adherence to 7 d treatment regimens compromise effectiveness [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Short course (3 d) fixed-dose artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are now recommended by the World Health Organization as first-line treatments of falciparum malaria in all endemic areas, and endorsed for use in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Artemether-lumefantrine given twice daily for 3 d (AL), is the most widely used fixed-dose ACT. It is effective against multidrug-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> malaria [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] but there are no published efficacy data in pregnancy [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. AL has an excellent safety profile in non-pregnant humans [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In animal studies, lumefantrine was neither mutagenic nor embryotoxic [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Artemether, like all artemisinin derivatives, can induce foetal resorption if given in high doses to experimental animals during a narrow time window in early gestation [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], although recent studies in primates showed no teratogenic effects at dosages equivalent to those currently recommended for antimalarial treatment [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In 1994 the northwestern border of Thailand became one of the first areas in which ACTs were deployed at scale. It took until 2003 for sufficient experience with artesunate treatment in pregnancy to accumulate [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and for sufficient confidence to develop for ethical approval to be granted for a treatment protocol evaluating AL in pregnancy. In 2006 WHO published guidelines recommending ACTs for the treatment of malaria in the second and third trimester of pregnancy whilst acknowledging the urgent need for more information, on both safety and dosing [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There is increasing evidence that the pharmacokinetic properties of several antimalarial drugs, including artemisinin derivatives, are affected significantly in late pregnancy resulting in lower blood concentrations. In the study area, current first-line treatment for falciparum malaria in pregnancy is quinine and clindamycin in the first trimester, and artesunate and clindamycin in the second and third trimesters. These are all 7-d treatments. A safe and effective shorter-course fixed dose ACT is needed to improve adherence to treatment and ensure high cure rates in pregnancy. However there are concerns that currently recommended doses of antimalarials in pregnant women may be suboptimal [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The hypothesis this study tested was that the AL would be superior to artesunate monotherapy 7 d (AS7) in terms of parasitological efficacy in the treatment of uncomplicated <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> malaria in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. This randomised comparative trial included a recently published nested substudy in which the pharmacokinetic properties of artemether, dihydroartemisinin, and lumefantrine [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] were characterised, followed by larger evaluations of lumefantrine population pharmacokinetics and day 7 drug level monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The CONSORT checklist and trial protocol can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050253-sd001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050253-sd002">S2</xref>, respectively.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants Setting and Location</title><p>The women in this study attended the weekly ANC of Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU).

This is a pragmatic compromise, as ACTs may become the only available effective antimalarials, pregnant women are at increased risk from falciparum malaria, and the evidence to date indicates that artemisinin derivatives are safe in later pregnancy. This is, to our knowledge, the first randomised controlled trial of fixed-dose ACT in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy. Artemether with lumefantrine was very well tolerated with no adverse effects either for the mother or for the foetus, yet its efficacy was lower than expected. Both artesunate monotherapy for 7 d and the standard 3 d regimen of artemether and lumefantrine resulted in cure rates below the 90&#x00025; efficacy threshold recommended by WHO [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cure rates are likely to be even lower outside the setting of a trial when all doses cannot be directly supervised. Failure rates were over twice as high as those in non-pregnant adults, given the same dose in this same location, for whom AL cure rates consistently exceed 95&#x00025; [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The cure rates in pregnant women are lower than observed in young children in this area, a patient group with little or no immunity, which suggests that the poor therapeutic response is not explained by the malaria-specific immunosuppression of pregnancy. The significantly lower cure rates with AL were largely explained by the difference in cure rates for recrudescent infections (i.e., women presenting with a recrudescence of a previous infection). This study initially recruited women with a recurrent <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> infection only, as there had been no previous experience to establish the safety of AL in pregnancy. This trial was not originally designed to compare cure rates in recrudescent with those in new or primary infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050253-g005">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0050253-t005">Table 5</xref>), but the exploratory analysis shows a clear superiority of AS7 over AL in this particular subgroup. There was no difference in efficacy between AL and AS7 in the treatment of primary or new infections. This difference between primary and recrudescent infections presumably reflects reduced class susceptibility of the recrudescent infections to quinine, mefloquine, and lumefantrine [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although AL is not routinely used in the study area, there is cross-resistance with mefloquine, which is combined with artesunate in the first-line treatment in the non-pregnant population. Resistance is associated with an increase in <italic>Pfmdr1</italic> copy numbers [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Parasites with increased <italic>Pfmdr1</italic> copy number are also slightly less sensitive to artemisinin derivatives, although the differences are much less than for lumefantrine [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The poor cure rate of AL in pregnant compared to non-pregnant patients probably results from the lower drug concentrations of both component drugs. The pharmacokinetic properties of both artemether and lumefantrine in later pregnancy are altered substantially. As with several other antimalarial drugs, plasma concentrations of artemether, its principal metabolite dihydroartemisinin, and lumefantrine are reduced in pregnant women [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This was shown in the conventional pharmacokinetic study [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] embedded into the early phase of this trial, and is reflected again by the relatively low day 7 capillary plasma lumefantrine concentrations.</p><p>We have shown previously that low plasma lumefantrine levels, reflected by the area under the plasma concentration time curve (or its surrogate, the day 7 level), and parasitaemia are the two main determinants of the therapeutic response in studies conducted in non-pregnant patients [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus patients with lower drug levels and higher parasitaemias are most likely to fail treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050253-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Where drug resistant parasites are prevalent, the combined effects of low antimalarial drug levels and the attenuated antiparasitic immunity in pregnancy in patients with heavier parasite burdens (itself a reflection of reduced immunity against the infecting parasite population) increase the risk of treatment failure.</p><p>The need in malaria-endemic areas for a safe and effective drug with an adequate post-treatment prophylactic effect in pregnancy is clearly demonstrated by the fact that half of the patients in this study had recurrent malaria infection within 50 d. All women who had positive placental blood at delivery had parasite reappearance after randomization.</p><p>Several factors contribute to the poorer treatment responses during pregnancy; <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> parasites sequester in the placenta and so the parasite burden is underestimated, antiparasitic immunity is compromised, and antimalarial drug levels are generally lower. This study shows that guidelines for defining antimalarial efficacy [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] in non-pregnant patients may not be applicable to pregnancy. Nearly one-third of PCR genotyping&#x02013;confirmed recrudescent infections occurred after day 42, whereas in non-pregnant patients treated with these drugs nearly all recrudescences occur within 42 d. Importantly this happened equally with artesunate and artemether-lumefantrine. One woman harboured a single infection at sub-patent densities for 3 mo following artesunate. Thus pregnant women can harbour recrudescent infections for protracted periods. This has been reported previously in Asia [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and more recently in Africa [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The duration of follow-up in all antimalarial drug trials in pregnant women should be extended at least to delivery, or day 42 if this comes later.</p><p>In contrast to high-transmission settings, microscopy of the placental smear did not add to the diagnostic yield. <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> PCR genotyping of maternal peripheral and placental blood at delivery did not detect any submicroscopic infections. All cases of placentas that were positive by PCR were found in mothers with a positive peripheral blood smear or very recently treated positive peripheral blood smear.

Anaemia is a significant adverse effect of malaria in pregnancy [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Artemisinin and its derivatives temporarily suppress erythropoeisis, but this &#x0201c;trades off&#x0201d; against the benefit of rapidly reducing parasitaemia and thereby reducing malaria-associated haemolysis. The slightly lower levels of haematocrit and haemoglobin at day 7 in the AS7 group were expected because of the longer haematopoietic suppression from the 7 d regimen [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This was not clinically significant as there was no difference in day 42 haematocrit levels, or final haematocrit before delivery.</p><p>No pregnant women or newborns in this study died from malaria. The newborn anthropometric results and neurological scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0050253-t005">Table 5</xref>) were very similar in the two groups and are consistent with having multiple malaria infections in pregnancy [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The better efficacy of AS7 compared to AL did not result in improved birth outcomes in the AS7 group nor would one expect it to, as this study was not powered to detect such differences. This was a study conducted in the second and third trimesters so any congenital abnormalities are most unlikely to be drug related and the rates were similar to previously reported studies in this area [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Although there were significantly more infant deaths in the AS7 group, these deaths were unrelated to treatment. The growth parameters and Shoklo developmental score of the infants during and up to 1 y of follow-up were also reassuring. Overall the 252 women in this study were treated with a total of 362 artemisinin-based treatments for slide-confirmed <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> infections before and during this study. This provides further reassuring safety data on the use of artemisinins in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy; however, further large-scale assessments are needed to confirm this safety profile.</p><p>One of the limitations of this trial includes the lack of blinding to antimalarial treatment administration. A placebo for this trial would have been difficult as the two regimens were very different. The embedded pharmacokinetic sampling would have been impossible without unblinding the trial or sampling women from both groups to maintain blinding, which would be unethical. The ad-hoc analysis shows differences within the strata, rather than simply between groups, which suggests the lack of blinding did not influence the efficacy results.</p><p>Immunity contributes significantly to treatment outcomes. It is probable that treatment responses to AL would be better in higher-transmission settings. But in this setting where <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> is relatively resistant and transmission intensity (and therefore immunity) is low, the cure rates with AL in pregnancy are unsatisfactory. A dosage increase is needed. A major drawback is that lumefantrine absorption has been shown to be dose-limited [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], so simply increasing the individual doses is unlikely to result in higher cure rates. A longer or more frequent AL treatment course should now be evaluated. Importantly, the most favourable efficacy results for this drug in non-pregnant patients on the Thai-Burmese border were obtained by giving six doses over 5 d [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A 5 d regimen would provide artemether exposure over three parasite asexual cycles and 67&#x00025; more lumefantrine. Pharmacokinetic dose evaluation studies on higher AL dose regimens should now be performed. Adequate cure rates for falciparum malaria in pregnancy will only be achieved when the doses are optimised specifically for pregnancy. Antimalarial efficacy studies in pregnancy are more complex than in non-pregnant patients. Lengthy follow-up is needed both to capture delayed recrudescence and for the assessment of the newborn. A safe and effective, short course, artemisinin-based combination treatment for uncomplicated <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> malaria in pregnant women has yet to be found.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Generalisability</title><p>Our results do not indicate that the conventional regimen of AL cannot be used to treat pregnant women with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in other endemic regions. However, they show that in an area of multidrug resistance, the lower lumefantrine plasma levels found in pregnant women will result in a lower parasitological efficacy. In areas of higher endemicity where multigravid pregnant women have some protection from acquired premunition, the conventional regimen of AL, i.e., two doses per day for 3 d, may be more effective, and studies (including pharmacokinetics) are in progress at the time of writing.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>There are no data on a direct comparison of the pharmacokinetics of lumefantrine in pregnant and non-pregnant women. The only comparable pharmacokinetic data from the same population and the same pharmacology laboratory are from adults (mostly males), and these were used in the present discussion. The results of the population kinetic study of lumefantrine in the pregnant women of this study will be presented elsewhere. Preliminary analysis confirms the findings of the initial pharmacokinetic study [<xref rid="pmed-0050253-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and show that plasma levels of lumefantrine are generally lower in pregnant women.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current standard six-dose artemether-lumefantrine regimen was well tolerated and safe in pregnant Karen women with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but efficacy was inferior to 7-d artesunate monotherapy and was unsatisfactory for general deployment in this area. Reduced efficacy probably results from lowered drug concentrations in later pregnancy in the presence of relatively resistant parasites. A higher-dose regimen may be needed to treat pregnant women effectively and should now be evaluated. Longer follow-up is needed when assessing antimalarial drugs in pregnancy as recrudescences may occur months after administration of rapidly eliminated drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0050253-sd001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist</title><p>(115 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0050253.sd001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0050253-sd002"><label>Text S2</label><caption><title>Trial Protocol</title><p>Artemether-lumefantrine treatment of multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria in pregnancy: a pilot study.</p><p>(198 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0050253.sd002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our sincere thanks to the pregnant women, doctors, midwives, medics, nurses, lab technicians, home-visitors, cleaners, drivers, and logistical and administrative teams of SMRU and MORU who made this detailed work possible.
