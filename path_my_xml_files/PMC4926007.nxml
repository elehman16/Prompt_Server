In other words, topical 5% KOH solution was as effective as CO<sub>2</sub> laser in the treatment of the lesions. The highest improvement of lesions in KOH and laser-treated patients was observed at the end of the 3rd week of treatment. This means that the most response was documented during 3 weeks after initiation of KOH and laser therapy. KOH solution complications were more than those of laser in the same patients and the difference was not considerable. KOH-treated lesions showed more erythema, burn, and erosion while laser-treated lesions presented more hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation. The results of the present study demonstrated that KOH solution had a higher rate of recurrence compared with CO<sub>2</sub>, but the difference was not prominent between the two treatment modalities. Our study showed that genital warts were more common in participants with higher education level and married patients. The most common complication of topical 5% KOH solution was erosion, while the least common one was post-treatment hypopigmentation. Another finding of the current study demonstrated that labia major were the most common location for developing genital warts.</p><p>According to the medical literature, there were a few clinical researches describing the positive therapeutic role of KOH in the treatment of genital warts. Some investigators evaluated topical 5% KOH solution in male patients with genital warts. They included 35 men in their study.

The patients were followed up for 2 months to determine the recurrence rate.

A total of 48 patients were enrolled in the study during a period of 10 months and followed up for 1 month. At the end of the trial, 54.2% of the patients treated with KOH were completely wart-free without recurrence. Superficial erosions, burning, and hypopigmentation were observed in the patients. This study demonstrated that 5% KOH solution was at least as effective as cryotherapy for the treatment of male genital warts.<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>It is likely that the action mechanism of KOH is related to its keratolytic role leading to the destruction of the contaminated cells and induction of inflammation.<sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first controlled trial that examined the therapeutic effect of KOH solution on female genital warts.

Third, the current study was self-controlled and possible confounders such as genetic and environmental factors were controlled.</p><p>The most remarkable superiority of KOH over CO<sub>2</sub> laser therapy is that KOH solution is applied by the patients and considered cost-benefit for both patients and healthcare system.

In addition, we excluded the pregnant women with genital warts from the study because we had not any document related to safety of KOH solution application in these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Our findings confirmed previous studies regarding the therapeutic role of topical KOH solution on genital warts. The present trial showed that topical 5% KOH was as effective as CO<sub>2</sub> laser on the improvement of female genital warts. There was not any serious complication in the application of KOH solution. This chemical agent can be included as a new therapeutic modality in the spectrum of therapies for genital warts. Though KOH therapy seems to be quite effective, further randomized control trials will provide more evidence of the effectiveness of this novel agent. Various concentrations of KOH solution such as KOH 2.5% and 10% can be investigated in the future clinical studies. Evaluation of the efficacy and complications of KOH solution in pregnant animals can be done prior to its use in pregnant women with genital warts.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENT</sc></title><p>The present article was extracted from the thesis written by Dr. Ensie Hemmati (Grant No: 92-01-01-6325) and financially
