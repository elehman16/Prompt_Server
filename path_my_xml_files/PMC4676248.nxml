Motor block from subarachnoid anesthesia beyond the duration of surgery is undesirable, particularly in ambulatory setting, and this is the most important reason why subarachnoid block is not preferred in ambulatory setting. Various local anesthetic agents have been used in spinal anesthesia since their introduction. Among them, ropivacaine, which was first used clinically in 1992,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] provides shorter duration of sensory and motor block than bupivacaine, and may be of particular use in the day-case setting.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Ropivacaine has been shown to be effective in providing surgical anesthesia for patients undergoing total hip replacement,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] transurethral resection of the prostate,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] lower abdominal or limb surgery[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and cesarean section.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Various studies have compared the efficacy and side effect profile of equipotent doses of intrathecal bupivacaine and ropivacaine in different surgeries.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, there are very few studies comparing intrathecal use of equal volume of isobaric ropivacaine and bupivacaine and their effect on perioperative hemodynamics and duration of analgesia[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and even fewer studies have used fentanyl as an adjuvant.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In this prospective randomized study, intrathecal 0.5% isobaric ropivacaine and fentanyl was compared with 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine and fentanyl in terms of block characteristics and hemodynamic effects in adult patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>After obtaining institutional ethics committee permission and written informed consent from the patients, 74 adult patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA PS) I and II and aged between 18 and 60 years scheduled to undergo elective orthopedic surgery under subarachnoid block during the period of March 2011 to February 2012 were included in the prospective randomized trial. Patients refusing to participate, with known allergy to any study drug, having any contraindication to spinal anesthesia, and pregnant women were excluded from the study. Patients having the level of sensory block below T10 after 15 min of subarachnoid block or having visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score &#x0003c;40 at any point of time during intraoperative period were offered general anesthesia for the rest of the procedure. This subset of patients were planned to regard as &#x0201c;incomplete block&#x0201d; category and planned to exclude from the final data analysis.</p><p>A computer-generated randomization table (Microsoft<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Excel 2007 software, Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) was used to assign each patient into either Group &#x0201c;R&#x0201d; (patients receiving ropivacaine and fentanyl) or Group &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; (patient receiving bupivacaine and fentanyl). For ensuring blinding, randomly allocated coded syringes of drugs were prepared by an anesthesiologist who did not perform subarachnoid block or record the outcome during intraoperative and postoperative periods. The investigator and the anesthesiologist performing subarachnoid block were blinded to the content of the drugs contained in the syringes. The solution intended for Group R contained 3 ml isobaric ropivacaine (0.5%) and 0.5 ml (25 &#x003bc;g) fentanyl, and solution intended for Group B contained 3 ml isobaric bupivacaine (0.5%) and 0.5 ml (25 &#x003bc;g) fentanyl.</p><p>A complete preanesthetic evaluation was performed in each patient and necessary written informed consent was taken. Standard ASA fasting guidelines were followed in each patient, and they did not receive any sedative premedication on the day of surgery as many of our patients were admitted on the day of surgery. After receiving the patients in operation theater, an intravenous line was established with an 18G intravenous cannula in a large peripheral vein of hand and preloading was done with Ringer's lactate (RL) solution 15 ml/kg body weight, which was infused over 15-min. Anesthesia machine, airway equipment was checked and drugs for resuscitation and general anesthesia were kept ready before starting the procedure.</p><p>Under strict aseptic precautions, a 25G Quincke's spinal needle (Spinocan&#x000ae;, B. Braun Medical Ltd, Sheffield, UK) was introduced in sitting position with midline approach into L3-L4 or L2-L3 interspace and after confirming free flow of cerebrospinal fluid, drug was injected over 20 s with cephalic orientation of the spinal needle bevel. At the end of the injection, a small sterile dressing was applied at the injection site, and patients were placed supine with a pillow under the head and neck soon after administration of intrathecal drugs. Verbal communication with the patient was maintained after spinal anesthesia. The patients were continuously monitored with electrocardiography, pulse oximetry and noninvasive blood pressure.</p><p>Oxygen was given through bi-nasal cannula at 2 L/min. Intraoperative fluid management was done as per standard protocol. The blood losses up to the transfusion threshold were replaced with 3 ml of RL for each ml of blood loss. Hypotension, defined by decrease in blood pressure more than 30% below baseline or in normotensive patients, fall in systolic pressure below 90 mmHg, was treated with bolus of 200 ml of RL solution and if not responded, incremental doses of intravenous mephentermine was used. Bradycardia was defined as heart rate (HR) &#x0003c;50/min which was treated with intravenous atropine 0.5 mg. At the end of the surgery, the patients were shifted to the postoperative ward for clinical monitoring of vital signs, appropriate fluid therapy and another treatment.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Following parameters were assessed</title><p>Height of sensory block (using loss of sensation to cold with an alcohol swab on each side of mid-axillary line) - measured every 5 min for the first 30 min and then at 15-min interval till the end of surgery and hourly thereafter till rescue analgesic was required. Duration of sensory block was calculated with two dermatome regression from peak block height for each patient.</p><p>Motor block was assessed using a 6-point-modified Bromage scale.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] These measurements were performed at 5, 10, and 15-min after intrathecal injection and then every 15-min after surgery until motor blockade regressed to sacral dermatome. Duration of motor block was calculated till modified Bromage score reached six for each patient.</p><p>Intraoperative HR and blood pressure were measured every 5 min for the first 30 min and then at 10 min interval till the end of surgery and hourly thereafter till rescue analgesics are required.</p><p>Duration of analgesia &#x02014; defined from the time of institution of a successful intrathecal block to the time of request for first rescue analgesia or VAS pain score more than 40 whichever was earlier was also assessed.</p><p>Side effects such as nausea and vomiting, pruritus, and respiratory depression were observed and managed accordingly in the intraoperative period and in the postoperative period till the requirement of rescue analgesic.</p><p>Rescue analgesia was administered postoperatively when VAS score was &#x0003e;40 or when patient requested for analgesia with diclofenac sodium1 mg/kg bodyweight intramuscularly. The primary endpoint of the study was when the patients requested for first rescue analgesia or VAS &#x0003e;40 whichever was earlier.</p><p>Sample size estimation was done using PS Power and Sample Size Calculation software (version 3.0, 2009, Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN). Based on clinical experience and review of literature, it was seen that 1 h difference in mean duration of analgesia between the two groups can be considered, being clinically significant. Within group, standard deviation was assumed to be 1.5 h. Using these data and assuming a study power of 80% and a 5% probability of type I error, a sample size of 74 patients was found to be required for this study. So, a total of 74 patients (<italic>n</italic> = 74) were incorporated in the study, who were distributed randomly into two equal study groups (<italic>n</italic> = 37).</p><p>All raw data of study parameters were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using SPSS software (SPSS version 22.0, Chicago, IL, USA). Results were summarized by descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation for numerical variables that are normally distributed and median and interquartile range for those that are skewed. Numerical variables were compared between groups by independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test if normally distributed and by Mann-Whitney U-test if skewed. Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare the frequency of adverse events and other categorical variables between groups.

Duration of postoperative analgesia is also higher with bupivacaine and patients who received bupivacaine experienced significantly less pain in 1<sup>st</sup> 3 h of postoperative period. However, peak height of sensory block and time to reach peak block height were similar to isobaric ropivacaine and bupivacaine.</p><p>As ropivacaine is less lipophilic than bupivacaine causes relatively less motor blockade.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Ropivacaine has a greater degree of motor sensory differentiation, which may be desirable especially in day care surgery.</p><p>Mantouvalou <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Ogun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] found a similar cephalad extent of sensory block after isobaric bupivacaine or ropivacaine subarachnoid anesthesia. Marret <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] who compared equal doses (10 mg) of isobaric bupivacaine with the isobaric ropivacaine also found a similar range of block height. But Malinovsky <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] found a lower cephalad extent (median dermatome level T9) of anesthesia associated with less intense anesthetic blockade in the ropivacaine group, resulting in requirement of supplemental analgesia to perform surgery. This difference can be explained by use of fentanyl as adjuvant in our study which improves the quality of the block as well as the increased drug volume could have led to a higher cephalad extent of the local anesthetic solution.</p><p>In our study, we did not found any incidence of bradycardia in any patient. Though McNamee <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in their study found 2 patients among 32 in the ropivacaine group to have bradycardia and required atropine to treat the same; they had used a higher dose of ropivacaine that is, 3.5 ml 0.5%, total of 17.5 mg. The result of our study is comparable with a study done by Koltka <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] 2009, who also did not found statistically significant difference in HR and arterial blood pressure in their study. Though McNamee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found intraoperative hypotension requiring treatment with ephedrine in 12% patients in ropivacaine group and 26% patients in bupivacaine group, they had used a continuous intravenous infusion of 1% propofol after giving spinal anesthesia. They also later attributed the hypotension was due to propofol infusion rather than the institution of spinal anesthesia as the incidence of hypotension started only after starting the propofol infusion.</p><p>The two dermatome regression time of sensory block in our study was significantly higher in patients who received bupivacaine. McNamee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] didn&#x02019;t measure the two dermatome regression time, but the duration of sensory block at dermatome level T10, which was significantly higher in the bupivacaine group (median 3.5 h vs. 3 h). Malinovsky <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] also found that time for two segments regression to be higher in bupivacaine when pinprick was used to measure it, but it was similar when cold swab was used for sensory block assessment.</p><p>We noted a significantly higher time to request first rescue analgesic in patients received bupivacaine and up to 1<sup>st</sup> 3 h postoperatively, VAS score was significantly lower in bupivacaine group than ropivacaine group, suggesting that the patients who received bupivacaine-fentanyl combination experienced much lower pain for a prolonged period of time than ropivacaine-fentanyl combination.</p><p>Our findings regarding duration of analgesia and study of postoperative VAS score between these two groups in this study qualitatively correlate well with the study done by Mantouvalou <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] who found that the duration of sensory analgesia was significantly shorter in the ropivacaine group. Similar finding was reported by McNamee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] also. They noticed that the median time to first analgesic request was significantly shorter in the ropivacaine group than in the bupivacaine group. However, median time to first analgesic request is higher in our study than what reported by McNamee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] probably because of fentanyl used in our study. There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative nausea vomiting between the two groups.
