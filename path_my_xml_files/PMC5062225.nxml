Little or no prior knowledge of anesthesia techniques can increase this significantly. Patients awaiting surgery may experience high level of anxiety. Preoperative visit is an ideal time to educate patients about anesthesia and address these fears. The present study evaluates two different approaches, i.e., standard interview versus informative audiovisual presentation with standard interview on information gain (IG) and its impact on patient anxiety during preoperative visit.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Settings and Design:</title><p>This prospective, double-blind, randomized study was conducted in a Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital in rural India over 2 months.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This prospective, double-blind, randomized study was carried out among 200 American Society of Anesthesiologist Grade I and II patients in the age group 18&#x02013;65 years scheduled to undergo elective surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were allocated to either one of the two equal-sized groups, Group A and Group B. Baseline anxiety and information desire component was assessed using Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale for both the groups. Group A patients received preanesthetic interview with the anesthesiologist and were reassessed. Group B patients were shown a short audiovisual presentation about operation theater and anesthesia procedure followed by preanesthetic interview and were also reassessed. In addition, patient satisfaction score (PSS) and IG was assessed at the end of preanesthetic visit using standard questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Statistical Analysis Used:</title><p>Data were expressed as mean and standard deviation.

Exclusion criteria included prior exposure to any anesthesia technique, patients having psychiatric disorders, patients not well oriented to time, place, and person, patients having significant medical background (e.g., doctors/medical interns/staff nurses and medical technicians aware of operative environment), and ASA Grade &#x0003e;II.</p><p>Patients were allocated to one of the two equal-sized groups through computer-generated randomization. Due to nature of the intervention, participants could not be blinded to the study group intervention. To counteract this potential, it was ensured that the resident doctor collecting the forms or making patients record was unaware to which group patient was allocated and was not the same who had delivered the preoperative information to the patient. During analysis, the observer was blinded to the study group allocations. Blinding was opened at the end of the study.</p><p>Patient anxiety and information desire were assessed using 6-item, Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>A departmental-approved audiovisual presentation was prepared in the common vernacular of our region (Punjabi) showing OT environment, general anesthesia techniques, and common equipment.

In such time-restrained situations, patient's fears regarding anesthesia and surgical outcome may not be properly addressed. Patient education often suffers. A short informative audiovisual presentation can help improve this.</p><p>Anxiety is the normal human response particularly when people are facing a serious life-threatening situation. Patient awaiting surgery may experience different levels of anxiety. Incidence of perioperative anxiety in adults may vary from 11% to 80%.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Lack of knowledge is a known contributor to patient anxiety.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Although anxiolytic drugs help in relieving anxiety, they carry their own limitations and disadvantages. Various distraction and relaxation techniques, i.e., yoga, therapeutic massage, or music, have been used to reduce anxiety with variable outcome.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Information can be an important tool in reducing patients anxiety and improving their hospitalization experience.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Video presentations are high-impact tools for providing information. Visuals cause a faster and stronger reaction than words. They help users engage with the content and such emotional reactions influence information retention. Visual memory is far superior to verbal memory and can persist for a longer time.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Previous studies have shown reductions in anxiety scores when using video or broacher as information tool during preoperative visit.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>This study is an attempt to evaluate the usefulness of informative audiovisual presentation and its impact on patient education and anxiety.</p><p>This study was carried out in 200 patients to assess IDC, anxiety, IG and PSS. It was hypothesized that video presentation would result in more informed and less anxious patients, thus increasing patient satisfaction, which was proven to be true in this study.

Pertaining to these questions, Group B was better informed. Question 4, about perception of pain showed worst results in both groups (44% in Group A and 70% in Group B). Pain is an important and difficult topic for patients to understand and needs to be addressed specifically and separately.</p><p>A study by Done and Lee[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] revealed similar results when they used a video to convey preanesthetic information to patient undergoing ambulatory surgery and by Snyder-Ramos <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in their study comparing patient satisfaction and IG using face-to-face interviews, brochure, and video during preanesthetic visit.</p><p>Our results correlate well with Done and Lee and Snyder-Ramos <italic>et al</italic>. Audiovisual presentation is a better information tool than interview alone. It results in much higher IG. Patients shown an informative audiovisual presentation before surgery have lesser anxiety. A better informed patient has a significantly higher satisfaction score. Audiovisual presentation helps in preparing patients better for their hospital experience and significantly adds to patient comfort.</p><p>Although this study highlights the benefits of audiovisual presentation, it has a few limitations. This study included only ASA Grade I and II patients in a relatively rural population. Patient socioeconomic status, education level, cultural and language diversities can influence the outcomes. Patient's diagnosis, type of surgery, duration of surgery and expected surgical outcomes can all affect the patients&#x02019; anxiety levels. Video was made as per se emed necessary from the prospective of anesthesiologist (IG required) but not as per the actual needs or queries of the patients. A further study can be conducted taking into consideration patient queries as a basis. With the consensus of society, a standard video addressing the needs of both patients and anesthesiologist can be framed and made readily available to the general public and its impact can be assessed on a larger population base. Information about pain is often misinterpreted and needs to be addressed separately.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>A better IG results in a lesser desire for further information which results in reduced anxiety.
