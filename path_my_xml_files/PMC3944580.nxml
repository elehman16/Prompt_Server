The purpose of this study was to investigate the response of appetite-regulating hormones to exercise. Nine overweight women undertook two 2 h trials in a randomized crossover design. In the exercise trial, subjects ran for 60 min at 50% of maximal oxygen uptake followed by a 60 min rest period. In the control trial, subjects rested for 2 h. Obestatin, acyl ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin and leptin concentrations were measured at baseline and at 20, 40, 60, 90 and 120 min after baseline. A two-way ANOVA revealed a significant (P &#x0003c; 0.05) interaction effect for leptin and acyl ghrelin. However, changes in obestatin and des-acyl ghrelin concentration were statistically insignificant (P &#x0003e; 0.05). The data indicated that although acute treadmill exercise resulted in a significant change in acyl ghrelin and leptin levels, it had no effect on plasma obestatin and des-acyl ghrelin levels.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>obestatin</kwd><kwd>acyl ghrelin</kwd><kwd>des-acyl ghrelin</kwd><kwd>leptin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The incidence of obesity is increasing rapidly in developed and certain developing countries. Obesity is related to several serious chronic diseases including diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease and cancer. Physical activity and diet are the two most important modifiable behaviours to regulate body weight and to prevent and/or reduce obesity. Body weight regulation is a complex process, involving various systems. While the mechanism by which physical activity may counteract obesity is well known, modifying the energetic balance by increasing energy expenditure, the mechanisms behind regulation of appetite and food intake are poorly understood. However, over the past decade, our knowledge of how homeostatic systems regulate food intake and body weight has increased with the discovery of circulating peptides such as leptin, ghrelin and obestatin. These hormones regulate the appetite and food intake by sending signals to the brain regarding the body's nutritional status [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The discovery of leptin has improved our understanding of the relationship between adipose tissue and energy homeostasis. Leptin is synthesized and secreted by adipocytes, and informs the brain about the status of energy stores present in adipose tissue [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. At present, much attention has been focused on gut hormones, which are generated in the gastrointestinal tract and integrated in the brain to regulate appetite and energy balance. Ghrelin, a 28 amino acid acyl peptide, was isolated from the human and rat stomach as the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone (GH) secretagogue receptor type 1-a (GHS-R1a) [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Ghrelin has two forms in the circulation: acyl and des-acyl ghrelin [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In addition to ghrelin, obestatin is a newly discovered hormone that originates from the preproghrelin gene, and results from post-translational processing of amino acids 76&#x02013;98 of the preproghrelin peptide [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Obestatin is mainly produced in the stomach and other organs in the gastro-intestinal tract and has a variety of functions. Studies indicate that obestatin, an anti-hunger peptide, plays an important role in energy balance and body weight [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While ghrelin and obestatin have the same gene structure, their effects on food intake and appetite are opposite [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Ghrelin stimulates appetite and gastric motility whereas obestatin has been reported to reduce appetite, food intake and gut motility in rats [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although the mechanisms by which obestatin carries out its actions are not clearly known, there is evidence that it may modulate ghrelin's effect [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Exercise is an essential part of any weight management programme. Physical activity improves the health status of obese individuals and helps to reduce body weight. It is possible that obestatin, ghrelin forms and leptin may provide a better understanding of how physical activity contributes to weight management and health improvements</p><p>Several studies have investigated the acute effects of exercise on appetite-regulating hormones in women [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and the majority of these studies have focused on ghrelin and leptin. Currently, little is known about the influence of acute exercise on appetite-regulating hormones in overweight women. Therefore the objective of this study was to investigate obestatin, acyl-ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin and leptin levels and their relation with each other during and after acute exercise in overweight women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Subjects</title><p>Nine overweight/obese women participated voluntarily in the study and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before participation. All women were between the ages of 20 and 24 and had a BMI between 26.5 and 32.4 kg &#x000b7; m<sup>-2</sup>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref> summarizes descriptive statistics for the subjects. Participants completed a health screen and a physical activity questionnaire. Subjects were excluded from participation in the study if they had a history of a chronic disease, uncontrolled hypertension or taking blood pressure medication, any condition that would alter one's metabolism or ability to exercise, diagnosed psychological disorders, recent weight loss of greater than 5 kg, irregular menstrual cycles (&#x0003c;25 days or &#x0003e;35 days between cycles), or low levels of sleep (&#x0003c;6 h &#x000b7; night<sup>-1</sup>). Participants had regularly occurring menstrual cycles, and were considered &#x0201c;low exercise risk&#x0201d; as per the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines. The study was approved by the ethical board of the Abant &#x00130;zzet Baysal University School of Medicine Clinical Laboratory Research, Bolu, Turkey, and Lehman College, The City University of New York, NY, USA, and it was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="S20004"><title>Specific procedures</title><p>
<italic>Dietary protocol</italic>: Participants were asked to maintain their normal dietary and physical activity programmes throughout the duration of the study. Subjects refrained from physical exercise, alcohol and caffeine for 24 h before testing. Because energy balance and macronutrient intake can influence appetite-regulating hormones, it was important to provide the same diet during the 24 h before each testing day. Throughout the day before the first main trial, participants&#x02019; weight and food intake were recorded. Participants then replicated this food intake during the day before the second main trial. Participants were also provided with a standardized evening meal and asked to eat it at around 8:00 pm on the day preceding each of the study days. Dietary intake was analysed by using diet analysis software (Diet Analysis Plus<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>, Version 4.0, ESHA Research, Salem, OR).</p><p>

Immediately after collecting blood samples, the sample tubes were centrifuged at 1500 g for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C for hormones (obestatin, acylated ghrelin and des-acylated ghrelin). The obtained plasma samples were mixed with 1 mol &#x000b7; L<sup>-1</sup> HCl (hydrochloric acid) at a ratio of 1/10 and were stored at &#x02013;70&#x000b0;C until assayed. Blood samples for leptin were drawn into red cap tubes and centrifuged after completion of clot formation, and the serum samples were stored at &#x02013;70&#x000b0;C until the day of the hormone measurements. Serum leptin concentration was measured using a commercial sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA-2395; DRG Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany) with a limit of detection of 1.0 ng &#x000b7; ml<sup>-1</sup>. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 11.6% and 6%, respectively.

Repeated-measures, two-factor ANOVA was used to examine differences between the two trials over time for obestatin, acylated ghrelin, des-acylated ghrelin, leptin and plasma volume change. Between-trial differences at each time point were examined using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc tests when significant interactions were found.

The results of the present study indicated that acute treadmill exercise at moderate intensity did not change plasma obestatin and des-acyl ghrelin concentrations. However, a significant decrease in plasma acylated ghrelin and leptin was observed after exercise and there were no correlations between variables over the exercise trial.</p><p>To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, the present study is the first study to examine obestatin levels after acute moderate intensity exercise in overweight women. There are a limited number of studies that have investigated the effects of exercise on obestatin; some of these studies were not properly designed and some were conducted on animals. These studies have observed decreases [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], increases [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or no alterations [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in obestatin concentration following exercise. In the present study, acute moderate intensity aerobic exercise had no effect on plasma obestatin level. In agreement with our findings, obestatin was not altered by single circuit-resistance exercise, or by acute aerobic and anaerobic exercise in women [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Ghanbari et al. [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found that acute resistance exercise with different intensities (40%, 60% and 80% of one maximum repetition) had no effect on plasma obestatin level. Ebrahimnia et al. [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] also reported that single circuit-resistance exercise and single aerobic exercise (70% <inline-formula id="IFD9"><mml:math id="ILM9"><mml:mover><mml:mtext>V</mml:mtext><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>O<sub>2max</sub>) had no impact on obestatin level. Manshouri et al. [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] investigated the response of obestatin levels to short-term anaerobic interval exercise training. The results showed that short-term anaerobic exercise had no effect on plasma obestatin levels. However, plasma obestatin level was decreased after 4 weeks of circuit resistance training (80% of one repetition maximum) [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and weight reduction due to a long-term lifestyle intervention in obese children [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Meanwhile, other studies reported an increase in response to lifestyle intervention [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and after long duration, high volume training in male rats [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Zuo et al. [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reported that a camp that included 3 h of aerobic exercise every day resulted in higher plasma ghrelin and obestatin concentrations after weight reduction. The inconsistent findings may be due to the intensity, duration and type of exercise employed and/or the sex of the subjects.</p><p>Leptin and ghrelin are two hormones that have been recognized to have a major influence on energy balance [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These hormones regulate appetite and food intake by sending signals to the brain regarding the body's nutritional status. Leptin is a mediator of longterm regulation of energy balance, suppressing food intake. On the other hand, ghrelin is a fast acting hormone, seemingly playing a role in meal initiation [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Whether ghrelin has an influence on circulating leptin levels has not yet been demonstrated [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, exercise resulted in a decrease of serum leptin. Most of the current studies elaborating on the effects of exercise on leptin support this finding [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The mechanisms explaining the factors relating to leptin during exercise are not well understood. The reduction of leptin has been attributed to alteration in energy balance, improvements in insulin sensitivity and alteration in lipid metabolism and lipid concentration [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The effects of exercise on acylated ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin are fairly controversial and depend on the intensity and duration of exercise [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We here report a significant reduction of plasma acylated ghrelin level but not des-acyl ghrelin during acute exercise. The decrease in acylated ghrelin during exercise in our subjects is in agreement with previous research [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but des-acyl ghrelin concentrations were not examined in these studies.</p><p>At present, the cause of the decrease in acylated ghrelin during acute moderate exercise is still unclear. Reduced acylated ghrelin concentration after acute moderate intensity exercise might be due to increased sympathetic nervous system activity and gastric mucosal ischaemia resulting from redistribution of blood flow from the splanchnic circulation towards the skeletal muscles during exercise [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. There is also some evidence that ghrelin levels are suppressed following resistance exercise of moderate intensity and are lower with higher GH concentrations during aerobic exercise. It has been suggested that negative feedback from elevated GH causes the reductions [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, Shiiya et al. [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported that acute moderate exercise decreased acylated ghrelin level. They also suggested that this was likely mediated by elevated sympathetic tone, but unrelated to alteration of GH secretion upon exercise. However, GH secretion and plasma catecholamines were not measured in the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0014"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study demonstrates that acute moderate intensity exercise significantly reduces acylated ghrelin and leptin levels but has no effect on des-acyl ghrelin and obestatin levels in overweight women. The present findings of decreased ghrelin concentrations and stable obestatin concentrations after acute treadmill exercise at moderate intensity in overweight women may be important for weight loss and weight maintenance. Further well-controlled research is required to determine the influence of exercise on appetite-regulating hormones in different intensities and duration of exercise in different subject groups. Such research could have important implications regarding the role of exercise in weight management.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was mainly supported and funded by the Scientific Research Projects Unit (2010.08.03.374) of the University of Abant Izzet Baysal and partly supported by a PSC-CUNY research award 42 grant of the City University of New York, NY, USA.
