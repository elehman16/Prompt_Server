The median survival of those receiving tamoxifen was longer than either of the other two groups (5.25 compared to 4.25 and 3 months, respectively) but this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Cox regression analysis of 12 clinical and biochemical features showed that, for the entire group of patients, survival was significantly longer in younger patients, those undergoing surgical bypass and those with better initial performance status. However, even when adjustment was made to allow for the distribution of these prognostic variables within the three groups, the difference in survival still did not achieve statistical significance. No side-effects attributable to treatment was observed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00121-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="789" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00121-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="790" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00121-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="791" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00121-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="792" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
