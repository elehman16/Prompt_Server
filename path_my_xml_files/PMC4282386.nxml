Patients are randomized to receive alirocumab 75 mg via a single, subcutaneous, 1-mL injection by prefilled pen every 2 weeks (Q2W) as add-on therapy to atorvastatin (20&#x02013;40 mg) or rosuvastatin (10&#x02013;20 mg); or to receive ezetimibe 10 mg/d as add-on therapy to statin; or to receive statin up-titration; or to switch from atorvastatin to rosuvastatin (OPTIONS I only). At week 12, based on week 8 LDL-C levels, the alirocumab dose may be increased from 75 mg to 150 mg Q2W if LDL-C levels remain &#x02265;100 mg/dL or &#x02265;70 mg/dL in patients with high or very high CV risk, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies is difference in percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to week 24 in the alirocumab vs control arms. The studies may provide guidance to inform clinical decision-making when patients with CV risk require additional lipid-lowering therapy to further reduce LDL-C levels. The flexibility of the alirocumab dosing regimen allows for individualized therapy based on the degree of LDL-C reduction required to achieve the desired LDL-C level.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Statins are first-line therapy for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Several international guidelines recommend high-risk and very high-risk patients achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels &#x0003c;100 mg/dL and &#x0003c;70 mg/dL, respectively.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, many patients fail to reach expected or recommended LDL-C levels on statin therapy.

For patients with heFH, the diagnosis must have been made either by genotyping or clinical criteria. For those patients not genotyped, the clinical criteria were based on either the Simon Broome criteria with criteria for definite heFH<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> or the World Health Organization/Dutch Lipid Network criteria with a score of &#x0003e;8 points.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion Criteria</title><p>The key exclusion criteria were age &#x0003c;18 years; fasting serum TG &#x0003e;400 mg/dL (&#x0003e;4.52 mmol/L) during the screening period; patients receiving a statin that was not atorvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg daily (OPTIONS I) or not rosuvastatin 10 mg or 20 mg daily (OPTIONS II); patients receiving ezetimibe within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit; and uncontrolled endocrine disease known to influence serum lipids (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>; for a full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria, see Supporting Information, Supplementary Methods, in the online version of this article).</p></sec><sec><title>Study Procedures</title><p>Both studies consisted of 3 periods: a 2-week to 6-week screening period, a 24-week double-blind treatment period, and an 8-week follow-up period. The screening period included an intermediate visit during which the patient or caregiver was trained to self-inject/inject. Patients on a stable atorvastatin (OPTIONS I) or rosuvastatin (OPTIONS II) dose for &#x02265;4 weeks before the screening visit 1 were screened for study eligibility. During screening and at the discretion of the investigator, patients not on a stable dose of atorvastatin (20 mg or 40 mg; OPTIONS I) or rosuvastatin (10 mg or 20 mg; OPTIONS II) for 4 weeks; patients being switched to atorvastatin (OPTIONS I) or rosuvastatin (OPTIONS II); or patients not on a statin but who should have been, according to local guidance, received open-label atorvastatin (20 mg or 40 mg; OPTIONS I) or rosuvastatin (10 mg or 20 mg; OPTIONS II) for a 4-week run-in period between the prescreening visit 1a (day &#x02212;42) and visit 1. The run-in dose of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin was based on the judgment of the study physician.</p><p>At randomization, treatment kit numbers were allocated using a centralized treatment allocation system, either an interactive voice-response system or an interactive Web-response system, depending on the site preference. Study patients, principal investigators, and study-site personnel were blinded to all randomization assignments throughout the duration of the study. All lipid and antidrug antibody results collected after randomization were masked.</p><p>Each eligible patient received a single, subcutaneous, 1-mL injection by prefilled pen every 2 weeks (Q2W) (aliro-cumab or placebo-alirocumab) and 2 oral-blinded medications daily (a statin [atorvastatin or rosuvastatin] and ezetimibe or placebo-ezetimibe). The first injection of alirocumab or placebo-alirocumab was administered at the clinical site (week 0), after study assessments were completed, and as soon as possible after the patient was randomized into the study. The patient/caregiver administered subsequent autoinjections outside of the clinic, at a patient-preferred location, on weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.</p><p>At week 12, based on their week 8 LDL-C level and baseline CV risk, patients randomized to alirocumab may, in a blinded manner, have had their dose increased from 75 mg Q2W to 150 mg Q2W. To maintain blinding, lipid values obtained at week 8 for the purpose of up-titration occurred in an automated process and were not communicated to investigators or patients. Patients with baseline LDL-C levels &#x02265;70 mg/dL and documented CVD continued to receive alirocumab 75 mg Q2W if their week 8 LDL-C level was &#x0003c;70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L); otherwise, they were dose up-titrated to receive alirocumab 150 mg Q2W (also via a 1-mL autoinjection) if their week 8 LDL-C level was &#x02265;70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L). Patients with baseline LDL-C levels &#x02265;100 mg/dL without documented CVD continued to receive alirocumab 75 mg Q2W if their week 8 LDL-C level was &#x0003c;100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L); otherwise, they were dose up-titrated to alirocumab 150 mg Q2W if their week 8 LDL-C level was &#x02265;100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L). Autoinjections continued to be administered at weeks 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22; the last dose of daily oral study drugs was adminis-tered at week 24.</p><p>So as not to interfere with the study drug or serum lipids, the following concomitant LLTs were prohibited from the initial screening visit until the end of the study visit: statins other than atorvastatin and rosuvastatin (provided as blinded medications), ezetimibe (other than that provided as blinded medication), fibrates other than fenofibrate, and red yeast rice products. Lipid-lowering therapies that were allowed as background therapy throughout the study included fish oils with omega-3 fatty acids, fenofibrate, bile acid-binding sequestrants, and niacin. Doses of these medications were stable for &#x02265;4 weeks before screening (&#x02265;6 weeks for fenofibrate) and were to remain stable for the duration of the study.</p><p>Throughout the studies, patients were asked to follow a stable, National Cholesterol Education Program&#x02013;Adult Treatment Panel III Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (NCEP-ATP III TLC) diet or equivalent diet from screening to the end-of-study visit. At the end of the 24-week treatment period, patients entered an 8-week follow-up period.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Design and Analysis</title><p>The planned patient populations were 350 and 300 for OPTIONS I and OPTIONS II, respectively. For efficacy comparisons, it was estimated that a total sample size of 50 patients (OPTIONS I) or 47 patients (OPTIONS II) per arm would have 90% power to detect a difference in means of &#x02265;20% in any one pairwise comparison (ie, alirocumab mean = 50% and control mean = 30%), assuming that the common standard deviation (SD) is 25 and that all 50 or 47 patients, respectively, are evaluable (for full statistical methods, see Supporting Information, Supplementary Methods, in the online version of this article).</p><p>In both OPTIONS I and II, the primary efficacy analysis population is the intent-to-treat population comprising all randomized patients with &#x02265;1 baseline calculated LDL-C value available and &#x02265;1 calculated LDL-C value available at one of the planned time points from weeks 4 and 24, regardless of treatment adherence.</p><p>The percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to week 24 will be analyzed using a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach to account for missing data (see Supporting Information, Supplementary Methods, in the online version of this article).<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Treatment differences between alirocumab-treated patients and patients treated with active comparators will be estimated and tested through pairwise comparisons within each baseline statin regimen (see Supporting Information, Supplementary Methods, in the online version of this article). Secondary endpoints will be tested with a similar approach (see Supporting Information, Supplementary Methods, in the online version of this article).</p><p>Safety events will be reported using descriptive statistics, based on the safety population (all randomized patients who received &#x02265;1 dose or partial dose of study treatment). The safety analysis will focus on the TEAE period, defined as the time from the first double-blind dose to 70 days after the last double-blind dose of the investigational drug.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Three hundred and fifty-five patients were randomized into OPTIONS I, and 305 patients were randomized into OPTIONS II.

The studies are designed to answer practical questions facing the clinician: Which clinical strategy provides the best combination of LDL-C&#x02013;lowering efficacy and safety/tolerability? Add alirocumab? Increase the statin dose or switch to another statin, or add ezetimibe? The study design also provides flexibility in the alirocumab dosing regimen, which in turn allows for individualized therapy based on the degree of LDL-C reduction required to achieve the desired treatment response.</p><p>Whether additional LDL-C lowering in patients optimally treated with statins will further reduce CV events is under evaluation in ongoing trials of ezetimibe as well as a number of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies. The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial is evaluating alirocumab in patients with acute coronary syndromes.</p><p>In conclusion, the ODYSSEY OPTIONS studies aim to provide further data regarding the efficacy of alirocumab to reduce LDL-C levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia at high CV risk, in particular those patients who are not achieving specific LDL-C levels with the most commonly used atorvastatin or rosuvastatin doses. This trial will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab in a larger patient population over 24 weeks.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the study investigators and committee members (see Supporting Information, Investigators, Steering Committee, and Data Committee Acknowledgments in the online version of this article).
