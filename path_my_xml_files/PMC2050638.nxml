The lecture was designed following a work-place inspection, to assess the most likely risk factors for injury. The lecture also included advice on posture, normal biomechanics and alternative strategies to improve spinal health.</p><p><italic>Subjects:</italic> Volunteer subjects, all from the same company, were randomly assigned to a study group (n = 34) and a control group (n = 27). The remaining employees (n = 60) formed a non intervention (baseline) comparison group.</p><p><italic>Main Outcome Measures:</italic> The number and severity of injuries for all groups was monitored over a six month period prior to and following the lecture. In addition, Oswestry pain and disability questionnaires were collected prior to the lecture and at the six month follow up period.</p><p><italic>Results:</italic> The average cost of injuries went from $451 in the six months prior to training down to $194 in the first three months and then to $269 at six months after training. In comparison, the corresponding control group figures were $396, $409 and $382, respectively.</p><p><italic>Discussion:</italic> The cost of reported back injuries decreased by 57% in the first three months for the educated group when compared to pre-intervention levels. At the six month follow up the cost of back injuries remained 40% lower than previous levels.</p><p><italic>Conclusion:</italic> The results from our study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction (p&#x0003c; .05) in the cost of back injuries and Oswestry pain scores, following an employee training program conducted by a chiropractor.
