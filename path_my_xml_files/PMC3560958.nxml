Despite the proven efficacy of oral rehydration therapy, it still remains underused [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The main reason is that oral rehydration therapy neither reduces the frequency of bowel movements and fluid loss nor shortens the duration of illness, which decreases its acceptance. Effective and inexpensive interventions that could add to the effect of oral rehydration therapy are of interest to caregivers and health care professionals.</p><p>The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the European Society of Paediatric Infectious Diseases (ESPID) recommend that select probiotics with proven clinical efficacy [e.g., <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> GG (LGG) or <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic>], administered in appropriate dosages, may be used as an adjunct to rehydration therapy for the management of AGE in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The plausible mechanisms by which they may exert their effects include activation of direct inhibitors called bacteriocins, reduction of the luminal pH through short chain fatty acid production (which also inhibits some pathogens), competition for nutrients, and immunomodulatory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Also, according to ESPGHAN/ESPID guidelines, smectite (also known as diosmectite, dioctahedral smectite), a natural hydrated aluminum magnesium silicate that binds to digestive mucous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and has the ability to bind endo- and exotoxins, bacteria, and rotavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], may be considered in the management of AGE. In experimental models, smectite increased water and electrolyte absorption and restored the barrier properties of human intestinal cell monolayers after exposure to tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It also modified the activity of bile salts and the physical properties of gastric mucus, thereby counteracting mucolysis induced by bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In countries where both LGG and smectite are available, their concomitant administration is often practiced with the intention of further reducing the length and severity of illness. However, there is uncertainty about the benefits of concomitant administration of LGG and smectite, while obviously it increases the cost of treatment. The present study was designed to determine whether LGG plus smectite is superior to LGG alone for the management of children with AGE.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The guidelines from the CONSORT statement were followed for this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Children aged 4 to 60&#x000a0;months with AGE, defined as the passage of three or more loose or watery stools per day for &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;day but &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;days, were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included diarrhea lasting &#x0003c;1 or &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;days, a recent history of diarrhea indicated either by parents/guardian or hospital case notes, underlying chronic gastrointestinal disease, undernutrition (weight/height ratio below the 5th percentile), systemic infection, and immune defects or immunosuppressive treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention</title><p>If a diagnosis of AGE was made, the child was assessed for eligibility and written informed consent was obtained. All patients were initially rehydrated according to the ESPGHAN and WHO recommendation (oral rehydration or, if not successful, intravenous rehydration). Regular feeding was not interrupted and was carried out after initial rehydration. At all times, breastfeeding was allowed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Eligible children received LGG (ATCC 53103) (commercially available as Dicoflor 30, Vitis Pharma, Poland) at a daily dosage of 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup> colony forming units (CFU) in one dose for 7&#x000a0;days plus randomly either smectite (commercially available as Smecta, Beaufour, Ipsen, France) or placebo (glucose). Both smectite and the placebo were administered as an oral dose of 3&#x000a0;g, once daily, until the diarrhea stopped. LGG was supplied as a powder in capsules that were opened with the contents administered in a small amount of water. The placebo and smectite were both supplied as a powder and also given in a small amount of water. While the children were in the hospital, the study products were administered by hospital staff. If a child was discharged, the study products were administered by a parent/caregiver following instructions regarding each product&#x02019;s intake. In both situations, a 3-h interval between the administration of LGG and the other study products was recommended. For each child, a diary was kept to record the frequency and consistency of daily bowel movements, as well as other symptoms considered to be important or needed for analysis. The study physician assessed the patient&#x02019;s diary during the follow-up visit on day 7. If a child was discharged during the study period, one of the investigators regularly contacted the family by phone to ensure adherence.</p><p>In all children, at the study entry, stool samples were collected for microbiological investigations.

There were no significant differences between the study groups for the secondary outcomes, with three exceptions. In the LGG/placebo group compared to the LGG/smectite group, there was significantly reduced stool frequency but only on day 4. While there was a difference between groups in stool consistency, it was not of clinical relevance; this is because stools with scores of 3, 4, and 5 on the Bristol Stool Form Scale are referred to as stools of normal consistency. If unscheduled intravenous rehydration was needed, there was a significantly shorter duration of intravenous therapy in the LGG/smectite group compared with the LGG alone group.</p><p>Several factors could explain why the addition of smectite to LGG did not provide any additional benefit over treatment with LGG alone. The first factor is the mechanism of action of smectite, including the absorption of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While theoretically smectite is directed towards pathogenic bacteria, one may not exclude the possibility that it also is directed towards potentially beneficial bacteria such as LGG. However, in our trial, this explanation seems less likely, as efforts were made to administer LGG and the other study products in at least 3-h intervals. A second factor that may explain the lack of an additional benefit with smectite is that it may not have been administered at a sufficient dosage. We chose a daily dose of 3&#x000a0;g, as recommended by the manufacturer for children up to 1&#x000a0;year of age. In previous studies, the daily dose typically ranged from 3 to 6&#x000a0;g (depending on the age of the children) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; however, no clear dose&#x02013;effect response has been described. Considering that the mean age of our patients included in the final analysis was 18.5&#x000a0;months, the dose of 3&#x000a0;g seems sufficient. For LGG, we chose a daily intake of 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>&#x02009;CFU, which exceeds the minimum dose of 10<sup>9</sup>&#x02009;CFU/day suggested in the literature for therapeutic purposes. It is noteworthy, however, that the optimal dose and treatment duration of LGG therapy have not been clearly established.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess concomitant administration of LGG with smectite. One previously published randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared administration of a mixture of three probiotic strains, i.e., <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> strains E&#x02044;N, Oxy, and Pen (commercially available as Lakcid, Biomed, Poland), plus smectite with the administration of probiotics alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This study was carried out in 107 Polish children aged 6 to 36&#x000a0;months with AGE. The authors reported that in the probiotic/smectite group compared with the probiotic alone group, there was a significantly shorter duration of fluid stools, shorter duration of intravenous rehydration, shorter duration of hospitalization, shorter duration of fever &#x0003e;38 &#x000b0;C, and greater weight gain. However, there are some methodological limitations to the study, including unclear allocation concealment, no blinding, and no intention-to-treat analysis; this may result in selection, performance, and/or attrition biases and, eventually, invalidate the results.</p><p>Conversely, the efficacy of LGG and smectite administered separately has been studied in a number of RCTs and their meta-analyses. For LGG, one meta-analysis of eight RCTs, involving 988 participants, found that compared with controls, administration of LGG had no effect on the total stool volume. However, use of LGG was associated with a significant reduction in diarrhea duration, particularly that of rotaviral etiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A positive effect of using LGG for treating acute diarrhea was also confirmed in a more recent Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>For smectite, one meta-analysis of data from six RCTs showed that smectite significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea compared with placebo. The chance of cure on intervention day 3 was significantly increased in the smectite versus the control group, with a number needed to treat of 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Two subsequently performed, large, double-blind RCTs performed in Peru and Malaysia confirmed a reduction in diarrhea duration and also indicated a stool output reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The most recent open RCT carried out in India also found that smectite reduced the duration of diarrhea and prevented a prolonged course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>The strengths of this study include adequate randomization and the use of intention-to-treat analysis, both of which minimize the risk of bias. Although there was a comprehensive (92&#x000a0;%) follow-up, there were non-significantly more patients lost to follow-up in the LGG/placebo group compared with the LGG/smectite group (7 versus 0). As parents did not report the reasons for refusal to continue, there is no clear explanation for this finding.</p><p>Participants in this study were young children only who typically develop AGE, so the results are applicable to clinical practice. On the other hand, our results apply primarily to hospitalized children. In principle, the efficacy of the treatment may be different for various subgroups (e.g., inpatients compared with outpatients). Those admitted to the hospital may be more severely affected, later in the course of the disease, or may be more dehydrated, and thus, respond differently to treatment. Evaluation within these subgroups is warranted.</p><p>A potential limitation of our study is the lack of perfect blinding. As stated earlier, patients received smectite or placebo in small, identical packages from the hospital pharmacy. Both were white powders. However, after being dissolved in water, they were of different colors that potentially could have been an issue if the parent/caregiver had had previous experience with smectite.</p><p>To access stool consistency, we used the Bristol Stool Form Scale, which has not been validated for the youngest children. While this study was in the final planning stage, the &#x0201c;Amsterdam&#x0201d; infant stool scale was published for assessing premature and term infants&#x02019; stool consistency (four items), amount (four items), and color (six items). The scale is more detailed, and it might be helpful in differentiating between normal and abnormal defecation patterns in infants; however, it has not been validated for practical and research purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite the limitations of the Bristol Stool Form Scale, it offers a more objective way of assessing stool consistency than just relying on the perceptions of caregivers.</p><p>In our trial, the duration of diarrhea was used as the primary measure of outcome. Unfortunately, this measure, alone, is not considered optimal. Quantitative diarrhea criteria are recommended by the World Health Organization for use in the evaluation of therapeutic agents for the management of acute diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, the reluctance of caregivers and health care providers to carry out the cumbersome stool collection experienced by us when conducting some previous trials was the main reason for not including stool output in this study&#x02019;s protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion and implications for practice</title><p>While everyone agrees that unnecessary medicines should be avoided in the treatment of children with AGE, nevertheless some agents are commonly used. The findings from this RCT help optimize the management of AGE through the discouragement of the use of regimens with no proven efficacy but additional costs. The results of this double-blind RCT indicate that adding smectite to LGG as an adjuvant to standard rehydration therapy in infants and young children with AGE does not offer additional benefit. If there is a wish on the part of caregivers or health care professionals for an adjunct treatment, the use of either LGG or smectite is a more rational choice and may be considered.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was funded by the Medical University of Warsaw.</p><sec id="d29e1018"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="d29e1023"><title>Open Access</title><p>This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and the source are credited.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Allen SJ, Martinez EG, Gregorio GV, Dans LF (2010) Probiotics for treating acute infectious diarrhoea.
