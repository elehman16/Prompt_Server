weight-bearing (WB) and non-weight-bearing (NWB) positions and to study the difference
between the methods in chronic stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were
15 stroke patients who were randomly scheduled to perform both positions by a physical
therapist not involved in the study. The subjects performed the positions (WB and NWB)
based on a randomized controlled cross-sectional design. WB subjects were positioned in
one-leg standing to assess the knee joint position sense. NWB subjects were instructed to
sit comfortably in a chair and maintain the knees at 90&#x000b0; of flexion with the leg out of
the plinth. [Results] The results revealed that the WB position showed a significant
difference in knee position sense. The proprioception sense in the WB position was a
higher than that in the NWB position. [Conclusion] The knee proprioception of chronic
stroke patients differs between the weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing positions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Knee proprioception</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Weight bearing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is accompanied by a decline in muscular strength, sensory perception, neuromuscular
control, and balance, consequently increasing the risk to fall<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. These factors cause poor
neuromuscular control and problems relating to proprioceptive sense<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proprioceptive sense is considered an essential element for
activities of daily living<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are several methods of assessing joint proprioceptive sense<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most joint proprioception assessments are used to evaluate the
function of conscious joint position<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
From an anatomic perspective, histologic studies can be conducted to identify
mechanoreceptors within specific joint structures. Neurophysiological testing can measure
the sensory threshold and nerve conduction velocities. Clinically, proprioceptive sense can
be assessed by measuring the two components that make up the proprioceptive mechanism,
namely, kinesthesia and joint position sense. Most studies have conducted testing knee
proprioception with participants in a non-weight-bearing (NWB) position. In recent years,
increasing numbers of authors have recommended a weight-bearing (WB) test for joint position
sense, as weight-bearing tests are more functional and involve all of the cutaneous,
articular, and muscular proprioceptors during activities of daily living<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
There have been few studies describing assessment of joint position sense by using
functional WB protocols. In a study performed by Lokhande et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, the authors investigated the differences in
reproducibility of knee joint angles in healthy subjects during a WB task performed while
standing and an NWB task performed while sitting. More accurate reproduction of knee joint
angles was noted during the WB protocol. In a study performed by Magalhaes et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, a WB task offered more proprioception and
sensorimotor feedback than an NWB task. On the other hand, Keifer et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported greater position error during a
WB task compared with an NWB task. In stroke patients, both the more affected side and less
affected side showed deficits in joint position sense<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the differences between the sides have been little studied
in previous studies, and few studies have compared WB and NWB positions in chronic stroke
patients. Thus, our study aimed to assess knee joint proprioception in WB and NWB positions
and to study the difference between the positions in chronic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were fifteen people who had had a stroke and had been admitted to a
rehabilitation clinic. They were randomly scheduled by a physical therapist not involved in
the study. Random scheduling was performed by selection of a sealed opaque envelope from
among envelopes containing different schedules. The selected schedules were given to the
physiotherapist in sealed numbered envelopes. The inclusion criteria were (1) stroke
experienced more than 6 months before the study; (2) sufficient cognition to participate in
the study, that is, a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> score of 24 or higher; (3) ability to stand independently for more
than 30 seconds; (4) sufficient knee flexion and extension of more than 150&#x000b0;; (5) no
excessive spasticity, defined as a grade of 2 or higher on the Modified Ashworth Scale<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>; and (6) not participating in any
experimental rehabilitation or drug studies. The exclusion criteria were (1) any comorbidity
or disability and (2) any uncontrolled health condition for which this study was
contraindicated. Participation in the study was voluntary, and the subjects fully understood
its contents. All subjects were informed about the test methods and the use of the results,
and were asked to sign a written statement in which the formally consented to inclusion in
the study. The study was approved by the Daejeon University institutional review board.</p><p>The subjects were subjected to the tests after gaining sufficient familiarity with the test
protocols. All procedures are shown in the flow diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-1203-g001"/></fig>.</p><p>The knee position sense was measured for both the more affected and less affected sides
using the WB and NWB methods explained below. The knee position sense for both sides was
assessed by an active test with the ipsilateral active limb matching response, i.e., with
the examiner passively moving the limb to a knee joint angle of 120&#x000b0; or 150&#x000b0; while the
subjects eyes were closed.</p><p>For the WB position method, the subjects were positioned in one-leg standing to assess knee
joint position sense and blindfolded to avoid any visual cues. To minimize cutaneous input,
the subjects were asked to wear short pants and to perform the tests while barefoot. A
goniometer was attached to the side of the leg in such a manner that the fulcrum coincided
with the lateral knee joint line; one arm of the goniometer (Seedtech., Incheon, Republic of
Korea) was aligned parallel to the line joining the greater trochanter and fulcrum, while
the other arm was aligned parallel to the leg. When the target angle of 120&#x000b0; or 150&#x000b0; of knee
flexion was attained, the subjects were instructed to stop and to hold the position for 5
seconds. They were then instructed to straighten the knee and return to the erect standing
position. After 7 seconds, the subjects indicated when they felt they had attained the
target angle. The tester then instructed them to return to the starting position. The knee
joint position sense was measured and recorded for both knees. The hold times used were the
same as those used in previous studies<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the NWB position method, subjects were instructed to sit comfortably in a chair and
maintain the knees at 90&#x000b0; of flexion with legs out of the plinth and the thighs fully
supported and were blindfolded to avoid any visual cues. To minimize cutaneous input, the
subjects were asked to wear short and to perform the tests while barefoot. They were asked
to extend the knee joint from 90&#x000b0; to 120&#x000b0; or 150&#x000b0;. When the target angle of 120&#x000b0; or 150&#x000b0; of
knee extension was attained, the subjects were instructed to stop and hold the position for
5 seconds. They were then instructed to flex the knee. After 7 seconds, the subjects
indicated when they felt they had attained the target angle. The tester instructed the
subjects to return to the starting position. The knee joint position sense was measured and
recorded for both knees. This sequence was repeated for a total of 5 trials. The angles of
knee and extension were chosen randomly from 120&#x000b0; or 150&#x000b0; to prevent a learning effect.</p><p>Measurements were recorded as an absolute error for both the target angle and the
reproduced angle. The absolute error was the arithmetic difference between tested and
reproduced angles. The mean of each set of 5 absolute errors was then calculated. Paired
t-tests were used to compare differences between the WB and NWB positions. One-way repeated
measures ANOVA was performed for comparison of the knee joint position sense for both the
more affected and less affected sides. Post hoc testing was performed with Bonferroni
correction. All statistical analyses were performed by using the PASW Statistics version
18.0 software. Data are presented as the mean and SD. The level of statistics significance
was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Fifteen people met the inclusion criteria and voluntarily agreed to participate in this

in chronic stroke patients. The results of the present study point out (1) that comparison
of the mean of absolute errors in the WB and NWB positions showed a significant difference
in knee position sense and (2) that there were significant differences in knee position
sense between the more affected and less affected limbs.</p><p>Our study was conducted to compare the effect of the WB and NWB positions on knee joint
position sense in chronic stroke patients, which has not been reported previously. However,
previous studies have measured knee joint position sense with aging and in subjects with
muscular skeletal diseases, injured knees, or knee ligament injuries<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The absolute errors found in our study for knee joint position sense according to position
in the chronic stroke patients appear to be higher than those in previous studies. In this
regard, we thought that neurologic disorder affected knee position sense. However, the WB
position showed lower absolute error means than the NWB position. This finding is in
agreement with those of previous studies<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, the WB position had a
positive effect on enhancing proprioception. More accurate reproduction of knee position
sense was reported during the WB protocol. In a study by Hopper et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, the WB position was found to be more important for
performance and injury prevention than the NWB position. The WB position is also more
functional, and this makes it easy to perceive information for the area around the knee by
co-activation.</p><p>Dominance in the lower limbs is not as distinct as in the upper limbs<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the lack of differences in knee joint position sense
between the two sides is not surprising. However, a trend was noted for the less affected
limb of the stroke patients to have slightly better knee joint position sense. Both lower
limbs showed decreased knee joint position sense compared with under other conditions (e.g.,
with aging or in individuals with muscular skeletal diseases, injured knees, or knee
ligament injuries). Comparing both lower limbs, the knee of the more affected side showed a
more significant increase in mean absolute error than the less affected limb. This indicates
that the knee proprioception of the more affected limb was decreased by more than that of
the less affected limb. However, the ranges of the mean absolute error were higher than
those under other conditions. Thus, interventions for improving the proprioception of stroke
patients should focus on both sides.</p><p>The central component of proprioception, that is, the integration of sensory input, is also
affected by neurologic disorder. The conductive function of the central somatosensory
pathway is impaired by loss of function of the dendrite system in the motor cortex<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, a decrease in the number of neurons and
receptors, and neurochemical modifications in the brain<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, a
decrease in muscle spindle sensitivity can also result from mediated changes in the gamma
drive to the spindle themselves<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The knee proprioception of chronic stroke patients differs between the weight-bearing and
non-weight-bearing positions. This study also noted significant differences when comparing
the more affected and less affected lower limbs. However, the study has some limitations,
including the relatively small groups and lack of investigation of training effects.
Therefore, the results must be interpreted with caution.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Brouwer</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Culham</surname><given-names>EG</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Use of visual feedback in retraining balance following
