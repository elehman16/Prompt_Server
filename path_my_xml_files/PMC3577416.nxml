In developed countries, &#x0201c;resident-as-teacher&#x0201d; programs have been implemented progressively; but there is little information about this theme in developing countries such as Iran.

Many researchers have investigated teaching skills and efficient teacher's characteristics.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Although clinical teaching is different from teaching in all other fields (due to the clinical nature of the former), it follows the same fundamental principles and skills.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Those who teach in the field of clinical training ought to be familiar with these principles and skills. In addition to the clinical professors at medical colleges, residents also contribute in teaching, especially at clinical settings. Residents are medical students&#x02019; first teachers of practical clinical skills[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and are often known as the leaders of the training team at clinical wards due to their frequent presence at therapeutic-educational centers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Research shows that around 20% of residents&#x02019; work time is allocated to teaching[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and in some cases, they are responsible for up to 70% of clinical teaching for students of medicine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] On the other hand, studies have shown that participating in teaching other learners is an enjoyable experience for residents and it even aides them in their own learning.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Although it is estimated that residents are responsible for 80% of teaching endeavor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] and have an important role in this regard, there is no formal teaching skills program in residency curriculum.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Teaching is a skill and it is an important competency for residents. As it is essential that the medical resident learn how to examine patients and take history, they should be educated in the fields of teaching to small groups, discussion facilitation, and giving structured feedback to learners. Residents should be able to pinpoint the learning opportunities and use it for being more effective on their own students.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Medical residents must be eligible professors as the forerunners in clinical education.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>In residency curriculums we do not teach residents how to teach; so, how can we expect them to do their best teaching?[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Residents are likely to demonstrate less efficiency and effectiveness in the field of teaching without getting the adequate instruction about teaching methods.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] In addition to teaching lower grade residents and medical students, residents are responsible for creating a positive learning environment. So, they ought to know the initial principles of teaching.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Many studies indicate the positive effect of teaching skills training courses on improving the residents&#x02019; teaching skills.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Training courses like &#x0201c;residents-as-teacher Curricula&#x0201d; have been included and attended to in the residency curriculums in developed countries since a long time ago; however, there is not enough attention to these programs in developing countries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The already conducted studies in this field are scarce in Iran and quality of residents&#x02019; teaching skills has not been discussed as the pivotal point in them.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] On the other hand, active participation at residency training programs and research-therapeutic activities has been included in the formal explication of residents&#x02019; duties and gaining the passing score in periodical and final examinations has been stated as the condition for receiving the specialized doctoral degree.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Unfortunately, despite the responsibility of residents for teaching all learners, there is no formal program for training and evaluation of residents&#x02019; teaching skills.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] With regard to the significance of this issue and the necessity for adopting certain measures in this vein, this study was conducted with the aim of identifying the effect of Teaching Method Workshop on general surgery residents&#x02019; teaching skills in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. The results of this research could be utilized as the preliminary steps in clarifying the role of residents in clinical training and offering strategies for improving their teaching skills.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>All the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> year general surgery residents in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in the educational year of 2009-2010 were invited into this quasi-experimental study. The participating residents&#x02019; teaching skills were assessed both before and after the intervention (holding the 10-hour training workshop on teaching methods). The residents, who were absent for more than 4 hours during the Teaching Method Workshop sessions, were excluded from the study. In order to assess the residents&#x02019; teaching skills, the Clinical Teaching Self-assessment and the Clinical Teaching Evaluation Questionnaires were used. The important factors in residents&#x02019; teaching skills were extracted after going over the related literature in databases and the books pertinent to residents&#x02019; teaching skills and clinical teaching. A standard questionnaire for assessing the professors and residents&#x02019; teaching skills has been devised at the Indiana University School of Medicine[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] which incorporates the important extracted factors. In order to use this questionnaire, the related author was corresponded with and she sent the final version of the questionnaire (SFDP, version 26). The two aforementioned questionnaires were prepared by using this questionnaire. Each of these questionnaires consisted of 26 items; the seven areas of clinical teaching, including the Learning Climate, Control of Session, Communication of Goals, Promoting Understanding and Retention, Evaluation, Feedback, and Promoting Self-Directed Learning were included in 25 items within the questionnaire and one of its items was related to the total effectiveness score.</p><p>The reliability and validity of the self-assessment and evaluation questionnaires were examined and verified as follows:</p><p>

The reliability of the questionnaires was approved of to be in turn as Alpha = 0.87 and Alpha = 0.95.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Before holding the workshop, the participating residents in the study filled out the clinical teaching self-assessment form. Assessing the residents was carried out by 26 interns at the end of the general surgery apprenticeship course by filling out the clinical teaching assessment forms.</p><p>The Teaching Method Workshop for the participating residents was held in two 5-hour sessions with one-week interval. The topics discussed in the workshop were as follows:</p><p>Effective factors on teaching-learning, the teaching method of lecturing, working in small groups, procedure training, feedback, and assessment.</p><p>For discussing the issues in the workshop, diverse teaching methods were used, including Team member teaching design, small-group discussions, questioning and answering, and working in small groups for analyzing the scenarios relevant to teaching subject.</p><p>The participating residents filled out the clinical teaching self-assessment form within 3 weeks after the holding of the workshop. Assessing the intended teaching skills of residents was also carried out after holding the workshop by 33 interns (at the end of general surgery apprenticeship course) by filling out the clinical teaching assessment forms.</p><p>The results were inserted into the SPSS Software, version 11.5 and the mean scores were compared both before and after the intervention by the statistical test of Paired-samples <italic>T</italic>-test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> grade general surgery residents (23 individuals) were invited for participation at the training workshop of &#x0201c;teaching methodology.&#x0201d; Among them, 18 participated at the workshop, two of whom were females.

In all areas, the increase of means of scores is not significant after the intervention. The significant change in the post-test scores was observed in two areas of clinical teaching compared with the pre-test scores. This issue is also seen in previous studies; for instance, in a controlled, random study on the teaching skills of residents, the experiment group was assessed before and after the intervention by using the 8-stage test of OSTE. In this study, the scores of residents had an increase in 6 stages of the 8 total stages (in the post-intervention test).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] In another study which assessed the teaching skills of residents at 6 stages of OSTE, the experiment group had gained better scores in 4 stages compared with the control group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Accordingly, the holding of the Teaching Method Workshop has led to an increase in the scores of clinical teaching self-assessment at two areas of feedback and promotion of self-directed learning among the general surgery residents. No significant difference was observed in the comparison of evaluation mean scores before and after the intervention. These reasons can be responsible in gaining such results:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Residents had not enough knowledge about the principles of teaching skills prior to participation at the workshop. There is the likelihood that the residents&#x02019; perception about teaching skills was changed after participating at the workshop; in other words, it is possible that they had considered their performance as to be appropriate before the workshop and after gaining the relevant information, they had considered their post test assessment scores something near to their pretest one.</p></list-item><list-item><p>While filling out the self-assessment form after the intervention, some residents pointed out that &#x0201c;we have not received any training during this period to assess&#x0201d; (around 3-week interval between holding the workshop to filling out the post-test forms). Perhaps, the problem is rooted in finding proper opportunities for training, since the general surgery resident can find 3 to 4 hours of free time during the week while having 3 to 4 full-time shifts weekly. This issue might be related to this conception that training occurs only at special conditions. For instance, a few individuals attend at a particular place and discuss about a pre-set topic. Meanwhile, teaching and learning opportunities can be created in any place or at any moment, even through the simple query which an intern is addressed by phone.</p></list-item><list-item><p>One important issue is that there is no training in the field of teaching program for residents. The training programs for residents&#x02019; participation at teaching affaires. The training programs of residents are limited to some theoretical, weekly classes for interns. Even some professors believe that residents devote less time to teaching the learners than professors.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is no measure for training and assessing the teaching skills of the surgery residents within their list of duties or among the expectations of the educational systems of them.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Except for personal interest and motivation, there is no factor for encouraging the residents to cooperate at educational affaires.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It seems that some interns consider training to be limited to a certain time or place and do not consider the exchange of data at limited times as worthy enough. This issue can be due to the learning style of individuals who prefer the traditional methods of getting the already prepared information and memorizing it. Nonetheless, every opportunity in clinical training, though short (like a short tea time for freshening up), can be turned into a learning opportunity which requires the dynamic collaboration of learners and teachers in creating such situations.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>We faced some limitations in conducting this study such as::</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Limitation in the explored sample size (the participating residents). Although all the necessary measures were adopted for paving the way to have the utmost participation from the side of the residents, the number of residents who could participate decreased due to the working conditions of the surgery residents (shift and occurrence of emergency cases at the time of holding the workshop). Studies with lower number of residents participating at the intervention was reported in a review article of resident-as-teacher curricula.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lack of the possibility for administering the pre/post-test assessments with one group of evaluating interns due to the monthly cycle of intern groups.
