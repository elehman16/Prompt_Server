GPs allocated to microspirometry (MI) used COPD-6<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> microspirometers in patients &#x02265;50 years old with a smoking history and respiratory complaints that could indicate undiagnosed COPD and ask to refer patients for full spirometry if MI was positive (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FEV<sub>6</sub> &#x0003c;0.73). Introduction of the COPD-6<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was postponed in the usual care (UC) group. GPs of both study arms were asked to list all patients that fulfilled study criteria and at the end of the study we screened the electronic medical record system for number of patients that fulfilled study criteria and visited their GP within the study period. Main end point was a documented diagnostic conclusion of COPD within 3 months after the patient&#x02019;s visit. We used multilevel logistic regression with correction for relevant covariates. Next, we described the process of care. 21 practices (88 GPs) participated and 416 possible undiagnosed COPD patient visited these practices in the study period. 78 (of 192 visiting) subjects were listed by MI GPs and diagnostic conclusions were documented in 77%, compared to 61 listed (of 224 visiting) subjects and 44% with documented diagnostic conclusions by UC GPs (Odds Ratio: OR: 4.3, 95%CI: 1.6&#x02013;11.5). Microspirometry improved the diagnostic process for possible underlying COPD in patients who consulted their GP with respiratory symptoms, but the majority of possible undiagnosed COPD patients remained unrecognised by GPs.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Chronic lung disease: Quick test may help identify potential sufferers</title><p id="Par2">A quick, simple test that can be used by family doctors may help identify patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

One diagnostic routine in primary care that could benefit from a valid POC test is the detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><p id="Par4">The hallmark of COPD is a chronic airflow obstruction that is objectified by a post-bronchodilator (BD) spirometry test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Diagnostic spirometry requires time (usually between 30&#x02013;45&#x02009;min) and standardised procedures that cannot be integrated in a regular patient visit to the general practitioners&#x02019; (GP) office.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> GPs consider the lack of objective information during consultation an important barrier in the diagnostic process for COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> For instance, it remains difficult to differentiate between a common respiratory infection and COPD in a patient who consults with respiratory symptoms. This is an important reason why COPD is widely underdiagnosed in primary care, with estimates that vary between 45 and 85% among subjects at risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup></p><p id="Par5">Forced expiratory volume in 6&#x02009;s (FEV<sub>6</sub>) is the volume of air that is exhaled in the first 6&#x02009;s under forced conditions, and can serve as a surrogate for forced vital capacity (FVC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> In the past few years, small and inexpensive handheld devices that measure forced expiratory volume in 1&#x02009;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>)/ FEV<sub>6</sub> ratio (microspirometers) have become available. In a previous study, we found that the negative predictive value of a pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FEV<sub>6</sub> &#x0003c;0.73 as measured with a microspirometer to rule out airway obstruction is high in a primary care population at risk of COPD (i.e., 96.3%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Other studies found comparable results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> Thus, microspirometers could help GPs to substantiate airway obstruction more easily and immediately during a regular consultation of an &#x02018;at-risk&#x02019; subject. When indicated, the subject can be scheduled for further diagnostic spirometry testing after that. This could facilitate the pathway to an earlier diagnosis of COPD, and at the same time lead to more efficient use of full diagnostic spirometry testing. Studies that focussed on screening (i.e., case finding) for COPD found microspirometry to be a valid method and significantly better than using screening questionnaires.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> But what if microspirometry is used in routine general practice settings as a POC test for COPD?

In subjects who were identified as being at risk for COPD by their GP, the diagnostic process was completed and reported more often when the GP had a microspirometer available. Moreover, the use of diagnostic spirometry appeared to be more efficient in the microspirometry group (i.e., more tests were positive), although the number of subjects for this analysis was small and the difference was not statistically significant. However, no further investigation was initiated in both study groups in the majority of subjects at risk for COPD, despite the fact that they consulted their GP with respiratory symptoms and fit the risk profile for COPD.</p><p id="Par11">The GPs who received the microspirometer seemed to be more aware of COPD compared to GPs that were allocated to usual care, as can be deduced from the higher proportion of eligible subjects that were placed on the summary lists (41 vs. 27%). Moreover, the diagnostic conclusion was more often registered for those who were put on the summary list in the MI group. This observation suggests that POC microspirometry could reduce COPD underdiagnosis in primary care.</p><p id="Par12">Another way to reduce underdiagnosis of COPD is case finding using a screening questionnaire, as has been applied in a recent Dutch study in general practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Of the 3715 questionnaires that were sent out in this opportunistic primary care case finding strategy, only 48 new COPD cases were found. One of the reasons for this low yield is that only 14% of subjects that filled out the questionnaire were at risk for COPD and could be referred for diagnostic spirometry, while in our study 55% of the microspirometry tests resulted in a referral. Moreover, the attendance rate for diagnostic spirometry testing is higher in our study (86 vs. 54%). A possible explanation for the lower rate of no-show is that the outcome of a microspirometry test is more tangible for patients than a score on a questionnaire. Some studies have compared the results of case finding with a questionnaire and microspirometry head-to-head and conclude that the specificity is much higher for microspirometry and the sensitivity slightly lower or comparable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> Moreover, a recent publication showed that the added value of a screening questionnaire next to microspirometry is low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup></p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Strengths and limitations of our study</title><p id="Par13">We executed a real-life study and analysed the results from a real-life perspective. For example, all spirometry results in the microspirometry group were analysed, including those that were requested by the GP after a negative microspirometry test (i.e., FEV1/FEV6&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.73). In daily primary care, GPs can also decide to order a diagnostic spirometry test despite a negative result. Another strength is that, we were the first to include a control group to enable comparison with usual care. Moreover, we verified the documented number of diagnostic conclusions in the subjects&#x02019; medical records. This outcome was considered clinically relevant as treatment is guided by confirmed or refuted COPD diagnoses and only documented conclusions are likely to change disease management in individual cases.</p><p id="Par14">A limitation of the study is that GPs may have had good reasons not to put particular subjects on their summary list, reasons that were not recorded in the subjects&#x02019; medical records (e.g., terminal ill spouse). The location of the practices (which varied greatly between the two groups) may have influenced findings. Because good access to diagnostic spirometry facilities are available, we do not feel that this has influenced our results. Next, in our study, &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; subjects should have smoked at least for three months. Cumulative cigarette smoke exposure is a better indicator, but more difficult to determine. Because of the pragmatic nature of the trial, we decided to ask for months of smoking. Another limitation is that we initially planned to use another definition for &#x02018;diagnostic procedure completed&#x02019; in our study protocol. We planned to compare the proportion of patients that had either a confirmed or refuted presence of airflow obstruction. However, only during the data analysis we realised that a negative microspirometry result should also be considered as a refuted airflow obstruction and that because of this, the outcome and intervention were &#x02018;entwined&#x02019;. The result of the analysis on the original definition of a completed diagnostic procedure is provided in the <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">appendix</xref> and shows similar results as the slightly modified outcome that is presented in this paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Implications and recommendations</title><p id="Par15">This study has shown that POC microspirometry is a feasible strategy in routine care that can be implemented without substantial additional time investment or costs in general practices that already have good access to diagnostic spirometry. As microspirometers have originally been developed for single-patient use, it is important to use the more expensive one-way valve mouthpieces in order to prevent cross-infections. Previous studies used another type of microspirometers (like PiKo-6<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, nSpire Health, Inc) with similar results in test quality, and therefore, it seems that other devices than the COPD-6<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> can be used for the same purpose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> However, little is known about the long-term performance of these devices and the effect of day-to-day use in a general practice. Unlike diagnostic spirometers, microspirometers cannot be calibrated, so more information on the durability of the devices is needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par16">In conclusion, the introduction of POC microspirometry in general practices resulted in more, and more efficient diagnostic spirometry testing in subjects at risk for COPD who consulted their GP with respiratory symptoms.

Quality of test evaluation and result selection had to be in line with recommendations by international spirometry guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Pre- and post bronchodilator (BD) spirometric measurements were performed, the latter 15&#x02009;min after administration of four doses of 100&#x02009;mcg aerosolized salbutamol by a Volumatic&#x000ae; spacer.

For all subjects on the practice list, the following information was extracted manually from their medical files: age; gender; smoking history; information on respiratory diagnostic tests and test results; diagnostic conclusions (also when COPD was ruled out and asthma); if applicable: time between the subject&#x02019;s initial consultation and the GP&#x02019;s diagnostic conclusion; and whether or not the subject had also been recorded on the summary list by their GP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par26">The primary outcome of the study was the proportion of subjects with a recorded diagnostic conclusion that either confirmed or refuted COPD as evidenced by a lung function test result within 3 months after the initial GP consultation.

Moreover, we anticipated that at least 10 patients per practice would be listed on the summary list during the study period. Accepting a power of 0.80, &#x003b1; of 0.05 and an intra-cluster correlation of 0.10, and a drop-out of 6 practices, 22 practices had to be recruited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par28">Unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests, <italic>&#x003a7;</italic><sup>2</sup> tests and Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests were applied to compare practice, GP and subject characteristics between the IM and UC groups, using IBM SPSS software (Chicago, IL, USA, version 22). Detailed descriptive information on the diagnostic process is provided for both study arms. Logistic regression modelling with correction for clustering on practice level was used to evaluate the difference between MI and UC groups for completed diagnostic process in 3 months after the initial GP consultation (GLIMMIX procedure in SAS statistical software) (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). We tested the model for effect modification and confounding for the following variables: age, gender, smoking status, respiratory symptoms, whether or not the subject had been put on the summary list by the GP, and the follow-up time of the practice (6 vs. 8 months). Because being recorded on the summary list by the GP turned out to be an effect modifier in the analysis, odds ratios (ORs) are presented separately for the comparison of patients on the summary list between IM and UC groups, and for those who had not been put on the summary list by their GPs.
