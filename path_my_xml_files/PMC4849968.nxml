cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). However, this technique is performed in pediatric

application of RAP in CPB in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Sixty
pediatric patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were randomly divided into control
and experimental groups. The experimental group was treated with CPB using RAP, while
the control group was treated with conventional CPB (priming with suspended red blood
cells, plasma and albumin). The hematocrit (Hct) and lactate (Lac) levels at
different perioperative time-points, mechanical ventilation time, hospitalization
duration, and intraoperative and postoperative blood usage were recorded. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> showed that Hct levels at 15 min after CPB

cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has become an important area of research. Complex
cardiovascular surgery will often require a large amount of banked blood or blood
products, which are commonly limited, and may cause immune response problems, virus
dissemination, and others. This encourages physicians to explore blood conservation
measures that can reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusion. At the same time,
priming of conventional crystal solution in CPB will inevitably cause serious
hemodilution and reduction of plasma colloid osmotic pressure, which will produce
adverse effects (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr"/>
<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It has been
demonstrated that the applications of retrograde autologous priming (RAP) in adult
rheumatic heart disease and cardiac surgeries for coronary heart diseases can improve
the hematocrit (Hct) level, reduce postoperative chest drainage volume and allogeneic
blood transfusion, indicating that RAP is a safe and cost-effective blood conservation
technique (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr"/>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The
application of RAP in pediatric CPB can reduce priming volume, and keep a high Hct level
during trans-instrument process (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However,
this procedure is carried out in pediatric patients with more than 20 kg, and research
about its application in pediatric patients with less than 20 kg is still scarce. In
infants and young children blood volume is small, and therefore the effect of RAP on
hemodynamic is greater than in adults. Therefore, the application of RAP to infants and
young children is limited.</p><p>Our research center has been successfully applying RAP to adults and children &#x0003e;20 kg.
We believe that, as blood volume of infants is less than of adults, moderately reducing
the volume of priming solution could result in an improved outcome in mitigating the
hemodilution. In this study, we applied RAP in CPB in pediatric patients with body
weight within 15 and 20 kg, and investigated whether it can reduce the perioperative
blood transfusion volume.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was approved by the ethics committee of Zhengzhou University and written
informed consent was obtained from the patients or their families. One hundred
pediatric patients with congenital heart disease, admitted to the Department of
Cardiac Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, who required CPB
from September 2013 to June 2014, were invited to participate. Inclusion criteria
were: body weight of 15-20 kg; preoperative hemoglobin (HB) level higher than, or
equal to 100 g/L; and were elective for CPB intracardiac correction. Exclusion
criteria were: CPB longer than 120 min and exhibited difficulties in removing
treatment instruments. According to the above criteria, a total of 60 patients were
included. For this single-blind experiment, the patients were divided in control
group (n=33) and the experimental group (n=27) using the random number table
technique. Among the control group, 12 patients were submitted to auricular septal
defect repairing (ASDR), 19 patients were submitted to ventricular septal defect
repairing (VSDR), and 2 patients had tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair. Among the
experimental group, 11 patients had ASDR, 14 patients had VSDR, and 2 patients had
endocardial cushion defect procedure. All patients in the control group completed the
surgery, while 1 patient in the experimental group was excluded because the operation
time was longer than 120 min. The CONSORT diagram is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>. The general information of the two groups is shown in

</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical methods</title><p>A longitudinal incision was performed at the sternum median or the fourth right
subaxillary rib, and the heart was exposed. The ascending aorta and right atrium were
isolated, and the F14 and F20 pipe were inserted, respectively, to connect CPB
circuit (standard A type for infants; composed by 3/8&#x000d7;1/4 inch pipeline; total volume
of 600 mL; Xijing Medical Supplies Co., Ltd., China), for establishing the CPB. The
infantile membrane oxygenator (Xijing Medical Supplies Co., Ltd.) was used
intraoperatively. After body temperature was cooled to 34&#x000b0;C, the ascending aorta was
blocked, and the antegrade perfusion with 4<sup>o</sup>C crystal cardioplegic
solution (20 mL/kg) was performed, followed by another intraoperative perfusion after
30 min interval (1/2 of the first volume). The cardiac blocking time was 20-60 min.
Iced saline gauze and ice crumbs were placed on heart surface to protect myocardium.
The CPB continued to operate after ascending aorta was opened, for a duration of not
less than 1/4 of the aortic blocking time. After surgery, patients were monitored and
treated in the intensive care unit (ICU).</p></sec><sec><title>RAP method</title><p>All children were actively supplemented with crystalloid or colloid solution before
surgery, to avoid lack of circulating blood volume due to fasting.</p><p>For the experimental group a sodium chloride compound priming solution was used to
pre-fill the circulation pipes and exhaust air. After the patients were heparinized,
the aortic cannulation was connected, and the inner loop and connecting pipe were
opened, so that the blood inside the arterial pipe could slowly return and replace
the same amount of priming solution (stored in a spare bag). When the pipe from the
pulmonary artery membrane to the aortic cannulation site was completely filled with
blood, the arterial pipe was clamped. The vena cava cannulation was connected, and
the occlusion clamp of venous drainage tube was slowly opened. The venous blood was
used to completely replace the liquid inside the venous tube. Meanwhile, the same
amount of liquid was pumped and stored in a spare bag. During surgery, blood
pressure, electrocardiogram and blood oxygen saturation of patients were closely
monitored. If necessary, vasoactive agents were used to reduce the adverse effect of
RAP on hemodynamics. If blood pressure dropped to &#x0003c;60 mmHg, 4-10 &#x000b5;g
desoxyepinephrine was immediately injected <italic>iv</italic> to elevate blood
pressure. If no reaction on blood pressure was achieved after desoxyepinephrine
injection, the RAP was immediately interrupted, and the priming with suspended red
blood cells, plasma and albumin was performed.</p><p>In the control group, the volume of banked blood was calculated as follows:
Volume<sub>banked blood</sub> = 600 &#x000d7; Hct<sub>target</sub> - blood volume &#x000d7;
(Hct<sub>preoperative</sub> - Hct<sub>target</sub>)/Hct<sub>banked blood</sub>.
The banked blood, 100 mL of plasma and 10 g of 25% albumin were added to CPB circuit
to replace the exact volume of the priming solution.</p></sec><sec><title>CPB management</title><p>The surgeries were performed using CPB machine from Stocker S5, (Italy). During CPB
operation, the exogenous liquid input was reduced, and the conditions maintained as
follows: colloid osmotic pressure &#x0003e;12 mmHg, temperature 21-23&#x000b0;C, average blood
pressure &#x0003e;40 mmHg, CPB flow 120-150 mL/kg. When the average blood pressure dropped
to &#x0003c;40 mmHg, 4-10 &#x000b5;g desoxyepinephrine was immediately <italic>iv</italic>
injected to elevate blood pressure. When CPB flow dropped to &#x0003c;120 mL/kg, 20-30 mL
of sodium chloride compound solution was <italic>iv</italic> injected. If the CPB
flow improved, with Hct &#x0003e;0.25, CPB operation was continued. If CPB flow did not
improve, the operation was immediately interrupted, and priming with suspended red
blood cells, plasma and albumin was performed. After CPB, the ultrafiltration and
transfusion of blood products were used according to the patient Hct level (target
Hct &#x0003e;0.27) and colloid osmotic pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Observation of related indicators</title><p>Hct and lactate (Lac) levels were recorded before surgery. During surgery, the CPB
time, aortic blocking time and the intraoperative blood transfusion were recorded. In
addition, Hct and Lac values at 15 min after the beginning (T2) and at the end (T3)
of CPB were recorded. After surgery, the mechanical ventilation time, ICU time,
hospitalization duration and postoperative blood transfusion were recorded. In
addition, the Hct value at 2 h after surgery (T4) was recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS17.0 software (SPSS Inc., USA).
Data are reported as means&#x000b1;SD. Comparisons between the two groups were performed
using the two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test. P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Overall treatment outcome</title><p>One case in the experimental group was excluded because the operation time was longer
than 120 min. All patients of the experimental group completed RAP, and only 2
patients were administrated desoxyepinephrine for unstable blood pressure. The
experimental group significantly reduced priming amount, and 17 patients had no
allogeneic blood transfusion perioperatively, while 26 patients of the control group
received allogeneic blood transfusion. All patients were discharged successfully, and
exhibited no blood transfusion-induced complications during hospitalization.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of general information</title><p>There were no significant differences in gender, age, body weight or other general

creatinine, urea nitrogen, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and Hct levels
between the two groups showed no significant difference (P&#x0003e;0.05; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of intraoperative indicators</title><p>There were no significant differences of CPB time, aortic blocking time, T2-Lac or
T3-Lac between the two groups (P&#x0003e;0.05). However, the T2-Hct and T3-Hct values, and
intraoperative blood transfusion exhibited significant differences between the two
groups (P&#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>). Hct levels in
the experimental group were lower than those in the control group, but still
maintained at &#x0003e;0.25 (except in two cases), which met the requirement for
intraoperative blood management (Hct &#x0003e;0.25). In addition, the blood gas results
were normal, and there was no difference in oxygen metabolism between the two groups,
indicating that hemodynamics was stable during CPB in both groups. In order to
further improve the Hct level (the target being &#x0003e;0.27), the modified
ultrafiltration was performed in both groups. According to the residual blood volume
in CPB circuit, the ultrafiltration volume was set as 300-450 mL.</p><p>

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>There exist various degrees of hemodilution in CPB, which may exhibit advantages such as
reduced peripheral vascular resistance, improved microcirculation perfusion, and reduced
blood destruction. Excessive hemodilution may lead to kidney damages and affect other
organs' perfusion. Therefore, moderate hemodilution is an important part of CPB
management (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Blood conservation has already
been vastly studied in CPB research, which includes preoperative autologous
preservation, intraoperative hemodilution, and autologous transfusion (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Many
years of clinical trials, as well as the improvement of artificial membrane oxygenators
and CPB pipelines, resulted in the progress of adult CPB, advancing from blood priming
to almost bloodless priming, currently. In pediatric CPB, priming amount should be
relatively larger. Therefore, the need for allogeneic blood priming still cannot be
avoided in small children. However, apart from having a high risk for immune response
problems and disease transmission, banked blood may have shortcomings such as decreased
erythrocyte deformability, hemolysis, acidosis, abnormal inflammatory responses of white
blood cells, and others (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Therefore,
in recent years, studies are aiming at reducing allogeneic blood priming in pediatric
patients, and important progress has been achieved in children and infants with enough
body weight (&#x0003e;20 kg).</p><p>This study targeted pediatric patients with body weight within 15-20 kg. Our results
indicated that the experimental group, which did not use banked blood, obtained outcomes
similar to the control group. Patients with body weight &#x0003c;20 kg have less blood volume
then necessary for RAP, which would likely affect hemodynamic stability. Therefore, to
perform RAP, blood volume should be positively supplemented before surgery, thus
avoiding inadequate circulating blood volume, caused by fasting. During this operation,
the patient&#x02019;s blood pressure, echocardiogram and oxygen saturation should be closely
monitored, and anesthesiologists, surgeons and CPB physicians should cooperate closely.
Vasoactive drugs should be administered when necessary to reduce the adverse effects of
RAP towards hemodynamics. As for patients who show poor heart functions, or signs of
intolerance for the RAP technique, the operation should be interrupted promptly.
Furthermore, this technique must consider the overall condition of the patients, and a
combination with other blood conservation methods, such as modified ultrafiltration,
might be considered to achieve the best blood-protective effects and improve prognosis
(<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Successful implementation of the combined application of RAP and other
blood-saving methods has been reported (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>In cardiac surgery, the probability of using allogeneic blood in infants and young
children is relatively higher than in adults. At present, blood source is relatively
limited, therefore using less or not using any banked blood can be an advantage. The
successful application of RAP in children with body weight &#x0003c;20 kg can result in
satisfactory Hct levels in CPB, and maintain stable hemodynamics. This can effectively
ease the situation of lack of banked blood, and avoid the risk of various complications
and infectious diseases related to blood transfusion. In conclusion, RAP can effectively
reduce the hemodilution in CPB when using less or not using any banked blood, while
meeting the intraoperative perfusion conditions, and decreasing the perioperative blood
transfusion volume in pediatric patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gurbuz</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name><name><surname>Durukan</surname><given-names>AB</given-names></name><name><surname>Tavlasoglu</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Yorgancioglu</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>eComment.
