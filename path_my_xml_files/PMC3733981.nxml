However, simulations based on real trial data found that type I error rates were unaffected by the method of analysis (stratified vs unstratified), indicating these conditions were not met in real datasets. Comparison of different analysis methods found that with small sample sizes and a binary or time-to-event outcome, most analysis methods lead to either inflated type I error rates or a reduction in power; the lone exception was a stratified analysis using random effects for strata, which gave nominal type I error rates and adequate power.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is unlikely that a stratified analysis is necessary after stratified randomisation except in extreme scenarios. Therefore, the method of analysis (accounting for the strata, or adjusting only for the covariates) will not generally need to depend on the method of randomisation used.

This is commonly done to increase power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], to guard against chance imbalances between treatment arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], or because the prognostic factors have been used as balancing variables in the randomisation process and it is necessary to account for them in the analysis to obtain correct type I error rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. There are often several available methods to account for covariates in a trial analysis. For example, with a binary outcome either logistic regression with the prognostic factors as covariates or a Mantel-Haenszel technique may be used to estimate the treatment effect. Alternatively, one could adjust for the individual strata, formed by all combinations of the covariates, using a logistic regression model with the strata modelled as either fixed or random effects.</p><p>Although many articles have highlighted the benefits of covariate adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], relatively little attention has been paid to the best method of adjustment with multiple prognostic factors (with only one prognostic factor most methods of adjustment will give a similar answer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). Likewise, little research has looked into whether the type of adjustment should match the type of randomisation (e.g. a stratified analysis for stratified randomisation). When randomisation is carried out within each stratum (for example using stratified permuted blocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]), not only will each stratification factor be balanced between treatment arms, but each combination of stratification factors (i.e. each stratum) will as well. If there is an interaction between balancing factors (e.g. if the effect of age on outcome depends on the patient&#x02019;s disease stage), it may be necessary to account for not only the stratification factors, but also their interactions (or for each stratum) in the analysis in order to obtain correct type I error rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Conversely, when randomised is not carried out within strata (e.g. when balancing factors are not used in the randomisation process, or when covariates are balanced marginally), it may be unnecessary to account for interactions between covariates to obtain correct type I error rates (although adjustment for strong interactions may lead to increased power). Minimisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] is the most commonly used method of balancing covariates marginally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Briefly, the balance between treatment groups is calculated for each covariate, and then summed across all covariates to give an overall measure of balance. The patient is then allocated to the group that would give the best overall balance (usually with an element of probability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). Thus, treatment assignments are balanced within a covariate considered individually, but not within combinations of balancing covariates. This implies that for minimisation, adjusting only for the covariates used in the minimisation process (and not for their interactions, or equivalently each strata) should give valid type I error rates.</p><p>The goals of this paper are (1) to determine whether a stratified analysis is necessary to maintain correct type I error rates after randomisation is performed within each stratum (stratified randomisation), and (2) to compare different methods of adjustment in terms of type I error rate and power, irrespective of the method of randomisation used. We do not consider the issue of how best to adjust for centre-effects in multicentre RCTs, as this issue has different considerations, and has been discussed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We also do not consider the case of treatment-by-covariate (or treatment-by-strata) interaction (that is, all analysis methods presented here assume the treatment effect is constant across different covariates or strata).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Methods of adjustment</title><p>Methods of adjustment for covariates will generally fall into two classes. The first involves adjusting only for the individual covariates. We refer to this as a <italic>covariate-adjusted analysis</italic>. The second involves adjusting for each individual stratum. We refer to this as a <italic>stratified analysis</italic>. We illustrate these two different approaches using an example. Suppose we wish to account for two binary covariates in the analysis: gender (male vs. female) and disease stage (early vs. late). A covariate-adjusted analysis would involve adjusting for gender and disease stage as two separate variables in a regression model. A stratified analysis however would account for each stratum formed by these covariates (male/early stage vs male/late stage vs female/early stage vs female/late stage). This could be done by adjusting for each stratum in a regression model using three dummy variables, but is often done by performing the analysis within each stratum, and combining the results. Examples of this include Mantel-Haenzel for binary outcomes, or a stratified Cox model for time-to-event outcomes.</p><p>We illustrate some general approaches to adjustment using the previous example, where there were two covariates of interest, gender and disease stage. Let <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> be a binary variable indicating the patient&#x02019;s gender (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;female, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;male), <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> be a binary variable indicating the disease stage (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;early, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;late), and <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>treat</italic></sub> be a binary variable indicating whether the patient received the treatment or not.</p><p>Then, a covariate-adjusted analysis can be carried out by adjusting for the individual covariates in a regression model. This can be done with a model of the form:</p><p><disp-formula id="bmcM1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M1" name="1471-2288-13-99-i1" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mfenced open="(" close=")"><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>&#x003b1;</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">treat</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">treat</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where <italic>Y</italic> is the patient outcome, <italic>f(.)</italic> is the link function, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> the intercept, and the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02019;s represent regression coefficients.</p><p>There are several methods of performing a stratified analysis, some of which apply only to certain outcome types. One method of performing a stratified analysis is to account for all the strata in a regression model using indicator variables. This can be thought of as a stratified analysis using fixed effects (this is a common method of analysis for multicentre trials with continuous outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). Since gender and disease stage form four strata (female/early, female/late, male/early, male/late) we need three dummy variables. Let <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>FL</italic></sub> be a binary variable indicating whether the patient was female with late-stage disease (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;yes), <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>ME</italic></sub> be a binary variable indicating whether the patient was male with early-stage disease (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;yes), and <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>ML</italic></sub> be a binary variable indicating whether the patient was male with late-stage disease (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;yes) (the choice of which stratum to drop from the parameterisation is arbitrary, and will have no impact on the estimated treatment effect or its standard error).</p><p>Then, a stratified analysis using fixed effects can be performed using the following model:</p><p><disp-formula id="bmcM2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="M2" name="1471-2288-13-99-i2" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mfenced open="(" close=")"><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>&#x003b1;</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">treat</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">treat</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">FL</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">FL</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">ME</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">ME</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">ML</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">ML</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>It should be noted that (provided there are no continuous covariates) equation (2) is equivalent to adjusting for all the individual covariates as well as all interactions in the sense that the treatment effect and its standard error will be identical.</p><p>Another method of performing a stratified analysis is to treat strata as random effects from a distribution (which is also sometimes used to analyse multicentre trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). This can be thought of as a stratified analysis using random effects. Consider the scenario where we have <italic>j</italic> strata (in the above example we have four strata). A stratified analysis using random effects could then be performed using the following model:</p><p><disp-formula id="bmcM3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="M3" name="1471-2288-13-99-i3" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mfenced open="(" close=")"><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>&#x003b1;</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">treat</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">treat</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>u</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> is a random effect for the <italic>j</italic>th stratum. <italic>u</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> would generally be assumed to follow a normal distribution. This assumption is likely to be violated in many scenarios, but previous research has shown that the fixed parameters from random effects models are robust to misspecification of the random effects distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>As mentioned previously, some types of stratified analyses can only be performed for specific outcome types. Two examples of this are a Mantel-Haenszel analysis and a stratified Cox model. Mantel-Haenszel applies to binary outcomes, and involves calculating an odds ratio within each stratum, then calculating a weighted average of the results to get a final estimate. A stratified Cox model is performed with time-to-event outcomes, and involves calculating a hazard ratio within each stratum, then combining the results for a final estimate.</p><p>For continuous outcomes, the interpretation of the treatment effect will not depend on the method of analysis. However, for binary or time-to-event outcomes, adjustment for different factors can lead to different estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and therefore must be interpreted based on the adjustment factors. If the interactions between prognostic factors are large, a stratified-analysis may lead to larger estimates of treatment effect compared with a covariate-adjusted analysis, and may therefore increase power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Simulation study based on theoretical data</title><p>We performed a simulation study to determine (i) if a stratified analysis is necessary after stratified randomisation to maintain correct type I error rates, and (ii) whether a covariate-adjusted analysis is adequate after minimisation for correct type I error rates (rendering a stratified analysis unnecessary).</p><p>We used two different methods of randomisation; (i) stratified permuted blocks, with a block size of 2, and (ii) minimisation with a random component of 80%. For each method of randomisation we performed two analyses; (a) covariate-adjusted analysis, using equation 1, and (b) stratified analysis using fixed effects, using equation 2 (which, as noted previously, is the same as model (4), and so is equivalent to the data generating model). We therefore assessed four randomisation-analysis combinations in total:</p><p>a) Stratified permuted blocks, with a covariate-adjusted analysis</p><p>b) Stratified permuted blocks, with a stratified analysis</p><p>c) Minimisation, with a covariate-adjusted analysis</p><p>d) Minimisation, with a stratified analysis</p><p>Our hypothesis was that using a covariate-adjusted analysis after stratified randomisation would lead to inflated type I error rates when there were substantial interactions between prognostic factors, but that a stratified analysis would lead to nominal type I error rates.

For the PBC and AUGIB datasets, type I error rates were not substantially affected until the interactions had been increased by a factor of at least 7.5.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Sensitivity analysis for MIST2, PBC, and AUGIB datasets.</bold> Shows the type I error rate for the MIST2, PBC, and AUGIB datasets, after systematically increasing the size of the observed interactions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2288-13-99-5"/></fig><p>To be these results in perspective, increasing the observed interactions from the MIST2 dataset by a factor of 2.5 resulted in the effect size of the largest interaction being increased to almost 60 (approximately 3 times larger than the residual standard deviation).

By comparison, this issue should not affect randomisation methods that do not balance within strata (e.g. simple randomisation, permuted blocks without stratification, or minimisation), and so both covariate-adjusted and stratified analyses should give correct results. We explored this issue using simulation under specific (and potentially unrealistic) conditions, and found that the necessity of a stratified analysis after stratified randomisation depended on (a) the size of the interactions between prognostic factors, and (b) the distribution of patients across strata. When there were both large interactions, and a relatively equal number of patients in each stratum, a covariate-adjusted analysis led to type I error rates that were too low. A stratified analysis by comparison gave valid results. However, when either the interactions were small, or there was a low percentage of patients in some strata, a covariate-adjusted analysis gave close to nominal type I error rates. As expected, both analysis methods gave valid results after minimisation. This is because minimisation balances baseline variables marginally, meaning that although variables are balanced, their interactions are not. Adjustment for the main effects will then be sufficient to obtain the nominal type I error rates.</p><p>In order to determine whether this issue was likely to affect real RCTs, we performed further simulations based on real data. Contrary to expectations, we found that a stratified analysis was not necessary after stratified randomisation; covariate-adjusted analyses lead to valid results in each of the three datasets we used. The reasons for this are not entirely clear. One possible explanation is that the interaction sizes we used (based on observed data) were not large enough to affect results. However, some of the interactions we used were substantial. For example, in the MIST2 trial one of the interactions was 28% larger than the standard deviation, in the AUGIB dataset one interaction had an odds ratio of 2.01 and another an odds ratio of 1.65, and in the PBC dataset one interaction had a hazard ratio of 0.45 and two others a hazard ratio of 0.67. Another explanation is that the distribution of patients across strata affected the results (i.e. some strata had too low a proportion of patients). This indicates that in practice, both large interactions between balancing factors and similar numbers of patients in most strata are necessary for a covariate-adjusted analysis to affect type I error rates after balancing within strata. However, the second condition may be unlikely; this would require a similar proportion of patients in each group for all balancing factors (i.e. close to 50% of patients in each level of a binary factor), as well as small correlations between balancing factors (as moderate to large correlations would lead to patients being much more likely to fall into certain stratum). In our view, these conditions seem unlikely to be met in practice. Given the imbalance in the number of patients in each stratum observed in the datasets, the size of the interactions would have to have been 2.5-7.5 times larger than they were in order to affect results. For the MIST2 trial for example, this would have required an interaction term of almost 60 (about three times larger than the standard deviation), which is not realistic in practice. We conclude that choosing between covariate-adjusted and stratified analyses does not need to be based on whether stratified randomisation was used.</p><p>This brings us to our second question; of the numerous methods of analysis available, which is most powerful, irrespective of the randomisation method used? For continuous outcomes, stratified analyses (either fixed or random effects) gave slightly higher power than a covariate-adjusted analysis, while all methods of analysis gave nominal type I error rates.</p><p>For binary and time-to-event outcomes, all methods of analysis gave similar results with large sample sizes. However, there were differences between analysis methods for small sample sizes. A stratified analysis using fixed effects led to inflated type I error rates in several scenarios, and cannot be recommended. A covariate-adjusted analysis also led to type I error rates that were too large when used with a time-to-event outcome; this is similar to results seen previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] where accounting for several balancing factors led to inflated type I error rates with a binary or time-to-event outcome.</p><p>Both Mantel-Haenszel for binary outcomes and a stratified Cox model for time-to-event outcomes gave close to nominal type I error rate (though Mantel-Haenszel was slightly too low in certain scenarios), but both suffered from a lack of power compared with other methods.</p><p>The one method of analysis which gave good results across all scenarios and sample sizes was a stratified analysis using random effects. While other analysis methods gave inflated type I error rates (stratified analysis using fixed effects, covariate-adjusted analysis) or led to a loss of power (Mantel-Haenszel, stratified Cox model) with a binary or time-to-event outcome and a small sample size, a stratified analysis using random effects gave nominal type I error rates and good power.</p><p>In this paper we have only considered methods of adjustment for prognostic covariates, and have not discussed ways to account for centre effects in multicentre RCTs. Comparison of methods for adjusting for centre effects in multicentre RCTs have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, many trials may adjust for both prognostic covariates and centre effects, and it is therefore worth considering whether the methods we have discussed in this paper will apply when also accounting for centre effects. A stratified analysis could be performed by accounting for the strata made up of all the centre-prognostic covariate combinations. However, if the number of centres is large, this may lead to over-stratification, which could lead to a loss of power. Therefore, we do not recommend this approach in general. An alternative approach is to perform a covariate-adjusted analysis for the prognostic factors (provided the sample size is large enough), and to account for centre-effects separately (e.g. using fixed or random effects, or generalised estimating equations). Alternatively, if centre effects are accounted for using fixed effects, a stratified analysis using random effects could be used for the prognostic factors.</p><p>One limitation of this paper is that we have dichotomised the continuous covariates from the original datasets for use in our simulation study. This has been done because a stratified analysis is only possible with categorical covariates. However, we would generally not recommend categorising continuous variables in practice. Provided the sample size is large enough, we would recommend accounting for continuous variables as covariates in a regression model. If there is a mixture of continuous and categorical variables, we could either perform a covariate-adjusted analysis for all variables, or perform a mixture of a covariate-adjusted and a stratified analysis, where the categorical covariates are grouped into strata and accounted for using random effects, and the continuous variables are included as covariates in the regression model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is unlikely that a stratified analysis is necessary after stratified randomisation except in extreme scenarios. Therefore, the method of analysis (accounting for the strata, or adjusting only for the covariates) will not generally need to depend on the method of randomisation used. All of the methods of analysis considered in this article are acceptable with a continuous outcome, although when there are large interactions between covariates, a stratified analysis may increase power. With a binary or time-to-event outcome and a small sample size, we recommend the use of a stratified analysis using random effects, as this has been shown to maintain nominal type I error rates while giving high power. For binary or time-to-event outcomes with a large sample size, all methods of analysis are acceptable; however, it is often unclear what constitutes a large sample size. Therefore, if in doubt, we recommend the use of a stratified analysis using random effects to ensure correct type I error rates and power.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AUGIB: Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding; MIST2: The second multicentre intrapleural sepsis trial; PBC: Primary biliary cirrhosis; RCT: Randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Both authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>BK devised the study, performed the simulations, and wrote the first draft of the manuscript.
