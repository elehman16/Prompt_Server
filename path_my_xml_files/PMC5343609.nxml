Thus, treatment should be focused on a weight loss strategy.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Currently, no agents with proven safe and sustainable weight loss results in terms of improved biochemical profiles and a regression of steatohepatitis and fibrosis exists in the market.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Therefore, a combination of dietary amendments and higher level of physical activity is thought to have significant long-term benefits.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In 2009, fifty patients with NAFLD were enrolled in an uncontrolled trial in order to reduce calorie intake and had 3 h/week light aerobic activity. The results revealed a significant reduction in body mass index (BMI).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Another intervention has been done in 2014 among postmenopausal overweight and obese Indian women by calorie restriction, improvement of dietary content and recommendation to increase physical activity, which resulted in significant decrease in BMI and waist circumference.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, more studies are warranted to provide answers regarding the best diet and exercise regimen for NAFLD patients. Thus, the current study was conducted to examine the weight reducing effects of a lifestyle modification education on adiposity measures included weight, BMI, lean body mass (LBM), soft lean mass (SLM), mass of body fat (MBF), percent of body fat (PBF), abdominal circumference (AC), waist to hip ratio (WHR), visceral fat area (VFA), age-matched of body (AMB), MBF of the trunk and SLM of the trunk. In addition, calorie intake and physical activity. The results could be used as effective preventive and therapeutic strategies toward reducing the burden of obesity and NAFLD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>Of 327 patients who were invited to fatty liver research center (Isfahan, Iran) and assessed for eligibility, 82 patients met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in this intervention. The presence of NAFLD was confirmed by an expert physician in our department based on the results of liver sonography (presence of steatosis) and laboratory tests (aspartate aminotranferase and alanine aminotransferase more than 31 mg/dl).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] This study was approved and performed under the guidelines of the research ethics committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Ethic code; 393583) and also registered in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (registration number; IRCT2016071211763N24). Moreover, a written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. All 82 participants were randomly assigned into two groups using blocked randomization method and were matched based on confounding factors included age, sex, and education level to take lifestyle modification program (<italic>n</italic> = 41) or to take usual care (<italic>n</italic> = 41). Randomization was carried out using computer-generated random numbers. Thirty-six patients in intervention group and 33 of controls completed the study.

Also bad and good choices in each group were explained. Participants were encouraged to consume more fruits and vegetable, low fat dairy, complex carbohydrates, white meat and fish and avoid the intake of unhealthy fats and refined carbohydrates. Moreover, one session was allocated to physical activity and regular 30&#x02013;60 min exercise during at least 5 days of the week was recommended [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. On the other hand, the controls were followed up for 2 months and were asked to follow usual care which included usual dietary recommendations.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Lesson plan of nutrition education based on health belief model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-8-10-g002"/></table-wrap><p>Physical activity was evaluated using 3-day physical activity records completed for 3 consecutive days in the beginning and at the end of the study.

Three-day food records were completed by participants during 2 week days and a weekend day in the beginning and at the end of intervention.</p><p>Body Composition Analyzer Model ioi 353 (Jawon, Seol, Korea) was used to estimate weight, BMI, AC, WHR, PBF, MBF, LBM, SLM, VFA, AMB, SLM of trunk and MBF of trunk. The device employs bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA) method and eight electrodes are placed on hands and feet, and then measure body composition using an experimentally derived algorithm. Furthermore, height was measured using a stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) with 0.1 cm accuracy without shoes. Anthropometric measurements were performed by a trained personnel in the fatty liver Institute in the morning with an empty stomach.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Quantitative and qualitative data were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard error and frequency (percentage), respectively. Normality of quantitative variable was assessed using Kolmogrov&#x02013;Smirnov test and Q-Q plot. Nonnormal data were subjected to logarithmic transformation. Qualitative data were compared between two groups using Chi-square test. Within group analysis based on quantitative data was conducted using paired samples <italic>t</italic>-test. Between group analysis was performed using analysis of covariance based on after intervention values, adjustment was made for baseline values and energy intake.

On the other hand, two participants of the intervention group were excluded because of recurrent lumbar disk, which made them unable to follow the coarse. Moreover, six patients in control group and two in the intervention group did not continue the study for unknown reasons. The final data analysis included 36 patients in education group and 33 in the control group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-8-10-g003"/></fig><p>The baseline characteristics, including age, gender, educational level, weight, and BMI of participants in two groups were similar and there were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the two groups, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The results of our lifestyle modification intervention are: Weight, BMI, MBF of the trunk, and energy intake showed a strong significant reduction after 2 months in intervention group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Furthermore, significant reduction was observed in the intervention group compared to control group. For PBF, SLM, LBM, AC, WHR, VFA, AMB and physical activity variables significant improvement was observed in the intervention group; however, no significant differences were observed between two groups. For SLM of trunk, no significant differences were observed within or between groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Results of within group and between groups comparison</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-8-10-g004"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The 2-months of lifestyle modification education in the present study resulted in significant reduction in weight, BMI, MBF, SLM, and MBF of the trunk in overweight patients with NAFLD. Since the physical activity level of patients did not change significantly it could be concluded that these improvements in body composition variables could be only the result of the reduction in total calorie intake.</p><p>There was a statistically significant reduction in anthropometric measurements except for AC and WHR in the study group when compared to control group. A recent study in 2016 revealed the beneficial effects of lifestyle modification on weight, after 3 and 6 months of intervention in type 2 diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Another trial in 2014 showed a significant reduction in weight and BMI after 3 months of intervention same as our study, but it also showed a significant reduction in WHR contrary to our study.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The probable reasons for insignificant results regarding WHR could be the short period of intervention and insignificant change in physical activity level as well. In 2014, a 4-months intervention was done in low income hispanic women which resulted in significant reduction of WHR alongside with elevation of physical activity level, but it did not show any significant differences for weight and BMI.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This could be the answer to our hypothesis about insignificant reduction of WHR.</p><p>In our study, the variables which shown fat mass included: MBF, PBF, and MBF of the trunk which were only PBF stayed insignificant after intervention. In 2014, another same study repeated our results, which were revealed a reduction of fat mass and trunk fat mass but not fat-free mass after 3 months of intervention.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Macfarlane <italic>et al</italic>. in 2016 showed a significant reduction in fat mass after 10 weeks of intervention, but this result did not repeat for LBM.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The possible answer for insignificant change in LBM could be the tools of measurements. In our study, we used a BIA. BIA was only being able to detect changes in fat mass when compared to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is used to measure total body composition and fat content. On the other hand, BIA overestimate LBM and underestimate fat mass in comparison with DXA.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] VFA is referred to visceral fat, which is stored in the abdominal cavity. VFA showed a significant reduction in the intervention group but when it compared to control group did not stay significant. In 2013, Takihata <italic>et al</italic>. showed a significant reduction in VFA after 6 months of intensive lifestyle modification. On the other hand, it stated that VFA associated with NAFLD and also is affected by not only weight reduction but also unknown factors. It should be the reason of insignificant reduction in VFA alongside with a short period of intervention.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The last variable which was extracted from body composition analysis and did not show a significant reduction, was AMB that refers to biologic age. Based on recent studies, biologic age is correlated with physical activity and exercise capacity, which were expressed as MET.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Hence, insignificant change in physical activity which was calculated as MET could be the reason of insignificant reduction in AMB level.</p><p>The results of our study showed a significant reduction in weight, independent of physical activity level. A recent study exactly showed our result in which weight loss after 52 weeks of lifestyle modification did not show significant correlation with physical activity.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Our study had some limitations including the small sample size, short period of intervention and absent of the follow-up period after the end of lifestyle modification education.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Based on the results of this trial, clear differences in body composition variables and calorie intake were revealed after lifestyle modification education. It means that changing the lifestyle could have resulted in remarkable changes in anthropometric measurements. A lifestyle modification program and its guidelines could be used in NAFLD patients with obesity, in order to improve their body composition measurements and lose weight. With this in mind, further studies and more trials are needed to draw a firm conclusion about the connection between lifestyle modification and body composition variables.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kopelman</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Obesity as a medical problem</article-title><source>Nature</source><year>2000</year><volume>404</volume><fpage>635</fpage><lpage>43</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10766250</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>KB</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Obesity statistics</article-title><source>Prim Care</source><year>2016</year><volume>43</volume><fpage>121</fpage><lpage>35</lpage><comment>ix</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26896205</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Torres</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of weight loss on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</article-title><source>J Clin Gastroenterol</source><year>2009</year><volume>43</volume><fpage>970</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19727004</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lazo</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hernaez</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Eberhardt</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Bonekamp</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamel</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Guallar</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the United States: The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994</article-title><source>Am J Epidemiol</source><year>2013</year><volume>178</volume><fpage>38</fpage><lpage>45</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23703888</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Blackburn</surname><given-names>GL</given-names></name><name><surname>Mun</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name></person-group><source>Effects of weight loss surgeries on liver disease.
