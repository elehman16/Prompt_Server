Children were excluded if they had chronic disease (cardiac, respiratory, or neurologic), had a family history of confirmed or suspected tuberculosis, had severe malnutrition requiring hospitalization, had an egg allergy, required hospitalization for any reason, or were currently enrolled in another clinical trial. Clinic staff sought informed consent from parents/guardians for eligible children after describing the nature and consequences of the trial, and, then afterwards, enrolled, randomized, and vaccinated consented children at the same visit. Children with a current acute illness were asked to return seven days later for re-evaluation and vaccination. Only one child per household was enrolled.

Vaccine allocations were assigned to sequential numbers using random number tables. The sequential numbers were printed on opaque labels that were placed on pre-filled vaccine syringes by the study data management team who were not directly involved in vaccination and post-vaccine evaluation process. Labels concealed the volume of vaccine in each syringe. The vaccinators were not involved in any level of participant follow-up or clinical care.

Vaccines were donated by Sanofi Pasteur. The composition of the influenza vaccine followed recommendations from the World Health Organization for the southern hemisphere. During the 2010, 2011, and 2012 seasons, IIV3 included an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus, an A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage). In 2013, IIV3 components were changed to include an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus, an A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus (Yamagata lineage). Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was the active control vaccine.

In 2012, 34% of influenza episodes in the IIV3 arm and 10% of episodes in the IPV arm occurred between vaccine doses when children were only partially vaccinated. The frequency of influenza among the partially vaccinated was 11% in the IIV3 arm versus 0% in the IPV arm in the 2011 season and 32% in the IIV3 arm versus 17% in the IPV arm during the 2013 season. By virus type/subtype, 64% of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 3% of A(H3N2), and 2% of B virus infections, among children in the IIV3 arm, occurred during a time when the child was only partially vaccinated. Additionally, all of the episodes of influenza among partially vaccinated children in the IIV3 arm in 2012 occurred during the period of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 circulation, which also supports why the VE against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection was non-significant in the primary analysis but was higher and statistically significant in the fully vaccinated, per protocol analysis (<xref rid="s0090" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="p0160">Among children receiving IIV3, 6.2% experienced a clinical event within seven days of a vaccine dose with one major or two minor symptoms that prompted referral to the community clinic, which was similar to 6.7% among children receiving IPV (p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;.463, <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

During the 2010 season, vaccination occurred near the end of the typical season due to delays in vaccine shipment. We chose to continue with enrollment and vaccination that season despite the delay because influenza circulation can be prolonged in Dhaka; however, very few children in the trial were infected with influenza after the vaccination round began and we were unable to estimate an informative VE for this season. The highest observed VE was during the 2011 season, which was predominated by influenza A(H3N2) infections. In 2012, again due to delays in vaccine shipment, vaccination occurred during the midst of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 circulation. Fewer cases were observed in each vaccine arm and more children were partially vaccinated at the time of infection, which likely contributed to the non-significant VE for the season in the primary analysis and against A(H1N1)pdm09 infections overall. Additionally, there was co-circulation of B lineage viruses in 2012 and a mismatch compared with the B lineage viruses in the vaccine, which likely further contributed to lower efficacy in that season. In 2012, the VE was much higher (50%) against viruses with matching antigens in the vaccine formulation, but was not statistically significant. In 2013, vaccination was completed prior to the first occurrences of influenza in the study population; but, again, there was a mismatch between the lineage of circulating influenza B viruses and vaccine virus. Thus, our vaccine efficacy measurements are likely under-estimates of optimal roll out of well-matched vaccine.</p><p id="p0175">The point estimates for VE did not vary much by type or subtype of influenza infection; however, the VE was statistically significant against influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria virus infections but was not significant against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or B/Yamagata virus infections in the primary analysis. The study period was comprised of mostly influenza A(H3N2) and B/Victoria virus infections, thus we were likely underpowered to detect a significant VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Additionally, when we stratified infections by whether the child was fully or partially vaccinated at the time of infection, we saw many more A(H1N1)pmd09 infections among children who were partially vaccinated than for the other types and subtypes of infection.</p><p id="p0180">Putting our overall findings in context, one other trial of IIV3 among children aged 6&#x02013;23&#x0202f;months reported significant VE against any culture-confirmed influenza during the 1999&#x02013;2000 influenza season in the US (66% VE, 95% CI: 34, 82%) <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

The variable effect of IIV3 may be related to how timing of vaccine administration matches with the peak and duration of transmission in any given season, and highlights the need to adequately plan and design influenza vaccine studies. The trial in Dhaka was designed to include three seasons; however, because of the delayed start of vaccination in 2010, enrollment was extended in 2011 to a fourth season, after blinded interim review. Without this additional season, our estimate of VE would have been limited to one season in which vaccination was completed prior to influenza circulation in the area.</p><p id="p0185">Compared with the VE among adults or in older children, the modest VE we observed may be reflective of lower immunogenicity of non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines in young children <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Phase II immunogenicity studies have shown that young children 6&#x02013;11&#x0202f;months have lower geometric mean antibody titers and lower rates of seroprotection than older children <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Older children may also have higher VE than young children because of a boosting effect of repeated vaccination or natural infections. We did see slightly higher VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza during a child&#x02019;s second season of enrollment, although the confidence intervals for repeated vaccination overlapped with those for the overall cohort and the cohort of first-time vaccinees. A similar pattern was reported in an observational study of children aged 2&#x02013;8&#x0202f;years in the United States <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> suggesting that young children may get an additional boost from second-year vaccination.</p><p id="p0190">We also observed a slightly higher VE for fully vaccinated children compared with the overall cohort. Through further investigation, the increase in VE was largely driven by increased VE among the fully vaccinated during the 2012 season when vaccination occurred during circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09. The study was designed to end vaccination prior to the start of influenza circulation in the area, which had historically been between April and October; and May has been suggested as the optimal time of vaccination based on data from 2006 to 2011 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, influenza circulation in the tropics can be sporadic and there was early circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 in Dhaka in 2012. Many children were exposed to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 prior to being fully vaccinated with two doses of IIV3. This context could have led to higher VE among the fully vaccinated because there is greater protection against influenza conferred by two doses of vaccine given during a first season, rather than one, or because the observation time for the fully vaccinated children started later and therefore included fewer infections than the primary analytic cohort did. During the 2011 and 2013 seasons, the VE among the fully vaccinated was similar to that of the primary analytic cohort, perhaps because both vaccine doses were administered before influenza was widely circulating, thus making those two cohorts virtually identical.</p><p id="p0195">In addition to the limitations of this trial that have been presented above, a high proportion of children had protocol deviations and did not receive a second, booster dose within one month of their initial dose. The results of the per protocol analysis were similar to those of the primary analysis, so these deviations are unlikely to bias our conclusions. However, they do underscore the difficulty of 2-dose vaccination strategies for influenza, with often-sporadic circulation in tropical and subtropical settings, and encourage efforts to find optimal strategies for vaccine administration, including timing of vaccination, and more immunogenic and universal vaccines for young children.</p><p id="p0200">In summary, we found that IIV3 significantly reduced the incidence of influenza in young children in Bangladesh. These findings support the recommendation for yearly vaccination of young children against influenza and confirm that these children likely benefit from an additional booster dose of inactivated vaccine in their first year of vaccination. As very young children are particularly vulnerable to severe influenza complications, alternative influenza vaccines with greater immunogenicity and efficacy should be evaluated, including vaccines with adjuvants or standard adult doses. While alternative influenza vaccines are being explored, inactivated influenza vaccines remain the only licensed vaccine for children aged 6&#x02013;23&#x0202f;months and are currently the best tool to prevent infection among very young children who are at risk for severe complications from influenza.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Contributors</title><p id="p0205">All authors meet the criteria for authorship according to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICJME).
