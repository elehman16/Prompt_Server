HSC-T6 cells were used as an <italic>in vitro</italic> model and randomly assigned into four groups: control, high-dose amygdalin, mid-dose amygdalin and low-dose amygdalin. Following amygdalin treatment, compared with the control, a high dose of amygdalin significantly suppressed the mRNA expression of PDGF and IGF (each P&#x0003c;0.05), whereas moderate and low doses showed no significant effect, relatively low doses of amygdalin are not sufficient to transfer signals to its receptor. The high-dose amygdalin and low-dose amygdalin displayed suppressed protein expression of PDGF at 24, 48 and 72 h, with the high-dose group exhibiting the most marked suppression at all three time points. By reducing the transcription of PDGF and IGF mRNA and the expression of PDGF protein, amygdalin decreased the synthesis and release of PDGF and IGF, thereby reducing the influence of PDGF and IGF on HSCs, thus protecting the liver from fibrosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>amygdalin</kwd><kwd>anti-fibrosis</kwd><kwd>HSC-T6</kwd><kwd>insulin-like growth factor</kwd><kwd>platelet-derived growth factor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatic fibrosis is a wound healing response to a variety of chronic stimuli that results in the excessive production and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the liver (<xref rid="b1-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the central link and the cytological basis of liver fibrosis. The activation of HSCs is a well-accepted critical event in hepatic fibrosis and an attractive target for treatment. Activated HSCs are able to secrete various cytokines, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which act as regulators of various different signaling transduction pathways in the formation of liver fibrosis (<xref rid="b2-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). PDGF, which is one of the most effective mitogens in terms of exerting functions on HSCs, regulates liver fibrosis via autocrine and paracrine signaling throughout the entire HSC activation process (<xref rid="b3-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that PDGF was able to promote insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, secretion and the release of IGF binding proteins in HSC cells and therefore induce liver fibrosis via PDGF self-interaction (<xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). HSCs are also the primary cell type responsible for the progression of liver fibrosis and serve a central role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis (<xref rid="b5-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The HSC-T6 immortal cell line is established by transfecting rat HSCs with the SV40 virus and has the phenotype of activated HSC and can virtually be pass aged infinitely (<xref rid="b5-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In the present study, HSC-T6 was used as a cell model to investigate the role of amygdalin in regulating the mRNA expression levels of PDGF and IGF and the protein expression levels of PDGF and its receptor (PDGFR).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Experimental cells</title><p>The HSC-T6 cell line was cryopreserved and resuscitated by the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (Guangzhou, China).</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental drugs</title><p>Amygdalin (molecular weight, 457.4; cat. no. 110820-200403; 20 mg/tube) was purchased from the National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (Beijing, China).

The membrane was placed on the gel, bubbles were removed and the transfer device was locked and placed into the electrophoresis rack with each electrode connected properly. Transmembrane electrophoresis was performed under 100 V for 60 min. Following protein transfer, the membrane was incubated at 4&#x000b0;C with the 5 ml blocking buffer and the PDGF monoclonal antibody (1:100; cat. no. 360511; Bioworld Technology, Inc.) overnight and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:100) at room temperature for 1 h.

It also affects glial cell growth and differentiation. PDGF is generated by a variety of cell types and when liver failure occurs it is predominantly secreted from nonparenchymal cells, including Kupffer and hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, or from activated HSCs through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms to regulate downstream pathways (<xref rid="b8-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). PDGF serves an important role in stimulating HSC proliferation and altering its cellular skeleton distribution, thereby promoting HSCs to differentiate into myofibroblasts (MFBs) (<xref rid="b10-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In chemical terms, PDGF is a dimeric glycoprotein consisting of two A(-AA) or B(-BB) chains, or a combination of the two(-AB); therefore, PDGF has three dimeric isoforms: PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB (<xref rid="b11-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The PDGF signaling network is activated when PDGF binds to its receptor on the membrane. PDGFR is a single-strand transmembrane protein of 170&#x02013;180 kDa containing two subunits, PDGFR-&#x003b1; and PDGFR-&#x003b2;, which make three different combinations, PDGFR-&#x003b1;&#x003b1;, PDGFR-&#x003b2;&#x003b2; and PDGFR-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; (<xref rid="b12-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). As the &#x003b1; subunit is highly affinitive to the A chain whereas the &#x003b2; subunit is affinitive to the B chain, PDGFR-&#x003b1;&#x003b1; binds only to PDGF-A, PDGFR-&#x003b2;&#x003b2; to PDGF-BB and PDGFR-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; to both PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB (<xref rid="b13-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). PDGF-BB and PDGFR-&#x003b2;&#x003b2; have important roles in regulating liver fibrosis as PDGFR is typically expressed in the &#x003b2; form and binds to PDGF-BB during liver fibrosis (<xref rid="b14-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). PDGF binds to PDGFR and the dimerized receptor activates the autophosphorylation of various sites within their cytosolic domains, which serve to mediate the signal transduction (<xref rid="b14-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). PDGF affects cells in various ways: i) It stimulates HSC proliferation. PDGF has no effect on unactivated HSCs, but for HSCs activated from spontaneous activation or stimulated by culturing with TGF-&#x003b2; or Kupffer cell conditioned medium, PDGF is able to promote their proliferation through a dose-dependent regulation. ii) It stimulates collagen synthesis and inhibits collagen degeneration. In liver fibrosis lesions, the PDGF location is highly associated with the distribution of mononuclear macrophages and collagen-producing cells and also with the deposition of collagen types I and III (<xref rid="b15-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Furthermore, PDGF is positively associated with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 level, which serves an important role in degenerating ECM (<xref rid="b15-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). iii) In addition to being a chemotactic factor of mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils and HSCs, PDGF also promotes HSC migration in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="b16-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A previous study revealed that the expression of PDGF and PDGFR are significantly higher in liver fibrosis than in normal liver tissues and its activity increased with the severity of liver fibrosis (<xref rid="b17-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Particularly, the expression of PDGF in HSCs exhibited a significant positive correlation with the level of fibrosis. This suggests that PDGF has an important role in changing HSC to MFB cells.</p><p>IGF is a polypeptide mitogen that is similar to proinsulin; therefore, it has an important role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis and mediates cell growth, synthetic metabolism, glucose reduction and immune regulation (<xref rid="b18-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Pinzani and Marra (<xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) previously demonstrated that PDGF enhanced the secretion and release of IGF and its binding proteins in rat HSCs and also promoted HSC division and proliferation by stimulating DNA synthesis in cells. Another study revealed that exogenous IGF significantly promoted HSC proliferation, indicating that IGF may be produced through autocrine and paracrine functions of HSCs and are further associated with the repair of liver damage by promoting liver fibrosis (<xref rid="b19-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the mRNA expression of PDGF and IGF was significantly suppressed by the high dose of amygdalin compared with that observed in controls. Whereas the high-dose group exhibited a significant decrease compared with the control group, the low- and mid-dose groups did not suppress PDGF and IGF mRNA expression. The mid-dose treatments led to a significant increase of PDGF and IGF mRNA compared with the control group. This difference may be due to the fact that relatively low doses of amygdalin are not sufficient to transfer signals to its receptor.</p><p>In the present study, amygdalin exhibited a long-term suppressive effect on PDGF protein levels, from 24 to 72 h. However, amygdalin treatment exhibited no significant effect on PDGFR. First, this may be associated with limitations of the experiment performed. As the fluorescence of PDGFR may be quenched easily, improper behaviors during sample handling and loading may result in false-negative results. However, due to time limitations, this could not be repeated in the present study and awaits further investigation. Second, due to differences between HSC-T6 and <italic>in vivo</italic> HSCs, HSC-T6 cells may fail to express PDGFR.</p><p>Therefore, the present study suggests that amygdalin reduced the production of PDGF and IGF by down regulating their transcription of genes. In this way, the influence of PDGF and IGF on HSCs may be reduced, thereby realizing the function of anti-fibrosis during the formation of liver fibrosis.</p><p>In conclusion, amygdalin is able to reduce the transcription of PDGF and IGF mRNA and the expression of PDGF protein. Amygdalin also decreased the synthesis and release of PDGF and IGF, thereby reducing the influence of PDGF and IGF on HSCs, thus protecting the liver from fibrosis. IGF and PDGF have been identified as significant mitogens for liver myofibroblasts (LMFs), a cell population that serves a role in liver fibrogenesis. A previous study demonstrated that both IGF-I and PDGF are important growth-promoting factors of LMFs <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="b10-etm-0-0-5886" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In the present study, amygdalin reduced the transcription of PDGF and IGF mRNA and the expression of PDGF protein. Furthermore, amygdalin also decreased the synthesis and release of PDGF and IGF. The data presented herein indicates that IGF and PDGF serve important roles in liver fibrogenesis, such that these may be attractive targets for future antifibrotic therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The present study was supported by Guangdong Province Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no.
