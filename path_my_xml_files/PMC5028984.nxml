Approximately 20&#x000a0;% of the adult population of Hong Kong has a probing pocket depth (PPD)&#x000a0;&#x02265;6&#x000a0;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although bacteria play a critical role in the life cycle of this disease, they are not solely responsible for the onset of this disease, with host factors playing an important role in the outcome of this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Smoking is one of the greatest risk factors for periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and is associated with an increased risk of periodontal attachment loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although routine non-surgical periodontal therapy has been shown to be effective for the treatment of chronic periodontitis in smokers, smokers tend to exhibit more residual periodontal pockets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] than non-smokers. Smokers also show a greater tendency towards progressive radiographic alveolar bone loss despite post-treatment periodontal maintenance care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the conceptual context of Chinese medicine (CM), periodontal disease is mainly categorized as <italic>ya xuan</italic> (gaping gums), <italic>ya lou</italic> (leaking gums) and <italic>ya nu</italic> (bleeding gums) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The recommended treatment for this disease involves the mechanical removal of deposits from the affected teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The use of herbal medicine recipes has also been suggested to rectify the disease-associated imbalance in the human body along the four major philosophical frameworks, including attention to poor oral hygiene, <italic>wei huo</italic> (<italic>stomach</italic>-<italic>heat</italic>, SH), <italic>shen yin xu</italic> (<italic>kidney</italic>-<italic>yin deficiency</italic>, KYD) and weakness in <italic>qi</italic> and <italic>xue</italic> (<italic>blood</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The concept of CM dictates that the <italic>kidney</italic> dominates the <italic>gu</italic> (<italic>bone</italic>) and <italic>sheng sui</italic> (<italic>create marrow</italic>) and that the <italic>kidney</italic> therefore also dominates the teeth, whereas the <italic>pi</italic> (<italic>spleen</italic>) and <italic>stomach meridians</italic> pass through the teeth and gum. Accordingly, periodontal disease could therefore be a problem associated with unwanted changes to the homeostasis in the <italic>spleen</italic> and <italic>stomach</italic> or <italic>kidney</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. From the perspective of CM, smoking would not only affect the lungs and airways, but would also fire up the <italic>qi</italic>, destroy blood and consume <italic>yin</italic> fluids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Several CM formula have been used to treat <italic>ya xuan, ya lou</italic> and <italic>ya nu</italic>, including <italic>Radix Achyranthis bidentatae</italic> (<italic>Huai Ni Xi</italic>), <italic>Rhizoma Drynariae</italic> (<italic>Gu Su Bu</italic>), <italic>Radix Ophiopogonis</italic> (<italic>Mai Men Dong</italic>), <italic>Cortex Phellodendri</italic> (<italic>Huang Bai</italic>) and <italic>Radix et Rhizoma Rehmanniae</italic> (<italic>Sheng Di Huang</italic>). All of these recipes have been reported to attenuate in vivo inflammation, enhance immune function and/or modulate bone homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. <italic>Rhizoma Drynariae</italic> and <italic>Rehmannia glutinosa</italic> (<italic>Shu Di Huang</italic>) has also been reported to exhibit therapeutic effects towards bone fracture healing, including the induction of proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human bone mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. <italic>Rhizoma Drynariae</italic>, which contains naringin as its main effective component, is one of the most widely investigated of all of these herbal preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p><italic>Yunu</italic>-<italic>Jian</italic> (YJ), which is also known as Jade maiden/women decoction, Fair maiden decoction or <italic>Rehmannia</italic> and <italic>gypsum</italic> combination, is a CM <italic>heat</italic> purging formula used to reduce <italic>stomach</italic>-<italic>heat</italic> (SH) and enrich <italic>kidney</italic>-<italic>yin</italic> (KY) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This formula is also commonly used to manage diabetes mellitus and gum/oral inflammation. In terms of the different concepts of CM, the regular smoking of cigarettes leads to the <italic>burning</italic> of the <italic>stomach</italic> and <italic>fei</italic> (<italic>lung</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], placing the affected individual at a higher risk of experiencing <italic>ya xuan</italic> due to SH. The activity of YJ can be modified or refined by the addition of CM herbs and/or minor changes to one of its five key ingredients. The aim of this study was to explore the adjunctive effect of using a specifically modified YJ (mYJ) formulation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) to target SH and KYD in male smokers with chronic periodontitis. In terms of its modification, <italic>Rhizoma Drynariae, Cortex Phellodendri</italic> and <italic>Radix Puerariae</italic> (<italic>Ge Gen</italic>; to promote circulation and increase blood flow) were added to YJ, whereas <italic>Rehmannia glutinosa</italic> was replaced with <italic>Radix et Rhizoma Rehmanniae</italic>.

Smokers, however, have been repeatedly shown to experience inferior healing responses following non-surgical periodontal therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Clinicians have attempted a variety of approaches, including adjunctive antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], toothpastes containing triclosan/copolymers in an un-blinded fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and Er:YAG lasers, in place of regular mechanical therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] to enhance or augment non-surgical periodontal healing in smokers. Unfortunately, however, none of these efforts have produced satisfactory results.</p><p>This study aimed to evaluate the adjunctive use of mYJ (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) for the non-surgical periodontal treatment of male smokers with chronic periodontitis in a randomized, double blind, prospective, placebo-controlled study. Middle-aged male smokers who had been diagnosed with CM syndrome of SH and/or KYD, but were otherwise healthy, were recruited into this trial. Full-mouth clinical treatment responses were measured, together with radiographic treatment outcomes at selected sites, which were measured by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis (CADIA) and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) volume. Digital subtraction radiography (DSR) was used to supplement the periodontal healing response assessment as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which is considered as a sensitive follow-up protocol for alveolar bone healing after periodontal treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. General CM signs of SH and KYD were recorded over a 12-month study period. Standard clinical and radiographical periodontal parameters were followed throughout the clinical trial to provide an indication of the reduction in the periodontal inflammation (reduction of bleeding on probing or BOP), resolution/remodeling of the diseased periodontium (reduction of PPD) and bony repair (increase in radiographic periodontal bone density) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

In brief, correct amounts of all raw materials were boiled together in water to extract their ingredients. The aqueous extract was then concentrated, dried, and crushed into fine powder. The correct amount of powder was then packed into an individually sealed plain aluminum sachet (25&#x000a0;g). A placebo powder (total 25&#x000a0;g) was packed in the similar aluminum sachets as the active recipe. The placebo or active sachet was coded as PH001 or PH002, respectively by the manufacturer. The identity of the sachets was kept by one of the authors (KYZ) who did not participate in the collection and analysis of the data. Contamination screening against heavy metals, pesticides, and aflatoxins in both the active and placebo sachets was performed by an independent laboratory to ensure safety before human consumption.

A member of the research team (JCSH) evaluated the dental eligibility of male smokers presenting at the clinic with untreated chronic periodontitis. Male smokers satisfying the eligibility requirements were asked whether they would like to participate in this study, and the CM eligibility of those who accepted the invitation was confirmed by PSC. Eligible participants were then assigned a numerical personal identification code (study number) as a personal identifier to be used throughout the study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). JCSH then followed up with all of the eligible participants to ensure that all of the necessary pre-treatment processes had been conducted. Emergency treatments such as extractions, caries stabilization and initial endodontic therapy were completed prior to the commencement of the non-surgical periodontal treatment trial.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Flow of participants through each stage of the randomized trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13020_2016_111_Fig2_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>After the required number of participants had been secured, receptionists at the Periodontology Clinic, PPDH, were instructed by KYZ via a concealed envelope, which was prepared prior to the recruitment process, to arrange appointments with all of the participants. Each envelope also included a predetermined table with a study number against randomized blocks indicating sachet allocation. Critically, the attending receptionists were completely unaware of the contents of the different sachets. All of the participants signed an informed consent form at their first appointment and were subsequently presented with seven designated sachets with specific instruction to take one sachet per day for the week prior to the commencement of the non-surgical periodontal therapy. On the first day of the non-surgical periodontal therapy, each participant was presented with 23 identical sachets to those that they had already received. The participants were subsequently presented with 30 more of the same sachets at onw and 2&#x000a0;months after the commencement of the non-surgical periodontal therapy. KYZ was responsible for concealing the details of each participant&#x02019;s allocation, whilst simultaneously refrained from contact with any of the participants, receptionists or clinicians involved in the study until it reached completion.</p><p>Each participant was instructed to start consuming the content of the allocated sachets 1 week before starting the non-surgical periodontal therapy process. The participants were instructed to dissolve the powder in each sachet in 200&#x000a0;mL of hot water and drink the resulting solution while it was still warm at the beginning of each day. Each participant was issued with a total of 90 sachets. Self-completion compliance sheets were given to each participant, when CM sachets were issued, to be completed at predefined intervals, including (1) within the 1&#x000a0;week pre-periodontal treatment period; (2) from day 8&#x02013;day 30 after commencement of the periodontal treatment; and (3) over the second and third month study period. These forms were provided to encourage proper CM medication consumption and to monitor self-reported compliance. Participants had to sign the compliance sheets to confirm their medication consumption and return the sheet, together with any untaken CM medication, according to the schedule set. On each compliance sheet, there was a section for participants to fill in the date, time and type of any suspected adverse effect experienced. Two phone numbers (accessible to PSC or JCSH anytime during the study period concerned) were written on the compliance sheet in case any participant wanted to contact the investigation team.</p><p>The receptionists at the Periodontology Clinic were instructed to arrange the non-surgical periodontal treatment appointments (4 visits) within a 3-week period for all of the participants. The appointments were subsequently delivered by JCSH, who was not involved in the clinical data collection. All of the participants received the same non-surgical periodontal treatment, together with the same oral hygiene instructions regarding brushing and interdental cleaning, followed by quadrant-wise scaling and root surface debridement under local anesthesia.</p><p>Recall appointments were scheduled once every week for the first month after the periodontal treatment, with reduced frequencies thereafter (i.e., once a week at month 2; once every 2&#x000a0;weeks for month 3, and once every month until the end of study). Oral hygiene reinforcement and motivation were provided as necessary. Supra- and sub-gingival debridement was performed if needed during the recall appointments. Clinical and radiographic examinations were carried out at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month recall visits.</p><p>Any residual periodontal problems detected at the conclusion of the study at the 12-month recall, namely any sites with residual PPD&#x000a0;&#x0003e;5&#x000a0;mm, were followed-up with an appropriate periodontal treatment process (e.g., re-root planing or access surgery), which was arranged and delivered without delay. All of the participants were again reminded of the deleterious effects resulting from their continued smoking and were advised to quit smoking at all of the recall appointments and at the end of the clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Clinical examination</title><p>Several clinical parameters were recorded at the baseline, as well as being recorded at 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months after enrollment. All of the clinical examinations were performed by one calibrated examiner (SMLL).</p><p>The PPD and probing attachment level (PAL) measurements were recorded at six different sites for each tooth, excluding the third molars (i.e., the mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual and disto-lingual sites). Custom-made poly-ethylene occlusal stents were fabricated for each participant as reference guides to ensure the reproducibility of the probing sites and for measuring the probing attachment level throughout the study using a manual periodontal probe (PCP-UNC 15, Hu-Friedy probe<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Chicago, IL, USA). The presence of any plaque was recorded dichotomously as the presence or absence of plaque according to the detection of plaque deposits determined by running the tip of the periodontal probe along the tooth surface at the gingival margin of each site. BOP was designated as positive if bleeding occurred within 10&#x000a0;s of periodontal probing.</p><p>Radiographic examinations were carried out at the two deepest proximal single-root tooth-sites in each participant. The two deepest non-neighboring sites (PPD&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;mm) of the mouth on two individual teeth with well-defined angular defects were selected as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The sites were selected initially from the panoramic oral radiograph taken as part of the PPDH admission screening procedure and subsequently confirmed by paralleling periapical radiographs. The gingival crevicular fluid volumes of these sites were also recorded (last paragraph of this section).</p><p>Radiographic examinations for following up any changes in alveolar bone by standardized DSR were carried out as described by Woo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Lai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Briefly, after selecting suitable sites for follow up, a custom-made acrylic bite block attached to a Rinn XCP film holder (Rinn Corporation, Elgin, IL, USA) was constructed for each of the selected sites to produce standardized reproducible periapical radiographs for digital subtraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Rectangular and long cone techniques were used with a radiographic film requiring a short exposure time (Kodak Insight, Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY, USA) to minimize the level of radiographic exposure to the participant. The X-ray cone was also modified to allow for the rigid attachment of the bite block to the cone. As a consequence, the angulations between the X-ray source, the object and the film were reproducible. All periapical radiographs were taken using the paralleling technique with the same X-ray machine (GE 700, General Electric Co., Fairfield, CT, USA) using the same settings (70&#x000a0;kV, 15&#x000a0;mA). The size-1 radiographic films were used for the anterior regions, where size-2 radiographic films were used for the posterior regions to minimize the distortion of the films. All of the films were developed in a batch with an automatic developing machine (Periomat, D&#x000fc;rr Dental, Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany) to reduce variability during the developing process.</p><p>All of the radiographs were subsequently scanned into a computer at 600 dpi with a flatbed scanner equipped with a transparency module (Agfa Studiostar, Agfa Gaevert, Mortsel, Belgium). The images were imported into software based on the Linux system. Selected sites were defined as regions of interest (ROI) on the radiographs, and the CADIA values were calculated for each ROI according to a previously reported formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The CADIA values were used to quantify changes in the alveolar bone and were presented as the net values of two standardized radiographic images, which were recorded at different time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>GCF sampling was conducted according to the procedure reported by Jin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Briefly, for a subject tooth (same sites as the DSR study), after isolation with a cotton roll and the removal of the supragingival plaque, a standard filter GCF strip (Periopaper<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> GCF strips, IDE Interstate, Amityville, NY, USA) was inserted into the gingival crevice or pockets until mild resistance was felt. The GCF strip was then left in place for 30&#x000a0;s. The amount of GCF collected was represented by the electric conductance, which was measured immediately using a GCF meter (Periotron 8000, IDE Interstate). The electrode jaws of the GCF meter were cleaned and dried after each measurement with the machine reading set to zero. The GCF volumes of two periodontitis-free sites were also followed in each participant, preferably from the same tooth type as the diseased tooth of interest. The GCF volumes from each sample site were calculated based on their electric conductance readings, which were measured using a Periotron 8000 GFC meter, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Clinical data collection for the last participant was completed in December 2006.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis was carried out using the statistics software: SPSS (SPSS 16.0, Chicago, IL, USA).

A total of 40 male smokers with chronic periodontitis were screened, and 32 met the inclusion criteria and were arbitrarily allocated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Seventeen participants were assigned to receive PH001 (placebo), with the remaining 15 being assigned to receive PH002 (mYJ). A total of 7 (21.9&#x000a0;%) participants dropped out from the trial during the study period: 2 (11.8&#x000a0;%) and 3 (20.0&#x000a0;%) participants withdrew from the placebo and CM groups, respectively, because they believed that they had recovered already, while 1 participant from each group did not complete the trial because they left Hong Kong (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p>The baseline characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

The results revealed that both groups showed improved plaque control and gingival inflammation (reflected by BOP&#x000a0;% reduction) at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months post treatment commencement. However, the levels of plaque and the clinical signs of periodontal tissue inflammation appeared to increase beyond this point in both groups. The mean PPD and PAL values improved and became stable at 6&#x02013;9&#x000a0;months, although the mean PPD value showed a tendency towards the baseline level at 12&#x000a0;months. No differences were observed in the mean Pl&#x000a0;%, BOP&#x000a0;% and PPD values between the test and control groups at any of the follow-up time points. Furthermore, the changes observed in the mean PAL over time were not significant for either of the groups compared with the baseline, except at 12&#x000a0;months, where we observed a significant improvement in PAL compared with the baseline in the control participants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Demography, pre-treatment clinical and CADIA sites profiles of participants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Characteristic</th><th align="left">Categories</th><th align="left">Placebo (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14)</th><th align="left">mYJ (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11)</th><th align="left">Test</th><th align="left">Statistics</th><th align="left">

Plaque control improved considerably at these periodontitis sites after the therapy, although the reoccurrence of some plaque was observed at the end of the study (i.e., at 12&#x000a0;months). A similar outcome was also observed for the percentage of sites with BOP and PAL. It is noteworthy that the mean depth of selected pockets sites in the mYJ group appeared significantly greater than that of the placebo group (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02, unpaired <italic>t</italic> test, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, b).

The symptoms of CM syndrome in patients suffering with periodontitis include <italic>stomach</italic>-<italic>heat</italic>, <italic>kidney</italic>-<italic>yin</italic> deficiency and weakness in the <italic>qi</italic> and <italic>blood</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Of the male smokers diagnosed with chronic periodontitis prior to this study, 80&#x000a0;% were also diagnosed with SH and KYD syndrome and were consequently invited to participate in our clinical trial (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] reported that 27.8&#x000a0;% of the participants in their cohort study of 26 mild, 41 moderate and 23 severe conveniently recruited periodontitis participants (50&#x000a0;% female, unknown smoking habit) were diagnosed to have SH and KYD. The results of a subsequent study by the same group based on a similar group of conveniently recruited periodontitis patients (52.5&#x000a0;% female, unknown smoking habit) revealed that half of the participants experienced <italic>kidney deficiency</italic> syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Both of these studies showed a lower prevalence of SH and KYD than our current cohort. This difference was attributed to the fact that it was relatively easy to recruit and secure our trial sample size, especially male smokers with severe chronic periodontitis. However, a more in depth population study would be required to fully establish the relationship between severe chronic periodontitis and SH and/or KYD.</p><p>This study was therefore deigned to evaluate the effects of mYJ on the proximal periodontal radiographic alveolar bone density using the CADIA values as the primary dependent variable following therapy. In line with results from previous trials involving smokers treated periodontally according to a variety of different approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], we did not expect to see significant differences in the non-radiographic periodontal clinical parameters like PPD reduction or PAL gain in the current small sample of smokers followed, instead CADIA was chosen as the dependent variable.</p><p>In general, despite having severe periodontitis, the smokers in the current study exhibited favorable initial periodontal healing in response to non-surgical periodontal therapy, as exemplified by the reduction in their PPD and PAL, which were similar to those reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The favorable clinical responses observed in this case were comparable with those reported in previous studies regarding non-surgical therapy in smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Similar to the results of an earlier report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], our control group of smokers exhibited only minor changes in their amount of radiographic bone density at 12&#x000a0;months after the commencement of non-surgical periodontal therapy compared with the baseline. In contrast, the test participants appeared to maintain the initial bone density gained after the non-surgical periodontal therapy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). mYJ could therefore maintain the radiographic bone density gained after the non-surgical periodontal therapy for up to 12&#x000a0;month after the commencement of treatment. The control medication, however, did not maintain the radiographic bone density of the smokers 11&#x000a0;months after the periodontal therapy.</p><p>An un-blinded study by Luo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] used a 1&#x000a0;month, twice-daily CM recipe containing 12 different ingredients, including <italic>gypsum fibrosum</italic>, <italic>Radix et Rhizoma Rehmanniae</italic>, <italic>Rhizoma Anemarrhenae</italic> and <italic>Cortex Phellodendri</italic> as an adjunctive therapy in a 3-month clinical trial involving non-surgical periodontal therapy on twenty 40&#x02013;50-year-old females (test group). The control group received non-surgical periodontal therapy without any placebo agent. The authors did not profile the CM status of their participants before and after the study period. Except for a lower BOP&#x000a0;% value in the test group at 3 months, the changes in the PAL and PPD values between the two groups were not significant over the study period. One earlier study compared the twice-daily oral administration of a 4&#x000a0;mg dose of <italic>Guchi</italic> pills over 3&#x000a0;months (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;50) with the four-times daily administration of an oral 200&#x000a0;mg dose of spiramycin over 5&#x000a0;days (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;40) as adjunctive agents to non-surgical periodontal therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. <italic>Guchi</italic> pill contains 18 different ingredients, including <italic>Radix et Rhizoma Rehmanniae, Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae</italic> and <italic>Rhizoma Drynariae</italic>, which are three of the eight active ingredients of mYJ. The study monitored the participants for 24&#x000a0;months after the initiation of the study (i.e., the baseline). The authors reported that participants in the <italic>Guchi</italic> pills and spiramycin groups improved considerably. The 90 participants in this study consisted of a mixture of aggressive and chronic periodontitis patients with mild-to-severe disease at presentation and varied CM syndromes at baseline, including 28&#x000a0;% with SH and KYD. Unfortunately the authors presented limited clinical information, making it difficult to establish the true efficacy of the CM preparation or the spiramycin as adjunctive agents in non-surgical periodontal treatment.</p><p>With reference to the literature, purified or enriched extracts from the ingredients of the mYJ preparation used in this study have been independently reported to positively affect bone density in laboratory animals and cell cultures. For example, <italic>Rehmanniae</italic> has been reported to stimulate the proliferation of osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]; <italic>Rhizoma Anemarhenae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and <italic>Drynariae Rhizoma</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] have been reported to promote bone formation; and <italic>Achyranthis bidentatae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and <italic>Puerariae radix</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] have been reported inhibit bone loss. The remaining ingredients of mYJ including <italic>Phellodendri cortex</italic> and <italic>Ophiopogonis</italic> root have been reported to attenuate bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and protect frog palatal epithelial cells against sodium metabisulphite induced damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], respectively. The major alkaloid component of <italic>Phellodendri cortex</italic>, berberine, has been reported to modulate the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of the iNOS gene, inhibit the activity of COX-2 and reduce the production of PGE<sub>2</sub> in LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. <italic>Cortex Phellodendri</italic> and rhizome <italic>Rehmanniae</italic> have been shown to inhibit <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The major ingredients in mYJ could potentially attenuate periodontal inflammation and promote bone healing.</p><p>The control flavoring agent: <italic>Momordica Charantia</italic> despite having CM <italic>heat</italic> clearing alleviation of dental pain plus hypoglycemic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], was not reported to possess bone cell stimulation functions. The dose and duration use of <italic>Momordica Charantia</italic> administered could not clear the SH of all the periodontitis-affected male smokers.</p><p>The fact that 64&#x02013;73&#x000a0;% of the mYJ group participants remained free from SH and/or KYD syndromes after the 6-month recall in the study indicated that mYJ was effective in alleviating the corresponding syndrome in these smoking periodontitis individuals. The reason why 3-to-4 mYJ group participants continued exhibiting SH and/or KYD syndrome, remains to be elucidated.</p><p>The mYJ formula might maintain the improved alveolar bone density from the immediate post-treatment stage up to 12&#x000a0;months, while the positive hard tissue effects detectable on radiographs at selected sites with placebo adjunctive to non-surgical periodontal therapy could only be maintained over the first 6&#x000a0;months. By 9&#x000a0;months, radiographic bone densities of control sites had reverted to the pre-treatment levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The adjunctive use of mYJ preserved the post-treatment increases in the radiographic alveolar bone density at the study sites and led to an overall improvement in SH and KYD compared with the controls.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13020_2016_111_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>
