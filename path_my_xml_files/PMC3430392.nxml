Although targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the prevention of CVD has been shown to be effective, evidence exists to indicate that significant cardiovascular (CV) risk remains in patients receiving 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) &#x02013; a risk that may be correlated with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Among the various tactics under investigation to increase HDL-C, inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) appears the most adept to raise these levels. Although torcetrapib, a CETP inhibitor, demonstrated significant beneficial changes in HDL-C and LDL-C after 12 months of therapy when coadministered with atorvastatin, patients in the torcetrapib arm experienced a rise in mortality, including increased risk of death from CV and non-CV causes as well as a significant rise in major CV events. Later studies established that the adverse effects of torcetrapib were produced from molecule-specific off-target effects and not to the mechanism of CETP inhibition. These untoward outcomes have not been detected with anacetrapib, the third of the CETP inhibitors to enter Phase III trials. Furthermore, treatment with anacetrapib revealed both a statistically significant decrease in LDL-C and increase in HDL-C over placebo. While the place in therapy of niacin and fibrates to reduce CV events is currently in question secondary to the Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL Cholesterol/High Triglyceride and Impact on Global Health Outcomes and the Action to Control CV Risk in Diabetes trials, the ongoing large-scale, randomized&#x02013;placebo, controlled-outcomes study with anacetrapib coadministered with statin treatment will not only test the hypothesis if CETP inhibition lowers residual CV risk but will also provide insight as to which patient subgroups might benefit the most from anacetrapib despite aggressive therapy with statins.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anacetrapib</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular disease</kwd><kwd>cholesteryl ester transfer protein</kwd><kwd>cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor</kwd><kwd>dyslipidemia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality within the United States (US) and worldwide.

Lipids secreted from hepatocytes in the form of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and LDL-C particles are taken up by the peripheral tissues via the LDL receptor. Alternatively, excess cholesterol in the periphery is removed and transported back to the liver by HDL-C via scavenger receptors for recycling and excretion from the body. This mechanism is most commonly termed reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-vhrm-8-483">Figure 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-vhrm-8-483">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-vhrm-8-483">31</xref> The role HDL-C plays in the removal of cholesterol from the body by means of RCT is essential in maintaining cholesterol equilibrium and is believed to subsequently give HDL-C its atheroprotective properties. Further contributing to the beneficial effects of HDL-C mediated RCT are the anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiapoptotic, antithrombotic, vasodilatory, and anti-infectious properties.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-vhrm-8-483">32</xref></p><p>Within the RCT pathway exists CETP, a hepatically derived hydrophobic glycoprotein secreted from the liver that binds to HDL-C. CETP mediates the equimolar transfer of cholesteryl ester (CE) from HDL to apolipoprotein (apo) B lipoproteins (chylomicra, VLDL-C, and LDL-C) and the equimolar transfer of triglycerides (TGs) from VLDL-C and LDL-C to HDL-C.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-vhrm-8-483">33</xref> The involvement of CETP in the RCT pathway is believed to result in both antiatherogenic and atherogenic activity. CETP-mediated transfer of CE accounts for the return of cholesterol from the peripheral cells to the liver via LDL receptors. Cholesterol can then be secreted into bile and eliminated from the body, leading to potentially antiatherogenic results. Conversely, when LDL receptors are unable to function adequately, CETP leads to the accumulation of LDL-C in the plasma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-vhrm-8-483">34</xref> The exchange of CE from HDL-C to apo B lipoproteins may also prevent efflux of cholesterol from peripheral cells and diminish circulating levels of HDL-C, which can reduce return of cholesterol from the arterial walls back to the liver.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-vhrm-8-483">35</xref> In addition, CETP activity causes HDL-C and LDL-C to become TG-heavy, giving way to small-dense HDL-C and LDL-C. The small-dense LDL-C has an increased susceptibility to oxidative modification by TG lipase, which promotes uptake within the arterial wall by macrophage scavenger receptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-vhrm-8-483">36</xref> Predominance of this smaller less buoyant LDL-C has been associated with up to a threefold increased risk of developing CAD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-vhrm-8-483">37</xref> Considering the potentially atherogenic effects of CETP, inhibition of this protein and the ability to increase antiatherogenic HDL-C has generated great interest in the prevention and treatment of CAD and atherosclerosis.</p><p>The correlation between CETP deficiencies and CV risk remains unclear at this point. Initial studies indicated that deficiencies in CETP were associated with an increased risk of CAD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-vhrm-8-483">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-vhrm-8-483">39</xref> However, the Women&#x02019;s Genome Health Study revealed opposing results, suggesting cardioprotective benefits of CETP inactivity through an HDL-C-mediated pathway.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-vhrm-8-483">40</xref> Finally, results of the Honolulu Heart Study revealed that men with CETP mutations had the lowest risk of CHD; however, these results were not statistically significant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-vhrm-8-483">41</xref> Therefore, the outcomes of these trials and the potential CV benefit of CETP modulation merit further research in this field.</p><p>Anacetrapib is a once daily, orally administered, CETP inhibitor that is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials. Similar to torcetrapib, anacetrapib exhibits its effect by forming a reversible bond between CETP and HDL-C. Formation of this bond results in the inhibition of CETP-mediated CE and TG transfer between HDL-C and apo B lipoproteins, consequently increasing circulating antiatherogenic HDL-C.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-vhrm-8-483">27</xref> In comparison to the other CETP inhibitors, torcetrapib and dalcetrapib, anacetrapib shares a similar potency with torcetrapib and is a significantly more potent inhibitor of CETP than dalcetrapib.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-vhrm-8-483">29</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, and pharmacodynamics</title><p>The pharmacokinetics of anacetrapib have been evaluated in healthy humans, dyslipidemic subjects, and animal models.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-vhrm-8-483">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-vhrm-8-483">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-vhrm-8-483">45</xref> Following a 1-hour delay, anacetrapib is promptly absorbed with peak concentrations arising approximately 4 hours after administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-vhrm-8-483">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-vhrm-8-483">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-vhrm-8-483">45</xref> Although anacetrapib is highly plasma protein-bound, the binding is reversible.

Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates for CYP pathways are not modified by anacetrapib. When midazolam was used as a probe-sensitive CYP3A substrate, anacetrapib treatment did not affect the activity of this enzyme, as depicted by a lack of variance in the plasma midazolam concentration. Similarly, a study evaluating the pharmacokinetic effects of simvastatin, also a sensitive CYP3A substrate, administered as monotherapy or in combination with anacetrapib, revealed no difference.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-vhrm-8-483">48</xref> Subsequent to these trials, studies have been performed with digoxin and warfarin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-vhrm-8-483">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-vhrm-8-483">50</xref> Digoxin is a substrate of the P-gylcoprotein (Pgp)-mediated transport pathway. Metabolism of digoxin does not rely on nor does it affect CYP metabolism. Multiple dose administration of anacetrapib 100 mg did not affect single-dose pharmacokinetics of digoxin or warfarin in healthy treatment groups. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is required for warfarin or digoxin when used concomitantly with anacetrapib.</p><p>Pharmacodynamic studies to analyze the serum CETP inhibitory potential of anacetrapib have been completed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-vhrm-8-483">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-vhrm-8-483">44</xref> A study by Krishna et al revealed that while anacetrapib exerted a serum CETP maximum inhibition of nearly 90% at 4 hours on the first day, the inhibitory potential decreased 5% to 10% at the same time point after 14 days. On day 1, the trough inhibitory potential was approximately 80%, and after 14 days of repeated doses, the inhibitory potential was diminished about 20%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-vhrm-8-483">44</xref> An elucidation of this occurrence may be due to the threefold increase in CETP concentration observed throughout the study. Although a precise explanation as to the CETP mass increase is not confirmed, Clark et al credited this increase to the strong adherence of CETP for HDL-C with development of a non-productive complex.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-vhrm-8-483">51</xref> Clark et al further noted that the CETP mass increase should not interfere with HDL-C elevation as the emergence of CETP concentration is not significant compared to the amount of HDL particles.

The C-reactive protein reduction of 30.9% with atorvastatin monotherapy was attenuated with combination treatment. All of the treatment arms tolerated anacetrapib monotherapy and combination therapy well, as the incidence of adverse effects were similar between the groups. There were no deaths or serious adverse effects. The most common complaint included constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, and myalgia. Most notably, there was no effect on either SBP or DBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-vhrm-8-483">Figure 4</xref>).

In addition, there was a significant increase in particle concentration of very small LDL4b (75%). Lastly, anacetrapib 150 mg significantly increased large HDL2b by 373%, yet yielded no significant change in smaller HDL2a + 3 particle concentrations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-vhrm-8-483">53</xref></p><p>A model-based approach was used to identify a suitable dose for future trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-vhrm-8-483">54</xref> Considering the various variables examined (ie, formulation, diet, and study population), a dose of 100 mg for anacetrapib was selected for future study in Phase III trials that was not previously analyzed in the Bloomfield et al Phase IIb trial. The lipid-altering effects demonstrated in a Phase III trial, which was published during the review of the model-based approach, validated the predictions made.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-vhrm-8-483">55</xref></p><sec><title>DEFINE trial</title><p>Unlike the trial by Bloomfield et al, patients in The Determining the Efficacy and Tolerability of CETP Inhibition with Anacetrapib (DEFINE) study were included if they had pre-existing CHD or were at high risk of CHD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-vhrm-8-483">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-vhrm-8-483">56</xref> This international, double-blind, Phase III, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the lipid level effects, tolerability, and safety profile of anacetrapib. Of the 2757 patients who were initially screened, 1623 patients were randomized to receive anacetrapib 100 mg or placebo daily in combination with statin therapy with or without other antilipemic agents. Each of the groups included patients aged 18 to 80 years who had LDL-C between 50 to 100 mg/dL, HDL-C less than 60 mg/dL, and TG not more than 400 mg/dL. The majority of patients had CHD, while 45.3% had risk factors for CHD. Only 0.7% of the patients were not on statin treatment.</p><p>The efficacy endpoints in the study were the percent change from baseline within the two treatment groups in LDL-C at 24 weeks and the safety and tolerability profile of anacetrapib during the 76 weeks. As in the Bloomfield et al trial, LDL-C was chosen as a primary endpoint because it is a CV risk factor that anacetrapib impacts. The change in LDL-C up to week 76 and change in HDL-C, non-HDL-C, apo B, and apo A-I after 24 weeks and 76 weeks of therapy were secondary efficacy endpoints. In addition to the safety endpoints of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalization due to unstable angina, other variables evaluated included blood pressure and electrolyte levels. The DEFINE trial analyzed the CV endpoints via a Bayesian approach to exclude the 25% CV events that occurred with torcetrapib. After 24 weeks of treatment, DEFINE established both a statistically significant decrease in LDL-C and increase in HDL-C over placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-vhrm-8-483">Figure 5</xref>). These effects extended to week 76. Although secondary efficacy outcomes were also positively affected versus placebo, confirmation of a lack of benefit with C-reactive protein levels was established. Furthermore, the Bayesian analysis confirmed a 94% probability that anacetrapib would not produce a 25% increase in CV adverse outcomes previously detected with torcetrapib (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-vhrm-8-483">Table 1</xref>). Although not all the surrogate markers originally used to test the off-target effects of torcetrapib have been analyzed with anacetrapib, the positive CV results of the DEFINE trial have assisted in reinvestigating the hypothesis that CETP inhibition is cardioprotective. Ideally, a largescale, randomized, placebo-controlled trial representing a variety of ethnic groups while evaluating the effects of long-term reduction of LDL-C to very low levels should be conducted in order to offer definitive outcomes as to the safety and efficacy of anacetrapib.</p></sec><sec><title>REVEAL trial</title><p>Anacetrapib is currently under investigation in the Randomized Evaluation of the Effects of Anacetrapib through Lipid Modification (REVEAL), a large-scale, randomized, placebocontrolled trial of the clinical effects of anacetrapib among people with established vascular disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-vhrm-8-483">57</xref> This double-blind Phase III trial of anacetrapib 100 mg daily will test the hypothesis if anacetrapib will reduce the incidence of major coronary events (ie, coronary death, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization procedure) in patients with a history of CVD who are taking statin therapy for lowering LDL-C.</p><p>The REVEAL trial is currently enrolling patients 50 years or older who meet at least one of the following inclusion criteria: history of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease, or peripheral arterial disease; or diabetes mellitus with other evidence of symptomatic CHD (ie, treatment or hospitalization for angina or a history of coronary revascularization or acute coronary syndrome). This international multicenter trial is expected to enroll 30,000 patients and is estimated to be completed by 2017.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-vhrm-8-483">57</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Alternative agents to raise HDL-C</title><p>There are three agents in the quiver of currently available pharmacological agents to promote raising HDL-C: nicotinic acid (niacin), fibric acid derivatives (fibrates), and statins. Of these agents, niacin has a more pronounced effect on HDL-C, raising HDL-C by 15% to 35%. In addition to its effects on HDL-C, niacin has also been shown to decrease LDL-C by 5% to 25% and decrease TGs by 20% to 50%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-vhrm-8-483">2</xref> Niacin is believed to increase circulating HDL-C by inhibiting the uptake and catabolism of HDL&#x02013;apo A within the liver without altering HDL&#x02013;apo A synthesis. By reducing the catabolic rate, niacin prolongs the half-life of HDL-C, allowing for greater accumulation of cholesterol and larger, more antiatherogenic, HDL-C molecules.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-vhrm-8-483">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-vhrm-8-483">59</xref> Additionally, niacin has also been shown to indirectly increase HDL-C by decreasing the activity of CETP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-vhrm-8-483">60</xref></p><p>Niacin is available in three oral formulations: immediate release, extended release, and sustained release. Traditional immediate-release niacin is dosed two to three times daily, whereas the newer extended-release formulations can be administered once daily. The most common adverse effects associated with niacin, which may affect tolerability and adherence, include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough, pruritus, and most notably flushing of the face and upper body. Niacin-induced flushing is believed to result from rapid elevations in serum nicotinic acid. In an effort to prevent these rapid elevations, extended release formulations of niacin have been created. The incidence and severity of flushing may be reduced by administering aspirin 30 minutes prior to niacin. Additionally, the dosage of niacin should be slowly titrated to minimize this unwanted adverse effect. It should be noted that tolerance to the incidence and severity of niacin develops over several weeks following initiation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-vhrm-8-483">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-vhrm-8-483">62</xref></p><p>Despite niacin&#x02019;s ability to substantially increase HDL-C, evidence to support the efficacy of niacin to reduce CV outcomes is inconsistent. A 2010 meta-analysis of niacin alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering agents concluded that the use of niacin significantly reduced major coronary events, stroke, and any CV events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63-vhrm-8-483">63</xref> Several of the studies included in the analysis took place before statin therapy became the standard of care. In contrast to this meta-analysis, the Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL Cholesterol/High Triglyceride and Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial, which evaluated the effects of extended release niacin in addition to intensive statin therapy in the prevention of CV events, was terminated early due to a lack of efficacy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-vhrm-8-483">64</xref> Results of AIM-HIGH have called into question the benefits of increasing HDL-C with niacin in addition to intensive statin therapy.</p><p>Although fibrates (fenofibrate, fenofibric acid, gemfibrozil) exert a more profound effect on TGs (20% to 50% reduction), these agents have been shown to increase HDL-C levels by 10% to 35% and also lower LDL-C by 5% to 20%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-vhrm-8-483">2</xref> The exact mechanism by which fibrates exert their lipid-modifying capabilities has not been fully determined; however, it is understood that these agents activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b1; (PPAR-&#x003b1;). Fibrate-mediated activation of PPAR-&#x003b1; results in both upregulation and downregulation of several genes that partake in lipid metabolism and transport within the liver and adipose tissue.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-vhrm-8-483">65</xref> In addition to the aforementioned atherosclerotic benefits of fibrates, these agents are believed to possess several pleiotropic effects. Fibrates, in particular, have been shown to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and C-reactive protein &#x02013; each linked to atherosclerosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-vhrm-8-483">66</xref></p><p>Within the US, there are two Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved fibrates: gemfibrozil and fenofibrate. FDA-approved derivates of fenofibrate have also been developed. These include micronized fenofibrate and fenofibric acid. Owing to its preference among patients and physicians, fenofibrate is administered once daily, whereas gemfibrozil is given twice daily with meals. Although fibrates are generally well tolerated, the most commonly reported side effects are gastrointestinal upset, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, cramping, muscle aches, and rash. A major disadvantage of gemfibrozil is the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when administered with statins. Glucuronidation, a pathway for renal excretion of lipophilic statins, is significantly inhibited by gemfibrozil but not fenofibrate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67-vhrm-8-483">67</xref> Therefore, fenofibrate is preferred in those who require combined therapy with a statin and fibrate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68-vhrm-8-483">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70-vhrm-8-483">70</xref></p><p>Similarly to niacin, the effect of raising HDL-C with fibrates has not consistently resulted in positive CV outcomes. In the Veterans Affairs HDL Intervention Trial study, the use of gemfibrozil to raise HDL-C and lower TG levels in patients with a history of CHD and an LDL-C level of less than 140 mg/dL decreased the rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction and death from CHD by 22%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71-vhrm-8-483">71</xref> Further analysis of this study revealed that the concentrations of HDL-C achieved in the gemfibrozil treatment group were strongly correlated with significant reductions in coronary events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72-vhrm-8-483">72</xref> However, there are rather disheartening results from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) lipid study. In this landmark trial, the addition of fenofibrate to open-label simvastatin therapy in high-risk diabetic patients failed to reduce the rate of CV events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73-vhrm-8-483">73</xref> Disappointing results of the AIM-HIGH and ACCORD studies have clouded the previously clear correlation between raising HDL-C and preventing CV endpoints.</p><p>Of the agents noted to have an impact on serum HDL-C, statins have been shown to have the smallest effect, raising HDL-C by 5% to 15%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-vhrm-8-483">2</xref> Within the statin realm, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin have the greatest potential for raising HDL-C.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74-vhrm-8-483">74</xref> Statins display their effect on cholesterol by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. Reductions in hepatocyte cholesterol concentrations result in increased expression of LDL receptors, which promote the removal of circulating LDL-C and LDL precursors. In addition, statins may lower LDL-C independent of LDL receptors by inhibiting the synthesis and secretion of apo B lipoproteins and TG-rich lipoproteins from the liver.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75-vhrm-8-483">75</xref> Although statins do in fact raise HDL-C, the CV benefit seen with this class is believed to be attributed to reductions in LDL-C as well as their aforementioned pleiotropic effects.</p><p>There are currently seven available statins approved for use within the US: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin, each of which are administered once daily. Because the majority of cholesterol synthesis occurs at night, it is recommended that agents with shorter half-lives, such as simvastatin, be administered in the evening or at bedtime. Statins are well tolerated in most patients, and their adverse effects can be seen with each agent throughout the class. The most common adverse effects of statins include myalgia, myopathy, gastrointestinal discomfort, and elevations in liver transaminases. One of the more serious side effects seen with statins is rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that patients newly initiated on statins be monitored for myopathy. Once identified, patients experiencing myopathy should have their statin dose decreased or if not possible, the medication should be discontinued. Additionally, concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis; thus, these patients should be monitored more scrupulously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75-vhrm-8-483">75</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The function of CETP is vital to lipid metabolism, and inhibition of this glycoprotein signifies a potential strategy to manage dyslipidemia. Compared to the current FDA-approved agents, anacetrapib increases HDL-C levels above that observed with niacin or fibrates. The safety and tolerability of anacetrapib was confirmed in multiple studies including DEFINE, and the off-target adverse effects previously reported with torcetrapib were not replicated with anacetrapib. While the place in therapy of niacin and fibrates is currently in question, the ongoing outcomes of the REVEAL study will not only test the hypothesis if CETP inhibition lowers residual CV risk but also provide insight as to which patient subgroups might benefit the most from anacetrapib despite aggressive therapy with statins. Pending the results of the REVEAL trial, anacetrapib may potentially be the first FDA-approved agent in this class to treat patients with dyslipidemia and those with proven atherosclerotic CVD.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-vhrm-8-483"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this

The majority of CE originates in HDL-C via a reaction carried out by LCAT, whereas the bulk of TG stems from the liver and intestine as VLDL or chylomicrons, respectively. LPL and HL hydrolyze a portion of TG from VLDL, which converts VLDL to LDL. Cells within the liver and peripheral tissue that express the LDL receptor take up excess LDL. In addition, macrophages also take up LDL and are converted to foam cells. Esterified and free (unesterified) cholesterol (FC) is then taken up by HDL via the SR-B1 (Pathway 1) and by LDL via the LDL-R (pathway 2).
