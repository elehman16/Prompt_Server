These three classes of endogenous opioid peptides have distinct effects on food intake, nutrient selection, and reward. The role of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP, which interacts with <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>-opioid receptors (MORs), in the regulation of energy balance has been extensively studied but is still not entirely understood.</p><p>When injected into the brain, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP has short-term stimulatory effects on food intake [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP can also interact with MORs expressed by hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that play a key role in regulating energy balance [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. POMC is a prohormone that is processed into several active peptides, including the melanocortin receptor (MC4-R) agonist <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH), which inhibits food intake and increases energy expenditure. AgRP is a MC4-R antagonist that increases food intake and inhibits energy expenditure. Deficiencies in POMC synthesis, peptide processing, or MC4-R signaling cause obesity in rodents and humans [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. POMC is also processed to <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP, which can antagonize the effects of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH on food intake [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Electrophysiological studies show that MORs on POMC neurons function as autoinhibitory receptors in response to the release of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02013;EP has also been shown to inhibit AgRP neurons [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (NTX) has high affinity for MORs and can inhibit food intake. NTX has well-established stimulatory effects on POMC neurons, and it has been postulated that NTX decreases food intake in part by stimulating POMC-derived <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH release. In rodents, NTX acutely stimulates POMC peptide release and POMC mRNA levels subsequently increase [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is accompanied by an increase in POMC prohormone levels in the hypothalamus and a decrease in hypothalamic <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP content, resulting in a marked decline in the ratio of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP to POMC [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>NTX has also been shown to decrease food intake in humans on a short-term basis, but when it is used alone, it has not been highly effective in producing weight loss [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, effectiveness increases when NTX is used in combination with bupropion, a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and this is the basis for the new US Food and Drug Administration-approved weight loss combination drug Contrave (NTX/bupropion; Orexigen Therapeutics, La Jolla, CA) [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It has been postulated that stimulation of POMC by bupropion can be enhanced by combination therapy with NTX. This has been confirmed by electrophysiological studies showing that bupropion stimulates POMC neurons and that NTX potentiates this stimulation by blocking <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP&#x02013;mediated POMC autoinhibition [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Little is known about the effects of NTX on brain POMC in humans or why NTX alone does not have more robust effects on energy balance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the effects of NTX on brain POMC in human subjects could be assessed by measuring changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neuropeptide concentrations. Prior rodent studies have shown that CSF levels of POMC correlate with hypothalamic POMC mRNA levels, and we have shown that high levels of POMC are present in human CSF and may be a biomarker for hypothalamic POMC activity [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We also hypothesized that NTX could induce changes in other neuropeptide and hormone systems that could attenuate the effects of POMC stimulation on energy balance, thus providing an explanation for the relatively mild effect of NTX on energy balance. Therefore, we measured AgRP levels in CSF and plasma, because NTX can stimulate AgRP mRNA levels in the rodent hypothalamus [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and there is evidence that plasma AgRP may be a biomarker of brain AgRP activity [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Effects of NTX on cortisol were also studied, because endogenous opioids inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and stimulation of the HPA axis by NTX could attenuate effects of POMC stimulation on food intake [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Accordingly, we have examined the effects of 2 and 7 days of NTX vs placebo treatment on POMC, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP, AgRP, and cortisol levels in CSF and on AgRP and cortisol levels in plasma in 14 healthy subjects. Effects of NTX on leptin, soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), and insulin concentrations and on measures of hunger or satiety as assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS) were also studied.</p><sec id="s5"><title>1. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s6"><title>A. Study Participants and Protocol</title><p>Fourteen healthy subjects, 10 men and four women, ranging from 19 to 47 years of age, completed the study. Women were studied in the early follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. There were eight lean, three overweight, and three obese participants (body mass index range, 18 to 36 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). An additional subject developed a mild headache after the first lumbar puncture (LP) and, per study protocol, did not undergo a second LP. All participants were nonsmokers, had no history of substance abuse, and were not taking medications. Subjects were excluded if they had any clinically significant medical condition or history of eating disorder or recent weight change &#x000b1;5% over the previous 6 months. All participants had a screening visit to confirm their eligibility, which included a physical examination, screening blood work (<italic>i.e.</italic>, complete blood cell count and metabolic panel), electrocardiogram, and urine toxicology to screen for opiate use. Pregnancy was ruled out by <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-human chorionic gonadotropin test.</p><p>The study was a double-blinded, crossover study with seven subjects per group. The first group received 2 days of NTX or placebo in random order and the second group received 7 days of NTX or placebo in random order. The dosage of NTX was 50 mg daily at 9:00 <sc>pm</sc>. An LP was performed in the morning between 8:00 <sc>am</sc> and 10:00 <sc>am</sc> after a 12-hour overnight fast on day 3 in the first group and on day 8 in the second group. Then, 4 to 12 weeks later, subjects were crossed over from their original random assignment to receive either NTX or placebo for 2 or 7 days and had a second LP on day 3 or 8.</p><p>A blood sample was obtained and participants completed a VAS questionnaire at the time of the two LPs. All LPs were performed by one of the study authors (R.S.) using a 25-G Whitcare needle; the first 0.5 mL of CSF was discarded before collection of the 10-mL study sample. The procedure was well tolerated, as we have previously reported [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This study was approved by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before their participation.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>B.

Discussion</title><p>Using CSF neuropeptide measurements as a surrogate for brain POMC activity, this study examined the effects of NTX treatment in humans. Significant changes in POMC-derived peptide levels were demonstrated that parallel some of the effects of NTX on brain POMC in rodents. Furthermore, changes in AgRP and cortisol levels were also demonstrated after NTX treatment that could mitigate the effects of POMC stimulation on energy balance. In addition, there is some evidence that the neuropeptide and hormone responses to opioid antagonism differs in lean vs OW/OB individuals.</p><p>CSF <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP levels increased after both 2 and 7 days of NTX treatment, but CSF POMC levels did not change. This is consistent with rodent studies that showed acute stimulatory effects of NTX on <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP release, whereas stimulation of POMC mRNA occurred after 7 days [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, it may be that longer duration of treatment with NTX could lead to an increase in CSF POMC levels. The ratio of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP to POMC in CSF increased after NTX treatment by 80% compared with placebo. This is the inverse of the changes noted in the rodent hypothalamus, where levels of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP and the ratio of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP to POMC fall after NTX treatment [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This could indicate selective release of the processed peptide or an effect on POMC processing. CSF <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP levels increased in both lean and obese subjects, but the percent increase was higher in the obese vs the lean group, consistent with increased endogenous opioid inhibition of POMC neurons in obese subjects. Of note, there is evidence that brain MOR availability is altered in obese subjects [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although it is <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH that interacts with brain MC4-Rs, we were unable to reliably detect <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH in CSF with a highly specific assay, possibly due to <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH degradation or inactivation by the enzyme prolylcarboxypeptidase [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH assay is specific for the 13 amino-acid, amidated peptide and does not detect the 12 amino-acid, inactivated peptide. However, prior rodent studies have shown that hypothalamic <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH levels change in parallel in response to NTX [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, it is likely that the NTX-induced changes in CSF <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP levels reflect changes in both hypothalamic <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH levels. However, the inability to directly assess <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH levels is a weakness of the study.</p><p>Despite the stimulatory effects of NTX on POMC in animals and on POMC peptide release in humans, as documented by the current study, effects on feeding and body weight are modest. Therefore, we examined other potential NTX-induced changes that could attenuate the POMC-mediated effects on energy balance. Effects of NTX on AgRP levels in CSF and plasma were examined because there is evidence that <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02013;EP can also inhibit AgRP neurons [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Plasma AgRP levels (measured by ELISA) tended to increase after NTX treatment, but the change was not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06). Changes were similar in lean and obese subjects. There was no change in CSF AgRP levels measured by ELISA or RIA in the group as a whole. However, a distinct difference was noted when the percent change in CSF AgRP levels measured by RIA was compared in the lean vs OW/OB subjects. CSF AgRP levels decreased by 21.6% after NTX treatment in the lean subjects compared with an increase of 27.5% in the OW/OB subjects. Of note, AgRP<sub>83-132</sub> possesses more biological activity than the full-length peptide [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We have confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography that both forms of AgRP are present in CSF [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, in the obese subjects in the current study, there was a more robust increase in AgRP as well as in <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP after NTX treatment.</p><p>Effects of NTX treatment on plasma and CSF cortisol levels were also studied because endogenous opioids inhibit the HPA axis and stimulation of the HPA axis by NTX could also limit the effects of NTX on food intake [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Plasma and CSF cortisol levels increased after 2 and 7 days of NTX treatment. Endogenous opioids inhibit the HPA axis in rodents via inhibition of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and opioid antagonism results in stimulation of the HPA axis [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In humans, NTX and other opioid antagonists have been shown to stimulate adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol release, but this has only been studied acutely after a single dose [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We now report that this increase persisted at 7 days and was accompanied by a significant increase in CSF cortisol levels. The increases in plasma and CSF cortisol levels were similar when lean and OW/OB subjects were compared. This longer-term increase in plasma cortisol levels and the increase in CSF cortisol levels may impact energy balance and could be another factor that mitigates the effects of POMC stimulation by NTX on food intake. Of note, there was a significant positive correlation between the changes in plasma AgRP levels with changes in both plasma cortisol and CSF cortisol levels after NTX treatment. This positive correlation is consistent with prior animal studies showing that corticosterone stimulates AgRP gene expression in the rodent hypothalamus [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We have also observed that plasma AgRP levels correlate with hypothalamic AgRP gene expression in rats (unpublished data) and increase in humans with elevated cortisol levels and Cushing disease [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although AgRP levels were measured in both CSF and plasma, only changes in plasma AgRP levels correlated with changes in cortisol. The explanation for this is unclear but may relate to anatomical differences in AgRP fiber tracks that gain access to CSF and blood [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Emerging evidence suggests there are distinct populations of AgRP neurons within the arcuate and one of these populations is outside the blood-brain barrier [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is possible that the population that resides outside the blood-brain barrier is the source of AgRP in blood.</p><p>There were no changes in plasma and CSF leptin levels in the study groups as a whole, but both plasma and CSF leptin levels decreased significantly in the lean subjects. The percent changes in leptin levels were significantly different when the lean and obese groups were compared. The decreased leptin levels in the lean group may maintain energy balance in the setting of POMC stimulation. Food intake was not documented in this study, but subjects were instructed to maintain their current level of food intake and exercise. In addition, no significant differences on VAS assessing hunger and satiety between NTX and placebo treatments were noted. No correlations between VAS ratings and neuropeptide levels were noted.</p><p>In summary, opioid antagonism with NTX stimulates POMC peptide release into CSF in humans, consistent with the effects on brain POMC peptide release in rodents. No effect on POMC prohormone levels was seen after 1 week. The increase in the CSF <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP-to-POMC ratio is consistent with selective release of the processed peptide or an effect on POMC processing. Furthermore, a potential stimulatory effect of NTX on AgRP levels and the persistent increase in both plasma and CSF cortisol levels may mitigate the stimulatory effects on POMC peptide release with respect to decreasing food intake. It remains to be determined if biomarkers in CSF and plasma could be used to predict responses to obesity pharmacotherapy targeting the melanocortin system.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="abbr" fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: <def-list><def-item><term id="G1">AgRP</term><def><p>agouti-related protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2"><italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-MSH</term><def><p><italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-melanocyte-stimulating hormone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3"><italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-EP</term><def><p><italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-endorphin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">CSF</term><def><p>cerebrospinal fluid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">ELISA</term><def><p>enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">HPA</term><def><p>hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">LP</term><def><p>lumbar puncture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">MC4-R</term><def><p>melanocortin receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">MOR</term><def><p><italic>&#x000b5;</italic>-opioid receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G10">NTX</term><def><p>naltrexone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G11">POMC</term><def><p>proopiomelanocortin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G12">OW/OB</term><def><p>overweight or obese</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G13">RIA</term><def><p>radioimmunoassay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G14">RRID</term><def><p>Research Resource Identifier</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G15">SEM</term><def><p>standard error of the mean</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G16">sOB-R</term><def><p>soluble leptin receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G17">VAS</term><def><p>visual analog scale.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the study subjects for their participation and the staff of the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research.</p></ack><ack><p content-type="financial-disclosure">This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grant RO1-DK093920 (S.L.W.); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences NIH Grants UL1 TR000040 and T32DK065522 (R.J.G.); the Russell Berrie Foundation Naomi Berrie Fellowship (D.A.) and the Atkins Foundation (S.L.W.).</p><p>Disclosure Summary: The authors have nothing to disclose.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References and Notes</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Yeomans</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>RW</given-names></name></person-group>
