A recent synthesis of barriers to engagement with maternity services in women with social disadvantage<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> suggested that lay workers providing non-judgemental support, working in conjunction with antenatal services, would be well received by women, however, evidence on effectiveness is lacking. The need to provide additional lay support (in this instance Pregnancy Outreach Workers, POWs) to women with identified social risk factors had been recognised in the West Midlands, and a service developed. The hypothesis was that this might improve engagement with maternity services (and thereby improve maternal and neonatal birth outcomes), and reduce postnatal depression, and we undertook a pragmatic randomised controlled trial to evaluate this.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>The study was a pragmatic, individually randomised, controlled trial across a UK geographical area containing three maternity units, where social risk factors are systematically identified at routine midwife antenatal booking. Nulliparous women under 28&#x02005;weeks gestation, with social risk factors, were eligible. Exclusions were women under 16&#x02005;years of age and teenagers already recruited to the Family Nurse Partnership Trial. Multiparous women were not included since some social support was already available for this group which could have masked a trial effect. Potentially eligible women (ie, nulliparous women with one or more social risk factor) were identified at midwife antenatal booking and given information about the trial. Following agreement, they were referred to specifically trained midwives who obtained informed consent, and randomised women. Randomisation to standard maternity care, or addition of the POW service was by telephone using a registered trials unit. Randomisation lists were computer generated (by trial statistician) using random block sizes (4&#x02013;12) and stratified for Maternity Trust.</p><p>POWs were trained to provide individual case management for the women including home visits, and were integrated into the community midwifery teams. Objectives were to encourage women to attend antenatal appointments, make healthy lifestyle choices, to provide social/emotional support, and help ensure benefits, housing difficulties and mental health problems were managed. In the postnatal period (to 6&#x02005;weeks postpartum), POWs also provided breast feeding and advice about infant care. The POW service was developed before the trial began, but not available outside the trial, and was provided by an independent organisation, who had access to supervision from experts with specific skills and knowledge.</p><p>Standard UK maternity care (control) included provision for referring women with social risk factors to specialist midwives or directing them to other agencies but did not include the offer of the POW service.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Outcome measures, data collection and follow-up</title><p>The two primary outcomes were engagement with antenatal care and maternal postnatal depression 8&#x02013;12&#x02005;weeks after birth.

The trial was a pragmatic one to evaluate a real-time National Health Service implementation, so evaluation had to take place urgently, otherwise trial design would have been compromised.

Following a successful initial 6 months pilot where 475 women were recruited, it was observed that 64% had two or more social risk factors, and it was agreed to increase the sample size to allow power to detect differences in primary outcomes in the prespecified subgroup of women with two or more social risk factors, that is, so that the required sample size of 421 would be recruited within this subgroup.

For binary outcomes, we reported the number (percentage) in each arm, along with relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat, calculated as 1 divided by risk difference; and also the risk difference (RD). For RRs, we calculated 95% CIs using standard normal approximation methods, and tested for statistical significance using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Analyses were carried out in Stata V.12, according to intention to treat principles, and included women for whom outcomes could be collected. Analyses of primary outcomes were replicated independently.

This was at the UK recommended level of 10<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> visits in both groups. Various other initiatives to encourage antenatal attendance and engagement had already occurred, thereby reducing potential for further improvement. Since antenatal attendance was unaffected, it is not surprising that maternal and neonatal birth outcomes were no different between trial groups.</p><p>This trial, however, provides some evidence of a benefit of lay support to maternal depression in women with social risk factors relative to similar controls: while there was no significant difference in mean EPDS for the intervention group as a whole, there was a significant difference in the powered subgroup of women with two or more social risk factors, and mother-to-infant bonding scores were better than among controls overall. Systematic reviews show that children of depressed mothers are more likely to suffer insecure attachment, behavioural problems, cognitive developmental deficits and difficulties in emotional functioning, with impaired bonding between mother and child.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The implications of a reduction in maternal depression are likely to be of lasting importance to the child, family and more generally to society.</p><p>The strengths of this trial are that it was an evaluation of an existing service using highest quality methodology with excellent balance between groups, including social risks, and it achieved excellent retention and follow-up which is uncommon among disadvantaged women. A possible limitation is that EPDS was not administered at baseline, but this was not feasible as a pragmatic trial evaluating a real service with inclusion based on routine maternity booking information. The difference in maternal depression we have seen might have been influenced by baseline differences in previous or current mental health problems, but prevalence of this was the same at 15% in the trial groups. Our results could also have been influenced by the fact that 25 women recruited to the intervention group subsequently withdrew relative to only two in the control group, however, this was almost entirely a result of the women deciding that they did not want to continue with the POW service after meeting their POW, and not unsurprising within a real service situation.</p><p>Improvements in aspects of maternal psychological health in women who received support from the POWs are plausible. For any service-level intervention to be effective it must be implemented and must show impact on the short-term factors that mediate improved long-term outcomes on the service user.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In the case of the POW service, we have evidence that the service was implemented with commitment: there was an average of over six face-to-face contacts per woman, over half of which exceeded 1&#x02005;h, and an overall average of more than 24 total contacts per woman. The ingredients shown in the literature to characterise an effective service, practical and emotional support,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> were also provided, and evidence that the POWs achieved positive relationships with women comes from the observation that many divulged sensitive information, for example, domestic abuse.</p><p>The Cochrane review of &#x02018;Psychosocial and psychological interventions for preventing postpartum depression&#x02019;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> identified 28 trials, involving almost 17&#x02005;000 women with types of intervention divided into psychological (eg, debriefing, cognitive behavioural therapy) and psychosocial interventions (eg, antenatal/postnatal groups, professional/lay home visits). The review concluded that as a group these interventions significantly reduced the development of postpartum depression. However, only seven trials were of lay interventions, three of which recruited women screened positive for probable depression, and none of the remaining four trials were effective in preventing postnatal depression. No difference in mean depression scores at final study assessment overall was seen in the lay support trials (MD &#x02212;10 (&#x02212;0.20 to 0.01)), and the review recommended further trials of support by lay individuals. Addition of data from our trial to this meta-analysis indicates a significant reduction in mean depression scores MD &#x02212;0.10 (&#x02212;0.18 to &#x02212;0.03) in lay support trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009203F2">figure 2</xref>).

One small trial (n=65) of women screened positive for probable depression reported depression diagnosis and showed a reduction with lay support, and the other in India (n=468) reported depressive symptomatology and showed no difference.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015009203f02"/></fig><p>Given that UK standard maternity care routinely provides some specialist services to support women with social risks, in international contexts where such standard services are lacking, benefit from a similar POW service might be greater than evidenced here. Moreover, this trial only included nulliparous women, and it is plausible that the effect of the service may be greater in multiparous women, likely to have more social risks. This trial provides evidence that a lay support service targeted to women with two or more social risk factors improves aspects of maternal psychological health relative to controls; such improvements are likely to be of lasting impact due to the known effect of maternal depression and poor attachment on longer term childhood outcomes. This, together with the relatively low costs of the service (approximately &#x000a3;500&#x02005;000 for 1000 women annually), means that consideration should be given by policymakers to introduction of a lay support service.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the ELSIPS midwives who recruited the women from <italic>BWH</italic>&#x02014;Diane Vernon, Rachel Corney, Abigail Penberthy, Jayne Woodroffe, Vivien Williams; <italic>from HEFT</italic> &#x02013;Donna Grey, Judith Wynter, Lucy Evans, Ann-Marie Henshaw, Zephina Fortune, Jeanna Partridge, Tina Williams, Jemma Heard; from <italic>City</italic>&#x02013;Norma Hughes, Sheron Bryan, Tracey Barrett, Clare Reeve and to all the community midwives who referred women to them.
