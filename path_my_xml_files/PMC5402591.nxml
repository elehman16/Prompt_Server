However, there was no study about IMT in stroke patients combined with CHF. According to our clinical observations, many stroke patients combined with CHF were too weak to do exercise or perform daily activities. We supposed that IMT combined conventional regular rehabilitation program could further help these patients improve cardiopulmonary functions, thus giving rise to better exercise tolerance and performance of daily activities. The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of IMT in stroke patients with CHF.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>METHODS</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Subjects</title><p>We recruited stroke patients with stable CHF from a single tertiary medical center in southern Taiwan.

Computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was used to confirm the diagnosis of stroke. Patients were excluded if they initially had high MIP (&#x02265;70% predicted MIP), if they could not tightly place their lips over a mouthpiece, or if air leaked during inhaling or exhaling through the threshold device, if they had a recent acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumothorax or large bullae on chest radiography, long-term use of oxygen therapy, a history of recent lung surgery (within the past 12 months), or marked osteoporosis, and if they had unstable angina, decompensated CHF, or complicated arrhythmia.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the <italic>Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical Center</italic> (IRB number: 99-3663A3) and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Clinical Trial Identifier: NCT02614001).

This device incorporates a flow-independent one-way valve to ensure consistent intensity (in cmH<sub>2</sub>O). It has been shown that through training with this device, respiratory muscle strength, endurance, and exercise tolerance can be ameliorated.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup></p><p>During the training program, the patients were instructed to place their lips around the mouthpiece in a sitting position with a nose clip (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The patients inhaled with enough force to open the valve and exhaled through the mouthpiece, and they continued to inhale and exhale without removing the device from their mouths. During the initial training session, the patients were encouraged to start at an intensity equal to 30% of their MIP and then to gradually increase the intensity by 2&#x0200a;cmH<sub>2</sub>O/wk as far as the patients could tolerate (or 41&#x0200a;cmH<sub>2</sub>O, the maximum load for this device).<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Throughout the first training session, oxygen saturation was monitored to ensure the safety of the training. The intensity was adjusted if there was any decrease in oxygen saturation during loaded breathing. The patients were allowed to take intermittent periods of rest whenever they felt uncomfortable. If the patient could not complete the training session because of increased intensity, the training intensity of the last part of the session was maintained with the previous intensity setting. The training was immediately stopped if the patient experienced any discomfort during inspiration. All of the patients were trained for 30&#x0200a;min/d for at least 5 days a week for 10 weeks.

Comparing the 11 patients in the IMT group to the 10 patients in the control group, there were no significant differences in most of the baseline characteristics except for percent predicted FVC. MIP, percent predicted FVC, FEV1, percent predicted FEV1, and Barthel Index significantly improved compared to the pretraining status in the IMT group, while only Barthel Index significantly improved compared to the pretraining status in the control group. Moreover, there were significant differences from baseline between the 2 groups in MIP and Barthel Index after adjusting for baseline percent predicted FVC using linear regression analysis.</p><p>IMT has been shown to significantly improve peak oxygen consumption, VE/carbon dioxide production slope, quality of life, respiratory muscle strength, exertional dyspnea, exercise capacity, and blood flow in the extremities during exercise and rest in heart failure patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> IMT has also been shown to improve FEV1, FVC, vital capacity, MMEF, maximum voluntary VE, and peak oxygen consumption in patients with subacute stroke<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> and to have a short-term effect on inspiratory strength and endurance in chronic stroke patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> One systematic review including 9 randomized controlled trials compared IMT versus control interventions in CHF patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Although the patients with normal inspiratory muscle strength had improvements in exercise performance after IMT, those with inspiratory muscle weakness had greater improvements in maximal and submaximal exercise capacity.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Stroke can be viewed as a cause of inspiratory muscle weakness due to peripheral and central etiologies. In the peripheral etiology, respiratory muscle weakness of the affected side, instability of the chest, and an inactive lifestyle can lead to bilateral inspiratory muscle weakness.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> In the central etiology, abnormal magnetic evoked potentials, cortical latency, central conduction time of the affected hemisphere, and no bilateral motor representation of each hemidiaphragm can result in respiratory dysfunction.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> Another systematic review including 3 randomized controlled trials and 3 cross-sectional studies compared IMT with a control intervention in stroke patients, and the results showed that the stroke patients had improvement in MIP after the IMT program.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p><p>In the present study, we included stroke patients who also had stable CHF, and all of the patients had inspiratory muscle weakness (inspiratory muscle strength less than 70% predicted MIP). We hypothesized that these patients would have a greater improvement in MIP compared to those with normal inspiratory muscle strength based on the results of a previous study.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> In addition, we assumed that patients with respiratory muscle weakness, dyspnea, or dyspnea on exertion would have a greater motivation to receive IMT training. Furthermore, IMT has been suggested to be an alternative modality to treat CHF patients with more severe deconditioning.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> These factors formed the rationale for the selection of these patients for the IMT program. The initial intensity of the IMT was 30% MIP, which was then increased weekly to achieve a target MIP at the patient's maximum load. The training intensity, frequency, and duration were similar to those used in other trials (5&#x02013;6&#x0200a;d/wk for 6&#x02013;12 weeks).<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup></p><p>It was difficult to recruit a sufficient number of patients for our IMT program, possibly because stroke patients with CHF were more likely to die or have morbidity than stroke patients without CHF,<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> a general lack of awareness of the IMT and pulmonary rehabilitation programs, and poor motivation. Boredom with IMT may also have discouraged the patients from training. No adverse events were noted throughout the whole IMT program.</p><sec><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations to this study. First, there was a significant difference in percent predicted FVC between the groups at the beginning of the study. Although there were no significant differences in other baseline characteristics between the 2 groups, some discrepancies still existed. Therefore, we compared differences in the change from baseline of each outcome between groups using linear regression analysis with adjustments for baseline percent predicted FVC. Second, the sample size was small. Although we calculated the sample size with an estimated dropout rate of 30%, there was still considerable loss after randomization. Third, data on the 6-minute walk distance, an important cardiopulmonary index, were not reported because the walking distance could be biased by the functional status of stroke patients. Fourth, there is currently no consensus or recommendations about the training protocol of IMT programs in stroke patients with CHF. Our training program was based on the protocol of our previous study in patients with bronchiectasis,<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> and the training intensity, frequency, and duration seemed to be adequate to show the clinical effectiveness after the IMT, even the statistical power was low because of small sample size. Fifth, we did not use sham IMT intervention in the control group, which might cause performance bias. Despite sham intervention was used in some trials on IMT for CHF patients,<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> we did not use sham intervention in the present study because the patients could possibly differentiate the sham intervention from the true IMT intervention. In fact, blinding is generally regarded as being difficult to carry out in trials assessing nonpharmacological treatments.<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> Future studies should address how to deal with this methodological challenge. Finally, the follow-up duration in previous IMT trials ranged from 4 to 12 weeks,<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> and no long-term follow-up results have been published. Further studies with larger sample size and longer duration are warranted to investigate the long-term efficacy among these patients.</p></sec><sec><label>4.2</label><title>Future research</title><p>As discussed, it was difficult to recruit eligible subjects for this study, and only half of those recruited were able to continuously perform or tolerate the training programs (either IMT plus conventional stroke rehabilitation or conventional stroke rehabilitation only) and complete the whole training course. This may be explained by the relatively weak study population and poor compliance. It is well known that stroke patients with CHF have poorer fitness and more complications, which often deters the patients from training. In addition, over 30% of the patients in our study complained of fatigue and boredom during the training program, which consequently led to poor compliance. Therefore, appropriate selection of participants and methods to improve compliance (such as virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation) should be considered in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In addition to conventional stroke rehabilitation, our results suggest that stroke patients with stable CHF can benefit from a 10-week IMT with regard to inspiratory strength and activities of daily living.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan for financially supporting this research (CMRPG8D0911).
