PDL fibroblasts, also called PDL cells (PDLCs), dominated in the periodontium, play an important role in extracellular matrix synthesis, principal fibers and dental cement production, cell conglutination, transportation, and mineralization.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> In normal periodontium, the oxygen content ranges from 2.9% to 5.7%,<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> but many causes can lead to local hypoxia microenvironment in periodontal tissues, like severe periodontitis,<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> smoking,<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> and orthodontic treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> So far specific mechanisms are still unknown about the behaviors of PDLCs under hypoxic conditions in vitro.</p><p>The Wnt signaling pathway is a highly complex, evolutionarily conserved, encompassing 19 Wnt ligands, and more than 15 receptors.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Generally, the Wnt pathway includes canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling and noncanonical Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and has been revealed to play critical roles in cell proliferation and differentiation during tooth development.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> The relationship between hypoxia and Wnt signaling has been paid more and more attention, including PDLCs. However, the results are contradictory: For instance, Meldrum et al<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> found that followed the activation of the canonical Wnt signaling, cementogenic markers increased significantly in primary PDLCs cultured in osteogenic induction medium. But Braunschweig et al<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway inhibited cementoblast differentiation by using an immortalized murine cementoblast cell line (OCCM-30; University of Washington, Wahington). Therefore, whether the effects of hypoxia on proliferation and cementogenic differentiation of PDLCs are modulated by Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hypoxia on proliferation and cementogenic differentiation of human PDL cells (hPDLCs) in vitro and elucidate the role of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling underlying this process, which is important in improving our understanding of the etiology and treatment of periodontal diseases.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Culture and identification of hPDLCs</title><p>hPDLCs were isolated and cultured according to previous published protocols.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Teeth were obtained from premolar teeth extracted from healthy patients (mean 13 years old) for orthodontic treatment. Informed consent was given to all the patients involved, and the research protocol had been approved by the Human Ethics Committees of Chongqing Medical University and Tongji University. The patients were asked to gargle with chlorhexidine before the extraction of the tooth. Then, the tooth was disinfected with 1% iodine and 72% alcohol. Following extraction, the tooth was repeatedly washed with sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and placed into Dulbecco Modified Eagle's Medium culture solution (DMEM; Gibco-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The tooth was subsequently sent to the super clean bench. The tooth was placed in a sterile culture dish, and a small quantity of DMEM containing antibiotics (100&#x0200a;U/mL penicillin, 100&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL streptomycin, and 5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL amphotericin B; North China Pharmaceutical, Shanghai, China) was added in order to keep the root face moist. Then PDL tissues were separated from the middle 3rd of the root surface using a scalpel and were cultured in a T25 flask in DMEM (Gibco-Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% v/v FBS (Thermo Scientific, Massachusetts), 50&#x0200a;U/mL penicillin, and 50&#x0200a;mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C in a humidified CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. The medium was changed after 5 days and the outgrown cells growing around the PDL tissues were passaged at approximately 80% confluence and expanded through 2 passages to obtain a sufficient number of cells for the in vitro assays. Cells at passages 4th to 7th were used for the study.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Identification of hPDLCs using avidin&#x02013;biotin complex immunohistochemistry</title><p>The hPDLCs (1&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;10<sup>5</sup>/mL, 4th passage) were inoculated into a culture dish with a glass slide in order to create a cell climbing slide.

The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd antibodies were added in sequence. 3,3&#x02032;-Diaminobenzidine (DAB; Dako Denmark A/S, Denmark) was primarily used in the color reaction, which was terminated by PBS. Subsequently, hematoxylin was used for the counterstaining process, and neutral balsam was used in the sealing process. Images were captured under a microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). According to various hypoxic conditions, hPDLCs were assigned into 3 groups randomly as follows: slight hypoxia group, 5% O<sub>2</sub> content; severe hypoxia group, 1% O<sub>2</sub> content; and the control group, 21% O<sub>2</sub> content. hPDLCs in the 2 hypoxia groups were cultivated in a 3-gas (CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) incubator (NuAire Inc., Plymouth, MN), and the hPDLCs in the control group were cultivated in a common CO<sub>2</sub> incubator (NuAire, Inc.).</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Proliferation of PDLCs on different O<sub>2</sub> conditions</title><p>hPDLCs were cultured in 96-well culture plates according to their corresponding circumstance.

The optical density (OD) of each tested well was measured using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Precision Microplate Reader, Molecular Devices, Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA) at 490&#x0200a;nm following agitation for 10 minute.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Morphology of hPDLCs on different O<sub>2</sub> conditions</title><p>hPDLCs were cultured in a 96-well culture plate according to their corresponding circumstance, and their morphology were observed using an inverted microscope at 3rd and 7th day. At the same time, to assess the relative alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, the culture solution was discarded at 3rd and 7th day after cultivation, and the cells were washed with PBS. Triton X-100 (Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich, St. Louis) was used to dissolve the cells. The lysates were maintained at 4&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C overnight.

From 1-mg total RNA, complementary DNA was synthesized using DyNAmoTM cDNA Synthesis Kit (Finnzymes, Genesearch, Australia) following the manufacturer's instructions. RT-qPCR primers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were designed on the basis of cDNA sequences from the NCBI Sequence database, and the primer specificity was confirmed by BLASTN searches. RT-qPCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7300 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with SYBR Green detection reagent.

It's a kind of heterogeneous pluripotent cells with self-renewal ability, including mature cells that have different functions and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that have differentiation potentials.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Hypoxia is a basic environment of life development, and it affects the survival of cells and the formation of blood vessels through a series of regulatory mechanism, which is critical to periodontal tissue reconstruction.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> To better understand the mechanisms of hypoxia on hPDLCs and to provide novel therapies for periodontal diseases, there are increasingly researches to explore the effects of hypoxia on PDLCs. Zhou et al<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> have found that hypoxia plays an important role in maintaining the stemness and differentiation capacity of PDLCs. Li et al<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> found that the differentiation of PDLCs into osteogenic and cementogenic lineages is partially regulated by the Wnt signaling pathway and that hypoxia is involved in this process. In present study, hPDLCs were isolated and cultured according to the tissue culture method and the cells in the 4th to 7th passages that had the best activity were selected. Cell proliferation is one of the most important factors in maintaining the balance of cell numbers and normal organism functions. We detected the OD values under various hypoxic conditions and found that the growth rate of hPDLC decreased with the reduction of O<sub>2</sub> content. Exposed to hypoxic conditions for various periods of time, migration ability was assessed, indicating that hPDLCs migrate remarkably faster in 21% and 5% than in 1% O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>To study cementogenic/osteogenic differentiation of hPDLCs, bone-related markers OPN, ALP and cementogenic-related markers CEMP1, CAP were detected. OPN is related to bone mineralization, while ALP is an early marker for osteoblastic differentiation.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> CEMP1 and CAP expressed limitedly in mature cementum matrix of periodontium and cementoblasts.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> In present study, cementogenic/osteogenic-related markers were all upregulated on hypoxic conditions, and the less the O<sub>2</sub> content was, the greater these markers were expressed. The results indicated that hypoxia play a critical role in enhancing cementogenic differentiation of PDLCs.</p><p>We further investigated the effect of hypoxia on canonical Wnt signaling pathways of hPDLCs to find possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Accumulating evidence has revealed that Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway has a dual role in mineral tissue development and regeneration.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> It could promote bone formation by enhancing both the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells, and it could also reduce bone formation during the terminal mineralization stages.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Now the Wnt signaling pathway has been investigated intensively in the mechanism study of hypoxia, including hPDLCs.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> In present study, the expression of Wnt signaling related gene AXIN2, &#x003b2;-catenin, and c-Myc were all increased, suggesting that hypoxia could activate Wnt signaling pathway. Then we hypothesized that the effect of hypoxia on proliferation and cementogenic differentiation of hPDLCs was mediated through Wnt signaling pathway. Li et al<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> reported that hypoxia could significantly suppress the proliferation of PDLCs in osteogenic medium either in Wnt stimulated or nonstimulated groups, which is consistent with our results. But further experiments to verify the necessity of Wnt signaling pathway on the effect of hypoxia on the proliferation of hPDLCs is needed. In our research, we found that hypoxia could promote hPDLCs cementogenic differentiation and induce activation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway, consistent with previous studies that the Wnt signaling pathway promotes cementogenesis of hPDLCs cultured in osteogenic media. Though there were contradictions that Wnt signaling inhibits cementogenic differentiation of hPDLCs when cultured in nonosteogenic medium.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>Simultaneously, we explored the relationship between HIF expression and Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway under hypoxic conditions. Usually, the effects of hypoxia on hPDLCs are determined by HIF-1.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor mostly composed of oxygen-sensitive (HIF-1&#x003b1;) and oxygen-insensitive subunits (HIF-1&#x003b2;).<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> The availability of HIF-1 is mainly determined by HIF-1&#x003b1;, which is regulated at the protein level in an oxygen-sensitive manner while HIF-1&#x003b2; is stably expressed.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> When under hypoxic conditions, hydroxylation that degrades HIF-1&#x003b1; rapidly under normal O<sub>2</sub> conditions is halted, leading to HIF-1&#x003b1; stabilization and translocation to the nucleus, stimulating the expression of a broad range of genes in a hypoxic-dependent manner like glucose transporter-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and so on.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> HIF-1&#x003b1; induced by hypoxia has a complex function on hPDLCs proliferation. Under short-term hypoxia, overexpression of HIF-1&#x003b1; could promote cell proliferation, but under a long time of hypoxia, it could oppositely restrain cell proliferation.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> This study found that the proliferation of hPDLCs was decreased under hypoxic conditions and with the reduction of O<sub>2</sub> concentration, the expression of HIF increased and gradually transported from cytoplasm to nuclei. The HIF expression was obviously higher than the control group and mainly expressed in nuclei in the severe 1% O<sub>2</sub> condition. Both RT-qPCR and Western blot results showed an increase of HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in hypoxia. Thus, we predicate that HIF-1&#x003b1; could induce the activation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. Previous studies have proved that HIF-1&#x003b1; could activate Wnt to increase the expression levels of c-Myc and other cytokines in osteoblasts.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> However, the molecular mechanisms of HIF-1&#x003b1; and Wnt signaling pathway in hPDLCs under hypoxic conditions remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Generally, there are various causes leading to local hypoxia microenvironment in periodontal tissues. For example, periodontal diseases that are frequently observed in adult patients, with a prevalence of over 50% of patients older than 30 years can seriously damage the periodontal tissue blood circulation, leading to local hypoxic conditions. Then the severe hypoxia further aggravates the progression of periodontal diseases.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Smoking can badly affect the O<sub>2</sub> content of periodontal tissues, and it was reported that the O<sub>2</sub> content in periodontal tissues of smokers is only 2/3 of nonsmokers.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Besides, orthodontic tooth treatment can also lead to hypoxic conditions, and the orthodontic force could exert different effects on the compression and tension sides. Bone resorption is dominant on the compression side, whereas bone formation is dominant on the tension side.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Compressive force reduces blood flow in the PDL and alveolar bone, causing local hypoxia.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> The periodontium is particularly sensitive to hypoxia, and a series of pathological and physiological reactions to hypoxia lead to the reduction of tissue defenses.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, hypoxia results in the decrease of redox potential, which leads to the gathering of anaerobes.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> The interaction of these factors accelerates the initiation and development of periodontal disease. Hence, the study of biological activities and specific mechanisms on the effect of hypoxia on hPDLCs improved our understanding of the etiology and treatment of periodontal diseases.</p><p>In conclusion, hypoxia was capable of suppressing the proliferation and migration ability, changing the morphology of hPDLCs, stabilizing HIF-1&#x003b1; against degradation and promoting its translocation to the nucleus, which may further initiate or aggravate periodontal diseases. Meanwhile, hypoxia may regulate hPDLCs proliferation and cementogenic differentiation via Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway and may potentially provide a novel insight into the etiology and treatment of periodontal diseases.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ALP = alkaline phosphatase, AXIN2 = axis inhibition protein 2, DMEM = Dulbecco Modified Eagle's Medium, GAPDH = glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase, HIF = hypoxia inducible factor, hPDLC = human periodontal ligament cell, OD = optical density, PDL = periodontal ligament, PDLC = PDL cell, RT-qPCR = reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding/support: The present study was supported by Program for Innovation Team Building at Institutions of Higher Education in Chongqing in 2016, no.
