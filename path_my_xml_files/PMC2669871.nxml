Indeed, recognizing the futility of expecting primary care providers to apply an ever-increasing number of condition-specific interventions,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref> recent blueprints for health system redesign have called for the development of such interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></p><p>We conducted the Self-Efficacy Enhancing Interviewing Techniques (SEE IT) study, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effects of an office-based, standardized patient (SP) instructor intervention on resident physician use of generic SEE IT with the effects of an attention control SP instructor condition. The intervention was grounded in self-efficacy theory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref> and informed by prior successful interventions to enhance self-efficacy and improve outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref> The SP instructor approach was chosen because it allows training to occur during usual office hours, which we anticipated busy residents and, ultimately, practicing physicians would appreciate. The training setting also enhances the salience of the techniques and allows learners to immediately practice and begin assimilating newly presented techniques. SP instructor interventions have been effective in improving physicians&#x02019; skills in breaking bad news,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref> obtaining informed consent,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref> and assessing human immunodeficiency virus risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref> By contrast, didactic educational approaches may improve knowledge, but have less effect on physician behavior.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></p><p>We hypothesized that residents receiving the experimental intervention would use SEE IT more during two unannounced post-intervention (non-training) SP visits than would controls. We also explored whether greater resident use of SEE IT during post-intervention visits would generalize beyond the specific clinical contexts encountered during training visits.</p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Study activities described were conducted from March 2006 through March 2008.

An <italic>a priori</italic> power calculation, based on a simple before/after analysis, determined a sample size of 64 residents would provide 80% power to detect an intervention effect size of 0.5 or greater on resident use of SEE IT, with alpha = 0.05, two-tailed, and equal size experimental and control groups. The power analysis did not account for the repeated measures, which were expected to increase power. However, that gain in power would likely be partially offset by the correlation among repeated observations. Because the correlation was unknown in this new intervention, the power analysis conservatively ignored the repeated measures.</p><p>Residents were solicited for participation via flyers, e-mails, and presentations at house staff meetings. A research assistant obtained interested residents&#x02019; informed consent for participation, using a standard consent form as a guide, and implemented a randomized allocation scheme in blocks of 32 residents via sealed opaque envelopes containing slips of paper printed with group assignments. Throughout the study, the SPs, SP trainer, and research assistant were aware of residents&#x02019; random group allocation, while the study investigators, audio recording coders, and biostatistician were blinded to resident group allocation. All residents received two $20 gift cards for participating in the study, one upon enrollment and one upon completion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Procedures</title><p><bold>Study interventions</bold> Residents received their randomly assigned intervention during two pre-announced, 30-min SP instructor visits, scheduled 2 weeks apart. We employed pre-announced SP instructor visits because they are effective and physicians tend to prefer them to unannounced SP visits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref> All experimental and control intervention visits were audio recorded, using pocket digital recorders carried by the SPs.During the first 15&#x000a0;min of each training visit, the SP instructors remained in their patient roles (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), both of which involved coexisting chronic medical and mental health conditions, reflecting their frequent co-occurrence in primary care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref> To further enhance realism, most behavior-change issues in the scenarios were of the &#x0201c;hidden agenda&#x0201d; variety, requiring elicitation by the residents. The order in which patients A and B were encountered varied among residents within each group.

During the second 15 min of their training visits, SP instructors presented scripted education aimed at raising resident awareness of the frequent co-occurrence of chronic medical and mental health problems in primary care (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref> However, there was no mention of self-efficacy or self-efficacy enhancement in the control intervention, and interviewing skills were not discussed, taught, or practiced. Residents were provided opportunities to ask clarifying questions about any of the material presented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Post-Intervention (Evaluation) SP Visits</title><p>Within 1 month of completing training, all residents received two unannounced 30-min evaluation (non-training) SP visits. The electronic medical record system used by both participating residency programs did not support creation of complete fictional charts. Instead, the SP charts were &#x0201c;placeholders&#x0201d; containing a name and demographics, but no clinical data. Thus, while the post-intervention SP visits were unannounced, all residents were able to discern they were seeing an SP upon opening the SP electronic charts.</p><p>The patient characteristics and concerns in the post-intervention visits (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were selected to allow exploration of whether resident use of SEE IT would be context-specific&#x02014;i.e., only with evaluation patient C, whose health conditions were similar to those of training patient A&#x02014;or more general, occurring in both evaluation visits. The order in which patients C and D were encountered varied among residents in each study group. SPs remained in patient role throughout evaluation visits, which were again audio recorded using concealed pocket digital recorders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Standardized Patient Training and Fidelity</title><p>Two SP instructors (one man, one woman) were each trained to deliver half of the experimental and control interventions. The other four SPs, all women, were trained to conduct evaluation visits. The training process was developed and implemented by a physician assistant with over 25&#x000a0;years of SP training experience. The SP trainer and principal investigator conducted quarterly fidelity audits of SP visit audio recordings, using a standardized checklist, and provided corrective feedback as indicated. Further information regarding the intervention is available from the authors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Measures</title><p><bold>Resident use of SEE IT</bold> The ten-item Doctors&#x02019; Observable Use of Self-Efficacy Enhancing Interviewing Techniques (DO U SEE IT) measure was developed for this study (Appendix). Six of the measure items corresponded to SEE IT Techniques 1&#x02013;4, 8 and 9, respectively; three additional items corresponded to the three sub-techniques of Technique 6; and a final item was included to assess residents&#x02019; use of both Techniques 5 (assess self-efficacy) and 7 (re-assess self-efficacy). All ten items employed a yes/no response scale, with 1 point assigned for each &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; response (resident used the technique). Individual item scores were added to yield a summary score (range 0&#x02013;10).Three coders first independently applied the DO U SEE IT measure to audio recordings of the patient role portion of all study SP visits, noting the digital counter number(s) of any segments they felt justified &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; codes. To maintain coder blinding to the resident study group, physician-patient introductions were removed from the beginning of all recordings, and training visit recordings were truncated just before the SP instructors came out of role. Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha derived from the inter-correlations among the three coders&#x02019; total DO U SEE IT scores was 0.88. Subsequently, one master coder reconciled discrepancies via re-review of pertinent recording sections and discussion with the other coder(s) until consensus was reached. The consensus DO U SEE IT scores were employed in our study analyses.</p><p><bold>Other measures</bold> Also assessed at baseline were resident age, gender, race/ethnicity, specialty (family medicine or internal medicine), and year of training. Following the final study visit, residents were also asked to complete a single item assessing the overall quality of the training they had received (5-point Likert scale, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;excellent to 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;poor). Four additional items assessed whether the training was useful and/or easy to understand, whether the resident intended to apply the training in actual patient encounters, and whether they would be interested in receiving further training (5-point Likert scales, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;strongly agree to 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;strongly disagree). Two final open-ended items asked residents to say what they liked least and best about their training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Analyses</title><p>Analyses were conducted with SAS (version 9.1, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and Stata (version 10.1, StataCorp, College Station, TX). The effects of the intervention on residents&#x02019; use of SEE IT were examined using generalized linear models (GLMs) implementing a Generalized Estimating Equations approach to accommodate the repeated measures on each resident.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref> The summary DO U SEE IT score at each time point or the proportion of obtained score out of the total possible (10 points) was used as the dependent variable.</p><p>Because the score is a count with limited range and not normally distributed, we examined four alternative GLMs: Gaussian, Gaussian using an arcsin transformation of the score proportion, Poisson, and logistic using the score proportion. Results were consistent among these approaches, and we report the adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for the mean intervention effect from the Poisson model. In this study, the adjusted IRR is the adjusted average number of SEE IT behaviors per visit observed in experimental group residents divided by the number observed in control group residents. The key independent variables were group (intervention vs. control), visit (2, 3, or 4), visit * group interaction (to assess learning consolidation or attenuation), and SP conditions (same as training conditions vs. different). Analyses adjusted for baseline SEE IT score, resident gender, race/ethnicity (white vs. other), specialty (family or internal medicine), year of training (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th or higher). SP teaching times in training visits were longer in the experimental compared with control group (see Results), but because teaching time was collinear with study group, it was excluded from the reported analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> diagrams the flow of participating residents through the trial.

We found a brief, office-based, SP instructor-delivered intervention led to significant improvements in family medicine and internal medicine residents&#x02019; use of SEE IT during SP encounters. Of note, the difference became apparent after one training visit, and persisted without attenuation through two post-intervention visits conducted within a month of completing the intervention, only one of which involved patient conditions encountered by residents during a training case. These observations suggest that resident use of SEE IT may generalize to patient health behavior concerns beyond those encountered during training visits.</p><p>While our case scenarios reflected common presentations of prevalent physical and mental health conditions in primary care, studies more optimally designed to assess physicians&#x02019; use of SEE IT across patient concerns are required to further explore this issue. Prior studies indicate that physician interviewing behaviors demonstrated during SP encounters correlate with their use during real patient encounters,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref> and with patient ratings of physician interviewing behaviors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref> Future studies should evaluate physician use of SEE IT during actual patient visits over longer periods of time and explore the impact of SEE IT training on patient self-efficacy, health behaviors, and outcomes.</p><p>Self-efficacy is a key mediator of patient behaviors across a wide array of health conditions and settings,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref> and self-efficacy enhancement can lead to improved health outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref> If SEE IT training is shown to facilitate patient health behavior change and improve patient outcomes, its potential to improve health care could be considerable. First, however, it would need to be disseminated from research into practice. To do so, training centers could be strategically placed to supply SP instructors to practices in various regions.</p><p>Self-efficacy also tends to be lowest in those most vulnerable to adverse health outcomes, such as minorities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref> and people with depression,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref> yet preliminary evidence suggests such individuals may derive the greatest benefit from well-conceived self-efficacy enhancing interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref> Thus, training physicians to employ SEE IT also holds promise as a &#x0201c;downstream&#x0201d; approach to reducing health-care disparities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></p><p>Encouragingly, participating residents were not highly selected; 73% of eligible family medicine residents and 44% of eligible internal medicine residents enrolled. However, the Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha among DO SEE IT items was moderate (0.61), suggesting that individual residents were consistent in their use of SEE IT (i.e., substantial, moderate, or minimal use). Additional work is needed to optimize resident response to SEE IT training.</p><p>The SP instructors presented SEE IT sequentially. Since the teaching lasted only 15 min, and residents had little familiarity with the material, techniques toward the bottom of Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> received less attention. Exploratory analyses confirmed that most changes in experimental group resident use of SEE IT relative to controls occurred for Techniques 1 through 6 (details available upon request). Providing the SEE IT training over three to four visits might remedy this problem. However, studies are be required to examine how increasing the number of SEE IT training visits may affect resource requirements, clinical effectiveness, and dissemination potential.</p><p>Our RCT had additional limitations. The experimental group had more senior year residents and greater baseline use of SEE IT than controls; however, the analyses adjusted for these differences. The teaching portion of both training visits was twice as long in the experimental as control group, so observed differences in post-intervention SEE IT may reflect attention differences. Also, while the post-intervention SP visits were not pre-announced, participating residents discovered they were seeing an SP after logging into the electronic medical record. Thus, we have shown residents were able to apply SEE IT under &#x0201c;prompted&#x0201d; circumstances (unannounced but detected SPs). However, prior SP intervention studies suggest little impact on outcomes whether SPs are detected or not.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref> Finally, studies will be needed to address whether the intervention will work in practicing physicians. A similar SP instructor intervention has been shown to improve practicing physicians&#x02019; human immunodeficiency virus risk assessment interviewing skills.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></p><p>We conclude that SP instructors can train residents to apply SEE IT during office visits with SPs portraying individuals with common primary care problems and health behavior change concerns. The effect was apparent after a single SP instructor training visit and persisted without attenuation through two additional evaluation SP visits. Studies are warranted to determine the effects of SEE IT on practicing physicians, and on actual patients, including their health behaviors and outcomes. However, our findings suggest that training primary care physicians to use SEE IT&#x02014;<italic>generic</italic> techniques that can be applied to facilitate essentially <italic>any</italic> health behavior change&#x02014;has potential for wide dissemination and clinical impact.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was funded in part by a National Institutes of Mental Health Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (5K24MH072756) to Dr. Kravitz, and a University of California Davis Department of Family and Community Medicine research award to Dr. Jerant.
