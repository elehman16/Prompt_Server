With the explosion in our understanding of the biology of these disorders, the time is ripe for the investigation of novel therapies. Recently depression is conceptualized as an immune-inflammatory and nitro-oxidative stress related disorder. Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that has anti-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, glutamatergic, neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties that make it a viable target to explore as a new therapy. This double blind, randomised, placebo controlled adjunctive trial will investigate the benefits of 200 mg/day of minocycline treatment, in addition to any usual treatment, as an adjunctive treatment for moderate-severe major depressive disorder. Sixty adults are being randomised to 12 weeks of treatment (with a 4 week follow-up post-discontinuation). The primary outcome measure for the study is mean change on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), with secondary outcomes including the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), Patient Global Impression (PGI), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) and Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (LIFE-RIFT). Biomarker analyses will also be conducted at baseline and week 12. The study has the potential to provide new treatment targets, both by showing efficacy with a new class of 'antidepressant' but also through the analysis of biomarkers that may further inform our understanding of the pathophysiology of unipolar depression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Minocycline</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Clinical research protocol</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Oxidative stress</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The World Health Organisation's Global Burden of Disease report cited major depression as the fourth leading cause of disease burden, as measured by disability-adjusted life years, and the leading cause in terms of years lived with disability.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1)</xref> This infers that major depression is possibly one of the most protracted and disabling illness, associated with great societal costs, of all modern medical conditions. A pertinent factor intertwined with such a crippling course is the overall poor treatment outcome for major depressive disorder (MDD). Despite having been traditionally viewed with a comparatively favourable prognosis within psychiatric disorders, remission and functional recovery are uncommon in practice.</p><p>One of the many factors underlying the poor treatment outcome of MDD is that, by and large, it is a syndrome of heterogeneous and imperfectly understood aetiology. Traditionally, MDD was believed to be caused by a dysfunction of neurotransmission, focused initially on the serotonergic, and later the noradrenergic pathways however recently it has been postulated that while alterations in neurotransmitter levels and function are present (including glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA] in addition to serotonin and noradrenaline), these may not be the primary aetiological basis of the disorder. Indeed, this notion is supported by the lack of complete efficacy for up to 30% of people with MDD by treatment with serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, directly effecting neurotransmitter levels in the brain.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2)</xref></p><p>Activation of immune-inflammatory pathways including changes in pro-inflammatory and cell-mediated immune (CMI) cytokines have been documented extensively in MDD. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory and CMI cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) and tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;)<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2)</xref> are reported in MDD. Conversely, treatment with cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b1; have been related to decreased mood and increased depressive symptoms.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3)</xref> Antidepressant treatments are believed to reduce the imbalanced cytokine levels in MDD. While there is, at present, a paucity of studies directly investigating changes pre- and post-antidepressant treatment, there is evidence to suggest that some antidepressants normalize cytokine levels and this may be an additional therapeutic target, secondary to their effects on neurotransmitters.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref></p><p>In depression, the role of nitro-oxidative stress has been explored in a small collection of studies. Peet et al.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5)</xref> presented evidence of depleted levels of omega-3-fatty acids in MDD, while Maes et al.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7)</xref> showed a significantly lowered oxidative potential index in fatty acids and lower concentrations of serum vitamin E, a fat-soluble antioxidant, in MDD compared with healthy volunteers. Bilici et al.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8)</xref> showed decreased levels of the antioxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase. Similarly, the lack of adequate antioxidant defence in MDD is evidenced by increases in oxidative stress markers. Lipid peroxidation products have been found to be significantly higher in MDD when compared to controls.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9)</xref> Furthermore, these alterations may return to normal after antidepressant treatment.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10)</xref> Higher serum levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OhdG), a biomarker of DNA damage, were found in those with MDD than in controls.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11)</xref> The levels of inducible nitric-oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) are higher in depression, while there is evidence of hyper-nitrosylation, the formation of NO-adducts.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13)</xref> Individually, these studies are limited by their small sample sizes and restricted focus of attention, but they conglomerate to provide cogent support for the oxidative stress hypothesis for depression.</p><p>Finally, one of the other major targets emerging in discovering the underlying aetiology of MDD are alterations generally known as neuroprogression; that is lowered neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, cell loss and activation of apoptotic.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14)</xref> There are several identified neurotrophins in the brain that have been investigated in MDD. These include, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. In depression, these factors have been shown to be reduced and this may contribute the pathophysiology of the disorder.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16)</xref> Furthermore, these neurotrophins are influenced by oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators, thereby creating an integrated system of pathophysiology that may underlie depression. Similar to inflammatory changes, alterations in neurotrophins have been found to be somewhat reversed following treatment and remission of symptoms.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16)</xref> Together, these changes in oxidative inflammatory and neurotrophic factors are thought to play a pivotal role in the process of neuroprogression that is operative in mood disorders.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17)</xref></p><p>Minocycline has been shown to have properties that may address these pathologies in depression. Minocycline has been shown to have antioxidant properties, making it appealing as a potential treatment for depression given the perturbations in antioxidant defences in MDD.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18)</xref> In terms of reducing free radicals, minocycline has been shown to dose-dependently decrease nitrite levels and nitric oxide synthase expression following lipopolysaccaride (LPS) treatment.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19)</xref> Rise in NO levels in response to 3-nitropropioic acid (3-NP; an inhibitor of the electron transport enzyme succinate dehydrogenase) was also attenuated using minocycline.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20)</xref></p><p>Similarly, minocycline was shown to attenuate increases in malondialdehyde (a marker of lipid peroxidation), following 3-NP treatment.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20)</xref> Lipid peroxidation and free radical generation were also shown to be decreased in ischemic mouse forebrain following minocycline treatment.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21)</xref> Furthermore, minocycline has been shown to prevent increases in antioxidants in response to oxidative stress. In rat brain homogenates, minocycline was found to reduce increases in catalase and succinate dehydrogenase following 3-NP treatment.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20)</xref> Conversely, minocycline treatment has not been shown to affect the reduced glutathione/oxidised glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio following traumatic brain injury in adult mice.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22)</xref></p><p>Minocycline has also has reported anti-inflammatory effects that are not related to its microbial properties, but rather due to its purported inhibition of microglial activation. High dose minocycline is reported to reduce IL-1&#x003b2; levels following traumatic brain injury.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22)</xref> This has also been replicated in MDMA-treated rats.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23)</xref> Minocycline has also been found to reduce prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) and inhibit COX-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19)</xref> Rises in TNF-&#x003b1; levels were also attenuated following minocycline treatment following administration of 3-NP.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20)</xref> These factors are especially relevant to MDD where increased levels of cytokines are reported.</p><p>In MDD there are reported decreases in neurotrophic factors such as BDNF and Bcl-2. Minocycline has been shown to significantly increase Bcl-2 RNA expression both alone, and in the presence of oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide treatment).<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24)</xref> Similarly, minocycline has been shown to increase nerve growth factor-induced PC12 neuronal growth in a dose-dependent manner.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25)</xref></p><p>Minocycline has also been shown to be neuroprotective by preventing cell loss. In mouse models of traumatic brain injury, minocycline has been shown to reduce lesion volume.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26)</xref> In one study modelling cerebral ischemia, minocycline was shown to reduce inflammation, but also decreased neurogenesis (shown by BrdU staining).<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27)</xref> However, this has been disputed in a similar study showing minocycline increased BrdU expression and reduced microglia activation.<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28)</xref> Dosing and occlusion strategies may explain differences in results. Using hydrogen peroxide to attenuate insulin-like growth factor-1-promoted neuronal survival, minocycline was shown to prevent this loss of neuronal survival.<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29)</xref> Minocycline is also reported to prevent excitotoxic-induced cell death following NMDA treatment.<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30)</xref> The latter is especially relevant to the current study, as changes in glutamate pathways have been reported in MDD.</p><p>Following glutamate treatment, minocycline-treated rat cortical neurons were found to have increased cell viability compared to controls, indicating decreased glutamate-induced neurotoxicity.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31)</xref> Studies have found reductions in MK-801-induced disruptions in prepulse inhibition, and both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist-and methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (two behavioural models associated with psychotic symptoms) in mice treated with minocycline.<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33)</xref></p><p>There is preclinical data indicating benefits of minocycline in models investigating depressive-like behaviour. In a study involving both independent and co-administration of minocycline in rats, minocycline was shown to be effective in the Porsolt swim test. Sub-threshold doses were of both current antidepressants and glutamate antagonists in combination with sub-threshold doses of minocycline were also shown to have antidepressant effects.<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34)</xref> Conversely, in a study involving adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, the same dose of minocycline was shown to have no effect on swim times in the Porsolt swim test.<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35)</xref></p><p>In a more recent study, learned helplessness was used as a model of depression and intracerebroventricular minocycline treatment was explored. The study found that rats treated with minocycline had improved performance on the conditioned avoidance test (mild foot shock) and this did not correlate to changes in locomotor activity. This suggests the effects of minocycline are anti-depressant. The study found biological correlates with serotonin turnover in the orbitofrontal cortex; being increased in rats with learned helplessness and this was not altered by minocycline treatment. However, there were no changes to serotonin in other brain regions investigated. No changes to dopamine levels were reported although the data suggested decreased dopamine levels in rats who acquired learned helplessness. Interestingly, although no deficit in dopamine was reported, minocycline caused an increase in dopamine levels in the amygdala. Finally, BDNF levels were reduced following the acquisition of learned helplessness and these remained unchanged following minocycline treatment.<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36)</xref></p><p>Taken together these data regarding the mechanisms of action of minocycline mirror many of the deficits seen in MDD. It is not surprising that minocycline has already been put forward as a potential antidepressant,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37)</xref> but what is surprising is that to date, no clinical trials have been performed, or are currently registered with the major clinical trials registry.</p><p>We have reviewed the literature regarding minocycline's use, to date, in psychiatry.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18)</xref> Initial interest began with case reports in schizophrenia, reporting serendipitous reductions in psychotic symptoms following minocycline treatment.<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38)</xref> Following on from these findings, the same research group conducted an open label study of 22 people diagnosed with schizophrenia. These participants were given 300 mg/day of minocycline and were shown to have reduced symptoms after eight weeks of treatment. These participants had either been treatment resistant in the past or were currently not responding to treatment. No adverse events were reported following the eight-week treatment phase.<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39)</xref> The first double blind, placebo controlled trial in schizophrenia investigated recently diagnosed (&#x0003c;5 years) participants (minocycline: n=36, control: n=18) who were currently experiencing symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] &#x0003e;60). Participants were assigned to either 200 mg/day of minocycline or placebo in addition to an atypical antipsychotic medication for a total of 22 weeks. Results showed improvements in negative and cognitive symptoms, as well as overall improvements in functioning.<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40)</xref></p><p>Specific to depression, a case report regarding an individual with bipolar disorder who has predominantly depressive episodes was reported by Levine et al.<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41)</xref> While admitted as an inpatient, the individual received 150 mg/day of minocycline and within four days had reported an attenuation of depressive symptoms. These improvements remained following withdrawal of minocycline treatment.<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41)</xref> To provide further clinical support for the proposed trial, an open-label study has been conducted in a cohort of participants diagnosed with psychotic depression (major depression with psychotic features). After 6 weeks of treatment with minocycline (150 mg/day) improvements were not only seen in psychotic symptoms, but dramatic reductions in depression symptoms were also reported. Based on both the biochemical indication and the clinical observations, minocycline may have antidepressant effects. The current study aims to explore the potential of minocycline as an adjunctive treatment for unipolar depression.</p><sec><title>Aims</title><p>Using a randomised placebo controlled trial, we aim in this pilot study to test the efficacy of adjunctive minocycline (100 mg twice daily) in the acute treatment of unipolar depression to determine if:</p><p>1.

Primary analyses will be undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis, including all participants as randomised, regardless of treatment actually received. Mixed- model repeated measures (MMRM) analyses will be used to analyse change in MADRS score because it has been demonstrated to be superior to the last observation carried forward method for handling missing data in longitudinal designs. The MMRM model includes the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction. The MMRM includes all available data at each time point. Results from the analysis of dichotomous data will be presented as proportions, with 95% confidence interval, and Fisher's exact <italic>p</italic>-value where appropriate. Non-parametric statistics will be used when assumptions for parametric methods are violated. Effect sizes will be calculated using Cohen's guidelines. All tests of treatment effects will be conducted using a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals. Significance will be defined as <italic>p</italic>&#x02264;0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size and Power</title><p>A total of 60 participants meeting the DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD, and experiencing moderate to severe illness symptomatology, will be recruited. The primary outcome measure will be change in MADRS score at week 12. For a two tailed analysis<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42)</xref> with &#x003b1;=0.05, Z&#x003b1; = 1.96 and with &#x003b2;=0.2, Z&#x003b2; = 0.842, N=60 (n=30 in each arm), the study will be powered at 80% to detect a true difference in rating scale score between placebo and minocycline treated groups if the difference of the means is not less than 0.724 times the standard deviation in the control group (effect size).</p><p>An effect size of 0.4 or greater for difference in MADRS scores in randomised controlled trials of antidepressants versus placebo has been suggested as necessary to suggest clinical utility for an antidepressant used as monotherapy. Effect sizes of 0.28 to 0.51 have been reported for difference in MADRS score in trials of citalopram and escitalopram after 8 weeks of treatment.<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43)</xref> This suggests that at N=60 the proposed depression study may not be sufficiently powered to detect small effect size differences between placebo and minocycline treated groups for changes in MADRS score if the efficacy of minocycline is not greater than conventional antidepressant monotherapy. However, for a pilot study a sample size of 60 should be sufficient to demonstrate trends that would indicate a need for a larger trial.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>The study is currently being conducted at the two Victorian sites and has relevant approval from the Human Research and Ethics Committees. The study is planned to begin recruitment at the Thailand site in May 2014, with the relevant aprpovals in place.</p><p>The study has recruited 15 participants to date and is planning to complete the recruitment phase in 2014.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Given the paucity of new therapies for unipolar depression and the burden the illness costs not only at a personal level, but for the wider community and the associated health-economics concerns, this trial is timely. The study may not only provide evidence of a novel therapy for unipolar depression, but may also assist in driving new targets of therapeutic pursuit through the exploration of biomarkers. Overall, we are hopeful that this study may have significant benefit for those with unipolar depression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Brain and Behavior Foundation, the Australasian Society of Bipolar and Depressive Disorders and the Alfred Deakin Postdoctoral Research Fellowship.
