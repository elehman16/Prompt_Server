This is due to higher transfer of loads through the medial compartment than through the lateral, resulting in higher external knee adduction moment. According to studies, the first peak knee adduction moment during walking is a strong predictor of the severity and rate of progression of medial compartment of knee OA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Management of knee OA necessitates a multidisciplinary approach with physiotherapy as the main choice of conservative management; which includes various strategies such as manual therapy, exercises, patellar taping and electrical modalities with or without thermal modalities as measures for pain reduction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Recently, closed kinematic chain exercises have drawn much attention in the management of knee OA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Studies suggest that these exercises are more effective and functional than the traditionally employed open kinematic chain exercises.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Closed kinematic chain exercises for knee joint can be incorporated in many ways; one of them is Retro-walking.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Retro-walking is walking backwards.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Since there is propulsion in backward direction and reversal of leg movement in Retro-walking, different muscle activation patterns from those in forward walking are required.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The effects of backward walking and backward running in strength gains and joint stress reduction and hence in facilitating rehabilitation are discussed in several studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Along with a unique muscle activation pattern; Retro-walking is associated with increased cadence, decreased stride length and different joint kinematics as compared to forward walking and hence may offer some benefits over forward walking alone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Though a growing body of evidence suggests the role of exercises in improvement of symptoms and joint function in knee OA; precise guidelines as regards their type and dosage have not been laid. Hence, Retro-walking may offer additional benefits in this population. The current study aimed at finding out the effectiveness of Retro-walking as an adjunct to conventional treatments on pain and disability in patients with knee OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to screening and participation in the study.

The scale had 0 (no pain at all) and 10 (maximum pain felt at this moment) at either ends. The patient was asked to mark his/her pain where he felt it would take its position in the scale. (2) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) of OA, a patient reported scale, was used to assess pain, stiffness and physical function levels in the subjects.

Group &#x000d7; time interaction analysis revealed that Retro-walking is more effective in reducing disabilities as compared to conventional treatment. However, both are equally effective in relieving pain.</p><p>Pain relief after conventional treatment could be attributed to the thermal effects associated with deep heating modality, strengthening exercises for hip and knee helping to steady the knee and give additional joint protection from shock and stress. In addition to this, Retro-walking may have effect on pain relief by reducing excess adductor moment at knee joint decreasing the compressive forces on medial compartment of knee joint.</p><p>Statistically, significant improvement in function is seen in both the groups and between the groups. However, the improvement in Group B is greater than that of Group A. Improvement in function may be attributed to the reduction of pain, reduction in abnormal joint kinetics and kinematics during functional movements and improved muscle activation pattern. Studies have shown that compared to forward walking; backward walking creates more muscle activity in proportion to efforts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] As advantages of Retro-walking include improvement in muscle activation pattern, reduction in adductor moment at knee during stance phase of gait and augmented stretch of hamstring muscle groups during the stride; all of these may have helped in reducing disability thus leading to improved function. There is a possibility that proprioceptive and balance training may have occurred during Retro-walking adding to its benefits. Retro-walking also has effect on improving strength of hip extensors leading to reduced hip flexion moment during stance phase and thus preventing abnormal loading at knee joint and, in turn, the disability. As a result of exercises and Retro-walking there was improvement in the strength of muscles at knee and hip which may have reduced functional disability.</p><p>There were certain limitations in the current study. Medications of patients, activities of daily living and recreational activities of patients were not taken into account. The compliance of patients with the home exercise program was not monitored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Retro-walking as an adjunct to conventional
