Anticoagulants are used in the treatment and prophylaxis of these diseases. Warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant in the World.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, because of the narrow therapeutic index and life-threatening complications, patients must be regularly and continuously followed up.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The warfarin dose is set according to the International Normalized Ratio (INR) level in the blood. The target range of INR is 2-3 in patients using warfarin and can vary with indications.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In the first stages of treatment, INR is monitored at frequent intervals, but after the INR reaches the desired level, monitoring is carried out routinely once every four weeks.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Studies have shown that when the INR level exceeds the therapeutic range the risk of bleeding increases, and when it falls below 2, the risk of thromboembolism increases.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Although warfarin is widely used, it can have life-threatening adverse effects when knowledge of patients about medication interaction with food and with other drugs, and laboratory test monitoring are inadequate.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The most important and most often seen adverse effect of warfarin treatment is bleeding.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>A patient&#x02019;s level of knowledge concerning the drug plays a key role in the effective and safe use of warfarin. In the Joint Commission International (JCI) National Patient Safety Goal (NPSG) guideline for 2014 education on treatment for patients taking oral anticoagulants was recognized as a vital factor.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Previous studies have reported that a positive relationship between patients&#x02019; anticoagulant knowledge levels and the INR number in the therapeutic range<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, and adherence to treatment.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> For this reason there is a need for effective education programs to increase patients&#x02019; knowledge concerning warfarin and to keep it up to date. Education and information services provided to patients using anticoagulants will reduce the costs of treatment by reducing risks such as thromboembolism and bleeding.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Educating the patients who use warfarin is one of the important responsibilities of the nurses&#x02019; counseling and educational roles as much as doctors&#x02019; roles. In a study by Johnson et al. (2010), it was determined that patient education improves patients&#x02019; attitudes and medication adherence, which emphasized the importance of nursing counseling and education programs.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> When planning education, individual characteristics and needs must be kept in mind, and group education in addition to individual sessions and the use of written and visual material will increase the effectiveness of the education.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In order to make the information permanent, oral and written materials were used (PPT Presentation and Booklet) in the education. To assess the persistence of the information, the patient&#x02019;s level of knowledge measurements were repeated immediately after the education, one month and two months later and the patient&#x02019;s questions after the education were answered on the phone.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to determine the knowledge of patients using warfarin concerning its use, and the effects of education on the safety of warfarin therapy on patients&#x02019; knowledge levels and INR control. A secondary aim was to contribute to development an education program and booklet for patients using warfarin in health institutions.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Hypotheses</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Are education programs effective in improving patients` warfarin knowledge level and INR control?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is there an association between patients` warfarin knowledge and INR control?</p></list-item></list>

The sample included 63 patients using warfarin between September 2014 and March 2015. It was carried out at the cardiology and cardiovascular surgery outpatient clinics of two different hospitals in Manisa. A total of 119 subjects were screened for eligibility of which 29 failed to meet the criteria and 21 patients refused to participate in the study. Sixty nine patients who met the eligibility criteria accepted to participate in the study and were randomized. A total of 69 patients were initially included in the study, 36 in the experimental group and 33 in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p>CONSORT 2010 Flow Diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PJMS-34-240-g001"/></fig><p>Patients were included into the study that had been using warfarin for at least two months, who were between 18 and 65 years old, who were literate, and who accepted voluntarily to take part in the study.

The researcher met with the all patients who were admitted to outpatient clinic two day a week. After the eligibility criteria of the patients were reviewed, initial assessments were completed and the participants were subsequently randomized. An appropriate room in clinic was provided to the researcher for meeting with patients by hospital management.</p><p>Data were collected via two questionnaires between September 2014 and March 2015 at four time points for experimental group and at three time points for control groups.

This booklet contained basic information on the use of warfarin such as how the drug should be used, its adverse effects, drug-drug and drug-food interactions, dental care, exercise, and laboratory monitoring. Expert opinion was obtained from ten persons (two cardiology doctors, two cardiovascular surgery doctors and six nursing instructor) before the study for the booklet and the questionnaire forms. In order to evaluate the comprehensibility of the questionnaire forms and the booklet, a pilot study was conducted with ten patients. Based on their feedback, some words and sentences were changed for clarity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Education program</title><p>At the first interview, the questionnaires were applied to both groups. Afterwards, patients in the intervention group were given a power point presentation about the safety of warfarin therapy of approximately 45 minutes, and a one-to-one education session.

The usual care for patients with warfarin usage in Turkey is informing by a doctor but structured education not available in all hospitals. The warfarin knowledge evaluation form was applied again to the patients of each group in the first and second months, and the INR values for those dates were obtained from hospital records. Any harm was not observed in the control group patients due to study.

rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In this study it was found that the number of patients with a therapeutic INR values before and after education was low in both groups. An increase in INR control was expected along with the increase in knowledge levels of patients in the intervention group after education, but the results showed no significant difference between the intervention and control groups. In studies to determine INR control in patients using warfarin, the percentages of patients with therapeutic INR values were variable. In a study by Kalra et al. (2000), 61% of patients were found to have INR values within the therapeutic range.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This percentage was found to be 61% in Nelson et al. (2015) and 67% in Oramasionwu et al. (2014).<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The present study confirms findings of earlier studies done in Turkey that INR control is better in patients in studies in other countries.</p><p>Patient knowledge level plays an important part in the prevention of the serious complications which can be seen with treatment. The incorrect use of medication by patients whose knowledge levels are inadequate increases the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Mean scores of patients in the intervention and control groups of the study were found to be similar before education, while in measurements made one and two months after education it was found that the mean knowledge scores of patients in the intervention group were significantly higher. Results of studies to determine the knowledge levels of patients using warfarin show that knowledge levels are low.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Two studies also report that patients&#x02019; warfarin knowledge levels were at a moderate level.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Because no correlation was found between patients&#x02019; warfarin knowledge levels and the INR number within the therapeutic range, it was concluded in the study that INR control was not affected by warfarin knowledge levels (p&#x0003e;0.05). A longer follow-up period may be necessary to determine behavior changes resulting from knowledge acquired by patients following education and their reflection in INR measurement results. In addition, in situations which are out of the control of the patient or which have a genetic cause such as warfarin resistance, INR values may be affected, and even if patient adherence to treatment is adequate, INR control may be insufficient.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In some studies, positive correlations have been found between patients&#x02019; knowledge levels and anticoagulant control and drug adherence and INR numbers within the therapeutic range, and it has been seen that the INR control of patients whose knowledge was at an adequate level was better than that of that of patients whose knowledge level was inadequate.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, other studies are in agreement with the present study in showing that patients&#x02019; INR control is not affected by knowledge level.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Patients over the age of 65 were excluded from the study because their literacy rates were low, in order to reduce the effect of education. Also, a standard questionnaire was not used to measure patients&#x02019; warfarin knowledge levels. For these reasons, the results should be relevant to the population in this study. The fact that the one-to-one education and the application of the questionnaire took approximately 60 minutes and patients&#x02019; unwillingness to participate in the application of the questionnaire in the first and second months resulted in the loss of some patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>After the education, patients in the intervention group on the safety of warfarin therapy, patients&#x02019; warfarin knowledge levels increased by approximately 50%, and it was found that the warfarin knowledge levels of the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group. There was no significant difference between INR control in patients in the intervention and control groups. An increase in INR control was expected as a result of an increase in patients&#x02019; knowledge of warfarin, but no correlation was found between INR control and warfarin knowledge levels. One to one patient education and the individualized education should be given by determining patients&#x02019; individual differences and lack of information. Health institutions should implement regular patient education programs and booklets about the safety of warfarin to prevent life-threatening complications. Achieving success with warfarin treatment is required effective INR control in order to prevent the complications.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A longer follow-up period may be necessary to determine behavior changes resulting from knowledge acquired by patients following education and their reflection in INR measurement results.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank the Teaching Staff Training Program Coordination Centre of University and all of the experts for their views on the booklet and questionnaire.
