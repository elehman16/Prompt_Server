Tuberculosis is a major infectious disease in China, with a prevalence of 459 per 100,000. China has the second-highest incidence of tuberculosis in the world, with up to 1,300,000 new cases each year, accounting for 14.3% of new cases in the world. Tuberculosis has become a major public health and social problem in China. China is one of 22 countries in the world with a high burden of tuberculosis [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>A combination of anti-tuberculosis drugs is needed to treat tuberculosis. Adverse reactions may occur during anti-tuberculosis treatment, which has become a serious problem for tuberculosis treatment staff, especially basic-level medical workers. Anti-tuberluosis drug-induced liver injury (anti-TB DILI) is the most common and the most harmful adverse reaction [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The prevalence of anti-TB DILI among Chinese patients is 8%-30%. The clinical manifestations are loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, discomfort or pain in the liver area, and increased level of aminotransferase. In severe cases, liver failure may occur, which may be life-threatening. If not handled properly, the liver injury may not only cause great pain but also cause some patients to terminate anti-tuberculosis treatment or to change therapeutic schemes, thus reducing the efficacy of the treatment and leading to drug resistance, which may affect the evolution of the disease and the prognosis of the patient [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Medical consultations, treatment, and hospitalization of such patients due to anti-TB DILI increase the financial burden on their families and the economic burden on society.</p><p>Clinicians attach great importance to this problem. The identification and timely treatment of anti-TB DILI, as well as the reasonable application of anti-liver injury drugs in anti-tuberculosis treatment, can not only improve patient compliance, but also ensure the smooth progress of the anti-tuberculosis treatment and increase the recovery rate [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], thus reducing the financial burden on patients and obtaining good cost-effectiveness. The diagnosis and treatment guidelines for and the expert advice on anti-TB DILI point out that for mild-to-moderate liver cell damage and mixed-type anti-TB DILI, based on the degree of abnormality of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), different treatment schemes can be adopted with clinical symptoms and signs as a reference. Treatment schemes include liver-protecting therapy with bicyclol, glycyrrhizin or silibinin [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Starting in the United States in the late 1970s [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], pharmacoeconomics has been studied and applied widely in more and more countries with the sharp increase in global medical expenses. Pharmacoeconomics is the evaluation of drug resources through the evaluation of the utilization level of drug resources, and provides the theoretical basis for scientific decision-making. At present, the prospective observational study is considered the ideal standard for pharmacoeconomic research [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The decision analysis approach is an effective tool to choose the optimal scheme from a series of therapeutic schemes.</p><p>As the anti-TB DILI-related pharmacoeconomic research indicates, bicyclol has the advantage of cost-effectiveness [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] for treating anti-TB DILI compared with diammonium glycyrrhizinate enteric-coated capsules, silibinin capsules, polyene phosphatidylcholine capsules, and tiopronin enteric-coated tablets.

The cost-effectiveness of three commonly used and efficient anti-liver injury drugs were evaluated: diammonium glycyrrhizinate enteric-coated capsules, bicyclol tablets, and silibinin capsules. The aim of this study was as follows: (1) Identify an economic, reasonable, safe, efficient, and optimal clinical pathway. (2) Reduce the burden of anti-TB DILI patients. (3) Provide a scientific and rational medical decision-making basis for clinicians.

and implicit costs, and it is quantified by monetary unit. The direct cost is the cost of medical services, including the direct medical costs and the direct nonmedical costs. At present, there is no unified approach to convert and calculate the implicit cost (the expenses incurred by the pain, sadness, and mental trauma caused by disease). The indirect costs (the loss incurred by the failure to work due to disease), the implicit costs, and the direct nonmedical costs could be negligible in the study, and only the costs of the anti-liver injury drugs and the processing costs of adverse reactions were calculated to avoid the data deviation. So we established the calculation formula as Ccost = Cdrug+ Cadverse reaction. The costs of the drugs used were calculated based on their prices in local hospitals in 2015. Mild adverse reactions did not need to be treated and thus did not incur any costs. Other adverse reactions were divided into two levels. Patients with moderate adverse reactions required treatment with simple drugs. Based on expert opinion, the cost of treatment of moderate adverse reactions was set at 40 CNY per person. Patients with severe adverse reactions required hospitalization. Hospitalization costs were based on the cost of hospitalization in national secondary-level public hospitals between January and May 2015, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China. The cost was set at 5320.5 CNY per person. Because of the short length of the study, there was no discount for extended treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="j_med-2018-0010_tab_003">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="j_med-2018-0010_s_002_s_006"><label>2.6</label><title>Analytic techniques</title><sec id="j_med-2018-0010_s_002_s_006_s_001"><label>2.6.1</label><title>Statistical analysis of therapeutic efficacy</title><p>The sample size was calculated according to the results of previous studies.

A study by Wang and colleagues [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] suggested that the silibinin capsule was the inferior treatment. Although both the present study and Wang&#x02019;s study showed that the silibinin capsule had the lowest effect and the lowest complete normalization rate, the dosage of silibinin capsules in Wang&#x02019;s study was twice that in the present study. The silibinin capsule had the highest cost-effectiveness ratio in Wang&#x02019;s study because the cost was higher than that of bicyclol and diammonium glycyrrhizinate enteric&#x02013;coated capsules, while the cost of silibinin in this study was the lowest.</p><p>The recovery of liver function in patients with anti-TB DILI ensures the smooth progress of anti-tuberculosis therapy. Silibinin capsules can be used for patients with lower financial resources and lower treatment expectations. But if the patient requires a better recovery of liver function, bicyclol is the preferred therapeutic regimen. A variety of anti-liver injury drugs with different efficacy, safety, and prices are available in China. Anti-TB DILI patients and clinicians should choose appropriate drugs that can not only recover patients&#x02019; liver functions and keep their tuberculosis treatment going, but also ensure the economy and safety of the therapy.</p><p>According to the Chinese Society of Hepatology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of DILI, the principles for DILI treatment included treating DILI with appropriate anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective agents according to the clinical patterns of DILI [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Research confirms that glycyrrhizin has a protective efficacy against liver damage caused by rifampin and isoniazid [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and has good therapeutic efficacy against anti-TB DILI [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Silibinin is a flavonoid derived from the fruit of milk thistle (Silybum marianum), which has many pharmacological actions including resisting lipid peroxidation, eliminating free radicals, maintaining stabilization of the cell membrane, and promoting hepatocellular regeneration [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It can effectively prevent anti-TB DILI [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Bicyclol has anti-inflammatory and hepatic protective pharmacological action on several experimental liver injuries. Its mechanism of action is closely related to the increase of anti-inflammatory factors, the elimination of free radicals, anti-lipid peroxidation, and the protection of biological membranes and mitochondrial function [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Clinical studies have confirmed that bicyclol can prevent and cure anti-TB DILI [<xref rid="j_med-2018-0010_ref_032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="j_med-2018-0010_s_005"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>With the advantage of cost-effectiveness, bicyclol can be used as a safe, efficient, and economical anti-liver injury drug to treat anti-TB DILI. This study explored the prospective economic evaluation of the treatment of anti-TB DILI with anti-liver injury drugs. Because of the limited number of cases included in the study, only the pharmacoeconomic analysis of a 4-week course was conducted, and indirect costs, implicit costs, and direct nonmedical costs were not calculated in this study. It is necessary to carry out a larger-scale and more thorough pharmacoeconomic study to evaluate the economic effect of anti-liver injury drugs in anti-TB DILI treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="j_med-2018-0010_fn_001"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest</bold>: Authors state no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="j_med-2018-0010_ref_001"><label>[1]</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" publication-format="print"><name><surname>Glaziou</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Floyd</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Weil</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Raviglione</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><article-title>TB deaths rank alongside HIV deaths as top infectious killer</article-title><source>Int J.
