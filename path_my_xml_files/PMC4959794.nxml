Patients received either on-demand symptomatic standard treatment (ST-group) or the same ST plus a homeopathic medication (Influcid; IFC-group) for 7 days. Outcome assessment was based on symptom and fever resolution and the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey&#x02013;21 (WURSS-21). A total of 261 pediatric (&#x0003c;12 years) patients (130 IFC-group; 131 ST-group) were recruited in Germany and the Ukraine. The IFC-group used less symptomatic medication, symptoms resolved significantly earlier (<italic>P</italic> = .0001), had higher proportions of fever-free children from day 3 onwards, and the WURSS-assessed global disease severity was significantly less (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001) during the entire URTI episode. One adverse event (vomiting) was possibly related to IFC. IFC as add-on treatment in pediatric URTI reduced global disease severity, shortened symptom resolution, and was safe in use.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>upper respiratory tract infections</kwd><kwd>fever</kwd><kwd>pediatrics</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled clinical trial</kwd><kwd>homeopathy</kwd><kwd>Influcid<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2333794X16654851"><title>Introduction</title><p>Children are frequently affected by upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) or common colds, causing a lot of missed days from kindergarten or school,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> as well as missed days off work for parents who have to take leave to take care of their child.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Each year young children may have as many as 6 to 8 or even more episodes.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr6-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents found that the 1-year average prevalence of URTI among children and adolescents amounts to 88.5%, with the highest prevalence of almost 94% among children aged 3 to 6 years.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Symptoms usually include sore throat, runny nose, general malaise, and low-grade fever at onset, followed by nasal congestion and cough, and peak at around day 3 or 4 after the onset of symptoms.

The significantly lower global disease severity during the course of the URTI in the IFC-group was highly clinically relevant. Typical symptoms such as whining and the child being less active were positively affected as well.</p><p>The main aspects of the study are briefly discussed below; for further details see the publication by Thinesse-Mallwitz et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The study was randomized, and care was taken to ensure allocation concealment. The population was well defined as URTI of viral origin, where the need for further treatment options is greatest. A further strength of this trial is the high external validity because its design is representative for routine clinical practice where the choice would be to offer IFC as an add-on treatment or not.</p><p>Due to the exploratory nature of this analysis, no type 1 error adjustment took place for testing multiple outcomes.</p><p>A limitation of this study was the absence of blinding to the treatment allocation, which could have led to a performance bias. In a study of Echinacea for URTI,<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> which included both a &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d; and an &#x0201c;unblinded&#x0201d; echinacea treatment arm, it was found that the mean global severity in the blinded group (as assessed via the WURSS-21) was not different from the global severity in the unblinded group. This suggests that the possible influence of blinding on the outcome assessment of URTI symptoms using the WURSS-21 may be limited. Blinding could have been addressed in our study by giving an indistinguishable placebo to the control group, but we chose not to do so because we aimed to reflect usual practical care as closely as possible.</p><p>Overall, the results in the pediatric population were similar to the results in the full trial, which included adolescents and adults as well. This suggests that the effects of IFC in URTI are relatively stable across different age groups. The main difference from the full data set was a lower cumulative dose of symptomatic medication intake in children, as was to be expected in a pediatric population.</p><p>The 6 single homeopathic ingredients of IFC have a long tradition in the treatment of flu-like infections and URTI and the effectiveness and safety of IFC (German name: Nisylen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) in the treatment of URTI was investigated in one open observational study including 94 patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Another observational study, which included 600 patients (333 adults, 267 children) with URTI, reported an improvement in about 90% of patients after 3 days (M. Heger, 1997; Statistical Report, Deutsche Hom&#x000f6;opathie-Union, Karlsruhe, Germany). A further study compared the effectiveness of IFC in children aged 3 to 6 years with URTI to a cohort of children treated with symptomatic medication.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In the IFC-group, clinical symptoms declined significantly earlier, as also shown in the present study. A limitation in the above-mentioned studies is the absence of an adequate randomized control group, which is why we conducted the current study.</p><p>The use of homeopathy in general and especially in children is common. A longitudinal study indicated that in Germany 28% of infants were treated with homeopathy during their second year of life,<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and another German survey reported that common cold and flu is the most frequent indication where users (&#x0003e;16 years) report positive experiences with homeopathy.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Among adult homeopathy users in the United States, respiratory and ear, nose, and throat complaints are the most commonly treated conditions.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The current trial evidence in children on the homeopathic treatment of URTI concerns the prevention of URTI<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="bibr33-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr34-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr35-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and the treatment of chronic recurrent URTI.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Moreover, there exists evidence for the treatment of other conditions that can include URTI,<sup><xref rid="bibr37-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="bibr38-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr39-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr40-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> and some non&#x02013;controlled studies are available that contain promising data on the treatment of chronic URTI,<sup><xref rid="bibr41-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> cough,<sup><xref rid="bibr42-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and the safety of a complex homeopathic medicine in the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> A comparative cohort study conducted in France showed that homeopathically managed patients with URTI had significantly lower consumption of antibiotics compared to conventionally managed patients, while achieving comparable clinical outcomes,<sup><xref rid="bibr44-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> pointing to potential benefits from a health economic perspective and to decrease the public health risk related to antibiotic resistance. While more evidence on the homeopathic treatment of pediatric URTI is needed, homeopathy merits consideration as a treatment option in the early symptom management of otherwise uncomplicated URTI.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p><p>The need for safe and effective alternatives for the treatment of pediatric URTI is further increased by the overuse of antibiotics, particularly in preschool pediatric patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Data from 13 eastern European countries suggest that overuse of antibiotics is common practice.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Holstiege et al found that the use of antibiotics is higher in the winter months, which is a likely indicator of the inappropriate use of antibiotics in mostly viral infections.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Moreover, the available data suggest that in general the off-label use of antibiotics is particularly prevalent in pediatric patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr47-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> This problem is compounded further by the widespread over-the-counter sales of antibiotics,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> which is currently permitted in many countries.<sup><xref rid="bibr48-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup></p><p>While controversial and subject to further confirmation, the mechanism of action of homeopathic medicines in infectious diseases is purported to take place via nanoparticles, supporting the natural immune functions of the body.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="bibr50-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Such a mechanism is clearly different from that of antibiotics and in line with one of homeopathy&#x02019;s core principles: &#x0201c;Treat the patient, not the disease.&#x0201d; In self-limiting diseases such as URTI, an improved immune function would express itself as a shorter and less severe symptomatic course of URTI, which is what we observed in our trial. It is known that single or intermittent repetitions of low-intensity levels of a foreign stressor or substance initiate a process of progressive endogenous response amplification over time.<sup><xref rid="bibr50-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Within the organism as a complex adaptive system or network, the intermittent administration of IFC might contribute to the body&#x02019;s intrinsic healing process in the sense of a stimulus or stressor.</p><p>Further controlled studies to investigate and confirm the role of homeopathic medicinal products including IFC in the treatment of URTI are warranted. Since there is a rising and increasingly intractable problem of antibiotics resistance,<sup><xref rid="bibr51-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="bibr52-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> homeopathy may also be able to contribute at a public health level to contain this problem due to an antibiotic sparing effect. The World Health Organization argues that there is an important role for the pharmacist, as an interface between the health care system and the patient, to help dealing with the increasing problem of antibiotics resistance.<sup><xref rid="bibr48-2333794X16654851" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> This fits well with the pharmacist also being an important interface with patients regarding the use of homeopathic medicines, particularly for self-limiting conditions such as URTI.</p><p>IFC as an add-on treatment for URTI in pediatric care reduced the global disease severity, resulted in significantly earlier symptom resolution, and was safe in use. While further confirmatory studies are needed, this study suggests that IFC could make a positive contribution to the management of URTI in pediatric patients.</p></sec><sec id="section8-2333794X16654851"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>RVH: Contributed to interpretation; drafted manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>MTM: Contributed to conception and design; contributed to acquisition and interpretation; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>VM: Contributed to conception and design; contributed to acquisition; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>SLB: Contributed to interpretation; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>SW: Contributed to analysis and interpretation; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>KT: Contributed to conception and design; contributed to analysis and interpretation; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>JB: Contributed to interpretation; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>PK: Contributed to conception and design; contributed to interpretation; critically revised manuscript, gave final approval, agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all investigators and patients who participated in this study.
