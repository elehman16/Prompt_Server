In Africa, artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine is the most widely used artemisinin-based combination therapy, whereas artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine is used infrequently because of a perceived poor tolerance to mefloquine. WHO recommends reconsideration of the use of artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine in Africa. We compared the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine with that of artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine for treatment of children younger than 5 years with uncomplicated <italic>P falciparum</italic> malaria.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did this multicentre, phase 4, open-label, non-inferiority trial in Burkina Faso, Kenya, and Tanzania. Children aged 6&#x02013;59 months with uncomplicated malaria were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation list, to receive 3 days' treatment with either one or two artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine tablets (25 mg artesunate and 55 mg mefloquine) once a day or one or two artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine tablets (20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine) twice a day. Parasitological assessments were done independently by two microscopists who were blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the PCR-corrected rate of adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at day 63 in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority was shown if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference between groups was greater than &#x02212;5%. Early vomiting was monitored and neuropsychiatric status assessed regularly during follow-up. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN17472707, and the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number PACTR201202000278282.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>945 children were enrolled and randomised, 473 to artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine and 472 to artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine. The per-protocol population consisted of 407 children in each group. The PCR-corrected ACPR rate at day 63 was 90&#x000b7;9% (370 patients) in the artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine group and 89&#x000b7;7% (365 patients) in the artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine group (treatment difference 1&#x000b7;23%, 95% CI &#x02212;2&#x000b7;84% to 5&#x000b7;29%). At 72 h after the start of treatment, no child had detectable parasitaemia and less than 6% had fever, with a similar number in each group (21 in the artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine group <italic>vs</italic> 24 in the artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine group). The safety profiles of artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine and artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine were similar, with low rates of early vomiting (71 [15&#x000b7;3%] of 463 patients in the artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine group <italic>vs</italic> 79 [16&#x000b7;8%] of 471 patients in the artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine group in any of the three dosing days), few neurological adverse events (ten [2&#x000b7;1%] of 468 <italic>vs</italic> five [1&#x000b7;1%] of 465), and no detectable psychiatric adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine is effective and safe, and an important treatment option, for children younger than 5 years with uncomplicated <italic>P falciparum</italic> malaria in Africa.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Agence Fran&#x000e7;aise de D&#x000e9;veloppement, France; Department for International Development, UK; Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Netherlands; European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership; Fondation Arpe, Switzerland; M&#x000e9;decins Sans Fronti&#x000e8;res; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, Switzerland.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since 2000, there has been substantial progress in the worldwide effort to control, and in some regions eliminate, malaria.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> However, the disease still caused an estimated 438&#x02008;000 deaths worldwide in 2015, mostly in Africa (90%) and in children younger than 5 years (70%).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The widespread deployment of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for treating malaria is recognised as one key public health initiative for reducing malaria morbidity and mortality.

We found two trials (Smithuis et al, 2010; Ashley et al, 2006) of the fixed-dose artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine tablet with ACPR at day 63 of follow-up as the primary outcome. These studies were done in Asia in populations of mixed age. Four trials (Faye et al, 2007; Agomo et al, 2008; Sagara et al, 2008; Bhatt et al, 2006) of fixed-dose artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine were done in Africa in populations of mixed age but with ACPR at 28 days as the primary outcome.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>As far as we are aware, our trial is the first to be reported on a fixed-dose artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine formulation and done in young African patients with a trial design that fully complies with WHO guidelines. It is the largest randomised, controlled trial providing efficacy and safety data for artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine in children in Africa. Our findings showed that artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine is non-inferior to artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine for the primary endpoint of PCR-corrected ACPR rate at day 63. We also found that the two treatments had similarly good safety profiles, with low rates of early vomiting and few recorded neurological adverse events. Our efficacy and safety data are consistent with the findings of large trials (Smithuis et al, 2010; Ashley et al, 2006) of the same fixed-dose tablet, which were done in Asia in mixed-aged patients with uncomplicated malaria. Additionally, we obtained evidence that artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine might delay re-infection for longer than artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine does, which might be explained by the much slower rate of clearance of mefloquine compared with lumefantrine.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine is one of five artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) that are currently recommended by WHO as antimalarial treatments. However, this combination was not registered in Africa at the time of the start of the trial. WHO recommends deployment of multiple ACTs to reduce the risk of the development of drug resistance. Our data suggest that fixed-dose artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine is safe and effective in treating young children with uncomplicated malaria in Africa and is as effective as artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine. These findings should have important implications for health policy in Africa, where malaria remains a major public health problem, particularly in young children.</p></boxed-text></p><p>Antimalarial drugs are used in combinations to prevent or delay the development of drug resistance and are now recommended in most malaria-endemic countries.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Monotherapy with artemisinin or its derivatives is now strongly discouraged,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> especially after the emergence of artemisinin resistance in some regions.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Deployment of multiple ACTs is regarded to be a further means to reduce development of drug resistance.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Several effective ACTs are now available, many as fixed-dose formulations,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> which offer improved patient adherence.

The fixed-dose artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine dispersible tablet (20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine, containing flavouring [Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland]), was dispersed in 200 mL milk (or breastmilk); it was given twice a day for 3 days, either as one tablet (for bodyweight &#x02265;5 kg to &#x0003c;15 kg) or two tablets (for bodyweight &#x02265;15 kg to &#x0003c;25 kg). Treatment was supervised and children observed for 60 min after treatment for possible vomiting. Test drug was readministered if vomiting occurred within 60 min. Patients with persistent vomiting and requiring more than a single repeat dose were excluded from the study and referred for further clinical management.</p><p>Children were followed up to day 63 after the start of treatment or to the first recurrence (first follow-up period). Patients with parasitaemia during follow-up were then switched to the alternative test treatment (except in Burkina Faso, where quinine was used for parasitaemia occurring within 28 days of the start of initial treatment, according to a national recommendation) and another 63 days of follow-up was started (second follow-up period), to collect efficacy and safety data, because artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine was not a registered medicine in the participating countries.</p><p>Clinical signs, including neuropsychological observations, were assessed and recorded before and during the first 3 days post treatment, and on follow-up visits on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and 63 (of first follow-up) and on days 7, 28, and 63 post recurrence (of second follow-up), and whenever required. Adverse events and concomitant drug treatment were systematically recorded at each visit, with haematological and biochemical analyses done on samples taken on days 0, 7, 28, and 63, and whenever clinically required. Investigators recorded whether results of patient examinations and sample analyses were normal or abnormal (with detailed description of any abnormalities). Concomitant drug treatment was recorded, with paracetamol allowed for fever. Intake of any drug with antimalarial properties led to study withdrawal.</p><p>Parasitological assessments (thick and thin blood films) were done independently by two microscopists (blinded to treatment allocation) at least once every 24 h or until parasite clearance (defined as two consecutive negative readings 8&#x02013;24 h apart), and then, on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and 63, and whenever required. Parasite density was expressed as number of asexual parasites per &#x003bc;L blood, calculated from a count relative to 200 or 300 counted white blood cells and the blood cell density; a negative count was 1000 white blood cells counted without detecting any asexual parasites.</p><p>Recrudescence and re-infection were differentiated by characterising malaria strains of initial infection and of recurrence, using internationally prescribed procedures<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> for PCR genotypic analysis of extensively diverse genes (<italic>msp1, msp2, glurp</italic>) in blood collected immediately before treatment (baseline) and on day of recurrence.</p><p>In the first amendment of the original study protocol, the study was extended to include sites in Kenya and Burkina Faso, the sampling sequence of the pharmacokinetic part of the study was increased to be consistent with the product's half-life, and an additional sampling for PCR analysis was included at day 7, in accordance with WHO recommendations. The second amendment included addition of the second 63-day follow-up. In the third amendment, the major change was the addition of new sites (Korogwe and Bagamoyo) in Tanzania, to reach the required number of patients.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Treatment outcomes (classified using standard definitions and adjusted to the 63 days of follow-up) were adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR), early treatment failure, late parasitological failure, and late clinical failure. At intervals after the start of treatment, we calculated the gametocyte carriage (percentage of patients with gametocytes) and the parasite reduction ratio (baseline parasite count/parasite count at the specific interval).</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was PCR-corrected ACPR rate at day 63 (in the per-protocol population). The secondary efficacy endpoints were non-PCR-corrected ACPR rate at day 63; Kaplan-Meier analysis of number of patients with ACPR after PCR correction; proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late treatment failure, and late parasitological failure; proportion of patients with recrudescence or re-infection; PCR-corrected and non-PCR-corrected ACPR rates on days 28 and 42; proportion of patients with parasitaemia on days 1, 2, and 3; rate of gametocyte carriage; and proportion of patients with fever on days 1, 2, and 3. Pharmacokinetic analyses were also included as a secondary endpoint and will be presented elsewhere.

The final version of the statistical analysis plan was signed before database lock and any analyses of results. The statistical analyses were done independently (Venn Life Sciences, Paris, France). The primary analysis tested the non-inferiority of artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine over artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine, using the per-protocol analysis of PCR-adjusted ACPR at day 63. The per-protocol population consisted of all patients without a major protocol deviation, who were fully treatment compliant (defined as &#x02265;80% and &#x0003c;120% intake of study drug), who had a primary endpoint at day 63, and who did not withdraw from study treatment (except for those who withdrew because of adverse events or an absence of efficacy). Patients who withdrew because of adverse events were initially excluded from the per-protocol population according to the protocol, but, during the development of the statistical analysis plan, it was decided they be included in the per-protocol population and imputed as failures because withdrawals due to adverse events could potentially be linked to treatment. Non-inferiority was shown if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference between groups was greater than &#x02212;5%. A further analysis of PCR-adjusted ACPR at day 63 (with the same method as for the per-protocol analysis) was done in the intention-to-treat population, which consisted of all randomly allocated patients who received at least one dose of study drug. No adjustment on any baseline covariate was performed. For the intention-to-treat analysis, we imputed missing primary endpoint data. We did an additional Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank test) of the rate of PCR-adjusted ACPR using a modified intention-to-treat population defined as all intention-to-treat patients except for those with undetermined or missing PCR results. This analysis, not planned in the protocol, was added to the statistical analysis plan to follow the 2009 WHO guidelines.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> A sample size of 399 patients per treatment was calculated to be required for 90% power with 2&#x000b7;5% significance for the one-sided comparison of rate of treated patients attaining a PCR-adjusted ACPR at day 63; this calculation was based on the assumptions that 95% of patients treated with artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine would achieve the primary endpoint, an expected difference of 0%, and a clinically relevant non-inferiority margin of 5%. To allow for an expected loss to follow-up of 15%, target recruitment was 470 patients in each treatment group.</p><p>Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for comparison of non-normally distributed continuous variables. The differences between treatments in the parasite reduction ratios, measured at intervals during the first 3 days after the start of treatment, were analysed using a linear mixed effects model, with parasite reduction ratio as the dependent variable and treatment group, baseline parasite count, and site as independent variables, and the time interval as random effect (the parasite count was derived from thick smear counts; counts of 0 were assigned a value of 1 for the analysis).

Non-inferiority of artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine to artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine was shown for the PCR-corrected ACPR rates at days 28 and 42 in both the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p><p>The Kaplan-Meier analysis (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>; modified intention-to-treat population) showed no difference in efficacy between artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine and artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine (p=0&#x000b7;8153, log-rank test), with higher PCR-corrected ACPR rates for both treatments than in the per-protocol non-inferiority analysis. There were 13 ACPR failures with artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine and 16 with artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine in the per-protocol non-inferiority analysis, and 17 and 18, respectively, in the Kaplan-Meier modified intention-to-treat analysis (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p><p>A similar number of patients in the artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine (n=204) and artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine (n=202) groups completed the 63-day study period (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).

A similar number of serious adverse events (mostly anaemia or infection) occurred with artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine (n=16) as with artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine (n=14), with one life-threatening adverse event and no fatalities. The life-threatening adverse event was anaemia, reported on day 1 of artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine treatment, and led to early treatment failure caused by severe malaria and suspected sepsis, and recorded as possibly related to treatment. Overall, 18 (1&#x000b7;9%) of 933 patients had at least one serious adverse event, mostly infection (in seven patients in the artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine group and five in the artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine group; pneumonia being most common with three cases in each group) or anaemia (two <italic>vs</italic> four patients).

During this follow-up, the relation of adverse events to rescue treatment was only recorded in the centres in Burkina Faso, where no patient had an adverse event that was at least possibly related to treatment.

The low deployment of artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine in Africa might result from the early vomiting and neuropsychiatric effects reported with mefloquine monotherapy,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> and also from the absence of a fixed-dose paediatric formulation. In this study we tested a fixed-dose artesunate&#x02013;mefloquine tablet, designed to optimise the compliance of a 3-day combination treatment and to improve the tolerability of mefloquine by dividing the dose into three equal daily doses.

Our findings should have important implications for health policy in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation
