The aim of the present study was to assess the preventive effect of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) on AO and also its effect on pain management and healing acceleration in third molar extraction sockets of high-risk patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This split-mouth, double-blind clinical trial included 40 bilateral third molar extractions (80 sockets) with at least one identified risk factor for AO. PRGF was obtained from patient's own blood, based on manufacturer's instruction, and blindly placed in one of the two bilateral sockets (PRGF group; <italic>n</italic> = 20) of each patient. The contralateral socket was treated with a placebo (control group; <italic>n</italic> = 20). Samples were evaluated for AO and pain incidence on days 2, 3 and 4 and healing and infection on days 3 and 7. Data were analyzed in SPSS v16 using Wilcoxon test.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>There was a significant difference in dry socket and pain incidence and healing rate between the two groups. Intensity of pain and occurrence of dry socket in the study group was lower than the controls. Also the healing rate was higher (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) for the PRGF group. No sign of infection was seen in either group.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The application of PRGF may significantly reduce the incidence of AO or its associated pain and may accelerate healing. The prophylactic use of PRGF following third molar extraction may be suggested especially in the patients at risk of AO.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dry socket</kwd><kwd>plasma rich in growth factors</kwd><kwd>PRP</kwd><kwd>third molar extraction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>The high prevalence (20% to 30%) of dry socket and its associated discomfort and complications remain one of the most important concerns of the dental profession.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The etiology of alveolar osteitis (AO) is not clear but increased fibrinolytic activity in the extraction socket has been shown to be associated with the clot lyses and exposure of the bone to the oral cavity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The increased fibrinolysis is thought to be attributed to surgery trauma, pathogenic fibrinolytics, enzymatic changes due to the inflammation, presence of high amounts of bacteria before and after surgery and other factors. The treatment is merely symptomatic and is limited to pain alleviation. Clinicians have attempted to observe preventive measures e.g. the administration of antifibrinolytics, antiseptics and antibiotics. These attempts, however, have not been uniformly successful due to the obscurity of the etiologic factors. Failure to prevent AO, on the other hand, will lead to clinical presentation of highly tender exposed bony surfaces, severe pain in the extraction site, moderate to severe dull headache with pain radiating to the ears in some instances, halitosis and altered taste.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>The present study was conducted to assess the effect of autogenous PRGF applied postoperatively in the prevention of AO.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Included were 40 patients with age range of 18 to 45 years. Bilateral (maxillary or mandibular) third molar extractions with similar scores of the Pederson scale of extraction difficulty and at least one AO risk factor (a history of pericoronitis, contraceptive uptake, smoking habits, bruxism or a history of AO) were chosen. Excluded were patients under antibiotic regimen or other interfering medications (e.g. steroids or antidepressants) at the time of the study. Also patients with complications during extraction, neurologic diseases, prophylactic needs, and lack of cooperation (e.g. patients who were not present for the follow-up sessions) were excluded. Impacted or partially impacted third molars were not excluded provided the difficulty of extraction was similar bilaterally. Venous blood samples were taken from patients prior to extraction.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>PRGF preparation</title><p>Ten milliliters of blood was obtained from cephalic or basilic veins (due to their accessibility and sufficient diameter) using 19 gauge needle to avoid platelet rupture or activation in the lumen. Sampled blood was immediately transferred to a syringe containing anticoagulant (1 ml of 3.8% sodium citrate for 10 ml blood) and centrifuged in PRGF system (BTI, Vitoria, Spain), set for 460 G in 8 minutes, to sediment platelets. Three layers were isolated after centrifugation: Red blood cells (RBCs) at the bottom, white blood cells (WBCs) in the middle and plasma on the surface. The surface plasma itself contained three distinct layers [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Platelet poor in growth factors (PPGF) on the top (500 &#x003bc;l), plasma growth factors (PGF) in the middle and PRGF at the bottom which contains the highest concentrations of platelets and growth factors accumulated right above the RBCs. PPGF and PGF were separately retrieved using two 500 &#x003bc;l pipettes. CaCl<sub>2</sub> was then added to PRGF (0.05 ml per ml) and coagulation was obtained within 5 to 8 minutes. To decrease coagulation time, PRGF was placed on a thermal block prior to activation to reach body temperature (37&#x000b0;). Finally the formed gel was placed in the socket.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The comparative illustration of the pain intensity (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation) felt by the patients (scored on VAS) on the second, the third and the fourth days following the third molar extraction.

All extractions were performed by a single surgeon in order to standardize the level of surgical trauma. PRGF was blindly placed in one of the two bilateral sockets of each patient. These sockets were considered as the PRGF group (<italic>n</italic> = 20). The other socket in each patient was treated via placebo. These sockets were considered as the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 20). Sockets were examined 2, 3 and 4 days postoperatively by a blinded examiner to detect possible development of AO and pain was recorded on visual analogue scale (VAS). The scoring was as follows: 0 = no pain, 1&#x02013;3 = mild pain, 4&#x02013;6 = moderate pain, 6&#x02013;8 = severe pain and 9 = pain with the highest possible severity. Healing was assessed on the third and the seventh days based on healing scale. The scale had 4 stages as follows: clot degeneration, wound departure with pus or without pus and no healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Data were analyzed in SPSS v16 using the Wilcoxon test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>Patients were 22.1 &#x000b1; 1.7 years old.

Included were cases with similar scores of the Pederson scale of difficulty of extraction and at least one AO predisposing factor.</p><p>Studies have shown that 0.2 ml of plasma located right above the red blood cells contains the highest concentrations of platelets, growth factors and fibrinogen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The application of PRGF in the extraction socket was associated with decreased occurrence of AO, decreased pain and discomfort and enhanced healing. Authors have reported the contributing effect of PRGF in healing after periodontal surgical or non-surgical managements.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Consistent to the findings of the present study, Amitua <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] studied the application of PRGF in different oral surgeries and reported remarkable outcomes in terms of epithelial proliferation, wound healing and bone regeneration in periodontal defects which were candidates for implant therapy. In another study, decreased epithelialization time, decreased bone regeneration time and improved bone regeneration were observed when PRGF was applied in the extraction socket of third molar. Also no pain, infection or AO was observed with the application of PRGF.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] This was also in accordance to the results of the present study. Several studies have assessed the effect of PRP, on the healing and regeneration of the soft and hard tissues in different surgeries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The coagulative effect of PRGF was most important. PRGF and PRP have the same platelet concentration which is the least concentration needed for clinical effects. (The PRP platelet concentration is 4&#x02013;7 times more than the peripheral blood platelet concentration (200.000) and the PRGF platelet concentration is 8 times more than the peripheral blood in 0.5 cc above the RBCs and 4 times greater in the next layer.)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Rutkowski <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] studied the effect of PRP on the prevention of AO after the extraction of 904 mandibular extractions. They claimed that the application of PRP decreases the occurrence of AO up to 60% seen in the high-risk patients. This value was 77% in the present study which is thought to be attributed to a higher efficacy of PRGF compared to PRP. The study of Rutkowski <italic>et al</italic>. did not include matched cases and was not case-control but the study population in the present split-mouth study was matched according to gender, age and difficulty of extraction.</p><p>Jerome <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] studied the preventive effect of PRP on AO following surgical removal of mandibular third molars of 117 patients. In their study, AO occurred in 3.4% of the PRP group and 12.8% of the control group. Also they noticed faster tissue healing, enhanced homeostasis and less swelling with the application of PRP.</p><p>PRGF does not need bovine or human thrombin for coagulation. Apart from the growth factors restored in the platelets, PRGF includes plasma proteins and coagulative factors and is then more advantageous compared to PRP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The pain relief and the healing rate increase due to the application of PRGF may be due to the inclusion of signaling proteins and platelet granules, which are immediately released with the activation of platelets and the initiation of coagulative cascade to form the clot. These factors are either synthesized by megakaryocytes or stored within the platelet granules or stored plasma proteins by endocytosis while circulating in blood cycle, because platelets do not have a nucleus and do not possess required elements for the production of these factors (insulin like growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, transforming growth factor rho, cytokines like angiopoietin II and interleukin I).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>These factors trigger differentiation, increase collagen synthesis, increase chemotaxis and other immune system cells to the surgery site and initiate angiogenesis. It also induces fibroblast proliferation, bone formation and bone regeneration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] The application of PRGF may significantly prevent AO and its complications due to long-term angiogenetic effect and increased regenerability. Patients with bruxism are highly susceptible to AO because of high bone density and the consequent decreased blood supply. The angiogenetic effect of PRGF may reduce these complications in bruxers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Patients with a history of pericoronitis may be predisposed to AO.</p><p>PRGF also accelerates the bone and tissue healing rate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Our study shows that the application of PRGF will help prevent the AO formation especially in susceptible patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENT</sc></title><p>This work was supported by the Research Department of Faculty of Dentistry.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This work was supported by the Research Department of Faculty of Dentistry</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Torres-Lagares</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Serrera-Figallo</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Romero-Ru&#x000ed;z</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Infante-Coss&#x000ed;o</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Garc&#x000ed;a-Calder&#x000f3;n</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Guti&#x000e9;rrez-P&#x000e9;rez</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Update on dry socket</article-title><source>Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal</source><year>2005</year><season>Jan-Feb</season><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>81</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><comment>77-81</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15627911</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jaffar</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Nor</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The prevalence of post-extraction complications in an outpatient dental clinic in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia</article-title><source>Singapore Dent J</source><year>2000</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>24</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11602946</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Matte</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Post -extraction complications seen at a referral dental clinic Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania</article-title><source>Int Dent J</source><year>2001</year><volume>51</volume><fpage>273</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11570541</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Blum</surname><given-names>IR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Contemporary views on dry socket (alveolar osteitis): A clinical appraisal of standardization, aetiopathogenesis and management: A critical review</article-title><source>Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg</source><year>2002</year><volume>31</volume><fpage>309</fpage><lpage>17</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12190139</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fridrich</surname><given-names>KL</given-names></name><name><surname>Raj</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Alveolar osteitis following removal of mandibular third molars</article-title><source>Anesth prog</source><year>1990</year><volume>37</volume><fpage>32</fpage><lpage>41</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2077984</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lilly</surname><given-names>GE</given-names></name><name><surname>Osborn</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Alveolar osteitis associated with mandibular third molar extractions</article-title><source>J Am Dent Assoc</source><year>1974</year><volume>88</volume><fpage>802</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4521772</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name></person-group><source>Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery</source><year>2009</year><volume>9</volume><edition>4th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>W.B.
