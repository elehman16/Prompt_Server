T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) along with MR angiography was performed with a Signa Excite 1.5 Tesla instrument (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA), when required, for confirming diagnosis. Diagnosis of ischemic stroke was made according to the World Health Organization definition.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The stroke subtypes were classified as per the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) study criteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Treatment</title><p>After inclusion, the patients were randomly divided into two groups according to computer-generated random sequences.

MRS score &#x02264;2 at 90 days was considered as a favorable outcome. The numbers of patients with favorable outcome (MRS &#x02264;2) were compared between two groups by Chi square test. For BI, the results were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and the mean were compared between two groups by independent t test.

Among edaravone group, 18 patients had large-artery atherosclerosis, 5 patients had small-artery occlusion, and 2 patients had cardioembolic stroke, whereas in placebo group, 16 patients had large-artery atherosclerosis, 6 patients had small-artery occlusion, and 3 patients had cardioembolic stroke. One patient in each of the placebo and edaravone group died at day 3 and day 5, respectively. Eighteen patients (72%) had favorable outcomes (MRS &#x02264;2) at 90 days in edaravone group, while 10 patients (40%) had favorable outcome in placebo group, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.

The neuroprotective agents may block reperfusion injury and help in decreasing neuronal damage. In the present study, 18 of 25 patients had favorable outcome (MRS &#x02264;2) at 90 days as compared with 10 patients in placebo group, and 3 patients became completely asymptomatic (MRS = 0) in edaravone group while none in placebo group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Our study observed significant improvement in functional outcome in favor of edaravone and also demonstrated its safety in Indian patients. The Edaravone Acute Brain Infarction Study (EABIS) Group also observed significant improvement in functional outcome in the edaravone group, as evaluated by the Modified Rankin Scale.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Frequency of Modifi ed Rankin Scale in edaravone and placebo groups at 90 days</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AIAN-14-103-g006"/></table-wrap><p>In EABIS study, the time limit to treatment after the onset of AIS was kept between 6 and 72 hours and the dose of edaravone was 30 mg twice daily for 14 days.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] In our study also, we followed the same dosing schedule and time criteria. An early phase II study involving edaravone had also demonstrated its efficacy up to 72 hours of onset of stroke. The improvement at 14 days was 52, 64, and 64% at doses of 20, 30, and 60 mg per day of edaravone, respectively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] On the basis of this study, the appropriate dose was considered to be 30 mg twice daily for 14 days.</p><p>The major adverse reactions were skin rash, abnormal liver function, and renal dysfunction, but they were more frequent in the placebo group and all patients recovered with treatment. The safety of edaravone was also established in an Indian study where no adverse reaction was observed in any of the patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Though EABIS group reported insignificant skin rashes and abnormal liver function in the edaravone group, there are few case reports of acute renal failure and fulminant hepatitis associated with edaravone administration and, therefore, careful monitoring of renal and liver functions is warranted while using this drug.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>The limitations of this study are the small sample size and that no blinding of the clinician was done.
