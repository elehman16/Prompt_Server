</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Patients receiving long-term administration of low-dose aspirin (LDA) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are at increased risk of developing gastric or duodenal ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore guidelines throughout the world recommend that patients receiving LDA or NSAIDs also receive proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or prostaglandin analogs to reduce gastric acid levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The efficacy of these agents is variable, but the agents of choice are PPIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 2010, lansoprazole was the first PPI approved for this indication in Japan. Ulcer recurrence in some patients (12.7&#x000a0;% of patients with NSAID-induced ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and 3.7&#x000a0;% with LDA-induced ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]) occurs despite lansoprazole treatment indicating that secondary prevention is incomplete. Hence, a more effective agent is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Vonoprazan, an orally active potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), effectively reduces gastric acid and has recently been approved in Japan for the treatment of several acid-related disease conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Vonoprazan is a P-CAB that ionically and reversibly binds to the gastric proton pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Unlike previously-developed P-CABs, vonoprazan is a different chemotype and therefore avoids the hepatotoxicity seen with previous P-CABs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, unlike PPIs, vonoprazan does not require intermediate complex formation, is stable at low pH, and its bioavailability is unaffected by food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Vonoprazan is rapidly absorbed in healthy adult males, the time to reach the maximum observed plasma concentration (<italic>T</italic>
<sub>max</sub>) is &#x02264;2&#x000a0;h and the mean elimination half-life is 9&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies indicate that vonoprazan is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolizing enzymes in humans including cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and the non-CYP enzyme sulfotransferase (SULT)2A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. CYP3A4 predominantly contributes to the metabolism of vonoprazan to M-I, M-III, and <italic>N</italic>-demethylated vonoprazan, while SULT2A1 contributes to the metabolism of vonoprazan to form vonoprazan <italic>N</italic>-sulfate, and CYP2C9 mediates the formation of M-IV-Sul from vonoprazan <italic>N</italic>-sulfate. Metabolites M-I, M-II, M-III, and M-IV-Sul were quantified in human plasma and none of them are pharmacologically active.</p><p>Vonoprazan is effective in promoting healing of erosive esophagitis and gastric/duodenal ulcers, and as an adjunct to <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> eradication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additionally, vonoprazan is useful in preventing recurrence of both erosive esophagitis and of LDA- or NSAID-induced gastric/duodenal ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of LDA and the most commonly used NSAIDs in Japan (loxoprofen, diclofenac, and meloxicam) on the pharmacokinetics of vonoprazan and, conversely, to evaluate the effects of multiple doses of vonoprazan on the pharmacokinetics of LDA or common NSAIDs. Additionally, the study was designed to evaluate the safety of vonoprazan administered in combination with LDA or NSAIDs, and the effects of vonoprazan on aspirin-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a single-site, phase 2, open-label, one-way crossover, clinical pharmacology study (JapicCTI-153100).

</p><p>No serious TEAEs were reported and no deaths occurred during the study period. No instances of serious liver dysfunction were reported during the study. All of the TEAEs occurred during the combination dose period (i.e., loxoprofen sodium with vonoprazan in Cohort 6 and diclofenac sodium with vonoprazan in Cohort 7). No hematology or urinalysis result or ECG finding was assessed by the investigator or subinvestigator to be clinically significant or a TEAE.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first to examine the potential risk for drug&#x02013;drug interactions between vonoprazan and LDA or vonoprazan and NSAIDs. The results of this study showed that there were no clinically significant effects of LDA or the NSAIDs loxoprofen sodium, diclofenac sodium, and meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of vonoprazan, and no clinically significant effects of vonoprazan on the pharmacokinetics of LDA or the NSAIDs.</p><p>Long-term LDA or NSAIDs have been associated with increased risk of upper gastrointestinal events such as ulcers and bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, acid-suppressive agents are concomitantly administered to provide gastroprotection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Hence, it was important to assess whether vonoprazan was associated with drug&#x02013;drug interactions with LDA or commonly prescribed NSAIDs. Loxoprofen sodium, diclofenac sodium, and meloxicam are the most commonly prescribed NSAIDs in Japan for the management of pain in patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The results of this study support the lack of drug&#x02013;drug interactions between vonoprazan and LDA or these NSAIDs.</p><p>Low-dose aspirin is a key component of thromboprophylaxis in patients at risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or atrial fibrillation (approved indication outside Japan). Therefore, it was important to confirm the lack of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of vonoprazan on aspirin. The effects of vonoprazan on LDA and salicylic acid pharmacokinetics were difficult to determine because of the large inter-subject variability observed. Although the AUCs of aspirin increased when concomitantly administered with vonoprazan, few differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of salicylic acid. Similarly, variability in the pharmacodynamic effects of aspirin were also observed in that vonoprazan slightly reduced the collagen-induced platelet-aggregating inhibitory activity of aspirin during concomitant administration. However, the arachidonic acid-induced platelet-aggregating inhibitory activity of aspirin was not influenced by vonoprazan administration. In addition, this study used a low dose of aspirin which is within the range commonly used to prevent thromboembolism (100&#x000a0;mg), whereas the maximum dose is 324&#x000a0;mg. Previous studies have reported that an increased concentration of salicylic acid has no meaningful effect on platelet aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Overall, vonoprazan was considered to have no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of aspirin and salicylic acid and therefore can be considered to have no clinically relevant drug&#x02013;drug interactions when taken in combination with LDA. In addition, concomitant administration of vonoprazan with LDA or NSAIDs was well tolerated. Few AEs were noted during the study.</p><p>The strengths of this study include the prospective design and the high study completion rate. However, because this was a clinical pharmacology study, the sample size was small and there was a limited duration of follow-up. The subjects enrolled in the study were relatively young whereas patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis are likely to be older. In addition, the study was conducted only in healthy male volunteers in order to compare the results with other pharmacokinetic studies of vonoprazan. Although caution is advised when extrapolating to women, gender-related disparities in pharmacokinetics are largely inconsequential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, the potential for drug&#x02013;drug interactions cannot be ruled out in females or in an older population who may be taking other concomitant medications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec100"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, despite some small differences, no clinically meaningful drug&#x02013;drug interactions were observed in healthy male volunteers between vonoprazan and either LDA or commonly prescribed NSAIDs. The results suggest that vonoprazan at the dose evaluated in this study can be concomitantly administered with LDA or NSAIDs such as loxoprofen sodium, diclofenac sodium, or meloxicam.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
