<bold>Background:</bold> Infantile colic, cry-fuss and sleep problems are transient in the initial months of life, but they
contribute to maternal depression, parenting stress and family mental health problems. In this randomized clinical
trial, we aimed to explore the efficacy of massage therapy compared to rocking in reducing infantile colic
symptoms including duration and number of cries, sleep duration and severity of infant colic.
</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> This was a single blind RCT study with a one-week follow-up. One hundred colicky infants aged
younger than 12 weeks old were randomly assigned into massage and rocking groups. Infants in the massage
group received a massage for 15-20 minutes once during a day and once at night before sleeping for a week. In
the control group, mothers rocked their infants gently for 5-25 minutes when the symptoms of colic appeared.
Parents recorded the details of the colic symptoms in a diary every day. A GEE approach was applied to explore
the effect of the intervention.
</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> Efficiency of massage therapy was significantly higher than rocking. At the end of the study, the
mean number of daily cries was 4.26&#x000b1;1.40 in the massage and 6.9&#x000b1;2.14 the rocking groups (p&#x0003c;0.01). The mean
of the severity score was 1.39&#x000b1;0.19 less in the massage group (p&#x0003c;0.01). Moreover, the mean differences of massage
and rocking groups were -0.82&#x000b1;0.20 hour (p&#x0003c;0.01) and 0.72&#x000b1;0.35 (p= 0.04) in the duration of cries and
duration of sleep, respectively.
</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> Massaging significantly improved colic symptoms during a one-week intervention for all outcomes.
In addition, significant differences were found between the intervention and control groups in favor of
massaging. Therefore, massage therapy is more effective than rocking for treating infant colic symptoms.

Based on Wessel criteria, an infant who cries for at least three hours a day three days a week and for three consecutive weeks, is colicky (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Infantile colic, cry-fuss and sleep problems are transient in the initial months of life, but they contribute to maternal depression, parenting stress and family mental health problems (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In addition, the long-term effects of infantile colic on subsequent child behavior problems have been studied even as early signs of the future disease for both parents and infants (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).
</p><p>
Crying and irritability, as the most common symptoms of infantile colic, are the reasons of most parents&#x02019; complaints and seeking medical care in the first three months of life. The prevalence of infantile colic was reported in a wide range from 3% to 40%. Variation in estimating the prevalence comes from differences in definitions, methods and the geographic area of the study (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, infantile colic is easily recognized, and its etiology is not completely understood and is difficult to solve. Therefore, in addition to the burden of infantile colic on family and social health-care system, ambiguity of its cause(s) makes it an interesting subject for pediatric researches (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, lack of proven cause for infantile colic subsequently leads to a wide spectrum of therapies for treating infants who suffer from this problem (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).
</p><p>
Researches in this field are classified into pharmacological, nutritional and parental care studies. Simethicone, Dicyclomine Hydrochloride and Cimetropium bromide are usually used in pharmacological treatments; however, their efficiency has not been proven in the related texts. In addition, some side effects are mentioned in this type of therapy (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Nutritional methods, particularly probiotics, are safe compared to pharmacological treatments. However, recent systematic reviews have not approved these treatments as a definite solution (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).
</p><p>
Massage therapy not only effects infantile colic, but also has proven benefits on maternal- infant relationship, weight gain, gastrointestinal problems and infant immune system (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Our literature review revealed that the majority of studies in this context explored the relation between massage therapy and number and duration of crying. In contrast, few studies were conducted in the field of reducing the severity of infantile colic and improving infant sleep time (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).
</p><p>
We conducted this randomized clinical trial to explore the effect of massage therapy as a type of parental care therapy on reducing infantile colic symptoms. We compared the efficiency of massaging with rocking the infants in reducing the frequency, duration and severity of infantile cries. In addition, improvements in infants&#x02019; sleep time were examined between the two groups.
</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>
This was a randomized clinical trial to explore the effect of massaging on pacifying infantile colic symptoms with a one-week follow-up. Symptoms included duration and number of cries, severity of infant colic and duration of sleep. This study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT), with a registration number of IRCT201106054317N5.
</p><p>
The sample size was calculated using the random sampling method with a significant level of 0.05, power of 0.8 and considering the results of similar studies (1.4 and 2 as standard deviation of duration of cries in the intervention and control groups and one hour as a significant difference between the mean of cry duration in the two groups) (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The minimum sample size of 47 was needed for each group. To control the loss to follow up, 50 samples were considered in each group.

Study Design
</title><p>
The trial was conducted in Amirkabir Hospital of Arak, in the central part of Iran. A pediatrician examined infants who were brought into the pediatric clinic from August 23, 2010 to January 20, 2011. The examination was conducted based on Wessel&#x02019;s criteria. The aims of the study were explained to the parents and the volunteer families signed the written consent. Infants who were younger than 12 weeks old, with full-term birth, without any known diseases, with no medical treatments for colic and no allergy to lactose were admissible to take part in this study. In addition, infants with smoker mothers during pregnancy or those whose mothers had severe anxiety background were not included. Furthermore, we excluded infants who underwent traditional and medical treatments during the study, or those whose mothers failed to perform the intervention correctly. Due to the nature of the intervention, among the infants who passed the above criteria, those who had no skin problems or limitations on receiving massage were recruited.
</p><p>
The participants were randomly assigned into the intervention and control groups based on referral day. Pediatrician and hospital staffs were kept blind to the allocation. Unfortunately, it was not possible to consider blinding method for mothers. An expert taught the mothers of infants in the intervention group to massage their babies correctly. Then, they were asked to massage infants for 15-20 minutes once during a day and once at night before sleeping during a one-week period. In the control group, mothers rocked their infants gently for 5-25 minutes when the symptoms of colic appeared. All participants recorded the duration (minutes), severity (Visual Analog Scale) and count of colic cries of the babies during the day for one week in an information diary. In addition, similar diaries were completed for one and two days before the start of the intervention as the baseline information for each participant.
</p><p>
A committee including ten specialists in midwifery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics and neurophysiology verified the validity of the information diary. Moreover, to increase the validity of registration, two members of the research team who were kept blind to the allocation, guided families during the study in both groups.

Ethical Considerations
</title><p>
The participants freely participated in this clinical trial and could withdraw from the study at any time they wished. The Ethics Committee of the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant.

Statistical Analysis
</title><p>
All data management and statistical analyses were conducted using Stata statistical software, Version 11 (Stata Inc., College Station, TX, USA). Pearson&#x02019;s Chi-squared test was used for categorical variables and independent t-test for continuous variables to examine the differences in the levels of cofounder and demographic variables. In addition, the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach was used to explore the effect of the interventions in the presence of other variables.
</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>
All fifty infants in both groups completed the trial because they had no adverse effect related to the trial, and no one refused to cooperate during the study. Baseline characteristics, demographic variables and the results of comparison tests are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. According to this table, no significant difference existed between the massage group and the rocking group in demographic variables at the significance level of 0.05. The majority of the mothers breastfed their infants, 92% and 90% in the massage and rocking groups, respectively. Type of delivery was equally distributed in both groups (p= 0.23) and no significant difference was found between the percentage of caesarean section (CS) and normal vaginal delivery (NVD) in the two groups (p=0.23).
</p><p>
Among symptoms of colic, number of cries had a statistically equal baseline means in the two groups (p=0.08). The mean of cry duration was 4.96 hours in the massage and 3 hours in the rocking groups (p&#x0003c;0.05) one day before the intervention. Furthermore, significant differences were found between the baselines of sleep duration (9.29 hours in the massage and 12.24 hours in the rock groups), and infant colic severity between the two groups (p&#x0003c;0.05). All these differences were in favor of the rocking group, which could affect the results. Therefore, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> indicates that the baseline values of the time of cry, duration of sleep and severity of infantile colic should be considered in the modeling process.

Although the coefficients of group variable were in favor of rocking intervention, the significant interaction terms indicated that coefficients should not be interpreted directly. Graphical illustrations of the trends of colic symptoms with 95% confidence intervals are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Exploring the trends of outcomes in each group expresses the decreasing slope for the number, duration and severity of cries. In addition, one could observe an increasing slope for the duration of sleep in both groups.

We compared the effect of massage therapy and rocking on improving infantile colic symptoms. Although regression coefficients indicated that rocking was more effective, the more accurate explorations demonstrated the efficiency of massaging compared to rocking. In addition, improvement in all colic symptoms was significant in the massage group during the study.
</p><p>
Our study revealed that the number of colic cries in the massage group was reduced from 8.34/day to 4.26/day at the end of the study. Alvandi et al. conducted a similar study and found that massage therapy could reduce the number of colic cries from 8 to 6 cries per day (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Olafsdottir et al. used chiropractic spinal manipulation to decrease the number of colic cries from 5.1 at the first day of the study to 3.1 at the end of the study (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). They also demonstrated that placebo could improve the colic cries in colicky infants.
</p><p>
The majority of the studies on infantile colic explored the effect of massage therapy on the rate and duration of colic cries. In this study, we showed that the average of crying severity was reduced from 5.13 to 2.71 during a one-week intervention. This study also showed that massage therapy helps infants to have a better sleep. The Average of sleep duration increased about 2.9 hours per day for infants who received a one-week massage.
</p><p>
Reviewing the available literature about the suggested treatments for infantile colic showed that none of these treatments were considered as the definite solution for this problem. Hall et al. evaluated 19 studies and 2 literature reviews on infantile colic treatments (five studies on pharmacological treatments, 10 on nutritional intervention and 4 on behavioral therapies). They concluded that pharmacological interventions are not effective or appropriate for infantile colic. They also stated that studies on behavioral interventions for infantile colic are limited and do not provide adequate evidence for using these treatments. They mentioned scienti&#x0fb01;c evidences that support the use of some nutritional interventions for infantile colic (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). A systematic review by Sung et al. showed that there is still insufficient evidence to support probiotic use for managing colic (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Comparing these studies confirms the importance of conducting more research to find a safe and efficient treatment for infantile colic.
</p><p>
The majority of the statistical methods including regression models for analyzing longitudinal data consider the data from all measurements under the study in the modeling process simultaneously. In the presence of an interaction, these models should not be used without considering the interaction term. On the other hand, interpretation of coefficients in regression models with the interaction term are not usually clear (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In this study, we fitted a marginal model using the GEE method and found a significant interaction between the treatment groups and time (Fig. 1). We did not interpret the coefficients due to the presence of this interaction. The major advantage of statistical regression models is their ability to adjust the results when randomization is not able to match confounders or baseline values.
</p><p>
This study had two limitations. First, mothers performed the massage therapy at home, so we could not be sure of the similarity and correctness of the massaging methods. To overcome this problem we examined the manner mothers massaged the infants three times. In addition, the parents were in direct contact with an advisor for their questions during the intervention. We believe this consideration makes the results of this study more trustworthy than other similar studies. Second, the interaction term was significant., and statistical references suggested expanding duration of the study in this case (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Therefore, conducting further studies to explore the effect of massage therapy on infantile colic symptoms in a wider period of intervention is highly recommended.
</p><p>
A number of studies have been conducted about the influence of different kinds of oils on infantile colic like lavender oil (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Massaging could be more comfortable by oil. Therefore, we suggest conducting a study to assess the use of the lavender oil in massage therapy as a new intervention for infantile colic.
</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>
In this study, colic symptoms were relieved in colicky infants who received a massage over a one-week intervention. On the other hand, rocking just affected the colic severity based on comparing the outcomes mean at the first and last days of the intervention. Therefore, massage therapy could be more effective than rocking for treating infant colic symptoms.
