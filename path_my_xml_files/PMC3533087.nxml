In fact, in a recent study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> where different types of diets were assigned to a population of overweight and obese subjects (BMI from 25 to 40&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), an average of 6&#x02005;kg, corresponding to 7% of initial body weight, was lost in the first 6&#x02005;months, but most of the weight was regained after 1&#x02005;year and at 2&#x02005;years, only 31&#x02013;37% of the participants had maintained a weight loss of at least 5% of their initial weight.</p><p>Bariatric surgery has long been recognised as an effective treatment for grades 3 or 2 obesity associated with complications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> and, accordingly, the number of bariatric operations in the USA is growing over time from ca. 10&#x02005;000 in the early 1990s to 103&#x02005;000 in 2003.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></p><p>Bariatric surgery may determine type 2 diabetes remission,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>

The procedure may be accessed from any web-connected computer; it clears the user for data access (user id/password); it requires the user to specify the screening number of the subject about to be randomised; it verifies inclusion/exclusion criteria and acquires stratification information; it finally assigns the subject to a treatment, and delivers the corresponding unique randomisation number. The procedure optimises the overall balance of treatments among each stratification cell. The allocation algorithm will be verified by the statistician responsible for the study, who will have continuing access to the randomisation statistics throughout the duration of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Criteria for discontinuation and/or withdrawal</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Withdrawal of informed consent</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subject uncooperative</p></list-item><list-item><p>Safety reasons as judged by principal investigator</p></list-item><list-item><p>Non-compliance to the protocol</p></list-item><list-item><p>Incorrect enrolment</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subjects who could not be operated laparoscopically</p></list-item><list-item><p>Conditions requiring medication that could interfere with the outcome of the study, except for those for intercurrent illnesses or adjustment of antihypertensive therapy, as judged by the principal investigator</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subjects with severe complications due to surgery, as judged by the principal investigator</p></list-item><list-item><p>Bleeding related to surgery that makes it impossible to draw blood samples</p></list-item></list><p>Subjects may be discontinued from the study at any time, at the discretion of the investigator.
