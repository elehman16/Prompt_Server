This study aimed to examine the effects of the probiotic <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic> CNCM I-745 (SB), the antibiotic Amoxicillin-Clavulanate (AC) and the combination on the microbiota and symptoms of healthy humans.</p><p>Healthy subjects were randomized to one of 4 study groups: SB for 14&#x000a0;days, AC for 7&#x000a0;days, SB plus AC, Control (no treatment). Participants gave stool samples and completed gastro-intestinal symptom questionnaires. Microbiota changes in stool specimens were analyzed using 16s rRNA gene pyrosequencing (bTEFAP).</p><p>Only one subject withdrew prematurely due to adverse events. Subjects treated by <italic>S boulardii</italic> + AC had fewer adverse events and tolerated the study regimen better than those receiving the AC alone. Control subjects had a stable microbiota throughout the study period. Significant microbiota changes were noted in the AC alone group during antibiotic treatment. AC associated changes included reduced prevalence of the genus <italic>Roseburia</italic> and increases in <italic>Escherichia, Parabacteroides</italic>, and <italic>Enterobacter</italic>. Microbiota alterations reverted toward baseline, but were not yet completely restored 2 weeks after antibiotherapy. No significant shifts in bacterial genera were noted in the SB alone group. Adding SB to AC led to less pronounced microbiota shifts including less overgrowth of <italic>Escherichia</italic> and to a reduction in antibiotic-associated diarrhea scores.</p><p>Antibiotic treatment is associated with marked microbiota changes with both reductions and increases in different genera. <italic>S. boulardii</italic> treatment can mitigate some antibiotic-induced microbiota changes (dysbiosis) and can also reduce antibiotic-associated diarrhea.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>adult</kwd><kwd>antibiotic</kwd><kwd>antibiotic-associated diarrhea</kwd><kwd><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection</kwd><kwd>healthy</kwd><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>probiotic</kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="49"/><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interactions between intestinal flora and the human host play a major role in maintaining intestinal health as well as in the pathogenesis of several disorders including antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1-5</sup></xref> Gut microbes play crucial roles in salvaging energy, absorbing nutrients, enhancing trophic effects on the intestinal epithelium, mediating the development and maturation of the host immune system and protecting against colonization by pathogenic microbes including C. difficile.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1-8</sup></xref></p><p>With emerging data about their proposed benefits in maintaining intestinal health, probiotics continue to gain popularity.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9-12</sup></xref> Probiotics are active bacterial and yeast organisms that are well-tolerated and safe, and are available in different foods and dietary supplements.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9,11,12</sup></xref> In sufficient doses, probiotics can provide significant health benefits.

</p><p>The heterogeneity of the human microbiota is well documented as is the relative stability of each individual's characteristic microbial architecture over time. Accordingly, each individual subjects' samples tended to group together when utilizing clustering of the microbial populations at the genus level, based upon Ward's Minimum Variance and Manhattan distance, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>. These individual baseline microbiota tended to remain stable over time and to overshadow differences due to treatment effects.</p><p>The subjects' microbiota also tended to cluster into different groupings corresponding to the 3, so called, enterotypes classically described in the literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). The 1<sup>st</sup> cluster is characterized by the presence of Prevotella and lower amounts of Bacteroides (from subject 1 on the far left to the last sample of subject 11). The 2<sup>nd</sup> cluster is characterized by high levels of Bacteroides (from subject 2 to the last sample of subject 11). The 3<sup>rd</sup> cluster shows increased Ruminococcus (from subject 4 to the last sample of subject 14).</p></sec><sec id="s0002-0006"><title>Baseline bacterial genera prevalence differences related to age, gender and across treatment groups</title><p>We evaluated the core microbiota (derived from control and pretreatment samples) and compared the most abundant bacterial genera based upon gender, age or study group. We found that the prevalence of several genera were significantly different after accounting for repeated measurements. Females had significantly higher Alistipes (2.07% versus 0.84% in males), Oscillibacter (1.83% vs. 0.70%), Fusobacterium (1.16% vs. &#x0003c;0.01%), Anaerotruncus (0.56% vs. 0.18%), Cetobacterium (0.60% vs. &#x0003c;0.01%) and Oscillospira (0.11% vs. 0.04%). On the other hand, none of the bacterial genera identified was significantly more prevalent in males compared with females.</p><p>Overall, there were no notable differences related to age when studied as a continuous variable. Given the age distribution of the subjects, age was dichotomized as being less than 35 y or older. Younger subjects showed a significantly greater prevalence of Roseburia (18.42% vs. 11.76%), Oscillibacter (2.46% vs. 1.08%), Sutterella (2.79% vs. 0.96%), Megamonas (1.71% vs. 0.18%, Lactobacillus (1.02% vs. 0.06%) and Thalassospirira (0.47% vs. 0.07%).</p><p>When evaluating the baseline, pre-treatment samples we found significant differences in the prevalence of 3 genera (Table&#x000a0;S1). Coprococcus abundance was significantly higher in the group assigned to later receive S. boulardii compared with the antibiotic group. Sutterella was significantly higher in the S. boulardii group compared with the S. boulardii plus antibiotic group and to the control group, and Catenibacterium was significantly higher in the control group compared with the S. boulardii group and to the antibiotic group.</p><p>Males and females were almost equally distributed among the study groups. In addition, the majority of the study participants were aged between 19 and 35 and the distribution by age was not statistically significant among the study groups (p = 0.8). Moreover, and to control for any potential effects attributed to age and gender distribution, we conducted multivariate analysis controlling for age and gender.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-0007"><title>Bacterial genera prevalence differences related to study treatments</title><p>Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) and Chao1 estimate analyses were performed on each of the samples. Both analyses showed that the antibiotic treated groups had significantly reduced bacterial diversity compared both to the control group's microbiota and to the S. boulardii only treatment group (Table&#x000a0;S2 and S3).</p><p>To further evaluate which treatments created notable bacterial population shifts we evaluated the microbial assemblage using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM, Table&#x000a0;S4). Of the 3 treatments evaluated, only the S. boulardii alone group remained stable and did not have any significant shifts from its pre-treatment microbiota. The control group microbiota was not significantly different to the other groups before treatment. Hence the control group's samples and those taken from the other groups prior to any treatment can be evaluated together and combined to form a &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>).

</p><p>We also evaluated changes in the abundance of specific bacterial genera within study groups during and after study treatments. We used the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) method to compare multiple means of genera concentrations across the study groups (independent variables) whereas we used paired t-test to compare concentrations for dependent variables (inter-group changes corresponding to different study time points). Genera with significantly different prevalence between groups during treatment are presented in Table&#x000a0;S5 while genera with significantly different prevalence between groups after treatment are presented in Table&#x000a0;S6. Inter-group differences in prevalence were identified for 19 individual genera during the study treatments and for 22 individual genera after treatment.</p><p>To evaluate further the effects of study treatments, we took advantage of the total microbial assemblages within each treatment group. Our redundancy analysis biplot is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>. The core microbiota for the study participants encompassing the control and pre-treatment subjects' samples is outlined (brown ellipse, upper left quadrant). Samples obtained during and after antibiotic treatment shifted strongly away from the core microbiota (to lower, right quadrant). The bacterial genera that were most significantly increased during and after antibiotic treatment were Escherichia, Parabacteroides, and Enterobacter which are clustered primarily within the quadrant associated with antibiotic administration. Conversely, Roseburia prevalence was decreased by antibiotic treatment. Samples from the S. boulardii group remained completely within the core microbiota both during and after therapy. As for the group that combined S. boulardii administration with antibiotic treatment, there was also a notable, but less prominent and directionally distinct, shift away from the core microbiota that did not encroach closely upon the Escherichia-Parabacteroides-Enterobacter region. Differences in these genera were also statistically evident with the S. boulardii and antibiotic treatment group but the associations were not as strong as for the antibiotic alone group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). The antibiotic plus S. boulardii group showed treatment-related increases in Odoribacter and Stenotrophomonas that were not evident with the antibiotic or S. boulardii when given alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>, upper right quadrant).</p></sec><sec id="s0002-0008"><title>Correlations between antibiotic-associated diarrhea and prevalence of Escherichia</title><p>Next we examined whether shifts in the concentrations of specific genera during and after therapy were associated with symptoms of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Since significant microbiota changes were related to several genera including: Escherichia, Ralstonia and Parabacteroides, we conducted separate analysis to investigate whether there were any correlations between antibiotic-associated diarrhea and the prevalence of the genera that were most notable for microbiota changes. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure&#x000a0;4A</xref>, the mean percentage prevalence of Escherichia in control and in S. boulardii treated subjects was very low (0.001% for each). Treatment with Amoxicillin-Clavulanate led to overgrowth of Escherichia increasing their prevalence by more than 100 fold (to 0.159%, p &#x0003c; 0.05). Conversely, when Amoxicillin-Clavulanate was administered in conjunction with S. boulardii the increase in Escherichia prevalence was substantially less (0.037%, not statistically significant). After treatment the prevalence of Escherichia fell to baseline in both the antibiotic alone and the antibiotic with S. boulardii groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.&#x000a0;4A</xref>).

</p><p>As expected diarrhea scores (as measured by the diarrhea-GSRS sub-score) rose significantly during treatment with Amoxicillin-Clavulanate (p = 0.004) and returned to baseline after antibiotic treatment ended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.&#x000a0;4B, lower panel</xref>). Overgrowth of Escherichia (as measured by mean percentage prevalence) correlated closely with symptoms of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.&#x000a0;4B, upper panel</xref>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99, p &#x0003c; 0.001 by linear regression analysis). A correlation between Escherichia prevalence and diarrhea symptoms was also seen when comparing across groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.&#x000a0;4C</xref>). Most importantly, the blunting of Escherichia overgrowth that was observed when S. boulardii was administered together with Amoxicillin-Clavulanate mirrored a similar and significant reduction in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.&#x000a0;4C</xref>). The strong trend seen with Escherichia was not seen with Ralstonia and Parabacteroides and there did not appear to be a strong correlation between diarrhea symptoms and the relative abundances of these 2 genera.</p><p>As outlined above and as shown in Tables S2 and S3, antibiotic treatment was associated also with significant changes, either increases or decreases, in multiple other genera. Some, but not all, of these antibiotic-associated microbiota alterations were moderated significantly by S. boulardii co-treatment (Table&#x000a0;S5). As an example, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate administration was associated with a substantial reduction in Ralstonia prevalence (from 6.57% to 0.019%, p &#x0003c; 0.05). S. boulardii co-treatment completely prevented this fall (17.5%, not significantly difference from control or from S. boulardii alone, see Table&#x000a0;S5). Conversely, antibiotic treatment was associated with a substantial increase in Parabacteroides prevalence (from 2.64% to 16.89%, P &#x0003c; 0.05). S. boulardii co-treatment largely prevented this increase (4.59%, not significantly difference from control or from S. boulardii alone, see Table&#x000a0;S5). Reductions in the prevalence of several other specific genera were seen during treatment with antibiotics and were not significantly altered by S. boulardii (e.g. Roseburia and Ruminococcus, see Table&#x000a0;S5). Thus the moderating effect of S. boulardii on antibiotic-induced microbiota shifts appears to be selective rather than universal.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0003"><title>Discussion</title><p>The human intestinal microbiota of a healthy individual is calculated to contain 100 trillion bacteria not including viruses, fungi, yeast, protists or archae.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,4,6,8</sup></xref> The richness and diversity of the human microbiota is influenced by many factors including mode of birth, diet, medications, age and debility.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,8,19</sup></xref> However, one of the most dramatic changes that can occur to the microbiota is that which results from antibiotic therapy.

In this study we aimed to explore the utility of a probiotic (Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745) that is commonly used to reduce or prevent AAD and determine if it prevents or minimizes gut-related side effects associated with a commonly used antibiotic, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate. Moreover, we examined the effects of antibiotics, probiotics and their combination on the composition of healthy subjects' microbiota.</p><p>Our study data demonstrate several important findings. The most marked changes to the intestinal microbiota were clearly those associated with antibiotic use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). These changes showed only partial reversal 14 d after antibiotic administration had ended. In this study, S. boulardii alone had no evident substantial effect on the intestinal microbiota of healthy individuals. Other studies have evaluated the effects of probiotics on the composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota, both in patients and healthy individuals.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> For S. boulardii CNCM I-745, in particular, studies using conventional culture-based methods or FISH have shown that it does not substantially modify microflora composition.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24,25</sup></xref></p><p>Although S. boulardii alone does not alter the microbiota, in this study the combination of S. boulardii with Amoxicillin-Clavulanate modified the microbiota changes caused by an antibiotic. Modulation of the intestinal microbiota may be one of the main beneficial effects of probiotics. These modulatory effects seem to be selective rather than universal since S boulardii mitigated shifts in the relativeabundances ofRalstonia and Parabacteroides seen with Amoxicillin-Clavulanate use but did not seem to have significant influences on other genera such as Roseburia and Ruminococcus. The impact of S. boulardii CNCM I-745 following disruption of microbiota by antibiotics was investigated in several animal models. The results suggested that S. boulardii CNCM I-745 allows a quicker return to basal level of fecal microbiota population.<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26,27</sup></xref> This is the first study to report these findings using 16s sequencing. However, our findings are supported by earlier reports using other techniques. The effect of S. boulardii CNCM I-745 was confirmed in a clinical study that investigated the fecal microbiota (investigated by FISH and microscopic biostructure) in 20 healthy volunteers and 20 patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea. The microbiota changes and clinical symptoms in those with chronic idiopathic diarrhea were improved with S. boulardii CNCM I-745 therapy.<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> More recently, a clinical study was conducted in 60 women treated for bacterial vaginosis with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by the FISH method. The authors concluded that S. boulardii CNCM I-745 was effective in preventing or reducing antibiotic-associated changes in colonic microbiota, when given concomitant with or subsequent to antibiotic therapy.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p><p>Our study also confirmed the findings reported by multiple studies in the past which associated the use of antibiotics with higher incidence of diarrhea and/or loose bowel movements.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21,22</sup></xref> 6 of the 12 subjects in the AC group, who had formed bowel movements prior to AC ingestion, had more than 3 loose bowel movements during antibiotic use. Moreover, subjects in the AC group reported statistically significantly higher diarrhea scores compared with the control, probiotic and combination regimen groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p><p>5 of the 12 subjects who were in the SB group reported AEs. Nonetheless, most of the reported symptoms were mild and overall, well tolerated. Only one subject voluntarily withdrew from the study due to an adverse event. While one might expect that the co-ingestion of 2 agents with potential side effects (AC and SB) would increase the overall reported symptoms compared with each separately, adding SB to AC led to a reduction in diarrhea associated with AC without worsening other GI syndromes. On the contrary, indigestion reported within the first week of probiotic use in the SB group, seemed to be less of a problem when SB was co-administered with AC. Finally, only 16.7% of the combination AC plus SB group subjects reported symptoms compared with 50% of the AC alone group subjects. Probiotics are often administered during a course of antibiotics, and our results support this practice.</p><p>Another interesting observation of our study was that the microbiota profiles associated with our study appeared to form clusters as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>. This could be consistent with the findings previously reported by Arumugam who suggested that individuals may be separated into one of 3 major enterotypes. Indeed the MetaHit consortia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.metahit.eu/">http://www.metahit.eu/</ext-link>), has classified gut microbiota based on the most abundant genera into enterotypes<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> where Enterotype 1 is Bacteroides dominant, Enterotype 2 is Prevotella dominant and Enterotype 3 is Ruminococcus dominant genera. These enterotypes appear to be independant of gender, age and ethnicity, but do depend upon the long-term diet of individuals.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29,30</sup></xref> Based on this definition, our 1<sup>st</sup> cluster is closer to Enterotype 2, and our 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> clusters are closer to Enterotype 1 and 3 respectively. However we didn't identify clear separation between these groups and a gradient of Bacteroides could be observed across our 3 clusters. The generalizability of the enterotype clustering has been questioned<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> and has generated controversy in the scientific community. It is not clear if enterotypes are distinct entities or whether it is better to define gut microbiota as a continuum. This concept is supported by HMP consortia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmpdacc.org/">http://hmpdacc.org/</ext-link>) which view gut microbiota as a gradient of species known as entero-gradient.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31,32</sup></xref> With this concept of entero-gradient, the observed associations of so called enterotype occur at the extremes.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31,33-36</sup></xref> While some authors failed to identify enterotype clusters, especially concerning the Ruminococcus enterotype,<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> other groups claim that Bacteroides and Prevotella do not exist in equal proportion in the gut,<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> and seem to not co-exist in the same gut environment. Bacteroides and Prevotella compete for the same niche hence the concept of entero-gradient may offer a better description of bacterial communities than so-called enterotypes.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref></p><p>Age, gender, and ethnicity did not appear to correlate with our cluster category. Despite the fact that using antibiotics caused transient microbiota shifts, intra-personal variations in almost all the study subjects were significantly less than inter-personal variations. This is probably due to complex interactions of diet, life-style and genetic/host factors that are crucial for maintaining a relatively stable, individualized and &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; microbiota profile over time.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,8,19,38,39</sup></xref> Another interesting observation was the tendency for the microbiota to revert toward the baseline status in these healthy individuals at the end of antibiotic use.</p><p>Interestingly, clinical recovery (resolution of side effects and symptoms) paralleled the recovery of the baseline microbiota. This fact helps to better understand the pathophysiology of AAD and CDI. Failure to restore the same &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; microbiota is well documented in recurrent CDI and constitutes the scientific mechanism upon which fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) is based.<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> In the future, it will be important to determine whether a certain &#x0201c;enterotype&#x0201d; group is associated with higher risk of developing gut diseases such as AAD, CDI, irritable bowel disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases, or non-GI diseases that are impacted by gut microbial composition such as metabolic or auto-immune disorders. Equally important would be to explore microbiota variations before and after diagnosis and/or effective treatment of such disorders.</p><p>Another important observation was the evident overgrowth of Escherichia in the stools of subjects during AC use. Furthermore, we found that the higher the mean concentrations of Escherichia, the worse were the observed diarrhea scores. Moreover, the improvement and resolution of diarrhea paralleled the decline in Escherichia prevalence over the 2 weeks following cessation of antibiotics. Such strong correlations were not seen with other genera. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that microbiota alterations, such as an overgrowth of Escherichia, underlie the mechanisms that lead to AAD. Proposed mechanisms include the direct effects of small molecules related to Escherichia in affecting colonic cells absorptive capacity. Other mechanisms could be more complex and related to &#x0201c;neutralizing&#x0201d; the beneficial effects of protective strains such as Parabacteroides through bacterio-bacterial interactions. Adding SB to AC minimized the observed rises in mean Escherichia concentrations and was simultaneously associated with lower diarrhea scores compared with the AC alone group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). Moreover, when Escherichia concentrations were lowest (control group), diarrheal score were lowest. These initial findings are worth further investigation with additional animal and human studies.</p><p>While our study reached several important and novel findings, we do note some limitations. First, we studied the effects of a specific probiotic (SB) and antibiotic (AC) on clinical symptoms and the microbiota of healthy volunteers. Therefore, our findings are not necessarily generalizable to other populations (e.g., those with illnesses) or to other antibiotics or probiotics. While the study subjects' compliance rates with drug administration and sample collections were very high, this study was conducted in an outpatient setting. Therefore, true compliance with medication administration is not guaranteed. Our study was not blinded. Therefore, some of the improved symptoms attributed to use of probiotics can be due to a placebo effect. Finally, our analyses involved frozen stool samples; hence inconsistencies in the handling of stool samples, outside of the study protocol, cannot be excluded.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that antibiotic therapy with Amoxicillin-Clavulanate led to substantial alterations of the microbiota of healthy subjects. This included an overgrowth of Escherichia and was accompanied by antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Amoxicillin-Clavulanate was also associated with reduced prevalence of the genus Roseburia and increases in Parabacteroides and Enterobacter in addition to Escherichia. Microbiota alterations reverted toward baseline but were still not completely resolved 2 weeks after completion of antibiotic administration. The probiotic S. boulardii CNCM I-745 given alone did not appreciably alter microbiota composition or symptoms. However, when S. boulardii was administered together with Amoxicillin-Clavulanate, microbiota changes, including Escherichia overgrowth, were lessened and antibiotic-associated diarrhea was prevented. Given the ability of S. boulardii, when administered with Amoxicillin-Clavulanate, to reduce Escherichia overgrowth and to induce significant increases or decreases in multiple other genera, future studies are warranted to explore the link between specific microbiota components and their metabolic products including small molecules and symptoms of antibiotic associated diarrhea.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0004"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="s0004-0001"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial in healthy volunteers.
