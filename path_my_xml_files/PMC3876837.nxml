The volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three groups and orally treated with solutions (25&#x02009;mL) containing 0&#x02009;mg (placebo), 250&#x02009;mg (low dosage), or 500&#x02009;mg (high dosage) of <italic><italic>&#x003b3;</italic></italic>-PGA.

Introduction</title><p>Poly-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-glutamate (<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA), which is naturally secreted from <italic>Bacillus</italic>, is a safe and edible polymer in which the <italic><italic>&#x003b1;</italic></italic>-amino and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-carboxy groups of D- or L-glutamic acid are linked by isopeptide bonds [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We previously reported that oral administration of high-molecular-mass <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA (average MW 2,000&#x02009;kDa) isolated from <italic>Bacillus subtilis sp. Chungkookjang</italic> (a traditional Korean food) confers more significant antitumor effects than lower-molecular-mass (10&#x02009;kDa) <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA by inducing interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-gamma (IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>) production and activating natural killer (NK) cells in a mouse model system [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These antitumor effects were elicited by the TLR4-dependent stimulation of immune cells (e.g., NK cells), activation of macrophages, and maturation of dendritic cells [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As part of their innate effector functions, NK cells possess a potent cytotoxic activity against tumor cells, virus-infected cells, and intracellular parasites [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. NK cells destroy targets, including tumor cells, by various mechanisms, and they may be regulated by IL-12 secreted from activated macrophages or dendritic cells [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The effects of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA on the antitumor activity of human NK cells has not yet been reported. In the present study, we investigated the effect of oral administration of high-molecular-weight <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA (MW 2,000&#x02009;kDa) on the NK cell activity by examining peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy volunteers who were treated in a single-center, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA molecules derived from <italic>B. subtilis </italic>(<italic>Chungkookjang</italic>), prepared as described previously [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], were kindly provided by BioLeaders Corporation (Daejeon, Korea) anddissolved in PBS. The number and weight-average molecular masses (M<italic>n</italic> and M<italic>w</italic>, respectively) and the polydispersity (M<italic>w</italic>/M<italic>n</italic>) of the <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA molecules were measured by gel permeation chromatography using a GMPWXL column (Viscotek, Houston, TX, USA) and an LR125 Laser Refractometer (Viscotek). The polydispersity of 2,000&#x02009;kDa <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA was found to be 4.3. The compositional D/L ratio of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA was 60&#x02009;:&#x02009;40, as determined by High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after FDAA modification (for differentiation of D-glu and L-glu) of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA hydrolysates. Polyacrylamide standards (American Polymer Standard, Mentor, OH, USA) were used to construct a calibration curve. Anion-exchange chromatography was used to increase the <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA content to &#x0003e;99% and decrease the polydispersity. To achieve complete solubility of the <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA powder, we adjusted the pH of the solution to 6.8~7.0 with 5&#x02009;N NaOH.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Study Designs and Drug Administration</title><p>Healthy volunteers (&#x02265;20 years) who met the selection criteria and were not on any therapy for physical or mental illnesses were enrolled in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Of the 102 participants, 99 met the trial criteria and were enrolled in the study. The study participants were randomized to three groups: 33 subjects (high-dosage) received 500&#x02009;mg of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA powder dissolved in distilled water (DW, 22&#x02009;mL) with maltitol (2.5&#x02009;g); 33 subjects (low dosage) received 250&#x02009;mg of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA powder dissolved in DW (22.25&#x02009;mL) with maltitol (2.5&#x02009;g); and 33 subjects (placebo) received maltitol (2.5&#x02009;g) dissolved in DW (22.5&#x02009;mL).

Assaying the Cytotoxic Activity of NK Cells</title><p>The cytotoxic activity of NK cells against K562 cells, an NK cell-sensitive target cell line, was tested using a CytoTox 96&#x02009;kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, K562 cells and PBMCs (including NK cells) were resuspended at a 30&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 ratio (PBMCs&#x02009;:&#x02009;K562) in RPMI-1640 containing 5% FBS, and incubated in 96-well round-bottomed plates for 5&#x02009;h at 37&#x000b0;C. During this incubation, NK cell-mediated lysis of target cells caused lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to be released into the medium. Spontaneous release of LDH from PBMCs or target cells was measured by a separate incubation of the respective populations. Maximum LDH release was measured by adding detergent to lyse all of the target cells (positive control). At the end of incubation, any cells that remained intact were centrifuged, and 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of supernatant from each well was transferred to a 96-well flat-bottomed plate and mixed with 50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L of fresh LDH substrate solution. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 30&#x02009;min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1&#x02009;mol/L acetic acid. The resulting optical density (OD) was measured using a microplate reader at 490&#x02009;nm. The percentage of cells exhibiting cytotoxic activity was calculated as: (OD of sample &#x02212; [OD after spontaneous release of LDH from target cells + OD after spontaneous release of LDH from effector cells]) &#x000d7; 100/(OD after maximal release of LDH from target cell &#x02212; OD after spontaneous release of LDH from target cells).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6.

Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. Study Population</title><p>One-hundred-and-two healthy adults were recruited for this study between August 2010 and May 2011. Of the three subjects who did not pass the screening tests, the most frequent reasons for exclusion were that the individuals did not meet the selection criteria and/or were not assigned a random number due to an omission or administrative errors. The overall noncompletion rate was 15.7% (16 subjects); these subjects, who failed to meet the compliance requirements, violated the selection/exception criteria, became lost to follow-up, or withdrew agreement, were excluded from the PP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. Demographics</title><p>The characteristics of the study participants in each treatment group are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. The numbers of male subjects in the groups were 5 (15.2%), 4 (12.1%), and 6 (18.2%) for the low dosage (250&#x02009;mg of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA), high-dosage (500&#x02009;mg of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA), and placebo groups, respectively. The numbers of female subjects in the groups were 28 (84.9%), 29 (87.9%), and 27 (81.8%) for the low dosage, high-dosage, and placebo groups, respectively. Overall, the number of female subjects was higher than that of male subjects, but the gender distributions did not differ significantly between groups. The average ages in years were 43.7 &#x000b1; 13.5 (range, 20.0&#x02013;57.0), 48.8 &#x000b1; 11.5 (range, 20.0&#x02013;64.0), and 45.3 &#x000b1; 16.4 (range, 20.0&#x02013;68.0) for the low dosage, high-dosage, and placebo groups, respectively. The differences in the average ages of the three groups were not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Efficacy Results</title><p>To evaluate the primary efficacy of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA treatment, NK cell cytotoxicities after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment were compared among the low dosage, high-dosage, and placebo groups. Based on the normality and Kruskal-Wallis tests, the between-group differences in NK cell cytotoxicity among the test subjects were determined to be statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), as described below.</p><p>
<italic>(1) ITT Group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)</italic>. A total of 99 ITT test subjects were divided into three test groups of 33 subjects each (low dosage, high-dosage, and placebo). Compared to the baseline, the cytotoxicities of NK cells from these groups were increased in average by 0.5 &#x000b1; 3.5%, 4.3 &#x000b1; 7.5%, and 0.3 &#x000b1; 3.3%, respectively, at week 4. In a two-sided test with a significance level of 0.05, the difference in average cytotoxicity among the three test groups was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0174). Tukey's HSD multiple comparison tests also showed that the changes were significantly different between the low and high-dosage groups and between the high-dosage and placebo groups. At week 8, the average increases in NK cell cytotoxicity relative to the baseline were 1.4 &#x000b1; 4.0% for the low dosage group, 5.6 &#x000b1; 6.7% for the high-dosage group, and 0.7 &#x000b1; 3.3% for the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0013, two-sided test). Furthermore, the cytotoxicity levels differed significantly between the low and high-dosage groups and between the high-dosage and placebo groups according to Tukey's HSD multiple comparison test.</p><p>
<italic>(2) PP Group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>)</italic>. After excluding the 16 test subjects whose reasons for exclusion were described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3.1">Section 3.1</xref>, a total of 83 test subjects were divided into the low dosage group (26 test subjects), the high-dosage group (30 test subjects), and the placebo group (27 test subjects). We then compared the average changes in NK cell cytotoxicity after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. At week 4 of treatment, the cytotoxicities of NK cells showed average increases of 0.4 &#x000b1; 3.6%, 4.3 &#x000b1; 7.8%, and 0.1 &#x000b1; 3.4% for the low dosage, high-dosage, and placebo groups, respectively, reflecting a significant difference among the groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0333, two-sided test). Tukey's HSD multiple comparison further revealed that there were significant differences in the cytotoxicity changes of the low versus high-dosage groups and between the high-dosage and placebo groups. At week 8 of treatment, the average cytotoxicity increases were 1.3 &#x000b1; 4.1% for the low dosage group, 5.7 &#x000b1; 6.8% for the high-dosage group, and 0.5 &#x000b1; 3.5% for the placebo group, indicating a significant difference among the groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0014, two-sided test). Moreover, the cytotoxicity changes were significantly different between the high and low dosage group, and between the low dosage group and the placebo group according to Tukey's HSD multiple comparison test.</p><p>We hypothesized that the increased cytotoxic effects of PBMCs from donors that received high doses of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA (in both the ITT and PP groups) might reflect increased NK cell proliferation in these individuals. To determine whether <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA influences the effector functions of NK cells in addition to increasing the absolute number of NK cells, we cultured PBMCs from healthy donors <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence or absence of 1&#x02009;mg/mL <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA for 8&#x02009;h and then stimulated them with K562 tumor (target) cells. FACS analysis showed that a higher percentage of NK cells displayed CD107a (a surrogate marker for degranulation) in samples that were pretreated with <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA compared to untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This analysis was done with at least 10 different donors, and the increase was consistent and statistically significant in almost all donors. Similarly, <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA-treated NK cells produced higher levels of IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> in the presence of K562 cells, compared to untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results indicate that the effects observed in <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA-treated donors are consistent with increased levels of NK cell cytotoxic activity and cytokine production.</p><p>NK cells, which are essential elements of the immune defense against pathogens and tumor cells, can modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses and are directly cytotoxic against virus-infected and tumor-derived cells. Many strategies have been investigated to enhance NK cell activity. Among them, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucan (isolated from <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic>) is an immunomodulator that is often consumed, especially among Orientals [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, a significant proportion of cancer patients takes complementary medical therapies while receiving conventional anticancer treatments [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, we herein sought to establish the immunopotentiating function of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA in humans. We report for the first time that both IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and cytolysis are upregulated in <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA-treated NK cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Also, a significant and consistent pattern of enhancement was observed in healthy volunteers treated with <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA. Thus, it may be possible to use <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA treatment to diminish tumors in some cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>3.4. Safety Assessment</title><p>The treated and untreated donors did not show any significant difference in abnormal diagnoses or clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters, vital signs, or other safety parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial revealed that a high-dosage of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-PGA (naturally secreted from <italic>Bacillus subtilis sp. Chungkookjang</italic>, a traditional Korean food) significantly increased the cytotoxic activity of NK cells compared to the placebo control.
