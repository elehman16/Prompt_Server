Overlooking this step may lead to failure of endodontic treatment.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Glide path (GP) is one of the most important steps, which determines the canal patency from the canal orifice and follows the smooth canal walls uninterrupted to the apex.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The technique of creation of the GP would reduce instrument failure by reducing frictional forces, can have a great impact on the endodontic success.</p><p>Manufacturers have recommended that performing preflaring and the preparation of GP are must before the introduction of any rotary system in the root canal.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Various instruments have been used to create GP like hand stainless steel K-flex files and nickel-titanium (NiTi) rotary files. Advantages of using stainless steel files for GP are it provides a better tactile sensation and also alerts the clinicians about the canal curvatures present in the canal. However, the disadvantages of using stainless steel files are it creates canal abnormalities such as elbows and zipping. To overcome the disadvantages of stainless steel hand files, the NiTi rotary path files were introduced in 2009 for the purpose of GP.</p><p>The previous studies have shown the influence of GP on the canal anatomy;[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] however, till date, no study has been carried out for testing its influence on the surface of the subsequent rotary instrument used. Hence, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the influence of manual versus mechanical GP on the surface changes of two different NiTi rotary instruments in root canal therapy in a moderately curved root canal.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Rationale</title><p>The objective of this <italic>in vivo</italic> study is to evaluate the effect of creating a GP either manually or mechanically on the surface changes of two different NiTi rotary instruments in a moderately curved root canal by scanning electron microscope.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixty systemically healthy controls aged 18&#x02013;40 years referred to the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics were selected for the study. Patients were selected on the basis of following inclusion criteria, i.e., patients aged 25&#x02013;35 years, moderate degree of curvature (20&#x000b0;&#x02013;30&#x000b0;), and the mesiobuccal root of mandibular first molars indicated for root canal treatment and exclusion criteria being calcified canals, root resorption, retreatment cases, immature root formation.</p><p>All the endodontic files were preexamined under scanning electron microscope and those with any defect were not included in the study. Then, these selected samples were allocated randomly into four study groups:</p><p>

</p><p>Patients consent was taken before any start of the treatment. All teeth were anesthetized with 2% lignocaine with 1:100,000 adrenaline followed by rubber dam isolation, and access cavity was prepared with an access opening bur no 3 (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, New York, PA, USA). A stainless steel K-file No. 10 (Mani, Japan) was used as patency file. Working length (WL) was then determined with #15 K-file (Mani, Japan) and the use of an electronic apex locator (RootZXll; J. Morita, Tokyo, Japan). WL was confirmed with an X-ray using the parallel technique using RINN Endo Ray II Ring (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, New York, PA, USA). All the samples having a moderate degree of curvature were selected (20&#x000b0;&#x02013;30&#x000b0;). The curvature of the teeth was calculated by Schneider's method.</p><p>Canal preparation was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations for both the instruments, i.e., the RaCe and HyFlex. In the order of clinical use, before using each set of HyFlex and RaCe instruments of the following sizes 25, 0.04 taper, size, manual, and rotary GP were prepared with stainless steel hand files no 15, 20 and rotary path files[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] no 13, 16, 19 (Dentsply Maillefer, USA), respectively. Rotary files were used in an electric motor (X-Smart Endo motor, Dentsply Tulsa Dental Specialities, USA) with a 16:1 reduction handpiece (Dentsply Tulsa Dental Specialities, USA) at a setting and speed recommended by the manufacturer (at 500 rpm).</p><p>In Groups 1 and 2, a manual GP was created before using rotary files. In Groups 3 and 4, a mechanical GP was created before using rotary path files.</p><p>All canals were irrigated with 1 ml of 3% sodium hypochlorite (Vensons India, Bangalore) using a 27-gauge (Unolok; Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices Ltd., Faridabad, India).</p><p>Statistical analysis was done using Chi-squared test and the statistical software used was R 3.0 (Vienna, Austria).</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Scanning electron microscope examination</title><p>After the preparation of the canal according to the allotted group, the NiTi rotary instruments (RaCe and HyFlex) were cleaned with acetone, and gold sputtering was done before the evaluation of any surface defect in the standard error mean chamber with the help of file holder and observed at &#x000d7;100 to &#x000d7;250.

This is essential because canal preparation determines the efficacy of all subsequent procedures and includes mechanical debridement, creation of space for medicament delivery, and optimized canal geometries for adequate obturation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Curved canals are the most common entity found in the root canal system of the tooth.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] To prepare a curved canal, the instruments with a low modulus of elasticity are required thereby maintaining the original canal curvature.</p><p>NiTi alloy was developed by W.F Buehler in the late 1960s. The two most distinctive properties of this alloy are shape memory and superelasticity.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In the present study, two different rotary file systems are being used, i.e., HyFlex and RaCe, as the preparation of the curved canals is challenging. However, the major deferent factor with these NiTi instruments is that they undergo unexpected fracture without warning.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Coronal enlargement and GP have been shown to be fundamental for safer use of NiTi rotary instrumentation. According to West, a GP is defined as a smooth radicular tunnel from the canal orifice of the canal to the physiologic terminus of the root canal.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This confirms that there is a pathway for rotary instruments to passively follow in the canal.</p><p>The results of the present study showed that all the instruments used in the study showed some or the other signs of defects after a single use. The most commonly found defect was fretting in Group 2. The probable reason of the presence of fretting before use can be due to the mechanical milling of the HyFlex file system,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] whereas in RaCe system, fretting was seen after the first use of about 13% in both groups as preoperatively no fretting was present on the files.</p><p>Pitting was also the defects seen in Groups 2 and 4, i.e., HyFlex system. It was only seen in the apical third of the groups as it undergoes more friction.</p><p>None of the groups showed microfracture, complete fracture, metal strip, metal flash, and corrosion.</p><p>Blunt cutting edges were present in Groups 3 and 4, i.e., 7% approx., whereas it was absent in Groups 1 and 2. Disruption of cutting edge is a loss of the regular continuous shape of the blades. Groups 2 and 4 showed the maximum defects, i.e., 27% and 40%, respectively, as the HyFlex instruments are used with more torque, thereby causing more defects whereas it was relatively absent in Groups 1 and 3, as these RaCe files having a positive rake angle leading it to cut the dentine at right angles and application of controlled force and speed of the instrument.</p><p>Debris is dentin chips which are embedded on the instrument. Groups 2 and 4 showed the maximum and least were seen in Groups 1 and 3 indicating that as the instruments having a smooth surface, the debris accumulation was less and in case of HyFlex instruments as it had preoperative fretting present, the debris accumulation was more.</p><p>In the present study, rotary files were viewed under scanning electron microscope at &#x000d7;100&#x02013;&#x000d7;400 magnification and files without visible manufacturing defects were selected because manufacturing defects can cause fracture of a new instrument even during the first use [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 1</xref>].[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Scanning electron microscope was chosen in the present study to evaluate the surface defects accurately, where the conventional methods failed to identify the surface defects of the instruments.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Postoperative standard error mean picture showing defects</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-19-549-g019"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, the following conclusions were drawn:</p><p>
