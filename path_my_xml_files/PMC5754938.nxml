They answered Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety subscale and a prebronchoscopy questionnaire to assess their expectation toward flexible bronchoscopy. The patients were randomized into three groups: placebo, midazolam, and fentanyl-midazolam. Vitals signs including heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded. Furthermore, Ramsay Sedation Scale was assessed during the procedure.

After getting approval from Institutional Ethics Committee (letter no. IEC 509/2013, dated October 9, 2013), the study was conducted on 144 patients from October 2013 to July 2015. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients after they read and understood the patient information sheet. The inclusion criterion was patients in the age group of 18&#x02013;70 years who were advised flexible bronchoscopy for diagnostic workup. Patients were excluded from the study if they had any of the following: oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) &#x0003c;95% on room air; hemodynamic instability; renal failure, hepatic insufficiency; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with FEVI &#x0003c;50%; platelet count &#x0003c;50,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; body weight was &#x0003e;85 kg; depression of consciousness or cognitive impairment rendering them unable to answer the questionnaires; and history of hypersensitivity or contraindications to the drugs used in the study.</p><p>All patients who met the inclusion criterion were assessed, and basic data such as indication for flexible bronchoscopy, age, gender, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and educational status were noted. The patients answered two questionnaires before the procedure: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) to assess the anxiety status of the patient before the procedure and prebronchoscopy questionnaire to assess the expectation of the patient toward flexible bronchoscopy and also their previous experience with flexible bronchoscopy, if any.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>After obtaining the above information, the patients were randomly allocated to any of the three groups (Group 1 &#x02013; placebo, Group 2 &#x02013; midazolam, and Group 3 &#x02013; fentanyl-midazolam). Randomization was done by block randomization (chit method). Sealed opaque-envelope method was used for allocation concealment.</p><p>Before beginning the procedure, the vital parameters such as pulse rate, noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiratory rate, and SpO<sub>2</sub> levels were noted, and continuous monitoring initiated. An intravenous access was established in one of the upper limbs, and the study drugs were loaded in two syringes labeled as A and B by an observer who had no further role in the study, thus ensuring blinding. Syringe A contained either 1 ml (50 &#x003bc;g) of fentanyl or 1 ml of normal saline. Syringe B contained either midazolam 0.035 mg/kg diluted in normal saline to a volume of 5 ml or contained only normal saline 5 ml. Group 1 would receive normal saline in both the syringes, Group 2 would receive normal saline in one and midazolam in another, and Group 3 received fentanyl in one and midazolam in another.</p><p>Two ml of 2% lignocaine jelly was administered into one of the patent nostrils of the patient. Initially, 0.5 ml of the drug from syringe A was administered, and then, after 5 min, 2.5 ml of the drug from syringe B was administered. After an additional waiting period of 2 min, the bronchoscope was passed through the patent nostril and then the throat. Two ml of 2% lignocaine spray was sprayed at the throat and additional 2 ml at vocal cords, by spray-as-you-go technique. Patients were administered another 0.5 ml study drug from syringe A and 2.5 ml from syringe B, before crossing the vocal cords. After waiting for a minute, the bronchoscope was advanced below the vocal cords and stationed at the level of carina, where 1 ml 2% lignocaine was sprayed. The bronchoscope was advanced beyond carina where 1 ml of 2% lignocaine was sprayed into each main bronchus. Once the coughing subsided, the bronchoscope was advanced into either bronchi to evaluate the bronchial tree, and the sampling procedure for which the patient was scheduled was completed. Additional 2% lignocaine was sprayed if the patient had recurrence of cough.</p><p>Vital parameters such as pulse rate, noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiratory rate, and SpO<sub>2</sub> levels were again recorded at 5-min interval from time zero &#x02013; i.e., from insertion of bronchoscope. If the Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) was 1 at any time after the lignocaine application was completed, the rescue medication in the form of Injection Midazolam 0.5 mg IV (open-label syringe) was administered in a stepwise manner, with a 2-min gap between doses. Lidocaine dosage, total number of rescue medication, completeness of the procedure, complications if any, and total duration of procedure were noted. Vital parameters were recorded 10-min after completion of the procedure.</p><p>The study involved three different observers. Observer 1 picked the randomization slip and prepared the study drugs ensuring blinding (labeling syringe A and B) and did not have any further involvement with the study individual. Observer 2 noted the patient-related data, recorded vital signs, administered the study drugs, prior to bronchoscopy. Also recorded the relevant data during flexible bronchoscopy and assessed the patients by administering questionnaires, before and after the bronchoscopy. Observer 3 performed the bronchoscopy and filled in the responses in physician-reported feasibility score sheet (on scale of 1&#x02013;5) [see <xref ref-type="app" rid="APP2">Appendix 2</xref>].[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Four hours after completion of flexible bronchoscopy, a questionnaire &#x02013; adapted from an earlier study &#x02013; was provided to the patients.

Guidelines, as well, have made sedation preferable but not mandatory &#x02013; advising to seek patients' preference in this matter.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Evidence of some level of anxiety, before undergoing flexible bronchoscopy, has been reported in one-third of the patients and this can increase the need for analgesics and may lead to more adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In the current clinical practice, patient comfort and allaying anxiety are desirable, and hence, use of sedation is required.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] For flexible bronchoscopy, an RSS between two to three is acceptable.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In our study, it is apparent; patients in fentanyl-midazolam group did significantly better than midazolam group in terms of level of sedation, as assessed by RSS.</p><p>Patient satisfaction and tolerance of the procedure is an aspect that has been probed and emphasized in many studies on flexible bronchoscopy.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Notwithstanding the opinion which considers overemphasis on patient satisfaction unwarranted, patient satisfaction remains an important part of the postprocedure assessment and has found its place in the bronchoscopy guidelines as well.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Sedation is one of the important determinants of patient tolerance and satisfaction, and inadequacy of sedation can make the procedure unpleasant in approximately two-thirds of patients, and about one-fourth may be unwilling for a repeat procedure.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Hence, the aim of using sedatives is to reduce these to as insignificant a level as possible; and a drug or combination of drugs that can achieve this objective is, obviously, a preferred option. In the present study, patient satisfaction and tolerance of the procedure were significantly better in the fentanyl-midazolam group when compared with the midazolam group. The higher the difference in the composite scores of patient-reported tolerance and satisfaction among the groups, the more is the expected clinical significance.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It may be possible to assume, though not assert conclusively, that in the absence of rescue medications (used more often in midazolam group than fentanyl-midazolam group) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>], the difference between these two groups might have been even more pronounced. It is a fact, attested by many studies, that postbronchoscopy, a better satisfaction is achieved among patients receiving sedation when compared to nonsedated patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, the variety of sedatives used &#x02013; with different pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and safety profiles &#x02013; and the nonidentical assessment tools used to quantify patient satisfaction make it difficult, if not impossible, to comment on the best possible sedative protocol.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Hence, keeping this limitation in mind, fentanyl-midazolam appears, at least, to score over midazolam alone &#x02013; so far as the results of the present study are concerned.</p><p>In fentanyl-midazolam group, the physician felt the patients were significantly more cooperative and better sedated. A significantly less utilization of the physician-directed rescue medication in the fentanyl-midazolam group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>] also alludes to the fact that the patient cooperation and physician's comfort level were significantly better in this group.</p><p>Varying results have been obtained regarding the length of the procedure when done under sedation &#x02013; some reporting shorter duration, while others finding no significant difference between sedation and placebo groups.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, a longer postprocedure hospital stay has been observed when sedation is used.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In our study, the duration of the flexible bronchoscopy was similar in all the groups.</p><p>In our study, we used the spray-as-you-go technique for lignocaine application to the airways, which is in accordance with the British Thoracic Society guidelines. The studies on the use of nebulized lignocaine during bronchoscopy have reported conflicting results, and hence, its use is becoming less common.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Recently, investigators from India have recommended that 1% lignocaine is as effective as 2% solution and hence exposes the patient to lesser cumulative dose of lignocaine.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In our study, we have used 2% lignocaine solution &#x02013; nonetheless, the total dose of lignocaine used was within the standard prescribed limits.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The dose of lignocaine used in individuals, who tolerate flexible bronchoscopy without sedation, has been reported to be within recommended levels.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In our study, every patient received, as per study design, a minimum of 180 mg of 2% lignocaine. As a result, if at all in any of the study groups the requirement was &#x0003c;180 mg, it would not become manifest. However, after having used this minimum dose of lignocaine, it seems additional requirement of lignocaine was not different across the groups.</p><p>In our study, an event of transient hypotension and another one of significant oxygen desaturation occurred in midazolam group and fentanyl-midazolam group, respectively. Both these episodes were managed without any serious consequences. In spite of the above episodes there was no significant difference, among the three study groups, vis-a-vis heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and SpO2 [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Combination of sedatives can cause excessive sedation, but studies have demonstrated no increase in adverse events that are clinically significant.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] For obvious reasons, patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy, particularly under sedation, should be monitored for any evidence of hemodynamic instability and oxygen desaturation. However, adverse events should not be a reason to avoid sedation, as these are manageable. There are many studies which support the fact that patient comfort is enhanced due to sedation, and the risks involved are small and manageable.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Limitations: The impact of rescue medication doses &#x02013; midazolam's amnestic effect &#x02013; on the differences between the patient-reported composite scores across the study groups could not be ascertained.
