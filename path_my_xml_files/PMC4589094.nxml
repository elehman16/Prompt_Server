We performed a post hoc analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind study in which patients with frequent RTIs were randomized to placebo or vitamin D (4000&#x000a0;IE/day for 1&#x000a0;year, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;124).

Statement of better well-being was associated with an increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). In contrast, worse well-being was associated with unchanged 25-OHD levels. Notably, a 25-OHD level above 100&#x000a0;nmol/L at the study end was associated with a higher chance of having a better well-being (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01).

In a longitudinal study of 92 patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), an assessment of general health showed lower scores in these patients compared to patients with other chronic diseases. Approximately one-third of all patients in the cohort were at risk of anxiety/depression, and two-thirds of the females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Vitamin D is important for a healthy immune system and strengthens innate immunity by inducing synthesis of antimicrobial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, vitamin D has broad anti-inflammatory effects on the adaptive immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) are associated with an increased risk of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Based on these findings, we conducted a randomized, placebo controlled and double blind study where patients with frequent RTIs were randomized to placebo or vitamin D (4000&#x000a0;IE/day for 1&#x000a0;year). In this study (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;124) we could show that vitamin D treated patients (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;62) had significantly reduced infectious symptoms, measured as &#x0201c;infectious score&#x0201d;, and a 60&#x000a0;% reduction of antibiotic consumption compared to the placebo group (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;62) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, vitamin D also seems to play a role in the central nervous system. Several reports have shown that low vitamin D levels is associated with increased risk of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and that vitamin D supplementation can reduce depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation could improve the overall well-being in patients with frequent RTIs. To test this hypothesis, we performed a post hoc analysis of our previously performed clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The analysis was based on an assessment of well-being during the study year and this information was related to vitamin D levels and use of antidepressive medication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study cohort</title><p>We performed a post hoc analysis of data from our previously performed clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This was a prospective, randomized and double-blind placebo-controlled study of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation (4000&#x000a0;IU/day) in patients with an increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections. The double-blind design implies that the randomization to placebo or vitamin D was blinded for both patients and the study-physicians and study-nurses. Patient characteristics and inclusion criteria are described in details in the original article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The current post hoc analyses is based on the per protocol cohort, which completed the study (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;124). Of these, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;62 had placebo-treatment and 62 vitamin D-treatment; thirty-three were men and 91 women.

The overall health during the study year was assessed by a global assessment approach by asking a single question: &#x0201c;How do you rate your overall health during the study year compared with the year before inclusion&#x0201d;. The questionnaire contained the predefined answers: 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;better than before, 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;worse than before, 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;no change or 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;other.</p><p>All statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism v. 6.00 and p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Among the patients that stated a better well-being during the study (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;72) there was a significant increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (25-OHD levels) during the study, mean levels increased from 50 (SD &#x000b1;22) to 87 (SD &#x000b1;48) nmol/L (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001); 95&#x000a0;% CI before 45&#x02013;55; after 76&#x02013;99&#x000a0;nmol/L.

At the study start 22 patients were taking antidepressants, 2 men and 20 women. The mean 25-OHD level was 56&#x000a0;nmol/L among these patients (95&#x000a0;% CI 45&#x02013;68&#x000a0;nmol/L) which was mainly the same as in the whole cohort; mean 49&#x000a0;nmol/L (95&#x000a0;% CI 45&#x02013;53&#x000a0;nmol/L). At the end of the study, 10 of these 22 patients stated a better well-being, 6 answered no difference and 6 reported a worse well-being (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The patients that had a better well-being during the study had a mean significant increase in 25-OHD levels (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001), whereas the other patients had no increase (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Interestingly, four subjects could terminate their anti-depressive treatment during the study and all these individuals reported a better well-being (marked with red lines in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). All these subjects had a significant increase in 25OHD-levels, from low levels at study-start, 19&#x02013;57 to 74&#x02013;150&#x000a0;nmol/L at the study-end.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We and others have shown that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for preventing RTIs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). Here, we show that a significant increase in 25-OHD levels is associated with a better well-being in patients with frequent RTIs. Based on these data, 100&#x000a0;nmol/L appears to be a tentative threshold for a beneficial effect on well-being in these patients. Interestingly, when 100&#x000a0;nmol/L was tested as a threshold for infectious score, a similar beneficial effect could not be observed (data not shown). Thus, the reporting of a better well-being could not solely be explained by a reduced infectious burden, suggesting that other mechanism could have contributed to the result.</p><p>In fact, vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial in the treatment of depression but the effects seems to be moderate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the results are still inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, several studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation may reduce chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in elderly (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;120) vitamin D in a single megadose increased quality of life and reduced pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To our knowledge, the present study is the first where vitamin D status in patients with frequent RTIs is correlated to an overall assessment of well-being. An interesting notion is that 52&#x000a0;% of the placebo-treated patients stated a &#x02018;better&#x02019; well-being during the study, indicating an important beneficial placebo-effect of &#x0201c;any&#x0201d; treatment (vitamin D or placebo). Usually, the placebo effect is estimated to 30&#x000a0;% of the effect of a treatment but this figure might be underestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The present study is carried out in Sweden with large seasonal variability of 25-OHD levels in the population between summer and winter due to limited sunlight exposure during the winter time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The lowest levels of 25-OHD levels in a Scandinavian population are in February&#x02013;March [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In Sweden and Finland depressions are most common in spring-time and the suicide peak is in May [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although many factors might contribute to this fact it could be speculated that low 25-OHD levels during early spring-time might contribute to impaired well-being in the population during spring.</p><p>It could not be excluded that the results presented here might at least in part be explained by confounding factors. Fewer respiratory tract infections in patients with a large increase in 25-OHD levels might have contributed to the results of better well-being. Moreover, sufficient 25-OHD levels improves general health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], thus improved well-being might be explained by better physical condition. Furthermore, a recent article suggested that UVB-light has strong analgesic effects by induction of endogenous opioid-like substances (endorphins) in the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus, vitamin D levels could only serve as a maker for UVB-exposition and the association between vitamin D levels and well-being could be explained by exposure to the sun and endogenous synthesis of endorphins. However, our study has an interventional design and thus the most reasonable cause of the observed increase in 25-OHD levels is vitamin D supplementation and not increased UVB-exposition, making this explanation less likely.</p><p>One limitation of the present study was that the trial was not designed to study well-being and the data presented here is a post hoc analysis. We did not use a validated questionnaire for evaluation of &#x0201c;quality of life&#x0201d; or depression, such as GHQ-12, SF-36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] or MADRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Instead, the overall health during the study year was assessed by a global assessment approach by asking a single question. It should also be noted that the current analysis is performed per protocol and not as intention to treat. However, we believe that the per protocol analysis represent the data in a valid manner, since there was an equal amount of patients excluded from each arm. The reasons for exclusion were mainly due to lack of compliance to the protocol, i.e. not taking the drug or not filling out the diary. Importantly, there was no tendency that any reason for exclusion was associated with a specific allocation (vitamin D/placebo), thus minimizing the risk of bias in a per protocol analysis. In addition, the allocation between vitamin D and placebo does not play a major role in this post hoc analysis, since the most interesting result is based on the measured 25-OHD levels and the relation to well-being and not based on allocation to vitamin D or placebo treatment.</p><p>Notably, in the original study vitamin D treatment was well-tolerated and no severe adverse events were reported in the study. Indeed, there were more adverse events reported among the placebo-treated patients than in the vitamin D treated patients, indicating that this is a safe treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Vitamin D supplementation could be a safe, cheap and accessible option to improve both physical health and well-being in patients with frequent RTIs.
