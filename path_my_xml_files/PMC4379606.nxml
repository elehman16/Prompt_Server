Although the causes of falls are varied and complex, the age-related loss in muscle power has emerged as a useful predictor of disability and falls in older people. In this population, the requirements to produce explosive and rapid movements often occurs whilst simultaneously performing other attention-demanding cognitive or motor tasks, such as walking while talking or carrying an object. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether dual-task functional power training (DT-FPT) can reduce the rate of falls in community-dwelling older people.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study design is an 18-month cluster randomised controlled trial in which 280 adults aged &#x02265;65 years residing in retirement villages, who are at increased risk of falling, will be randomly allocated to: 1) an exercise programme involving DT-FPT, or 2) a usual care control group. The intervention is divided into 3 distinct phases: 6 months of supervised DT-FPT, a 6-month &#x02018;step down&#x02019; maintenance programme, and a 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be the number of falls after 6, 12 and 18 months. Secondary outcomes will include: lower extremity muscle power and strength, grip strength, functional assessments of gait, reaction time and dynamic balance under single- and dual-task conditions, activities of daily living, quality of life, cognitive function and falls-related self-efficacy. We will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the programme for preventing falls.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study offers a novel approach that may guide the development and implementation of future community-based falls prevention programmes that specifically focus on optimising muscle power and dual-task performance to reduce falls risk under &#x02018;<italic>real life</italic>&#x02019; conditions in older adults.

At least one third of community-dwelling people aged 65 and over fall at least once per year, and falls in these people are the leading cause of injury-related hospitalisation and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Australia, it is projected that the total annual health cost attributable to fall-related injury will increase almost 3-fold to AUD$1.4 billion by 2051 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, there is a need to identify and implement cost-efficient and effective strategies to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults to ensure that they live independently and relatively disease- and disability-free into old age.</p><p>It is well established that the causes of falling are varied and complex, but the age-related loss in muscle power has emerged as a major factor underlying impaired muscle function and disability in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Muscle power reflects the ability of the muscle to produce force rapidly (that is, it is the product of force and velocity of contraction), and declines earlier and more rapidly with increasing age compared to muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many common daily functional tasks, such as the ability to get up from a chair, climb stairs and walk quickly to cross the road, are more strongly related to muscle power than muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Indeed, the ability to recover from a loss of balance has been shown to be strongly related to the ability to step rapidly or grasp quickly for an object for support; factors associated with speed of generating force (power) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The clinical relevance of this loss in muscle power has been demonstrated in a study that reported that older adults with low muscle power have a two- to three-fold greater risk of significant mobility impairment compared to individuals with low muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There is also evidence that improvements in lower limb muscle power are more influential in producing clinically meaningful changes in muscle function than changes in muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, targeting deficits in lower extremity muscle power and movement velocity are likely to represent an effective strategy to optimise muscle function and reduce the risk of falls and related injuries in older people.</p><p>Extensive research into falls prevention has identified exercise to be an effective strategy to counteract key risk factors for falls, such as muscle weakness and poor balance, and reduce the risk of falling in older people. However, a recent meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials reported that exercise only reduced the risk of falling by an average of 16%, and that not all modes of exercise were equally effective with those studies that included walking being less effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While walking is a popular activity for many older adults and can substantially lower the risk of many chronic diseases, a large proportion of falls occur during walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, there is a need to explore other novel exercise interventions that can improve multiple risk factors for falls (gait, balance, reaction time) and lower fall rates more effectively. Progressive resistance training (PRT) is one approach that is often recommended because of its reported benefits on muscle strength, but there are mixed findings with regard to the efficacy of this mode of training for preventing falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This is perhaps not surprising given the concept of training specificity. Most PRT programmes encourage slow velocity contractions (2 to 4 seconds concentric phase) at a moderate to high percentage of maximal force (approximately 60 to 80% of 1-repetition maximum strength (1-RM)). However, many common tasks related to mobility and daily perturbations require rapid coordinated and dynamic contractions within 50 to 200 ms, which is considerably less than the time needed to achieve maximal muscle force (approximately 400 to 600 ms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, strategies that aim to enhance the ability to generate force quickly, and that are specific to tasks of daily living, are likely to be more relevant to the maintenance of muscle function and thereby prevent falls in older adults.</p><p>In recent years there has been interest in the role of high-velocity (HV) PRT, or power training, as a novel form of training to enhance muscle power and function in older adults. This mode of training is characterised by rapid concentric movements followed by a slower eccentric phase performed at moderate to high loads. In healthy young and older adults, a number of intervention trials have shown that HV-PRT using exercise machines conducted within a controlled setting was effective for improving muscle strength, power and functional performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The findings from a meta-analysis of the limited trials available also revealed that the functional gains following HV-PRT were greater than those that can be achieved through traditional PRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Most of the previous studies involving HV-PRT have used specialised exercise equipment within a controlled setting, which may not be readily accessible to many community-dwelling older adults. Importantly for older people, high-load or high-intensity training is not required as several studies have shown that training at low load and high velocity leads to similar (or even greater) gains in balance, movement speed and muscle strength compared to traditional slow speed PRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. There is also evidence that dynamic functional exercises (stair climbing, chair stands, step-ups) performed rapidly and made progressively more challenging through the use of weighted vests or elastic bands/tubing can significantly improve muscle power and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, a limitation of nearly all these studies is that they included small sample sizes and were performed in a controlled setting. To our knowledge, this will be the first community-based, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the long-term effects of HV-PRT on falls in older people.</p><p>For many older adults, the risk of falls is increased when they are required to undertake a secondary or concurrent cognitive or motor task (referred to as the &#x02018;dual-task paradigm&#x02019;), such as walking while talking, carrying objects or watching traffic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Previous research has shown that cognitive deficits in older people, particularly deficits in executive function such as the ability to concentrate, to attend selectively, multi-task and to plan and strategise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], are associated with both risk factors for falls (for example, postural instability, impaired gait, reduced ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL)); and future falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Indeed, there is evidence that under dual-task conditions, older adults exhibit poorer reaction times, reduced walking speed, increased sway, more frequent contact with obstacles whilst walking and slower step velocities, compared to single-task conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Difficulties in dual-task conditions have also been associated with a history of falls and risk of future falls in community-dwelling older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Several short-term trials and pilot studies in healthy older adults and those with stroke, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and dementia, have shown that balance or stepping programmes incorporating dual-tasking, such as exercising whilst performing a cognitive and/or motor task, were effective for improving balance and gait under dual-task conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In contrast, single-task training was not transferable to balance performance under dual-task conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This highlights the need for targeted falls prevention programmes that incorporate the principle of training specificity and replicate &#x02018;real-life&#x02019; everyday situations in terms of how and where falls are likely to occur. To our knowledge, this study will be the first to investigate whether dual-task functional power training can reduce the rate of falls and improve risk factors for falls under single and dual-task conditions in older people at risk of falling. Furthermore, previous research has consistently shown that many of the benefits of exercise for falls prevention are lost following the cessation of supervised or intensive programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Thus, there is a need to identify safe and effective strategies to maintain any initial benefits derived from structured or intensive programmes. In this study, we will examine the efficacy of a less intensive &#x02018;step down&#x02019; maintenance programme on fall rates after an initial intensive 6-month structured training programme. We will also examine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and maintenance programme for preventing falls in older community-dwellers.</p><p>The primary aim of this community-based, cluster randomised controlled trial is to evaluate whether dual-task functional power training (DT-FPT) can reduce the rate of falls in community-dwelling older adults at increased risk of falling.

The delivery of the programme will be standardised through regular quality assurance visits and monthly trainer meetings with the research staff.</p><p>The 26-week programme will be divided into an initial 2-week familiarisation (orientation) period, followed by 3 distinct but interrelated 8-week phases termed &#x02018;mesocycles&#x02019;. Each mesocycle will be further divided into 2-week achievable microcycles that are designed to be progressively more challenging. Each training session is designed to be completed within 45 to 60 minutes and will be divided into 4 components: 1) a warm-up consisting of rhythmic and range of motion exercises, 2) challenging balance and mobility activities, 3) HV-FPT, and 4) a cool-down. Dual-task activities will be incorporated into the challenging balance/mobility and HV-FPT. All programmes will be individualised to the functional capabilities of each participant based on their initial assessment.</p><p>For the challenging balance and mobility training, participants will be asked to engage in a range of activities designed to simulate common daily functional tasks such as avoiding and stepping over obstacles, weight-shifts and leaning to reach objects. Particular emphasis will be placed on training the lower limb muscles (ankle dorsi- and plantar-flexors, knee flexors and extensors, hip abductors, adductors and extensors) that are associated with balance and mobility. The programme will become progressively more challenging through the inclusion of more difficult postures with a gradual reduction in the base of support, dynamic movements that increasingly perturb the centre of gravity, reducing sensory input, negotiating different environmental hazards and the use of dual-task activities. For each session, participants will be required to perform at least two challenging balance or mobility exercises.</p><p>For the HV-FPT component, the goal will be to increase lower limb muscle power, movement speed, force and mobility. Participants will be instructed to perform a series of resistance and functional tasks where all repetitions for each concentric (shortening) phase of the exercise will be performed as quickly as possible, while the eccentric (lengthening) phase of the exercise action will be controlled over 3 to 4 seconds. The exercises will become progressively more challenging by increasing the resistance, difficulty or changing the exercise to another more complex task. Core exercises will include: multi-directional rapid stepping and bench stepping, combined with functionally relevant resistance exercises (squats, hip abduction, hip extension and ankle plantar- and dorsi-flexion). Weighted vests, thera-bands, tubing, hand-held weights and sand bags will be used to increase the training loads. Participants will perform 2 sets of 10 to 20 repetitions progressing to 50 repetitions for the stepping exercises. For the functional resistance exercises, participants will perform 2 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions at an intensity of 4 to 6 (moderate to hard) on the 10-point Borg&#x02019;s Rating of Perceived Exertion scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and resistance will be increased as tolerated using this scale.</p><p>The dual-task training will incorporate a combination of cognitive and secondary motor tasks that will be performed simultaneously whilst undertaking the challenging balance/mobility and HV-FPT. Prior to incorporating the secondary tasks into the programme, participants will undertake at least 2 weeks of training without this component to ensure safety and confidence with the single-task exercises. Cognitive and motor tasks will then be progressively incorporated into the programme. Examples of cognitive tasks that may be incorporated into the programme include: tasks related to verbal fluency (for example, listing words within a category (names of animals, vegetables, fruit, and so on) or by letter (a word that begins with &#x02018;D&#x02019;)), serial subtraction (for example, subtracting three from a given start number) and information processing (for example, stepping rapidly in a given sequence on command or from memory) onto thin slip-resistant mats or discs that may be different in colour. Dual tasks will be progressed or changed on an individual basis every 4 weeks or as needed.</p><p>To maximise social interaction and enjoyment and enhance adoption and maintenance, participants will train in small groups (8 to 10 per group) and we will incorporate established behavioural models that have previously been successful in older adults. Effective strategies have included: social support (buddy system); regular feedback (fitness testing); positive reinforcement through rewards (T-shirts, caps) and public recognition in newsletters for attendance and adherence; and ongoing education via fact sheets and newsletters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Usual care control group</title><p>Participants residing in the villages assigned to the control group will receive their usual care from their medical practitioner and community services. They will also be encouraged to adhere to the current guidelines of at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity. They will also receive standardised falls prevention and physical activity advice in the form of booklets (Department of Health: &#x02018;<italic>Don&#x02019;t fall for it - falls can be prevented&#x02019;</italic>, and <italic>&#x02018;An active way to better health&#x02019;</italic>) along with generic project newsletters that contain project updates to help minimise attrition over the 18-month duration. There is no evidence that the provision of written falls prevention or physical activity advice alone reduces falls risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>&#x02018;Step down&#x02019; maintenance programme and follow-up</title><p>A 6-month &#x02018;step down&#x02019; maintenance programme will be introduced after the supervised training for the intervention group since previous trials have shown that the benefits of exercise on falls incidence are largely lost after programme cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The &#x02018;step down&#x02019; represents a decrease in the level of free supervised training that will be offered to the participants by the exercise staff who delivered the first 6-months of the programme. Prior to this phase we will liaise with all village managers to discuss strategies as to how they can continue to offer the programme within their village without the intensive intervention of the research staff. Village managers will be provided with a number of potential options as to how they can continue to offer the programme to the residents. To facilitate this transition, participants will be offered 1 weekly 1-hour exercise class led by our trained exercise staff who have completed our &#x02018;train-the-trainers&#x02019; workshop. In addition, since one of the goals of the main intervention is to improve gait and muscle function under dual-task conditions, participants will also be encouraged to undertake at least one brisk walking session per week. Within each village, staff/participants will be encouraged to form walking groups. Compliance with the &#x02018;step down&#x02019; programme will be monitored by attendance sheets completed by the staff at each village and a diary for recording the walking. After the 6-month &#x02018;step down&#x02019; programme, participants will be followed for a further 6 months to establish the long-term residual effects on falls. Participants and staff at the villages will not receive any support or advice during this final 6-month follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>A summary of the outcome measures is shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

The initial comparison of falls outcome between the two groups will be analysed according to the number of falls per person year and the proportion sustaining one or more falls. Subsequent analyses will allow for the non-independence of multiple events for the same participants. Participants will record all falls ((F (fall) or N (no fall)) each day on a monthly falls and adverse events calendar, which will be returned monthly via postage-paid mail. Any participants who do not return the monthly falls calendar will be contacted by telephone by the research staff. When a fall is recorded, a research staff member will administer a standardised questionnaire via telephone to record more specific details of the fall location, cause, injury, treatment and the healthcare utilisation. The fall event data will be coded using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>The secondary outcome measures to be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months (unless stated) will include: changes in lower limb functional muscle strength and power, isometric knee extensor, dorsi-flexor and hand grip strength, dynamic balance and reaction time, gait, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), quality of life, cognitive function and falls- related self-efficacy (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Functional muscle strength and power</title><p>Functional muscle strength of the lower extremities will be assessed using the 30-second Sit-to-Stand (STS) test. Participants will start from a seated position in a chair, with arms folded across the chest, and will be instructed to stand fully upright and return to the seated position as many times as possible in 30 seconds. The final score will be the number of complete stands recorded during this time. The STS test has been shown to have a good test-retest reliability correlation of 0.84 to 0.92 in a sample of community-dwelling men and women over the age of 60 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>Functional lower limb muscle power will be assessed using five consecutive sit-to-stands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

Briefly, participants will be seated with their hip and knee at an angle of 90&#x000b0;, with a strain gauge attached to a strap around the leg about 10 cm above the ankle joint. A strap will also be placed around the thighs to prevent movement of the pelvis and minimise any contribution of the gluteal muscles. Participants will be asked to perform 2 practice trials prior to the completion of 2 maximal efforts with a 60-second rest between each test. For analysis, the maximal knee extensor strength (kg) of each leg will be expressed per unit of lower leg length to compensate for the length of the lever arm. This test has been shown to have excellent test-retest reliability (Pearson&#x02019;s r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.92) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p>Bi-lateral maximal isometric dorsi-flexion strength will be assessed using a dorsi-flexion dynamometer (Neuroscience Research Australia, Sydney, Australia). Participants will be instructed to sit on a 45-cm high chair with the foot strapped securely to a spring-gauged plate attached to a strain gauge load cell. Participants will be instructed to perform 1 practice trial followed by 2 maximal effort muscle contractions, interspersed by a 10- to 15-second rest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. For analysis, maximal dorsi-flexion strength (kg) of each leg will be recorded.</p><p>Bi-lateral maximal isometric grip strength will be assessed using a hand-held dynamometer (Jamar dynamometer, Asimov Engineering Co., Los Angeles, CA, USA). Participants will be instructed to sit on a standard height chair with their shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated, elbow flexed at 90&#x000b0;, forearm neutral and hand slightly extended. They will be instructed to perform 1 practice trial, followed by 2 maximal effort muscle contractions by squeezing the handle of the dynamometer as forcefully as possible. For analysis, maximal grip strength (kg) of each hand will be recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Muscle function and performance</title><p>The Four-square step test (FSST), Timed up-and-go test (TUG), and choice stepping reaction time (CSRT) will be used to assess lower limb muscle function. Each of these tests will be performed in the participant&#x02019;s own footwear.</p><p>The FSST provides a measure of dynamic balance and stepping speed in four directions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Participants will be instructed to step forward, sideways, and backwards over four canes resting flat on the floor in a cross formation. The test begins with the participant moving first in a clockwise direction and returning in a counter-clockwise direction to the start square. Participants will be instructed to complete the task as quickly as possible without touching or stepping on the canes and, if possible, to face forward during the entire sequence. They will also be instructed to ensure that both feet make contact with the floor in each square. After 1 practice trial, participants will complete the test and the time (in seconds) taken to complete the sequence will be measured with a stopwatch and recorded as the final score. The FSST has been shown to discriminate between community-dwelling older adults with and without a history of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The test has an 89% multiple falls sensitivity and an 85% specificity for non-fallers with a cut off score of greater than 15 seconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The test has been shown to have a high test-retest reliability of 0.98 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p>The TUG test is a measure of dynamic balance using three commonly performed functional activities of daily living: standing and sitting, walking, and turning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Participants will be seated in a chair (height 45 cm) that will be placed at the end of a marked 3-meter walkway. On the command &#x02018;go&#x02019;, participants will be instructed to stand up, walk at a comfortable speed for 3 meters, turn back to the chair and sit down. The test will be performed under both single- and dual-task conditions. The dual-task condition will involve participants completing the task while counting backwards in threes from a randomly selected number. All participants will be given a practice trial and one test run. Participants who require a usual indoor walking aid (cane or walker) will perform the test with the use of their aid. A stopwatch will be used to record the time taken (in seconds) to complete each test. Prior to completing the dual-task TUG test, the participants cognitive ability while seated will be assessed by asking them to count backwards in threes from a random number. The time taken to complete 10 subtractions from this random number will be recorded. The number of errors that occur during the seated and dual-tasking test will be recorded for all participants. &#x02018;Dual-task cost&#x02019;, which represents the change in performance with the addition of a second task, will be calculated as:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Following this trial, participants will complete the same activity but with the addition of a dual task. For this trial, participants will be asked to step when a green arrow appears and to not step when a purple arrow appears. A total of eight green panels and four purple panels will be displayed in a random sequence. CSRT will be measured as the time period between the illumination of an arrow and the foot making contact with it, and the average reaction time (in ms) will be recorded.

The ProtoKinetics Zeno walkway system is a 2-foot wide by 16-foot long mat that contains a 16-level pressure sensing pad with 18,432 pressure sensors arranged in a grid pattern with a spatial resolution of 0.5 cm and a sampling frequency of 120 Hz. Participants will be asked to perform 18 trials on the Zeno system, wearing comfortable footwear, at their preferred walking speed, and with their usual indoor walking aid if required. Three different gait conditions will be assessed: 1) simple walking; 2) walking while counting backwards in 7s from a computerised derived random number between 70 and 99 (cognitive dual task), and 3) walking while carrying a tray whilst balancing a ball in a target (motor dual task). For the cognitive and motor dual task, the number of errors in counting backwards and the number of times the ball deviates from the centre of the target will be recorded. Motor dual-task trials will not be completed by those participants requiring an indoor walking aid. For each walking trial, all participants will start standing 1 m behind the walkway, and on the command &#x02018;go&#x02019; they will walk the length of the Zeno mat to a cone that will be placed 1 m past the end of the walkway. All participants will be given standardised verbal instruction followed by one practice trial for each walking condition.

The use of norm-based weights gives each domain score a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10, allowing change in scores to be assessed on a comparable scale.

Summary measures of the physical and mental components of the survey will also be calculated based on a factor analysis of the 8 domains among participants in the 2004 South Australian Health Omnibus Survey, yielding two separate overall summary scores: the physical component summary (PCS) and the mental component summary (MCS) scores.</p><p>Participants will also be asked to complete the Assessment of Quality of Life - 6D scale (AQoL-6D) questionnaire, which is a 20-item self-report instrument that considers six dimensions of health, including independent living, relationships, mental health, coping, pain and senses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Cognitive function</title><p>The CogState Brief Battery computerised test (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cogstate.com/">http://cogstate.com/</ext-link><underline>)</underline> will be used to assess cognitive function. More specific details about these tests have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Briefly, the tests have been designed to be easily administered and repeatable without eliciting practice or learned effects, and have been shown to provide sensitive and valid measurement for a range of different cognitive functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The battery of five tests that will be used for this study include: Groton maze learning test (measure of executive function and spatial problem solving), the Detection task (psychomotor function and speed of processing), the Identification task (visual attention and choice reaction time), One Card Learning task (visual learning with a pattern separation model) and the One Back task (working memory/attention).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Falls efficacy</title><p>Falls efficacy will be measured using the 16-item Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) version questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], which is a tool for measuring the level of concern about falling during social and physical activities indoors and outdoors on a 4-point Likert scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;not at all concerned to 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;very concerned).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional measures</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Anthropometry and body composition</title><p>Height will be measured with a standardised portable stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm. Body mass will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg. Body composition will be assessed using a whole body bioelectrical impedance (BIA) segmental body composition scales (TANITA BC-418, Tanita, Tokyo, Japan). This is a single-frequency (50Hz) BIA device that uses 8 polar electrodes that can provide a measure of whole body and segmental (arms and legs) fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM). An algorithm incorporating impedance, age and height will be used to estimate percentage fat mass. To standardise the measurement of weight and body composition, participants will be instructed to refrain from eating a meal 1 to 2 hours prior to the testing and to ensure normal hydration status. Participants will be measured wearing light clothing, standing erect and barefoot on the analyser&#x02019;s footpads.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Lifestyle and medical history</title><p>A lifestyle questionnaire will be used to obtain detailed information on the participant&#x02019;s ethnic and education background, employment history/status, medical history, previous history of any falls and fractures, family history of osteoporosis, current medication and dietary supplement use, smoking status, weekly television viewing and sitting time, and sun exposure habits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Diet</title><p>Dietary intake will be assessed at each testing assessment using the Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies Version 2 (DQES v2), a modification of the Cancer Council Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. The DQES v2 covers 5 main types of dietary intake: 1) cereal foods, sweets and snacks; 2) dairy products, meats and fish; 3) fruit, 4) vegetables and 5) alcoholic beverages, incorporating 80 items. The DQES v2 is designed to be self-administered to determine the usual eating habits of the participants over the past 12 months at baseline. Participants will be instructed to record how often they ate each food listed on average over each time period. All questionnaires will be checked by the researchers for completeness. The performance of the Cancer Council FFQ has been evaluated in studies comparing the results of the questionnaire with those from weighed food records showing good agreement between methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Habitual physical activity</title><p>Total leisure and recreational physical activity will be assessed using the Community Healthy Activities Model Programme for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire. This questionnaire has been designed for use in older adults and has been shown to be reliable, valid and sensitive to the changes in physical activity behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. At each assessment, participants will record their weekly frequency and duration of participation in a &#x02018;typical week&#x02019; of the preceding 4 weeks. The results will be reported as estimated kilojoules per week spent in moderate- to high-intensity activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Exercise compliance</title><p>Compliance with the exercise programme will be assessed by attendance at the supervised exercise sessions and completion of personal exercise cards that will be completed by the participants and checked by the trainers after each session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Adverse events</title><p>All adverse events will be self-reported by the participant at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months and assessed by the research staff for seriousness, expectedness and causality following the guidelines recommended by the National Institute for Ageing (NIA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical-research-study-investigators-toolbox/adverse-events">http://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/clinical-research-study-investigators-toolbox/adverse-events</ext-link>). For this study, an adverse event will be defined as any health-related unfavourable or unintended medical occurrence (sign, symptom, syndrome, illness) that develops or worsens during the period of observation in the trial. Adverse events will be closely monitored until a resolution or stabilisation is achieved, or until it has been shown that the study intervention is not the cause of the injury. Participants will be asked to contact the research staff immediately in the event of a serious adverse event. Any adverse event sustained during the exercise programme will be recorded by the trainers and immediately reported to the research staff. The chief investigator will be informed and shall determine the seriousness and causality in conjunction with any medical staff treating the event. A serious adverse event that is deemed related to or suspected to be related to the exercise intervention will be reported to the ethics committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)</title><p>The CEA will be used to determine the monetary treatment costs of implementing the exercise programme and cost of outcomes (for example, falls and their consequences). The results will provide an incremental cost per fall averted for the DT-FPT and &#x02018;step down&#x02019; programme. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is the ratio of the incremental difference in treatment cost to the cost-saving (fewer falls). The ICER will be used in future decision-making on the allocation of resources, which maximises the health effects for a given amount of resources. The following measures will be collected: 1) the costs of implementing the programme (for example, staff costs, training, vehicle costs, capital costs and consumables), and 2) costs of health services (for example, directly related to a fall including inpatient hospital admissions, emergency department presentations and other health and community service contact) derived from the monthly calendars. The results will be expressed as the incremental cost (dollars) per fall averted among those randomised to the DT-FPT and &#x02018;step down&#x02019; programme versus usual care. Research-related costs will not be included in the CEA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Sample size</title><p>Based on previous research in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], we anticipate that approximately 45% of the usual care control group will experience a fall throughout the study. To detect a 40% reduction in the rate of falls (for example, from 45% to 27%) in the DT-FPT group, we estimate that we will require 118 participants per group (2-tailed, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and power of 0.8). This allows for a 15% loss to follow-up due to death or withdrawal from the study. To account for cluster randomisation, we will assume a conservative intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.01 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], giving a design effect of 1.19, assuming approximately 15 to 20 participants are recruited per village. This gives a sample size of 140 per group (280 participants from approximately 15 villages). This sample size will also provide sufficient power (0.9, 2-tailed, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) to detect significant and clinically meaningful differences in many of the secondary outcome measures. Previous research has shown that 6 months of high-velocity resistance training in older adults can result in a 50% increase in peak muscle power (SD 18%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This mode of training has also resulted in a reduction in chair rise time of approximately 11% (SD 12%) and stair climbing time of approximately 7% (SD 10%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For the usual care control group, we estimate a mean change of 0 (SD 10%). Thus, to achieve 90% power at <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 (2-tailed), we estimate that 46 participants per group would be required to demonstrate between group differences of this magnitude in these measures. We will also have sufficient numbers to detect the smallest clinically significant differences in other measures of function and the SF-36. Perera <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] calculated that a small meaningful change (difference) in function is around 5% (0.05 m/s gait speed) and a substantial change is around 10% (0.10 m/s gait speed). Since we will recruit a cohort at increased risk of falling, we anticipate greater changes based on previous work in healthy community-dwelling older adults (gait speed +7%, chair rise +13%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We estimate that 32 to 42 participants per group will be needed for a statistical power of 0.9 (2-tailed, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) to detect differences between the groups of 14 to 25% in gait speed and chair rising time. Using data from a pilot study on dual-task stepping exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], we estimate that we will need 48 participants per group to detect a 20% difference (SD 25%) in dual-task cost at 90% power (2-tailed, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). For the sub-scales of the SF-36, we anticipate a change of 10 points in the DT&#x02009;+&#x02009;FPT groups with a small age-related change (decrease) in the controls. In various patient groups a 5 to 10% change is regarded as the minimal important difference. We note that the effects of resistance training on SF-36 are mixed, but differences of 15 to 52 points for the various sub-scales have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Primary analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis using STATA statistical software release (STATA, College Station, TX, USA). Per protocol analysis will also be performed by including all participants who are at least 80% compliant to the exercise (as measured by the number of exercise sessions attended). Initially, descriptive statistics will be computed to compare the intervention and control groups on background variables and baseline measures. Imbalances on prognostic factors between the groups will be adjusted for during analyses. Calculation of QoL scores (SF-36 v2, AQol-6D) will utilise published &#x02018;weightings&#x02019; most relevant to this population. Baseline measures and changes in outcome variables over the study period for each study arm will be presented as means (&#x000b1; SD) with 95% confidence intervals. The effect of the intervention on the primary outcome variables will be assessed using negative binomial regression, to account for the non-independence of multiple events for the same participants and to allow for over-dispersion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. To account for clustering, the negative binomial regression analysis will be carried out using the generalised linear mixed modelling approach, with observations clustered within retirement villages; village will be modelled as a random effect. Differences between the intervention and control groups on the secondary outcome measures will be examined using linear mixed models with assessment times clustered within individuals and individuals clustered within villages. Village and, where appropriate (as determined by the likelihood ratio tests) individuals, will be modelled as random effects. The secondary outcome variables will be checked for normality prior to analysis and transformed appropriately if necessary. For both primary and secondary outcomes, random effects will be computed utilising robust standard errors. For all outcomes, primary analyses will compare unadjusted differences between the study groups at each follow-up. Supplementary adjusted analyses, with adjustment for potential covariates (baseline values of relevant outcome, age, sex, use of medication, chronic conditions, falls history and other background variables that show imbalances between the intervention and control groups) will also be conducted.</p><p>Missing data: where possible, we will obtain endpoint measures from all withdrawals and include all randomised subjects in the final analysis. For participants who are lost to follow- up, missing data will be handled with multiple imputation. As this approach makes an untestable assumption that data are missing at random (that is, missing data can be predicted from the observed data) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], we will perform sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of potential non-random attrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Sensitivity analyses will employ simulation and will test a range of scenarios assuming plausible arm-specific differences in outcomes for individuals who were lost to follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Many falls in older people result from an inability to generate sufficient lower limb muscle power to produce an explosive and rapid movement to step quickly when balance is lost. This is confounded further when simultaneously performing concurrent attention-demanding tasks (&#x02018;dual-task&#x02019; paradigm), such as talking while walking or negotiating traffic or obstacles. Despite the clinical relevance of muscle power and dual-tasking to &#x02018;<italic>real life</italic>&#x02019; situations<italic>,</italic> no studies have examined the efficacy of either approach for preventing falls in a large-scale randomised controlled trial. We expect that the results from this trial will guide the development and implementation of future community-based falls prevention programmes that specifically focus on optimising muscle power and function and reducing falls risk under &#x02018;<italic>real-life&#x02019;</italic> conditions in older adults at risk of falling. If successful, the pragmatic design of the exercise intervention programme could be easily adopted to routine practice. The successful delivery of the intervention within retirement villages is also critical as it overcomes common barriers to exercise participation for older people. Furthermore, the &#x02018;step down&#x02019; programme will provide important new information about the efficacy of a less intensive maintenance programme for reducing the risk of falls over an extended period in community-dwelling older adults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment is currently underway and a number of participants have commenced the study.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>1-RM</term><def><p>1-repetition maximum strength</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ADL</term><def><p>Activities of daily living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AEP</term><def><p>Accredited exercise physiologist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AQoL-6D</term><def><p>Assessment of quality of life - 6D scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BIA</term><def><p>Bioelectrical impedance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEA</term><def><p>Cost-effectiveness analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHAMPS</term><def><p>Community healthy activities model programme for seniors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSRT</term><def><p>Choice stepping reaction time</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DT-FPT</term><def><p>Dual-task functional power training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DQES v2</term><def><p>Dietary questionnaire for epidemiological studies version 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESSA</term><def><p>Exercise and sports science Australia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FES-I</term><def><p>Falls efficacy scale-international</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FM</term><def><p>Fat mass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFM</term><def><p>Fat-free mass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFQ</term><def><p>Food frequency questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FSST</term><def><p>Four-square step test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HR-QoL</term><def><p>Health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HV-PRT</term><def><p>High-velocity progressive resistance training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IADL</term><def><p>Instrumental activities of daily living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICD-10</term><def><p>International classification of diseases, 10th edition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCS</term><def><p>Mental component summary score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHMRC</term><def><p>National health and medical research council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIA</term><def><p>National institute for ageing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCS</term><def><p>Physical component summary score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PKMAS</term><def><p>ProtoKinetics movement analysis software</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRT</term><def><p>Progressive resistance training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36 v2</term><def><p>Short form 36 version 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STS</term><def><p>Sit-to-stand test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TUG</term><def><p>Timed up-and-go test</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>RMD originated the idea for the study and will supervise the project.
