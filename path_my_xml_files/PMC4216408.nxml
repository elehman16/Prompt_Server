Caused by a partial or total deficiency of coagulation factor IX (FIX), haemophilia B is less common than haemophilia A (deficiency of factor VIII), accounting for approximately 15&#x02013;20% of the total haemophilia population <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. The severity of haemophilia B is typically classified according to the levels of coagulation factor activity in the blood. Severely affected patients have &#x0003c;1% of normal factor levels, patients with moderate disease, 1&#x02013;5%, and patients with mild disease, 5&#x02013;40% <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Patients with severe disease constitute approximately 30% of the haemophilia B patient population <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>Bleeding events associated with haemophilia are characterized by spontaneous or trauma-related haemorrhage into soft tissue, muscles and joints, with repeated bleeding leading to arthropathy and pain <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Spontaneous haemorrhage is generally considered to occur randomly and without a predictable temporal or seasonal pattern; however, a few reports have examined the effects that weather, temperature and atmosphere might have on spontaneous bleeding. Based on these reports, there is a lack of consensus in the medical literature regarding consistent seasonal variation in bleeding risk in patients with haemophilia <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In addition, regulatory agencies have expressed concern regarding the potential for seasonal influence on bleeding rates and have relayed requests for clinical trial analyses of on-demand treatment over a period of 1&#x000a0;year to appropriately assess the impact of seasonal variation on bleeding risk.</p><p>Replacement of deficient FIX with high purity plasma-derived or recombinant FIX concentrates used either as on-demand or prophylaxis therapy, is a mainstay of treatment for haemophilia B <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. In a multicentre, randomized, open-label crossover study, Valentino <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. evaluated the efficacy and safety associated with the use of nonacog alfa (BeneFIX&#x000ae;; Wyeth [Pfizer], Philadelphia, PA, USA), currently the only commercially available recombinant FIX, as a prophylaxis regimen compared with administration on an on-demand basis <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. The objective of this <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis was to assess the influence of seasonality on bleeding frequency and patient-assessed pain in these patients with haemophilia B receiving on-demand therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and patients</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Data for this <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis were obtained from a multicentre, randomized, open-label, four-period crossover study that assessed the efficacy and safety of nonacog alfa as secondary prophylaxis in patients with moderately severe to severe haemophilia B. The design and primary results of this study have been reported previously <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. In brief, patients received on-demand treatment with nonacog alfa for 16&#x000a0;weeks, with dosing adjusted based on the investigator's judgment, according to body weight and bleeding severity (Period 1). Patients were then randomized to prophylaxis therapy with nonacog alfa 50&#x000a0;IU&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> twice weekly or 100&#x000a0;IU&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> once weekly for 16&#x000a0;weeks (Period 2; Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). This was followed by an 8-week period during which patients received on-demand treatment only, with a dose and treatment plan similar to that of Period 1 (Period 3). Patients were then crossed over to receive prophylaxis with the alternative treatment regimen for 16&#x000a0;weeks (Period 4).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design.

Reasons for exclusion included current use of primary prophylaxis, human immunodeficiency virus infection with CD4 count &#x0003c;200/&#x003bc;L, hepatic or renal impairment, thrombocytopaenia, another bleeding disorder, major surgery or orthopaedic surgery within the previous 3&#x000a0;months or planned during the study period, past or current FIX inhibitor, known hypersensitivity to FIX or hamster proteins, or any other condition that could interfere with study participation or confound the interpretation of the results.

For example, a small proportion (10&#x02013;15%) of patients with severe haemophilia have bleeding patterns typically associated with mild disease (i.e. less spontaneous bleeding or less joint damage) despite having a coagulation factor activity of &#x0003c;1% <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. The presence of target joints and synovial hypertrophy, extent of haemophilic arthropathy, physical activity and age may also influence bleeding patterns in patients with haemophilia <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Research has also included investigation into physiological issues such as seasonality and weather in haemophilia bleeding episodes <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. The findings from this <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis showed no seasonal or temporal pattern for bleeding episodes (spontaneous and traumatic) in patients with moderately severe to severe haemophilia B receiving on-demand treatment with nonacog alfa. In addition, the pattern of severe pain associated with joint bleeding events did not fit a seasonal or temporal pattern.</p><p>The findings from this analysis are generally consistent with data in the literature. In a recent study, Broderick, <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. evaluated the effect of physical activity on bleeding risk in paediatric patients with haemophilia A and B. The latter study included an assessment of bleeding frequency according to week of year of study participation, and no trend was observed <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. A case study by Benbasset of adult patients with haemophilia A found monthly peaks in bleeding in individual patients; however, the timing of the peaks varied widely between patients and did not show a seasonal preference for the group as a whole <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Likewise, an observational study of adolescent boys with haemophilia A found no seasonal variation in bleeding episodes over a period of 2 academic years <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. A retrospective analysis of data from clinical trials of patients with haemophilia A, including both children and adults, found an age-dependent elevation of the risk for joint bleeds during the summer months. In patients aged 10&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years and 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years, 43% and 46%, respectively, experienced their bleeding events from June to August, compared with 21% for patients aged 1&#x02013;6&#x000a0;years <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. The authors hypothesized that the pattern of increased bleeding was likely related to the increased physical activity levels in teenage and adult patients during this time. Only one study published in 1990 found a correlation between weather patterns/atmospheric pressure and bleeding risk in patients with haemophilia <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>; however, it appears that this study was not followed up or repeated.</p><p>In this study, patients were prompted to complete a pain assessment whenever they reported a joint bleed. A recently published study found that scores for acute pain associated with a bleed event were higher (5.97/10) than scores for pain not associated with a bleed (4.22/10) <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.This is consistent with existing literature which suggests that although acute and chronic pain in patients with haemophilia are qualitatively similar, patients experience acute pain as being more intense <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. However, findings from a recent study evaluating 15 spontaneous, non-traumatic pain episodes (six ankles, seven knee, two muscles) in 11 haemophilic adults suggested that patients and physicians misclassified the pain aetiology for the majority of episodes <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Of 10 episodes of patient-perceived joint bleeding, only three were confirmed by ultrasound imaging to actually be associated with bleeding. Furthermore, swelling, warmth and loss of range of motion were present in only half of the confirmed bleeding episodes, demonstrating that these findings alone are not clinically reliable assessments of pain associated with bleeding.</p><p>The limitations of this analysis include its <italic>post hoc</italic> nature. In addition, the relatively small number of patients may be a limiting factor; however, this is inherent in studies of rare diseases such as haemophilia. Finally, this analysis may have been limited by the collection of data from study periods other than those used for the primary assessments (e.g. from the washout period between the two prophylaxis periods).</p><p>More data are clearly needed to determine patient risk profiles to optimize therapy with FIX replacement agents. Based on the present analysis, the frequency of bleeding in patients with moderate to severe haemophilia B does not vary according to a seasonal or temporal pattern, and similarly, there is no seasonal or temporal pattern to the intensity of pain during joint bleeding episodes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the research support staff and data management personnel for their participation in this study.
