Obesity is a chronic condition that carries an important health risk. National guidelines, for use in England, on the management of people who are overweight or obese have been published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE, 2006). NICE recommendations for primary care teams are: determine the degree of overweight and obesity; assess lifestyle, comorbidities and willingness to change; offer multicomponent management of overweight and obesity; referral to external services when appropriate. This study investigates a tailored intervention to improve the implementation of these recommendations by primary care teams.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study is a cluster randomised controlled trial. Primary care teams will be recruited from the East Midlands of England, and randomised into two study arms: 1) the study group, in which primary care teams are offered a set of tailored interventions to help implement the NICE guidelines for overweight and obesity; or 2) the control group in which primary care teams continue to practice usual care. The primary outcome is the proportion of overweight or obese patients for whom the primary care team adheres to the NICE guidelines. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with a record of lifestyle assessment, referral to external weight loss services, the proportion of obese patients who lose weight during the intervention period, and the mean weight change over the same period.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although often recommended, the methods of tailoring implementation interventions to account for the determinants of practice are not well developed. This study is part of a programme of studies seeking to develop the methods of tailored implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN07457585">ISRCTN07457585</ext-link>.

In the guidelines, overweight is defined as body mass index (BMI) of between 25 and 30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and obesity is defined as a BMI of 30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or over. In 2011, 65% of adult men in England were classified as overweight with 24% obese, with similar percentages among women (58% and 26% respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The prevalence of obesity varies by level of social deprivation, and reaches 33% in women in the lowest socio-economic group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. High though these levels of obesity may be, it has been predicted on the basis of current trends that they will have risen even further by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Obesity is a chronic condition that confers an important health risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It has been estimated that the effects of obesity exceed those of smoking or excess alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It is associated with increased rates of mortality, diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, osteoarthritis and some cancers, and leads to increased health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It also reduces health-related quality of life and increases time lost from work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In 2011, the government in England launched a strategy intended to reduce levels of obesity by 2020 including plans to improve food labelling and encourage more healthy lifestyles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Health services also have responsibilities in reducing the number of people who are overweight and obese, and excess weight in both adults and children has been included among the new outcome indicators for the English health service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In England, primary care services are important in identifying people who are obese, or at risk of becoming obese, and offering advice, support, and practical interventions. Some people may be referred to receive dietary and exercise advice, or for consideration of bariatric surgery. Patients may also opt to attend weight reduction services that charge a fee, for example <italic>Weight Watchers</italic> or <italic>Slimming World </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. NICE identifies a range of barriers to following the guidelines, including perceptions among patients, social pressures including marketing of foods, and poor access to weight reduction services, including exercise facilities. The most commonly reported barriers to effective management of obesity in the primary care setting include: psychological complexities of cases, high rate of relapse, perceived lack of effective interventions, lack of time, lack of resources, and lack of onward referral options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In pilot work in Leicester, UK, we have identified a sense of helplessness among health professionals as a potential barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A 2010 review of strategies to promote weight reduction in obese patients through changing the behaviour of health professionals and the organisation of care by Flodgren and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] has identified the need for better developed and evaluated interventions to achieve effective weight reduction advice by health care professionals.</p></sec><sec><title>Targets for improvement</title><p>This study is part of the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases (TICD) project, which has the overall aim of developing and testing methods of tailoring implementation interventions to determinants of practice for knowledge in chronic illness care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the TICD project, we developed a programme for implementing the NICE obesity guidelines in a stepwise approach. The first step involved identifying from the NICE guidelines those recommendations applicable to primary care, and which would be selected for implementation (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The NICE recommendations for the treatment of overweight and obesity</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="left"><bold>Recommendation</bold></th><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td rowspan="4" align="left" valign="top">1<hr/></td><td rowspan="4" align="left" valign="top">Determining degree of overweight and overweight<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Use clinical judgement to decide when to measure weight and height<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Use body mass index to classify the degree of overweight or obesity<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Use waist circumference in people with a body mass index less than 35&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> to assess health risks<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; To tell the patient their classification, and how this affects their risk of long-term health problems<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4" align="left" valign="top">2<hr/></td><td rowspan="4" align="left" valign="top">Assessment of lifestyle and willingness to change<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Presenting symptoms and underlying causes of overweight or obesity<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Risk factors and comorbidities<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Eating behaviour, diet and physical activity<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Willingness and motivation to change<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4" align="left" valign="top">3<hr/></td><td rowspan="4" align="left" valign="top">Management of overweight and obesity<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Increased physical activity<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Improved eating behaviour<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; Healthy eating<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; If appropriate, drug treatment<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" align="left" valign="top">4</td><td rowspan="3" align="left" valign="top">Referral</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; For assessment of the underlying cause of overweight or obesity<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02022; If conventional treatment has failed<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02022; If specialist interventions may be needed</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Health system context</title><p>England has a national health service that provides free access to care, and is funded from taxation. However, there are charges for a limited range of services, including dental care, and patients aged under 60 are required to a pay fixed charge for prescription medicines. Following organisational reforms in 2013, public health services are managed through local authorities or councils. Hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care, and primary health care is delivered through general practices. Around 98% of the population is registered with a general practice, practices having registered lists of patients, electronic record systems, and multidisciplinary primary care teams that include doctors, nurses, and health care assistants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Practices are paid through a combination of capitation and pay for performance schemes, notably the quality and outcomes framework (QOF) and payments for enhanced services. Practices vary widely in size, although the mean size is approximately 6,800 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In 2012, there were 8,088 general practices in England, 921 of which were classified as single-handed. There were 35,871 full time equivalent general practitioners (GPs), 14,695 full time equivalent practice nurses, and 70,851 full time equivalent practice staff in other categories. The total number of patients registered with GPs in England was 55.7 million (patients are required to register with a single practice in order to receive primary care).</p></sec><sec><title>Usual care</title><p>There is an indicator for obesity in the QOF as follows: the contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 16 or over with a BMI &#x02265;30 in the preceding 12&#x000a0;months, and therefore practices have some financial incentive for the detection of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Yet despite this, the proportion of the population recorded on general practice obesity registers falls well short of the proportion identified as obese in systematic population surveys, nationally being only 10.7% in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] compared with approximately 20% in population surveys.</p><p>Failure to record obesity is not the only performance deficit. An implementation uptake report on the surgical and pharmacological interventions for obesity found that the NICE clinical guidelines had mixed impact in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Prescription patterns were in line with the NICE guidance but the low proportion of patients receiving advice prior to the start of their drug treatment indicated deviance from the guidance. Lack of adherence to the NICE clinical guidelines for obesity was also reported by the Office of Health Economics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The Office of Health Economics, which administered questionnaires to the 151 Primary Care Trusts that managed primary care teams in England at the time of the survey to assess their views on the degree of similarity between their local referral process/guidelines for obesity and the NICE guidance. People with obesity, therefore, may well not be identified and recorded in general practice, and, even if they are, support and management may not be in accordance with the guidelines. Yet, with around a quarter of the UK population being obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the effective implementation of the NICE clinical guidance on obesity has potential to benefit individual and population health and reduce the economic burden of the health consequences of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases project</title><p>The underlying conceptual framework to TICD is that implementation is more likely to be effective when the determinants of practice have been identified and a strategy (that may include several discrete interventions) is designed and delivered to address them. This process is referred to as tailored implementation.</p><p>Our Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] has shown that this approach can be effective, but as yet the most appropriate methods used to identify determinants and tailor a strategy to account for them have not been determined. In the review, twelve studies provided sufficient information to be included in the quantitative analysis, and a pooled odds ratio of the effectiveness of tailored interventions was 1.54 (95% confidence interval 1.16 to 2.01). TICD sets out to advance the methodology of tailored implementation.</p><p>The first component study of TICD, a review of determinants and development of a checklist that can assist in identifying them in implementation initiatives, has been completed and published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A second study has compared various methods for investigating determinants; for example, interviews of professionals or patients, or brainstorming (manuscript in preparation). A third study has investigated the methods that can be used to plan the implementation strategy taking account of the determinants of practice (manuscript in preparation). Both the second and third studies have been completed, and have laid the foundation for the trial described in this protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness of a tailored implementation strategy in comparison with usual care for improving adherence to the NICE guidelines for the management of overweight and obesity in primary care teams.</p><p>The secondary aim is to examine the extent to which the most important determinants were identified and appropriate interventions used to address them, which we refer to as the validity of methods. A process evaluation will be undertaken to investigate how successful the tailoring process was in identifying and addressing determinants, the fidelity of intervention delivery, and how the study participants responded to the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Research questions</title><p>1. What is the effectiveness of a tailored implementation programme compared to no intervention (usual care) in improving adherence of primary care teams to the NICE guidelines on overweight and obesity?</p><p>2. What is the validity of the methods used to tailor the implementation programme to determinants of practice?</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>This study is a cluster randomised trial in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] that will randomise general practices into two study arms: 1) the study group in which primary care teams are offered a set of tailored interventions; or 2) the control group in which primary care teams administer usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants and setting</title><p>All general practices in the East Midlands of England will be invited to participate in the study. The area includes the following Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs): Leicester City CCG, East Leicester &#x00026; Rutland CCG, West Leicestershire CCG, NHS Southern Derbyshire CCG, North Derbyshire CCG, NHS Lincolnshire East CCG, Lincolnshire West CCG, North East Lincolnshire CCG, North Lincolnshire CCG, Mansfield and Ashfield CCG, Nottingham North &#x00026; East CCG, Nottingham West CCG, Rushcliffe CCG, NHS Nottingham City CCG, Newark &#x00026; Sherwood CCG, NHS Corby CCG, Nene CCG.

The population is typical of England for social status and age distribution, but with a slightly higher proportion of non-white ethnicity. There are three to four large urban centres, but also small towns and more isolated rural communities.

Study 2 confirmed that health care professionals found it difficult to find acceptable ways to raise the issue of weight with patients. The intervention aims to address this by providing scripts for health care professionals to use in raising and discussing weight with patients that are likely to be acceptable to patients. We also aim to show video clips of good and bad ways to raise weight with patients.</p><p>To classify the degree of overweight and obesity, the NICE guidelines recommend that waist circumference is measured in patients with a BMI less than 35&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> to assess health risks. Study 2 identified that health care professionals were unsure how to reliably measure waist circumference and how waist circumference relates to health risks. The intervention aims to address this by providing information on how to effectively measure waist circumference. A live demonstration will be provided in the practices and a thorough explanation relating waist circumference and increased health risks will be provided.

If the patient is not ready and willing to do so, it is likely the intervention will fail. The NICE guidelines recommend that health care professionals assess a patient&#x02019;s lifestyle, co-morbidities and willingness to change. This can be difficult to assess in a short consultation. The intervention will explain how to assess whether a patient is ready to make changes to their lifestyle. Health care professionals will also be provided with questionnaires to assess motivation and that can be used as a discussion point with patients.</p><p>The intervention will also provide health care professionals with resources that can be used to increase a patient&#x02019;s motivation, and suggest appropriate times to use them within the consultation.

They felt that the advice provided by commercial slimming clubs on portion sizes and guidance on a more prescriptive diet would be beneficial. The intervention will provide health care professionals with a prescriptive weight loss plan that can be delivered to patients within primary care. The &#x02018;Weight loss you can see&#x02019; information booklet provides patients with visible pictures of portion sizes for every day foods. The booklet provides patients with a prescriptive energy deficit diet. The energy level prescribed for a patient will be based on an estimate of their initial maintenance energy needs minus 600&#x000a0;kcal/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].

Some of these programmes are available for patients to self-refer into, while others require a referral from a health care professional. Our investigation of determinants found that many health care professionals were not aware of the services on offer and how to refer patients to them. The intervention aims to provide health care professionals with an up to date list of the current services offered locally. In addition clear guidance on the referral pathway to local secondary services will also be given.</p><p>We will also ask each primary care team to designate a health care professional for their team to lead their management of overweight and obesity.
