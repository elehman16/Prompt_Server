Obviously, this can only give an efficacy analysis, since there is no control group, nor it is possible to know failures due to drop out.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>To present the prospective results of bracing patients affected by IS above 45&#x000b0; and still growing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Design is a prospective study including all IS patients with 45&#x000b0; or more, Risser 0-4, who had their first evaluation in our Institute from March 1st, 2003 to December 21st, 2010, and utterly deny any surgical intervention. Population: out of 59 patients, we excluded 2 still in treatment. 57 (11 males) were included, who at start of treatment had a mean of: 15.03&#x000b1;1.10 years of age, 52.5&#x000b0; Cobb (range 45-93&#x000b0;), and Risser 2 (0-4). Thirty-nine accepted a full-time brace treatment (BG) to try avoiding surgery, 18 served as controls (CG). Outcomes: radiographic and clinical data. Statistics: efficacy analysis in patients who completed treatment (38 in BG; 10 in CG; failures: surgery, progression 6&#x000b0; or more); intent-to-treat (failures also drop-outs). In CG, we had 8 patients not retrievable: they were considered as positive results (no progression or surgery) in the intent-to-treat analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Efficacy analysis: Failures were 23.5% in BG, and 100% in CG. Intent-to-treat: failures were 20.5% in BG and 55.6% in CG. The Relative Risks (RR) of failure in CG were 4.3 (95% Interval Confidence - IC95: 3.6-4.9) and 2.7 (IC95 2.0-3.5) respectively in the two analyses (P&#x0003c;0.05). Conversely, the RRs of improvement were 1.6 (IC95 1.46-1.9) and 1.9 (IC95 1.6-2.2) (P&#x0003c;0.05). Patients joining treatment achieved a 10.4&#x000b1;10.7&#x000b0; Cobb improvement, an ATR reduction of 4.2&#x000b1;4.3&#x000b0;, and an aesthetic improvement of 2.8&#x000b1;1.9 points (TRACE). At the end of treatment, 24 patients were below 45&#x000b0;, including 6 of below 35&#x000b0;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Through this study, we conclude that conservative brace treatment (if correctly performed and managed) is a suitable alternative for those patients who reject any surgical intervention for idiopathic scoliosis above 45&#x000b0;. Indeed, this treatment largely provides excellent results, and in most cases stabilises the curve, with a subsequent improvement of the Cobb degrees and TRACE levels.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Maniscalco</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>L</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Del Vecchio</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>D'ascola</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Savoini</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Pagliantini</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Vox</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Lusini</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Serra</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><source>Distal femoral fractures: mini-invasiveness vs open</source><year>2009</year><volume>XXXV</volume><issue>Supl.2</issue><publisher-name>GIOT</publisher-name><comment>Distal femoral fractures: mini-invasiveness vs open, vol.
