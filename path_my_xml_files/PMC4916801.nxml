Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that, when periodontal disease is uncontrolled, it can act as a crucial factor in tooth loss. The mainstay of prevention of periodontal disease is regular and adequate plaque control using personal oral hygiene protocol and periodic professional review and maintenance wherever indicated.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Though mechanical plaque control is the most effective oral hygiene measure, acceptable plaque removal requires time, motivation, and manual dexterity.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This in turn has led to a quest for chemotherapeutic agents that would inhibit plaque formation. A variety of products with antiplaque properties are a topic of current research. The mode of delivery for these chemical agents is diverse and includes toothpastes, chewing gum, irrigators, spray, varnishes, and mouthwashes.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Mouthwashes have proved to be a simple, safe, and effective delivery system, and in popularity are next only to toothpastes; mouthwashes have proven to play a vital role in plaque reduction.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Chemical agents such as chlorhexidine and triclosan are regularly used as mouth rinses and the later has also been used as an additive in dentifrices for the prevention of plaque formation and thereby gingivitis.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Chlorhexidine is a gold standard in preventing dental plaque formation. This broad-spectrum antibiotic, a cationic bis-biguanide is extensively used as an antiplaque agent.</p><p>Aloe vera, a cactus-like plant, belongs to the Lilaceae family. The core mucilaginous tissue of the Aloe vera leaf is used as a gel for treatment of multiple conditions such as sunburn, wounds, digestive tract disorders, and as a laxative. Pharmacological actions attributable to Aloe vera include antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>There is no published data available, to the best of authors' knowledge, that assesses antiplaque efficacy of Aloe vera where the study cohort has been recruited from the general population. Hence, this present study was conducted to compare and evaluate efficacy of Aloe vera mouthwash on clinical levels of dental plaque with established antiplaque agent of 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and placebo using the approach of 4-day plaque regrowth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was designed as a single blind, randomized, parallel, controlled clinical trial to comparatively evaluate the antiplaque efficacy of placebo, Aloe vera mouthwash, and 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash. The study recruited 90 participants (45 females and 45 males, with age ranging from 18 to 40 years, and mean age of 27.19 &#x000b1; 12.08 years).

Stained tongue and teeth and alteration of taste sensation are common side effects which limit their use for prolonged period. Chlorhexidine also has documented effects on vital tissues such as cytotoxicity to periodontal ligament (PDL) cells, altered mitochondrial activity, and inhibition of protein synthesis.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In recent times, there has been an increase in demand for alternative medicine.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Medicinal plants, such as Aloe vera, have natural phytochemicals and have proven to be better than synthetic drugs.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Studies by Khalessi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Parwani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] had suggested the better efficacy of herbal mouthwashes in maintaining plaque and gingival status. <italic>In vitro</italic> study on antimicrobial efficacy exposing supragingival plaque have found to have maximum effect at 100% concentration of Aloe vera.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In our study, 100% concentration of Aloe vera was used.</p><p>The present study is in compliance with the ideal mouth rinse protocol requirements given by Barnett.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] There was a significant decrease in PI scores at the 4<sup>th</sup> day in the control and test group. Chlorhexidine gluconate is effective against assorted microorganisms, such as Gram-positive organisms, Gram-negative organisms, yeasts, viruses, and fungi is known. However, there are few studies, mainly <italic>in vivo</italic> studies on microorganisms such as <italic>Streptococcus, Actinomyces viscosus</italic>, and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> to suggest antimicrobial effect of Aloe vera.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Thus, the low plaque score in our study shows antimicrobial efficacy of Aloe vera, as seen in the study by Chandrahas <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Aloe vera contains various anti-inflammatory agents such as carboxypeptidase, which reduce prostaglandin synthesis, magnesium lactate, which inhibits histidine decarboxylase preventing mast cell activity, sterols, and lupeol as pain modulators.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Aloe vera also reduces edema by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases blocking polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMNs) release, cyclooxygenase, and lipo-oxygenase pathways. These activated PMNs in turn inhibit free oxygen radicals.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] These suggest potential anti-inflammatory action of Aloe vera, which showed a decrease in the GI.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Both the control and test groups showed significant reductions in plaque scores (chlorhexidine 46%, Aloe vera, 44%) which are consistent with previous studies. Aloe vera use was not associated with any side-effect, and post-rinsing PI scores between control group and test group were also not statistically significant. This suggests that Aloe vera has a similar potential as chlorhexidine as far as antiplaque activity is concerned.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Shortcomings of this study are:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A 4-day plaque regrowth model is used for the first time which is insufficient to evaluate gingival scores</p></list-item><list-item><p>A cross-over design with wash-out period would have been more authenticating because it eliminates the bias of variable host response.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Therefore, future studies can be directed toward testing Aloe vera-based herbal mouthwash antiplaque and anti-gingivitis spectrum with a prolonged usage period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that Aloe vera mouth wash has an efficacy which is comparable to the antiplaque agent 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash. Considering the side effects associated with chlorhexidine, Aloe vera mouthwash can be considered as a viable alternative.
