disability worldwide and is a global health problem<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although stroke rehabilitation improves walking competency, 50% to
65% of stroke patients are left with functional impairments<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most patients are still
significantly disabled beyond 6 months after stroke, and do not return to social activities
within the community<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several methods can improve walking competency. Task-oriented practice performed at a high
intensity may enhance walking competency in people with stroke<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many randomized controlled trial studies<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, found circuit class training to be effective in improving walking
ability and postural control with standing, in patients after chronic stroke. A recent
meta-analysis suggested that circuit class therapy was safe improved mobility in people
after stroke, and reduced the length of hospital stay<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study designed task-oriented circuit training program to improve balance and gait
performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the task-oriented
circuit training on balance and gait ability in patients with subacute stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty subacute stroke patients were admitted as inpatients in the rehabilitation centres
from South Korea. This was a randomized clinical trial. Randomization was performed by
flipping a coin, and all subjects (n=30) were assigned to either the task-oriented circuit
training (n=15) or conventional therapy (n=15) group.</p><p>All subjects confirmed clinically by computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance
imaging. Inclusion criteria were: patients were within 6 months after stroke; presented the
ability to walk at least 10 meter alone or with an aid, but without standby assistance.
Exclusion criteria were: atrial fibrillation, uncontrolled hypertension, symptoms of
unstable cardiac disease, recent pulmonary embolism, and subacute systemic illness or
infection.</p><p>Informed consent was voluntarily obtained from all the subjects before participation in the
study, and this study was approved by the institutional human ethics committees, and written
informed consent was obtained from all subjects, before their participation.</p><p>Both the groups received neuro-developmental treatment (postural control exercise,
resistance exercise, and functional activity exercise) for approximately 1 hour per day. In
addition, they received some other therapies, including occupational and speech therapy, as
needed.</p><p>Subjects in the intervention group participated in a task-oriented circuit training at the
rehabilitation centre, for a total of 50 minutes, five times a week, for 4 weeks. The length
of intervention was 4 weeks, 5 sessions of weekly training, for a total of 20 sessions. All
training sessions were organized into groups, with at least 2&#x02013;3 people/group, and were
conducted by two physical therapists (with 3&#x02005;years of experience in stroke
rehabilitation).</p><p>Task-oriented circuit training program was modified according to the studies by Dean et
al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and Outermans et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> and incorporated 10 workstations. It
consisted of task-oriented activities for improving balance, walking competency, and
respiration ability. At all stations patients practiced for 3 minutes, and this session was
followed by a 1 minute transfer to the next station. And stretching time (5 minutes) was
offered before and after the exercise. The total exercise time was 50 minutes.</p><p>These core practice activities were: sit to stand; stepping; tandem standing; one leg
standing; and reaching; walking practice included obstacles, reaching, slope and stairs.
These core activities were individually adjusted for each subject by the treating therapist.
Progress was assessed as required, such that the level of difficulty, complexity, and dosage
(number of repetitions) matched the ability of each individual<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion was used to adjust
the effort intensity in order to maintain an &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; level<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Details about exercise intensity and/or repetitions performed at
each station were recorded for each participant.</p><p>The control group was performed through exercise focused on task-oriented exercise, such as
strengthening exercise (resistance exercise), standing balance (using varying methods), and
functional activities for gait improvement.</p><p>To determine the subjects&#x02019; balance and gait ability, we examined Berg Balance Scale (BBS),
Timed up and Go Test (TUG), Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) and 6 minute Walk Test
(6MWT).</p><p>In order to determine the walking ability and the level of endurance for FAC, the 6MWT was
conducted with participants wearing shoes and using their usual assistive devices such as
cane or ankle foot orthosis. FAC was calculated by according to the scores at their most
independent level (supervision or physical assistance required to ambulate) ranging from 0
to 5. The test is based on a walking distance of 15&#x02005;m and is performed with a cane<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. 6MWT is a clinically useful measure of
walking ability post stroke. It incorporates the important requirements for ambulation, such
as walking endurance, balance, and speed. It is performed at the fastest speed possible
during walking, which is individually determined, making it ideal for stroke survivors. It
measures the ability to walk for a maximum distance, within the 6 minute test duration.</p><p>Descriptive statistics was used in order to process the general characteristics of the
participants. The independent t-test was used to compare the demographic data and the
baseline characteristics of the two groups. The paired t-test was used to compare in-group
data before and after the intervention. Pre- and post-test differences in balance and gait
ability between the experimental group and the control group were compared using the
independent t-test. The statistical significance level was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Thirty subjects were included in each group for a total of 30 subjects. General

improved gait endurance in subacute stroke patients. More importantly, values for the
6-minute walk test showed significant improvements in the experimental group, when compared
to the control group. These changes represent the therapeutic effect of the task-oriented
circuit training for patients after subacute stroke.</p><p>The largest effect between group treatments during the four week intervention was found for
the 6-minute walk test. Our results are similar to the previous studies<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that circuit training increased the 6-meter walk
test results and also had a positive effect on the gait endurance in acute and chronic
stroke patients. Walking ability, as measured with the 6-minute walk test is associated with
a higher quality of life and is a good predictor for the walking capacity in these
patients<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Flansbjer et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that improvement on the distance
of the 6-minute walk test must exceed 13% in order to be clinically meaningful. Our findings
revealed that both groups significantly improved. While the experimental group averaged a
distance increase from 233.40&#x02005;m to 336.73&#x02005;m with a 44.27% increase, control group presented
a 26.17% increase. Significant difference in between-groups was identified for the 6-minute
walk test (p=0.01). This result might be due to adequate training as intensity and
frequency, with the use of progressive increase in task-oriented circuit training
program.</p><p>Although no significant difference in the variation of BBS, TUG, FAC were observed between
experimental and control groups, BBS, TUG, FAC were significantly showed pre- and
post-training within both groups. Therefore, task-oriented circuit training would benefit
the balance and gait ability in subacute stroke patient.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. First, the major limitation of this study was
the lack of follow-up. We could not assess whether the subjects in the experimental group
can maintain these changes. Therefore, we advised our patients to perform their
task-oriented exercises regularly. Second, our study included relatively small number of
subjects capable of independent 10 meter walk, not severity of stroke was measured.
Therefore, our findings might not be generalized to all stroke patients. However, our study
investigated the effect of the task-oriented circuit training on the pulmonary function.</p><p>Future studies should further extend this study in order to evaluate the missing insights.
In particular, a comparison with other treatment methods for improvement in pulmonary
function will be necessary.</p><p>These findings suggested that task-oriented circuit training could improve the gait ability
in patients with stroke. Therefore, task-oriented circuit training should be considered as
an essential part of the physical therapy program for subacute stroke patients. Furthermore,
continuous further studies on task-oriented circuit training program and intervention are
necessary in order to improve the gait ability and pulmonary function in patients with
stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bonita</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Mendis</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Truelsen</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal>et
