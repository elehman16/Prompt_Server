          <title>BACKGROUND:</title>
          <p>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between different
            target levels of glucose and the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing cardiac
            surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>METHODS:</title>
          <p>We designed a prospective study in a university hospital where 109 consecutive patients
            were enrolled during a six-month period. All patients were scheduled for open-heart
            surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were randomly allocated into two
            groups. One group consisted of 55 patients and had a target glucose level of
            80&#x02013;130 mg/dl, while the other contained 54 patients and had a target glucose
            level of 160&#x02013;200 mg/dl. These parameters were controlled during surgery and
            for 36 hours after surgery in the intensive care unit. Primary outcomes were clinical
            outcomes, including time of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care
            unit, infection, hypoglycemia, renal or neurological dysfunction, blood transfusion and
            length of stay in the hospital. The secondary outcome was a combined end-point
            (mortality at 30 days, infection or length of stay in the intensive care unit of more
            than 3 days). A p-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>RESULTS:</title>
          <p>The anthropometric and clinical characteristics of the patients from each group were
            similar, except for weight and body mass index. The mean glucose level during the
            protocol period was 126.69 mg/dl in the treated group and 168.21 mg/dl in the control
            group (p&#x0003c;0.0016). There were no differences between groups regarding
            clinical outcomes, including the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in
            the intensive care unit, blood transfusion, postoperative infection, hypoglycemic event,
            neurological dysfunction or 30-day mortality (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>CONCLUSIONS:</title>
          <p>In 109 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, both protocols
            of glycemic control in an intraoperative setting and in the intensive care unit were
            found to be safe, easily achieved and not to differentially affect clinical
          outcomes.</p>

      <p>An emerging body of medical literature has described the adverse consequences of
        hyperglycemia in a variety of different clinical contexts. Hyperglycemia occurs commonly
        among patients with acute neurological disease,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-10-oa-0107"

          ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-10-oa-0107">13</xref> Its development has been attributed to
        numerous stress, counter regulatory, and iatrogenic factors.<xref ref-type="bibr"
          rid="b14-10-oa-0107">14</xref> A review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-10-oa-0107"
        >15</xref> of 1,826 patients admitted to adult medical-surgical intensive care units (ICU)
        demonstrated a strong association between increasing glucose levels during ICU admission and
        risk of mortality. The lowest hospital mortality occurred among patients with mean glucose
        levels of 80 to 100 mg/dl during their ICU stay; the rate of hospital mortality increased
        dramatically for every 20 mg/dl increment above this normal level.</p>
      <p>There are relatively few studies in the literature reporting improved outcomes with control
        of blood glucose in the acute setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-10-oa-0107"
          >16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-10-oa-0107">19</xref> A landmark
        randomized, controlled study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-10-oa-0107">18</xref> performed
        in a surgical ICU included 1,548 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, 63% of whom had
        undergone cardiac surgery. The study demonstrated a significant reduction in ICU mortality,
        reduced from 8.0% to 4.6%, and impressive reductions in numerous organ system dysfunctions
        with an intensive regimen that targeted euglycemia. In addition to saving lives, intensive
        insulin therapy largely prevented several critical illness-associated complications. The
        incidences of critical illness polyneuropathy, bloodstream infections, acute renal failure
        and anemia were reduced.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-10-oa-0107">18</xref></p>
      <p>In 2006, after the first surgical study, a second large, prospective, randomized controlled
        trial by the Leuven group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-10-oa-0107">20</xref> was published
        on the effects of tight glycemic control in adult patients admitted to the medical ICU.
        In-hospital mortality of the intention-to-treat population of 1200 medical ICU patients was
        reduced, although not significantly. The lack of significance was not surprising, as the
        study was not statistically powered for this endpoint. In the target group of long-stay
        patients, maintaining normoglycemia significantly reduced in-hospital mortality from 52.5%
        to 43.0% (<italic>P</italic>=0.009). Morbidity was significantly reduced in the
        intention-to-treat group when they received intensive insulin therapy, where this reduction
        was even more striking in the target group. Patients were less dependent on prolonged
        mechanical ventilation and were discharged earlier from the ICU and hospital. In the
        subgroup of long-stay ICU patients, intensive insulin therapy also prevented newly acquired
        kidney injury, reduced the incidence of hyperinflammation and reduced the incidence of
        critical illness polyneuropathy or myopathy.</p>
      <p>Questions have been raised about the efficacy of this technique in general and in specific
        subgroups. Additional issues include the safety of intensive insulin therapy with regard to
        the potential harm of brief hypoglycemic episodes and of high-dose insulin
          administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-10-oa-0107">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-10-oa-0107">24</xref> In a recent study, the prospective,
        randomized, multicenter VISEP (Efficacy of Volume Substitution and Insulin Therapy in Severe
        Sepsis) trial was designed as a four-arm study to assess the choice of fluid resuscitation
        and the efficacy and safety of intensive insulin therapy in patients with severe sepsis and
        septic shock. Mortality and organ dysfunction were utilized as outcome parameters.<xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-10-oa-0107">25</xref> The insulin arm of the study was stopped
        prematurely because the rate of hypoglycemia in the intensive treatment group was considered
        unacceptably high (12.1%).</p>
      <p>Data provided by recently completed trials reveal that we should regard tight glucose
        control during cardiac surgery as experimental and confine its use to clinical trials.<xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-10-oa-0107">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-10-oa-0107"
          >25</xref> In light of this suggestion, we aimed to investigate whether different targets
        of intraoperative and postoperative glucose (80&#x02013;130 mg/dl, 4.4&#x02013;7.2
        mEq/l or 160&#x02013; 200 mg/dl, 8.8&#x02013;11.1 mEq/l) could affect postoperative
        clinical outcomes after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.</p>

        <title>Patient Selection</title>
        <p>The study was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial performed in the operating room
          and in the cardiac surgical intensive care unit (ICU). The protocol of glycemic control
          was modified from data provided in the literature<xref ref-type="bibr"
            rid="b18-10-oa-0107">18</xref> and was approved by the Institution Ethics and Scientific
          Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from patients a day before the surgery.</p>
        <p>Over a period of 12 months, 300 patients were submitted to cardiac surgery at InCor
          &#x02013; Heart Institute. Of these 300 patients, 191 were excluded; 39 patients due
          to renal failure, 116 patients because they required inotropic support and 36 patients
          because of emergency surgery. One&#x02013;hundred-nine patients scheduled for
          open-heart surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) were enrolled. The patients were
          randomized into two groups through a lottery system. The first group was named the
          &#x0201c;treated group&#x0201d; (intensive protocol), with a target glucose level
          between 80&#x02013;130mg/dl. The second group was the &#x0201c;control
          group&#x0201d; (less intensive), with a target glucose level between
          160&#x02013;200 mg/dl. In the latter case, infusion of insulin was initiated only if
          blood glucose levels exceeded 200 mg/dl. Continuous intravenous regular insulin was used
          to control glucose levels (regular insulin, U100, Biobr&#x000e1;s, Montes Claros,
          Brazil) when protocol criteria were met, using an infusion device.</p>
        <p>The study group included adults from both genders who were older than 21 years of age and
          who were undergoing open-heart cardiac surgery with CPB. The exclusion criteria included:
          (1) renal failure (creatinine&#x0003e;1.5 g/dl), (2) neurological dysfunction
          (diagnosis from medical records), (3) chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (CPOD), (4)
          current use of any type of antibiotic, (5) current use of inotropic support, (6) emergency
          and urgent surgeries and (7) reoperations.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Protocol for glycemic control</title>
        <p>At the beginning of the study, all patients were kept in intraoperative rooms and were
          started on intravenous glucose (8&#x02013;12 g/hr), which was maintained for the first
          24 hours after arrival in the ICU. After 24 hours, patients started a standardized feeding
          schedule, intended to deliver 20&#x02013;30 nonprotein
            calories&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;24
          hrs<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> with a balanced composition (0.13&#x02013;0.26 g
            nitrogen&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;24
          hrs<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 20&#x02013;40% of nonprotein calories as lipids) of
          enteral feeding. All of the patients were able to receive enteral feeding after surgery.
          Parenteral nutrition was not prescribed for any patients in the study. Patients were
          randomly assigned to either intensive or conventional insulin treatment. Adjustment of the
          insulin dose was based on the measurements of whole blood glucose in undiluted arterial
          blood every one to four hours, using a glucose analyzer (ABL700, Radiometer Medical A/S,
          Copenhagen, Denmark). The dose was adjusted by the intensive care nurses according to a
          titration algorithm (Leuven modified), as stipulated below. These insulin doses were
          approved by a study physician not involved in the clinical care of the patients. The
          nurses were advised to consider the titration algorithm as a directive rather than strict
          numerical instructions.</p>
        <p>Insulin was given exclusively by continuous intravenous infusion through a central venous
          catheter using an infusion device (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany). The standard
          concentration was 100 IU of Actrapid HM (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark) in 100 mL of
          0.9% NaCl. Prepared solutions, which were stable for up to 12 hrs when kept at
          &#x0003c;25&#x000b0;C, were not to be used beyond that time. Whole blood glucose
          levels were measured on site in undiluted arterial blood. Undiluted samples were obtained
          by removing at least four times the flush volume in the arterial catheter between the
          sampling point and the arterial puncture site before the actual sample was taken. During
          the intraoperative period and during the first 24 hours after admission to the ICU,
          measurement of blood glucose was advised every one to two hours until the targeted level
          of blood glucose was achieved. Thereafter, blood glucose was measured every four hours,
          unless dramatic decreases or increases in the blood glucose level occurred. In these
          cases, hourly control was performed after each dose adjustment.</p>
        <p>Adequate administration of the prescribed nutrients was emphasized. Intravenous
          glucose-containing solutions were administered by an infusion pump to avoid fluctuation of
          blood glucose levels and frequent adjustment of the insulin dose. At the time of planned
          interruptions of feeding, the insulin dose was proportionately reduced to avoid
          hypoglycemia. Hence, in a patient receiving total enteral nutrition, insulin was virtually
          stopped during the twice daily, two-hour interruptions of tube feeding. In some patients,
          however, including those with diabetes and those requiring insulin before ICU admission, a
          low maintenance dose was needed during that time. At the time of patient transportation to
          an investigation or to the operating room for surgery, all intravenous and enteral
          administration of feeding was halted, and insulin infusion was temporarily discontinued.
          The blood glucose level was measured to ensure that it was adequate before transport.
          Whenever a patient was extubated and allowed to initiate a limited intake of oral foods,
          the intravenous or tube feeding was usually reduced to allow the patient&#x02019;s
          appetite to return. The insulin dose was proportionately reduced and often temporarily
          discontinued.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Initiation of Insulin Infusion and Initial Stabilization of Blood Glucose Level</title>
        <p>When the blood glucose level exceeded 130 mg/dl, insulin was started at 2 IU/hr (4 IU/hr
          if the first blood glucose level exceeded 220 mg/dl). When the next blood glucose reading
          was &#x0003e;150 mg/dL, the insulin dose was increased by 1&#x02013;2 IU/hr. When
          the subsequent blood glucose level was 110&#x02013;140 mg/dl, insulin was increased by
          0.5 to 1 IU/hr. When blood glucose approached 80&#x02013;110 mg/dl, insulin was
          adjusted by 0.1 to 0.5 IU/hr. When the blood glucose level was 80&#x02013;110 mg/dl,
          the insulin dose was unaltered.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Dose Adjustments After Initial Stabilization</title>
        <p>Dose adjustments were always proportionate to the observed change in blood glucose. When
          blood glucose decreased by &#x0003e;50%, the dose of insulin was reduced to half, and
          the blood glucose level was checked within the next hour. When blood glucose was
          60&#x02013;80 mg/dl, insulin was reduced depending on the previous blood glucose
          level, and the blood glucose level was checked again within the next hour. When blood
          glucose was 40&#x02013;60 mg/dl, insulin infusion was stopped, an adequate baseline
          glucose intake was ensured, and the blood glucose level was checked within the next hour.
          When the blood glucose was &#x0003c;40 mg/dl, insulin infusion was stopped, an
          adequate baseline glucose intake was ensured, glucose was administered via 10 g
          intravenous boluses, and the blood glucose level was checked within the next hour. When
          blood glucose started to decrease within the normal range in a stable patient, recovery of
          insulin sensitivity was assumed, and the insulin dose was reduced by 20%. Additional blood
          glucose controls were advised whenever changes in body temperature or infection
        occurred.</p>

        <title>Initiation and Dose Adjustment of Insulin Infusion</title>
        <p>As soon as the blood glucose level exceeded 200 mg/ dl, insulin infusion was initiated at
          an initial dose of 1 IU/ hr. When a control blood glucose level was &#x0003e;200
          mg/dl, the insulin dose was increased by increments of 1 IU/hr. Once the blood glucose
          level was between 180 and 200 mg/dl, the insulin dose was maintained constant. When the
          blood glucose level decreased to &#x0003c;180 mg/dl, insulin infusion was decreased
          until the blood glucose level was between 180 and 200 mg/dl. The insulin dose was further
          reduced and eventually stopped completely when blood glucose levels decreased further.
          Insulin infusion was returned when blood glucose exceeded 200 mg/dl.</p>

        <title>Intraoperative and ICU Management</title>
        <p>Surgical and anesthesia management did not differ from routine care. All patients were
          given oral midazolam at 0.5 mg/kg as premedication (maximum 15 mg), general anesthesia
          with propofol (dose depending on hemodynamics), 0.5&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;g/kg
          sufentanil, 0.5 mg/kg atracurium and isoflurane titrated to a hemodynamic effect. In
          accordance with the routine protocol, 20 mg/ kg methyilprednisolone (maximum 1 g) was
          given after induction of anesthesia. The use of inotropic support was dependent on
          patients&#x02019; needs. The threshold for a red blood cell blood transfusion was a
          hematocrit of less than 30%. Second generation cephalosporin was given as prophylaxis
          before sternotomy and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), per hospital protocol.
          Antifibrinolytic therapy with aminocaproic acid was used as needed according to
          institutional protocol. Lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution was used to increase the
          volume. Cardiopulmonary bypass temperature depended on the type of surgery and varied from
          profound to mild hypothermia. Hematocrit, before and after CPB, was set above 30% and,
          during CPB, between 23&#x02013;25%.</p>
        <p>All subjects who met criteria for the study started glucose control after arrival in the
          operating room, immediately after standard monitoring, anesthesia induction and tracheal
          intubation. They were subsequently examined every hour until the end of the operation.
          Then, on admittance to the ICU, hourly glucose control resumed until glucose levels
          stabilized, and at that time, glucose control was performed every 2 hours for 36 hours.
          The glucose level was determined in blood samples and measured by a glucose meter (Accu
          Check Advantage, Roche, Manheim, Germany), which proved to be precise and exact when
          handled by trained personnel.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-10-oa-0107">26</xref></p>

        <p>Primary outcomes were clinical outcomes, which included the duration of mechanical
          ventilation from the operation room until extubation in the intensive care unit (ICU), the
          length of stay in the ICU, occurrence of infection (diagnosis of pneumonia, urinary tract
          infection, sepsis, septic shock, wound infection, blood stream infection, catheter
          infection), occurrence of hypoglycemia (glucose level &#x02264;50 mg/dl), renal
          dysfunction (characterized as an increase in the level of creatinine higher than 50% of
          the baseline value), neurological dysfunction (diagnosis by hospital neurologist who was
          blinded to the protocol), red blood cell transfusion during the first 30 days after
          surgery, the length of stay in the hospital and mortality by 30 days after surgery. We
          contacted patients by telephone and used a standardized telephone survey at 30 days after
          surgery to assess outcomes that occurred after discharge. The physicians and nurse who

      <p>The results of this study are presented in tables and figures with mean age and standard

        study; five of them required a second operation due to bleeding, three had hemodynamic
        instability that required an aortic balloon, and three had serious ventricular tachycardia
        that required electric shock. Ninety-eight patients were enrolled in this study, including
        fifty-one in the control group and forty-seven in the treated group.</p>
      <p>Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and sixty-six were diagnosed as
        non-diabetic. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-10-oa-0107">Table 1</xref> shows the
        anthropometric characteristics of the patients in both groups. The control and treated
        groups were comparable with respect to age, gender and height, but the treated group was
        slimmer and had a lower body mass index (BMI).</p>
      <p>There were some slight differences in the treated and control groups related to the
        classification of physical status by the ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists). In the
        control arm of the study, 86.3% of the patients were P4 and, in the treated arm, 70.2% of
        the patients were P4. After applying the risk evaluation for cardiac surgical patients from
          EuroSCORE&#x000ae;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-10-oa-0107">27</xref> and from
        Canadian research,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-10-oa-0107">28</xref> no differences were
        found between the two groups. The same results were obtained when the risk evaluation from
        Bernstein and Parsonnet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-10-oa-0107">29</xref> was applied
          (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-10-oa-0107">Table 1</xref>). Glucose level, total
        cholesterol, hematocrit and triglycerides before surgery were similar between the two
        studied groups. Although similar, clearance of creatinine in both groups was mildly lower
        than the normal range (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-10-oa-0107">Table 1</xref>). The type
        of surgical procedure is described on <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-10-oa-0107">Table

      <p>Neither the type of surgery, duration of surgery or the CPB time was different between the
        two study groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-10-oa-0107">Tables 3</xref>). The use of
        antifibrinolytics until extubation in the ICU also showed no statistically significant
        differences between the two groups; the duration of use ranged from 10 hours to 15 minutes
        in the control group and 10 hours to 55 minutes in the treated group. In relation to the
        length of stay in the ICU, both groups were comparable, with 5.9 days for the control group
        and 4.1 days for the treated group (p=0.481).</p>
      <p>The mean glucose level during the protocol period was 126.69 (&#x000b1; 10.82) mg/dl in
        the treated group and 168.21 (&#x000b1; 28.29) in the control group. These results were
        statistically different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-10-oa-0107">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>The intensively treated patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-10-oa-0107">Table
        4</xref>) received higher total and daily doses of insulin compared to the control group
        (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p>
      <p>Clinical outcomes were not different between the two groups. Primary and secondary outcomes
        were parallel (p&#x0003e;0.05). The duration of intubation from anesthetic induction was
        also quite similar in both groups (p=0.831).</p>
      <p>Both groups were comparable regarding the use of allogeneic blood. Four units of packed red
        cells were used in the control group in comparison with 3.5 units in the treated group
        (p=0.20), as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-10-oa-0107">Table 5</xref>. The rate of
        hypoglycemia, which was considered to be the ratio of the hypoglycemic episodes per number
        of glucose measurements (2.1% in the control group and 2.9% in the intensive group, p=0.67),
        was similar between the groups.</p>
      <p>Although 35.3% of the patients from the control group and 19.2% of the patients from the
        treated group had a postoperative infection, this difference did not reach statistical
        significance (p=0.11). <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-10-oa-0107">Table 5</xref> describes
        the documented infections. Respiratory tract infections were the most common infection, and
        both groups had the same frequency of this type of infection. There were no cases of septic
        shock, catheter infection or bloodstream infection. Renal dysfunction occurred in 9.8% of
        the patients from the control group and 6.4% of the patients from the treated group, without
        any statistically significant difference (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t6-10-oa-0107">Table

      <p>No differences between groups were found concerning neurological dysfunction. A neurologist
        blinded to the protocol examined all of the patients and detected neurological dysfunction
        in 9.8% of the patients in the control group and 2.1% in the treated group. The length of
        stay in the hospital was slightly different between the two groups, with the control group
        staying 17 days compared to 12 days for the treated group. However, this difference was not
        statistically significant. Finally, the survival rate was examined as the principal
        end-point at postoperative day 30, and the results were not different between groups
        (p=0.71), as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t7-10-oa-0107">Table 7</xref>.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The main results of our study demonstrate that there are no significant differences between
        our two groups, the intensively treated (glucose level of 80&#x02013;130 mg/dl) and the
        control (glucose level of 160&#x02013;200 mg/dl). Specifically, we examined the duration
        of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in the ICU and hospital, the incidence of
        postoperative infection, required units of blood for transfusions, incidence of renal
        dysfunction, presence of neurological dysfunction and number of deaths within 30 days after
        the operation.</p>
      <p>Patients from both groups were comparable with regard to age, gender and height, but they
        differed in weight and body mass index. In addition, there were no differences between the
        control and treated groups for physical status (ASA), as well as Canadian and
        EuroSCORE&#x000ae; indices of risk. Diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity are considered
        risk factors in cardiac surgeries only in the score index proposed by Bernstein and
        Parsonnet; both groups were similar considering these co-morbidities.</p>
      <p>The regular use of methylprednisolone, administered as a single dose after anesthetic
        induction, is justified by some studies to attenuate the inflammatory response to CPB.<xref

        >30</xref> It is likely that methylprednisolone contributed to additional elevation of serum
        glucose levels in our patients. The examined groups did not show any differences concerning
        intraoperative variables, including duration of surgery, length of CPB and usage of
        antifibrinolytic.</p>
      <p>The results of our study are different from those of other recent. These differences could
        be explained by the different populations examined and/or by the methodological design.<xref

        patients included in our series were scheduled for elective surgeries; therefore, emergency
        surgeries, patients with renal dysfunction and patients using inotropic support were
        excluded from this study. These same exclusion factors did not apply to patients in the
        studies by Van den Berghe et al. and Krinsley et al.<xref ref-type="bibr"

        studies included surgical and clinical ICU patients, most of whom had post-operative
        complications or decompensate clinical diseases. Another possible reason for the lack of
        statistical significance in results from the two groups in the present study is the
        relatively limited duration of glucose control, since it was maintained only during surgery
        and for 36 hours in the ICU. Studies which demonstrated a benefit from strict control of the
        glucose level on outcomes included protocols with durations longer than 5 days.<xref

      <p>Hyperglycemia is common in intensive care unit patients, and the severity of hyperglycemia
        has been repeatedly associated with adverse outcomes of a variety of illnesses, including
        critical illnesses. Traditionally, insulin is not administered until blood glucose exceeds
        180&#x02013;200 mg/ dl, based on the rationale that such mild increases are not
        deleterious, and tighter control might be complicated by life-threatening hypoglycemia. In
        2001, a large, randomized, controlled study revealed that intensive insulin therapy to
        maintain normal blood glucose levels (&#x0003c;110 mg/dl) saved lives and prevented
        debilitating and expensive complications in a predominantly surgical ICU population.<xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-10-oa-0107">18</xref> This study was followed with a publication
        by Krinsley et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-10-oa-0107">19</xref> who reported that
        when intensive insulin therapy is implemented in real-life intensive care situations, the
        benefits on morbidity and mortality are largely reproduced. The subsequent randomized,
        controlled study of intensive insulin therapy in a very ill medical ICU population, with a
        high co-morbidity and a high risk of death, confirmed the morbidity benefits and, when blood
        glucose control was continued for at least three days, reduced mortality.<xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-10-oa-0107">20</xref> Hence, since the 2001 publication, which
        has been strongly supported by other more recent studies, many centers have initiated blood
        glucose control in their ICUs.</p>
      <p>Recent reports question whether this protocol fits all patients and if consequent
        hypoglycemia, which is the risk of controlling blood glucose with insulin, could have a
        negative impact on patient outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-10-oa-0107"
          >22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-10-oa-0107">25</xref> Blood glucose
        control with insulin has an associated risk of hypoglycemia. In both of the studies
        mentioned above, hypoglycemia occurred more frequently in patients who did not survive.
        However, as hypoglycemia was associated with mortality in both insulin therapy groups, it
        remained unclear whether this association was causal. Fears of hypoglycemia and its imagined
        consequences, based on deeply rooted emotional beliefs rather than evidence, explain why
        hypoglycemia is often considered more dangerous than hyperglycemia in the critically ill.
        Hypoglycemia is generally arbitrarily defined as blood glucose &#x0003c;50 mg/dl with
        neuroglycopenic symptoms or &#x0003c;40 mg/dl in the absence of symptoms. In the ICU,
        however, sedation may mask symptoms of neuroglycopenia, and counter-regulatory responses may
        be impaired, which complicates the diagnosis of hypoglycemia in this setting. Thus, the
        clinical relevance of a brief hypoglycemic episode, independent of illness severity, remains
          unclear.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-10-oa-0107">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr"
          rid="b33-10-oa-0107">33</xref></p>
      <p>In our study, hypoglycemia occurred in 2.1% of the control group and in 2.9% of patients
        from the treated group, with no statistical difference between groups. There were no cases
        of neurological sequelae of hypoglycemia, which suggests that the protocol was safe in this
        population.</p>
      <p>One important point that deserves discussion is the fact that 11 patients were lost to
        follow-up, which may have biased the results.</p>
      <p>Vriesendorp et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-10-oa-0107">34</xref> assessed the effect
        of incidental hypoglycemia on outcomes of critically ill patients. The risk of hypoglycemia
        with this regimen was 6.9%. They studied a total of 302 patients. Matching of cases and
        controls was performed for age, sex, severity of illness, and duration of ICU stay before
        the hypoglycemic event. They found no association between hypoglycemia and early (within
        five days of the event) or late (hospital) mortality. The data reported by Vriesendorp et
        al. suggest against using the risk of hypoglycemia as a reason to avoid intensive insulin
        therapy. The prospective, randomized, multicenter VISEP (volume substitution and insulin
        therapy in severe sepsis) trial was designed as a four-arm study to assess the choice of
        fluid resuscitation and the efficacy and safety of intensive insulin therapy in patients
        with severe sepsis and septic shock, using mortality and organ dysfunction as outcome
          variables.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-10-oa-0107">24</xref> The insulin arm of this
        study was stopped prematurely because the rate of hypoglycemia in the intensive treatment
        group (12.1%) was considered unacceptably high. In our study, we had a low rate of
        hypoglycemia that was similar between groups (2.9% in treated group vs. 2.1% in control
        group, p=0.67), and these results can be explained in part by the acquired glucose levels
        (126.69 (&#x000b1; 10.82) mg/dl in the treated group and 168.21 (&#x000b1; 28.29)
        mg/dl in the control group). Consequently, it is possible to assume that the use of this
        protocol may be safe in patients undergoing open-heart surgeries, although the glucose
        levels remain higher than classical recommendations, which could explain our results. This
        study, which applied less intensive glycemic control, had good outcomes and did not result
        in excess hypoglycemia. This data contrasts with those from a recent study<xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-10-oa-0107">35</xref> which showed that strict intraoperative
        glycemic control (glucose levels between 80 and 100 mg/dl) is associated with higher rates
        of death and stroke.</p>
      <p>Several recent studies clearly identify the development of hyperglycemia as an important
        risk factor for mortality and morbidity of critically ill patients. In patients undergoing
        cardiac surgery, hyperglycemia has been associated with a substantial mortality risk and
        delayed extubation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-10-oa-0107">36</xref> Intraoperative
        hyperglycemia seemed to be an independent risk factor for adverse outcome after cardiac
          surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-10-oa-0107">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-10-oa-0107">42</xref> Furthermore, hyperglycemia was associated
        with an increased risk of death in patients with myocardial infarction and also in patients
        with risk of congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock.<xref ref-type="bibr"
          rid="b38-10-oa-0107">38</xref> From the predictive value of hyperglycemia for decreased
        survival of patients with a severe brain injury, a significant relationship was found
        between high blood glucose levels and impaired neurological status, weakened pupil
        reactivity, intracranial hypertension and a longer hospital stay.<xref ref-type="bibr"

        addition, a strong link has been described between increased blood glucose levels and the
        risk of critical illness polyneuropathy in sepsis and the systemic inflammatory response
          syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-10-oa-0107">44</xref> Results of multiple-center
        trials on tight blood glucose control in the critically ill and of studies on the most
        optimal level of blood glucose for different patient populations are still lacking. While we
        await those results, the current evidence, largely provided by the two Leuven trials and the
        implementation study by Krinsley, is in favor of controlling blood glucose levels in the
        ICU. Indeed, these studies showed that many lives were saved with this intervention, despite
        a higher prevalence of hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia is deleterious for critically ill
        patients. Dr. Vriesendorp and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-10-oa-0107">34</xref>
        have now shown that incidental, brief episodes of hypoglycemia, when rapidly recognized and
        appropriately treated, are not likely to cause serious harm.</p>
      <p>To safely target normoglycemia in ICU patients, intensivists and ICU nurses alike anxiously
        await accurate, continuous blood glucose sensors. This vital tool should be added to the
        bedside monitor, with appropriate alarms and trends to facilitate safe implementation of
        insulin therapy. Ideally, a closed-loop computerized system with an accurate continuous
        sensor and an insulin pump linked via an automated algorithm will conserve precious nursing
          time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-10-oa-0107">44</xref> Such devices are not yet
        available, and systems that are commercially available and perform relatively well for
        patients with diabetes do not work for critically ill patients. It is hoped that validated
        systems will become available soon and find their way to the ICU. In this study, we used a
        glucose meter that is widely available in ICUs world-wide.</p>
      <p>Although this pilot study showed no difference in clinical outcomes among the two study
        groups, the sample size was not large enough to allow for any definite conclusions or
        recommendations on the effect of strict glucose control versus less intensive control.
        However, the sample size is sufficient to address the following important questions. Who are
        the patients that really benefit from strict glucose control? What is the safest protocol
        regarding hypoglycemic events? Do the patients improve with glucose control or solely
        because of the improved care included in the protocols? Our study showed that in a
        population of 109 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, both
        protocols are safe, can be easily achieved and do not differ regarding clinical outcomes.
        However, due to the small study sample, a clinically relevant effect in the population could
        not be excluded.</p>
