Many surveys continue to report &#x0201c;hypertension control&#x0201d; rates without considering CVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the new concept remains unfamiliar in family practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Hypertension control in the relevant target group with manifest CVD or otherwise high CVR remains poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], despite improvements in some countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A recent Cochrane review on interventions used to improve control of blood pressure in patients with hypertension found that &#x0201c;none of the included RCTs attempted to manage hypertension in the context of overall cardiovascular risk&#x0201d;, concluding that &#x0201c;future studies need to be congruent with hypertension guidelines that recommend treatment and control of blood pressure in combination with multi-factorial risk reduction&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>If physicians are to consider global CVR before recommending anti-hypertensive treatment, they need to assess and discuss it with their patients.

However, little is known about the effects of this &#x0201c;double paradigm shift&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] toward global CVR and shared decision making on clinical outcomes. Only a few intervention studies addressing hypertension management in primary care with explicit consideration of global cardiovascular risk have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], of which only one measured CVR before and after the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The trial reported here evaluated the effect of a complex intervention in German General Practice, including an educational outreach visit, on global CVR of patients with known hypertension, compared to a simple intervention by mail.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>We report a prospective non-blinded longitudinal cluster-randomised intervention trial involving general practitioners and their patients with known hypertension.

Each GP was asked to enrol a consecutive sample of 40 patients with a known diagnosis of hypertension from his or her daily patient flow, regardless of the current cause for consultation. Other inclusion criteria were age (40-75 years) and continuity of care by the GP over at least 6&#x000a0;months. Emergency cases and patients expected to die within one year were excluded.</p><p>Ethical approval (No. 2715) was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the medical faculty of the University of D&#x000fc;sseldorf. Patient consent was deemed unnecessary by the Committee since we use anonymous data routinely collected by GPs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cluster randomisation</title><p>After enrolling the patients and recording of baseline data, GPs were cluster-randomised into 2 groups, A (complex intervention) and B (simple intervention). One GP (or one group practice with 1-3 GPs) represents a cluster, whereas the patients are the observation units.</p><p>To avoid the possibility that GPs familiar with the concept of global CVR were accidentally over-represented in either group, we asked them to estimate the CVR of each patient enrolled. This estimate was compared with the respective patients&#x02019; calculated CVR, and the GPs were divided into 2 groups according to whether their estimate was close to or far from the calculated CVR. &#x02018;Close to&#x02019; was assessed if the mean deviation of the estimated from the calculated CVR was below 0.5% and the mean absolute deviation was &#x0003c;0.75% (both values were near the median for all GPs). Thus, 45 GPs were defined as familiar and 44 as not familiar with global CVR. The resulting strata were used for a stratified randomization to balance the familiarity between random groups. Because of the necessity to randomise all GP&#x02019;s working in group practices into the same study group (A or B), stratified randomisation resulted in a higher imbalance (47 in A and 42 in B) than the otherwise expected 45 versus 44.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Baseline data and subgroups by CVR</title><p>A total of 3,523 patients were enrolled, the baseline data being given in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Of the latter, one would be at low risk (SCORE &#x0003c;5%), and one at high risk (&#x02265;5%). Discussion of the GPs&#x02019; respective patient cases included feedback elements, which served as concrete examples to demonstrate the paradigmatic changes of the CVR concept to the GP.

Sample size calculation was based on the assumption of a standard deviation of 0.44 for the CVR changes on the log-odds scale, an intra-class correlation of 0.2, and a proportion of 40% high risk patients in the total sample, the latter being derived from a pilot study of 330 patients cared for by 20 GPs.

Primary analysis included all randomized patients of the first (high CVR) subgroup with global CVR determinations at baseline (ITT population). In case of missing follow-up values, a LOCF (last-observation carried forward) was imputed, i.e. the baseline determination was imputed as follow-up determination. For the primary analysis, a 2-level random intercept model was fitted to the data with follow-up CVR as outcome, random group and CVR familiarity strata as fixed factors, baseline CVR as covariate and, with patients nested in physicians modeled as random effects. This hierarchical ANCOVA model takes the correlation structure resulting from cluster randomization into account and allows for differences between physicians in treatment effects. The primary analysis used the fixed effects contrast test that compares the mean follow-up CVR adjusted for baseline CVR between random groups. We report the estimated means with confidence limits, the group differences with confidence limits and p and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with corresponding p value. Effect modification by CVR familiarity of GP was tested by adding the corresponding interaction term to the hierarchical model. The reported p value results from the maximum likelihood test that compares the models with and without interaction term. If pre-post changes were to be analyzed subsequently, this was done for the random groups or for the total subpopulation with paired t tests for continuous outcomes or McNemar tests for binary outcomes.</p><p>As sensitivity analyses, calculations were repeated for the complete cases population and for a dataset with missing values imputed by an EM algorithm.</p><p>Secondary analyses involved only the complete cases. Analogous to the primary analysis, mixed models were fitted separately for the secondary endpoints in groups 1, 2 and 3. If the outcome was binary, the hierarchical ANCOVA model was replaced by a hierarchical logistic regression model with the corresponding factor, covariate and random part as in the ANCOVA models. As a post-hoc analysis, the pooled statin intervention effect was calculated across all types of patients.</p><p>Calculations used the last available versions of SPSS and STATA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Baseline information is presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

There was, however, a large and significant intervention effect on statin prescription rates in patients with manifest CVD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Interpretation of the results</title><p>The fact that our complex intervention did not have the intended greater effect than the simple (postal) intervention has several possible explanations relating to (i) the design of the interventions, (ii) other aspects of the study design, and (iii) the participating physicians and patients.</p><p>First, despite its complexity and strengths, our complex intervention may have been insufficient, especially in view of the deeply rooted beliefs and routines of GPs. Thus it needs to be modified if consideration of global CVR (and subsequently shared decision making in this area) replaces single risk factor management in the minds of doctors and patients.</p><p>Second, the observation period could also have been too short for a change in calculated CVR to occur, although we do not believe that the observed effect would have increased with time without further boosting of the intervention.</p><p>Third, it may be that patients were reluctant to comply with additional treatment efforts, and/or that the physicians were eventually not convinced by the new concept and unwilling to change their routines. On the level of GPs, familiarity with the concept of global CVR may have affected the intervention effect. Although the interaction test was not significant, the results suggest that the intervention might have been effective in a group of GPs not familiar with the concept of CVR. However, we had not taken into account stratification of GPs according to CVR knowledge for the estimation of the intervention effect, and the power of the study was insufficient to demonstrate an intervention effect in a specific subgroup. Thus, for clarification another trial focusing on this subgroup would be required.</p><p>While there was no group difference, both groups showed a significant reduction of CVR. This may have external and/or internal causes: External causes or secular trends include the introduction of disease management programs for coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus in Germany in 2002, both affecting primary care and setting incentives to improve CVR factor management. Also, the concept of considering global CVR is a subject directed at primary care physicians in some CME programs. Conceivable internal causes comprise: (1) an equally strong effect of both the complex (A) and simple (B) (postal) intervention; (2) an increased awareness for reducing CVR factors in both the simple and complex intervention group (Hawthorne effect) at the level of GPs and patients; (3) a regression to the mean effect of our baseline and follow-up measurements of both blood pressure and cholesterol; and (4) a reporting bias on the side of the physicians participating in the study in the sense of social expectancy. This study yielded no evidence for either of these explanations, but we believe that both the secular trend and an increased unspecific attention on the side of the participating physicians could account for much of the observed effect.</p><p>Among the secondary outcomes, we did find a large and significant intervention effect on statin prescription rates in patients with manifest CVD, and a moderate intervention effect that just missed significance in patients with low CVR, but no such effect in patients with high CVR. The increased statin prescription rate in patients with manifest CVR is congruent with our recommendation to rigorously lower CVR in these patients, and thus seems in line with our complex (peer) intervention. Perhaps this particular, straightforward (and familiar) component of the intervention message was received by the GPs most strongly. On the other hand, the (albeit just not significant) moderate intensification of statin treatment in patients with low CVR, and the absence of a group difference in statin prescriptions for patients with high CVR do not add up to a comprehensible effect in the sense of our intervention with regard to evidence-based treatment in primary prevention, nor can we provide an alternative explanation. The significant increase of statin prescriptions in the pooled analysis suggests an increase of general awareness of GPs concerning other cardiovascular risk factors apart from blood pressure.</p><p>Finally, intraclass (intracluster) correlations (ICC) are a measure of the variability between patients of different GPs in relation to the variability of all patients. The high ICC values seen for ASS and Statin reflects the dependency introduced by the GP of prescribing it in most patients or not prescribing it in any. However, with considerable variability between GPs in medication rates, hypertension control or smoking, the variability with CVR was very small in both groups. It seems that the GPs of both groups go different ways in treating their patients, but agree in the goal of CVR reduction in patients with high CVR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Study findings in the context of other research</title><p>Traditionally, trials aimed at better management of arterial hypertension are designed to improve blood pressure control, regardless of global cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. There are few papers available on the implementation of the concept of global CVR in general, and of the use of cardiovascular risk tables in particular, in the management of arterial hypertension in the family-practice setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Few intervention studies have addressed hypertension management in general practice that explicitly consider global cardiovascular risk, and to our knowledge ours is the first to be designed to primarily demonstrate a change in calculated CVR.</p><p>One study, however, did calculate CVR before and after the intervention as a secondary outcome; it found, like ours, a small positive effect of both a simple and a complex intervention, i.e. patient encouragement to change lifestyles by means of a nurse-led cardiovascular management strategy, but no superiority of the complex intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A second study found positive effects of using decision-aids - such as electronic or paper-based CVR calculators facilitating shared decision-making between physicians and patients on patients&#x02019; satisfaction and involvement - without negative effects on the calculated CVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>An intervention trial, including the training of physicians in using a guideline and a decision support tool, did not have the intended effect on GP performance, or patients&#x02019; self-reported lifestyle and risk-perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The authors suggest that improvements in the management of global CVR may have positive effects especially in high risk patients who were not included in their study. However, our study that included high risk patients (albeit in a different setting) does not confirm this assumption.</p><p>Thus, while there is a strong scientific consensus that the concept of treating cardiovascular risk rather than single risk factors ought to be implemented in primary care, including greater patient involvement and shared decision-making, there is very little understanding of how this could be undertaken and little evidence of successful models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title><p>The prominent strengths of this study include the high number of participating primary care physicians and patients, and the cluster-randomized design that minimizes the risk of selection bias at the level of physicians. The multifaceted and thorough design of the complex peer-intervention is also a strength, even if eventually it proved ineffective.</p><p>Our study has also methodological limitations. The selected regions and GPs were chosen for convenience, which means that the results may not be fully representative of all German GPs. Despite our careful design, we cannot exclude a selection bias at the patient level, possibly due to non-adherence to the rules of consecutive patient enrolment on the side of the physicians. Furthermore, there could be a Hawthorne effect, i.e. that taking part in a study can be a relevant intervention itself both at the level of patients and GPs. This is a principle methodological bias of interventions in healthcare research.</p><p>Another possible limitation lies in our decision to compare the complex intervention not with usual care, but with a simple intervention as the control group. This is due to our pre-condition that the benefit of the complex, and therefore costly, intervention should only be found relevant if the benefit can be demonstrated against a less complex, cheaper intervention. In many GP settings, however, our simple intervention comes close to usual care, as guidelines are often posted to GPs. Systematic reviews of interventions to change professional practice show that passive dissemination of information has little or no effect on professional behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Finally, our analysis does not take into account the variability of follow-up-time (6 versus 9&#x000a0;months), and we cannot tell whether duration of follow-up was associated with any of the outcomes. Follow-up at 6 and 9&#x000a0;months occurred only at GP level, not at patient level, so the follow up data sets reflect cumulated, undated changes of medication, BP-levels, cholesterol-levels, smoking status etc. during the observation period of 6 or 9&#x000a0;months. Therefore, an analysis would not yield reliable results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treating patients with arterial hypertension according to their global CVR rather than to set value limits is a necessary change of paradigm in family practice. Few existing intervention trials have been able to demonstrate marked effects, and our study being the first designed to measure the effect of an intervention of physician peer-education on calculated patient CVR is no exception.</p><p>We conclude that our approach to implementing the concept of global CVR into primary care was probably not comprehensive and sufficiently sustainable to change deep-rooted traditional risk factor treatment, which is in accordance to the results of our embedded qualitative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Given that the concept of global CVR implies increased patient participation in treatment decisions, future research should identify outcome parameters that do take into account the informed choice of patients, even if the latter might not lead to a lower CVR.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BP</term><def><p>Blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p>Cardiovascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVR</term><def><p>Cardiovascular risk</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EM algorithm</term><def><p>Expectation&#x02013;maximization algorithm</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESC</term><def><p>European society of cardiology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LOCF</term><def><p>Last-observation carried forward</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled study</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCORE</term><def><p>Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>HHA, AM and JidS conceived of the study.
