balance, activities of daily living (ADL) performance, and self-efficacy in stroke
patients. Twenty patients with stroke were recruited from a hospital in Cheongju, Korea.
[Subjects] Ten of the subjects were assigned to an experimental group that participated in
the task-oriented training program, and the other 10 were assigned to a control group that
received traditional rehabilitation therapy. [Methods] In the two groups, balance was
measured with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), ADL performance with the Modified Barthel
Index (MBI), and self-efficacy with the Self-Efficacy Scale (SES), before and after 4
weeks of training. [Results] Comparative analysis of the experimental group&#x02019;s pretest and
post-test results showed statistically significant differences in the BBS, MBI, and SES
scores. There were also significant between-group differences in the BBS, MBI, and SES
scores. [Conclusion] The results suggest that a task-oriented training program can be an
effective intervention to improve balance ability, ADL performance, and self-efficacy in
stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Task-oriented training</kwd><kwd>Self-efficacy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The goal of stroke rehabilitation is to maximize the ability to walk independently and
improve activities of daily living (ADL)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
A reduction in balancing ability is one of the factors that adversely affect the ADL of
stroke patients with hemiplegia. In these patients, the center of the body cannot move to
the affected side, and tries to move to the unaffected side. As a result, patients with
hemiplegia cannot shift body weight symmetrically in response to motion, thereby reducing
balancing ability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. This leads to
asymmetric physical balance, with walking and voluntary movement deficiencies. A previous
study reported that task-oriented training significantly improved the balance and movement
ability of chronic stroke patients, compared to a control group<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. For hemiplegic stroke patients, the desire and motivation
to participate in treatment programs are closely related to the restoration of exercise
ability. Self-efficacy is an important precursor of health behavior. During the early
hospitalization period after a stroke, enhancing self-efficacy is associated with restoring
balance sense, exercise function, and walking ability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Self-efficacy refers to a person&#x02019;s belief in their ability to
overcome a crisis in life<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and to perform
a behavior or activity successfully. Task-oriented programs can be designed to enable people
to accomplish specific tasks or acquire specific beliefs, such as in the ability to control
one&#x02019;s disease<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and are important factors
in stroke rehabilitation. Such programs can improve the psychological and physical
well-being of stroke patients.</p><p>The task-oriented approach used in the present study includes problem solving and
functional tasks<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. A number of recent
studies have demonstrated the effects of task-oriented approaches<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, only a few studies have applied a step-by-step task
training program composed of ADL that the patient wants to accomplish.</p><p>In the present study, the patient rather than the therapist selected the tasks to be
included in training. The tasks were important to the patients in their ADL, and would have
a positive influence on the patient&#x02019;s sense of accomplishment or satisfaction. In addition,
the exercise level in the step-by-step training program was tailored to the patient&#x02019;s
ability, commencing with easy tasks and progressing to more difficult ones, according to the
level of accomplishment. We examined the influence of this program on balance and
self-efficacy in hemiplegic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects in this study were 20 stroke patients who were hospitalized and receiving
physical therapy from early July to the end of August 2013 at C hospital in
Chungcheongbuk-do province. Ten of the subjects were allocated to a task-oriented training
treatment group, and the other 10 to a general physical therapy control group. They were
randomly and equally assigned to the experimental group (4 males, 6 females) or control
group (4 males, 6 females). The mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) of the age, height, and
weight of the experimental group were 61.5&#x000b1;7.2&#x02005;years, 161&#x000b1;9.4&#x02005;cm, and 59.6.1&#x000b1;14.3&#x02005;kg. Four
of the patients had right hemiplegia, and six had left hemiplegia. The Korean mini-mental
state examination (K-MMSE)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> score was
26.5&#x000b1;1.8. The mean &#x000b1; SD of the age, height, and weight of the control group were
66.4&#x000b1;9.3&#x02005;years, 160&#x000b1;7.2&#x02005;cm, and 59.8&#x000b1;10.1&#x02005;kg. Four of the patients had right hemiplegia,
and six had left hemiplegia. The K-MMSE score was 26.0&#x000b1;1.4. The inclusion criteria for the
study were as follows: a diagnosis of hemiplegia due to stroke, a morbidity period of 6
months or more, a score of 25 points or more on the K-MMSE, Stage 2 or lower on the
Modified Ashworth Scale, an ability to understand the purpose of the study and follow
instructions, and agreement to participate in the study. All subjects provided written
informed consent prior to participation according to the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was used in the task selection. The
COPM uses a 10-point scale to rate the importance of individual tasks. Priority is placed
on five tasks, with the greatest importance placed on the patient&#x02019;s evaluation of the
outcomes of the training program<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Following an interview with each

The selected tasks comprised four stages. If the patient was unable to
complete the tasks in one week, they were repeated the following week. The participants
practiced the tasks five times a week for 4 weeks. In each 30-min session, the tasks were
performed three times for 10&#x02005;min, with a 2-min break between each task. The control group
received general physical therapy, including exercises aimed at improving gait ability and
balance, for 4 weeks, five times a week, with each session lasting 30&#x02005;min.</p><p>Balance ability was measured using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BBS is used clinically for patients with elderly or
hemiplegia resulting from a stroke to evaluate their balance ability during movement or in
a standing position. It consists of 14 items, each scored from 0 to 4, giving a total
maximum of 56.</p><p>The Modified Barthel Index (MBI) developed by Shah<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> was used to evaluate ADL. The ADL were divided into 10 detailed

required. The total possible score was 100.</p><p>The self-efficacy of the subjects was assessed with a modified version of the general
Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) developed by Sherer and Maddux<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> comprising 17 questions. Each question was assessed on a 5-point
scale, with a higher score denoting greater self-efficacy. The reliability of this scale

ADL, and self-efficacy of stroke patients. The task-oriented training program (experimental
group) was more effective in improving the balance, ADL, and self-efficacy of hemiplegic
stroke patients than the general physical therapy program (control group).</p><p>Comparison of the variation in the BBS scores of the experimental and control groups before
and after training revealed a significant difference. The variation in the experimental
group was greater than in the control group, with a measured difference of 1.8 points;
however, this did not reach 4.66, which was the minimal detectable change (MDC), i.e., the
minimum statistically significant variation<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The short duration of the training period may explain the
findings, with 4 weeks possibly being insufficient to affect balancing ability. Bayouk<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported significant improvements in 10-m
walking and balance (p&#x0003c;0.05) in chronic stroke patients who participated in an 8-week
task-oriented training program, including sensory inputs. Ahn<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that task-oriented training for chronic stroke patients
increased BBS scores significantly, from 30.5&#x000b1;2.3 to 32.9.&#x000b1;1.7. Nichols<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that balancing function was associated with ADL,
such as walking, getting dressed, and movement, and that balancing function was necessary
for the successful performance of these activities<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Comparison of the variation in the MBI before and after training revealed a score of
4.00&#x000b1;1.41 points for the experimental group and 2.00&#x000b1;1.41 for the control group, which was a
significant difference (p&#x0003c;0.05). These results may be explained by the fact that
task-oriented activities<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> replicating
real-life situations were used. These promote brain reorganization and cerebral
activation<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, and can maximize
functional performance. In addition, these results may reflect the fact that the tasks are
highly correlated<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> with balance and ADL
in stroke patients.</p><p>Comparison of variation in the SES scores before and after training revealed a score of
6.20&#x000b1;2.90 for the experimental group and 2.20&#x000b1;1.55 for the control group, which was a
significant difference (p&#x0003c;0.01). ADL and self-efficacy in stroke patients are highly
correlated (r=0.698, p=0.000)<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the
improvement in self-efficacy in the present study may be associated with the improvement in
ADL. The increase in self-efficacy may also be due to the motivational nature of the
training, using patient-selected goal-setting and tasks. In addition, it is likely that by
encouraging and praising the subjects as they progressed to high-level tasks, the physical
therapist helped to improve self-efficacy.</p><p>The limitation of this study is the small sample number. Therefore, it is difficult to
generalize the findings to other stroke patients. In addition, this study comprised tasks
selected by the subjects, and this likely had a positive influence on self-efficacy.
However, the study did not consider individual abilities, and potential compensatory
patterns that may have developed during the training program could not be identified. To
identify such patterns, future studies of programs comprising ADL tasks need to consider
physical capabilities.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Moreland</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldsmith</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Huijbregts</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Progressive resistance strengthening exercises after
