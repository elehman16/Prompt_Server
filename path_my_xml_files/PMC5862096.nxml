However, the design, conduct, and analysis of an RCT can undermine the purpose of randomization and introduce bias in the estimation of treatment effects. Departures from random allocation (often referred to as noncompliance or nonadherence) create uncertainty in the interpretation of findings with regard to the causal effect of treatment. Although an intention-to-treat (ITT)&#x02013;based analysis remains the default analysis <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, in the presence of substantial noncompliance, it is natural to ask the question &#x0201c;what is the effect of actually receiving the treatment?&#x0201d;</p><p id="p0050">Two common approaches used to address noncompliance are per-protocol (PP) and treatment-received (TR) analyses. Under a PP analysis, only data from those participants deemed to have complied with the (treatment) protocol are included. In a TR analysis, the analysis groups are formed on the basis of the actual TR, irrespective of the randomized treatment. The shortcomings of these conventional approaches to dealing with noncompliance are well recognized <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Those who do not comply with treatment allocation (e.g. did not get surgery as allocated) tend to be different from the typical participant (they are often sicker and poorer in health, though in some situations the reverse can be true). A PP analysis excludes the subset of participants who do not comply from the analysis risk potentially introducing selection bias, as those who comply may reflect different patient characteristics between the groups. The TR analysis is carried out on the basis of transferring individuals who &#x0201c;crossed over&#x0201d; to the other group, and so also introduces bias into the comparison.</p><p id="p0055">More recently, causal methods which address noncompliance while maintaining the integrity of randomization and avoiding exclusions of participants have been proposed <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, which vary in complexity and the underlying assumptions. Focus has mainly been on continuous outcomes <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> partly through the more ready application of methods, although approaches for binary outcomes do exist <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Their use has been limited, and when used, the focus has been on calculating the risk difference and in the setting of an observational study <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In particular, causal bound instrumental variable (IV) methods have received little attention but can be readily calculated when the instrument, exposure variable, and the outcome are binary <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Surgery is considered an example of a scenario where compliance issues are &#x0201c;simple&#x0201d; (i.e., surgery is or is not received) as opposed to drug treatment or complex interventions which are delivered over time <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, the recent work has highlighted the potential complexity of surgical interventions <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The use of compliance-based trial analyses in the area of surgery has been very limited to date, and methodological considerations have focused on surgery versus medicine and for a continuous outcome <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The aim of the work presented herein is to explore the compliance in a surgical randomized trial, where the treatment effect for a binary primary outcome is expressed as a risk ratio (RR). Through the case study, we seek to illustrate the use of randomization respecting compliance analyses versus conventional methods and to consider issues relating to compliance in this setting.</p><sec id="sec1.1"><label>1.1</label><title>Case study&#x02013;FILMS trial</title><p id="p0060">The Full Thickness Macular Hole and Internal Limiting Membrane Peeling Study (FILMS) trial compared macular hole surgery with or without peeling (removal) of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) of the retina for idiopathic full thickness macular holes (FTMH) <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Macular hole surgery, which seeks to close the hole and improve patient visual outcome, involves a number of steps with peeling an optional additional step. Patients with stage 2 or 3 FTMH were randomized to receive macular hole surgery with or without ILM peeling or not at nine centers. Of the 141 participants randomized, 138 were included in the statistical analysis (three were discovered not to meet the eligibility criteria after being randomized). The status of the macular hole (open or closed), the main surgical outcome, was assessed at 1, 3, and 6&#x000a0;months after surgery. Other outcomes collected included visual function (EDTRS visual acuity in the study eye [the primary outcome] and the fellow eye) and quality of life (Visual Function Questionnaire-25 and EuroQol 5 Dimensions 3 Levels). Principal (ITT based) study analyses found evidence of decreased occurrence of an open hole at 1&#x000a0;month but no statistical evidence of difference at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, interpretation of these findings was complicated by the occurrence of further surgery with 29 (43%) of the nonpeeling group received peeling within the 6-month follow-up period (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Some occurrences of peeling within this group were as per the initial treatment and some as a further surgical intervention, which was allowed in FILMS according to standard clinical care. Although a number of factors could have contributed to the loss of a significant effect at the latter time points (3 and 6&#x000a0;months), it was thought to be most likely caused by the substantial number receiving peeling in the control group. A later individual patient data meta-analysis which included the FILMS trial provided further support for this view <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although participants receiving peeling in the no peel group if their initial treatment was deemed to fail can be viewed as both clinically necessary and allowable within the trial protocol, from an evaluation perspective, it can also be viewed as &#x0201c;noncompliance&#x0201d; and an obstacle to an accurate assessment of the effect of actually receiving the treatment.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Number of participants who received peeling by randomized group (<italic>N</italic> [%])</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Time from baseline</th><th>Peeling group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;71)</th><th>No peeling group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;67)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 month</td><td align="char">64 (90)</td><td align="char">4 (6)</td></tr><tr><td>3 months</td><td align="char">64 (90)</td><td align="char">27 (40)</td></tr><tr><td>6 months</td><td align="char">64 (90)</td><td align="char">29 (43)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Scenario</title><p id="p0065">The following considers the situation where we have a 2-arm RCT with treatment allocation (<italic>Z</italic>), a binary outcome (<italic>Y</italic>), and a binary measure of receipt of the treatment (<italic>D</italic>). We define compliance as a participant receiving their randomly allocated treatment (Z&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;D). In addition, we acknowledge the possibility of a vector of variables, <italic>U</italic>, which are unmeasured confounders of the outcome and compliance. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref> represents this graphically. An estimate of the treatment effect on outcome which accounts for the presence of noncompliance with treatment allocation is desired. The presence of <italic>U</italic> results in bias under conventional methods, such as excluding those who do not comply (PP) or direct adjustment in the statistical analysis. One way to deal with this is the use of an IV approach, in this setting of random allocation (<italic>Z</italic>), which enables the influence of <italic>U</italic> to be controlled for. A valid IV has to meet three standard IV assumptions: (1) the IV, <italic>Z</italic>, is assumed to be independent of <italic>U</italic>; (2) the TR (<italic>D</italic>) is assumed not to be independent of the IV (i.e., <italic>Z</italic>), which here implies that the random allocation influences the TR (<italic>D</italic>); and (3) the outcome (<italic>Y</italic>) is assumed to be independent of random allocation, given knowledge of the unobserved confounder and the TR, which implies that the random allocation only influences the outcome through the TR. This last assumption is referred to as the &#x0201c;exclusion restriction&#x0201d; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A further assumption, most commonly a monotonicity assumption (e.g., the absence of &#x0201c;defiers&#x0201d;, individuals who will always receive the opposite of their random allocation), is assumed to enable the local average treatment effect, also called the complier average causal effect (CACE), to be estimated <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Other distributional assumptions that can be made about the relationships of <italic>Y</italic> to <italic>U</italic> and <italic>D</italic> (e.g., additivity on the chosen outcome scale of interest and assuming a particular model form) are also commonly made to allow estimation of the point estimate and associated uncertainty <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. For simplicity and to allow direct comparability between methods, the presence of observed confounders (such as might be used in the randomization algorithm, and in the case study, a prognostic factor such as stage of macular hole) has been ignored throughout, although the general approach can be extended, given appropriate assumptions to allow for controlling for these (e.g., through a regression model), as per the ITT analysis.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Graphical representation of a trial with noncompliance, with randomization as an instrumental variable for the treatment received.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0070">Compliance (and noncompliance) was defined as receipt (or not) of the allocated treatment, irrespective of the reason for any deviation from allocation. In our case study, three different definitions of compliance were used: (1) compliance to the presence or absence of peeling during the initial surgery (C1); (2) compliance to the undertake peeling or not up to 3&#x000a0;months after surgery (C2); and (3) compliance to the undertaking of peeling or not up to 6&#x000a0;months after surgery (C3).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Comparison of methods</title><p id="p0075">The three classic conventional analyses were conducted; ITT, estimating the causal effect of random allocation where participants are analyzed according to the randomized groups irrespective of receipt of treatment (i.e., the effect of <italic>Z</italic> on <italic>Y</italic>); PP, where analysis was according to randomized group using the available data for those viewed as complaint (i.e., the effect of <italic>Z</italic> on <italic>Y</italic> in those for whom <italic>Z</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;<italic>D</italic>); and TR where the participants were grouped according to the actual TR up to the corresponding time point, irrespective of the random allocation (i.e., the effect of <italic>D</italic> on <italic>Y</italic>). It should be noted that the term &#x0201c;ITT&#x0201d; is not used here in the strict sense as there was a small amount of missing data for the primary outcome, and three ineligible participants were excluded postrandomization. For the purposes of this case study comparison, to match the trial's principal analysis, and for simplicity of presentation, the impact of this not been considered here. An unadjusted Poisson regression model with robust standard errors was used to calculate three conventional treatment effects and the associated uncertainty at the 5% 2-sided significance level (via 95% confidence interval [CI] and <italic>P</italic>-value) with the effect expressed as an RR.</p><p id="p0080">In addition, two IV methods were used in which random allocation was used as an IV to allow an unbiased causal effect to be calculated in the presence of unobserved confounding factors (e.g., receipt of the treatment being influenced by another unmeasured factor such as surgeon treatment preference). The two IV analyses used were as follows:<list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p id="p0085">A causal bounds (cbounds) approach in which bounds for the average treatment effect were calculated using the bpbounds command in Stata <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Under this approach, no point estimate is calculated but instead bounds for the causal effect for which a distribution exists given the underlying standard IV assumptions. Together, the IV assumptions impose constraints on the causal risk ratio for a binary outcome, and bounds can be calculated. In this context, it allows the bounding of the effect on receiving the treatment in the trial (&#x0201c;global&#x0201d;) population. Details on how this can be achieved are given in the <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Online appendix</xref> along with the additional invoking of a monotonicity assumption.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>2.</label><p id="p0090">A two-stage residual inclusion estimator approach (2SRI) <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This IV approach differs from the causal bounds approach in that further assumptions are made to estimate the point estimate of the causal effect. This leads to a local estimate of the treatment effect among those who would comply with the allocated treatments. Under this method, the residuals from a regression of TR on randomization (first stage) were obtained to enable an unbiased analysis of the effect of receiving treatment on outcome in the compliers (second stage). This second stage was carried out using an unadjusted Poisson regression model for the treatment effect by regression of the outcome on the TR (with 95% CI calculated) adjusted for the first-stage residuals as covariates.

Regarding the IV assumptions, randomization, if correctly implemented, precludes the possibility of an association between random allocation and any pre-existing unmeasured confounders. For each of the compliance definitions, it is worth noting receipt of allocation to peeling was associated with greater receipt of peeling as would be anticipated in an RCT (i.e., more individuals allocated to peeling received peeling than those allocated to no peeling) supporting acceptance of core IV assumption (2).

For macular hole status at 1&#x000a0;month, the ITT and TR, 2SRI and PP (under compliance to the initial surgery) analyses are all highly significant with large estimated RRs (between 0.26 and 0.32). The ITT effect is the smallest estimate. Interestingly, the causal bounds approach contains all the estimated point estimates (0.24, 0.38) but is narrower than all the estimated CIs. At 3&#x000a0;months, there is a similar pattern; although most of the analyses now show no statistical evidence of a difference. However, the causal bounds method shows evidence of a causal effect given initial compliance. This is no longer true if compliance is based on the absence of peeling through the 3-month follow-up period. For 6&#x000a0;months under initial compliance, all the regression analyses provide a similar point estimate likely due to no participants with 6-month data who both had an event and were noncompliant. The causal bounds method again shows weak evidence of a causal effect. Under compliance across the 6-month period, the 2SRI estimate is large than under ITT, PP, and TR. The causal bound approach no longer shows evidence of a causal effect. Across all 3- and 6-month analyses, the 2SRI estimates had a high degree of uncertainty larger than any of the other approaches.<table-wrap id="tbl4" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Risk ratio results (95% CI/causal bounds)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Outcome</th><th>Compliance</th><th>Method</th><th>Point estimate (lower&#x02013;upper)</th><th><italic>P</italic>-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 month</td><td/><td>ITT</td><td align="char">0.32 (0.18&#x02013;0.58)</td><td align="char">0.001</td></tr><tr><td/><td>C1</td><td>PP</td><td align="char">0.26 (0.14&#x02013;0.51)</td><td align="char">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>TR</td><td align="char">0.25 (0.13&#x02013;0.49)</td><td align="char">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>2SRI</td><td align="char">0.26 (0.13&#x02013;0.53)</td><td align="char">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>Causal bounds</td><td align="char">NA (0.24&#x02013;0.38)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>3 month</td><td/><td>ITT</td><td align="char">0.43 (0.16&#x02013;1.18)</td><td align="char">0.103</td></tr><tr><td/><td>C1</td><td>PP</td><td align="char">0.35 (0.12&#x02013;1.05)</td><td align="char">0.061</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>TR</td><td align="char">0.33 (0.11&#x02013;0.97)</td><td align="char">0.044</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>2SRI</td><td align="char">0.37 (0.11&#x02013;1.26)</td><td align="char">0.112</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>Causal bounds</td><td align="char">NA (0.27&#x02013;0.69)</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>C2</td><td>PP</td><td align="char">0.35 (0.11&#x02013;1.12)</td><td align="char">0.078</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>TR</td><td align="char">0.48 (0.19&#x02013;1.20)</td><td align="char">0.117</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>2SRI</td><td align="char">0.20 (0.02&#x02013;1.60)</td><td align="char">0.129</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>Causal bounds</td><td align="char">NA (0.13&#x02013;1.09)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>6 month</td><td/><td>ITT</td><td align="char">0.55 (0.17&#x02013;1.81)</td><td align="char">0.328</td></tr><tr><td/><td>C1</td><td>PP</td><td align="char">0.55 (0.17&#x02013;1.80)</td><td align="char">0.326</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>TR</td><td align="char">0.55 (0.17&#x02013;1.81)</td><td align="char">0.328</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>2SRI</td><td align="char">0.51 (0.13&#x02013;1.99)</td><td align="char">0.331</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>Causal bounds</td><td align="char">NA (0.39&#x02013;0.97)</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>C3</td><td>PP</td><td align="char">0.45 (0.13&#x02013;1.68)</td><td align="char">0.214</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>TR</td><td align="char">0.51 (0.16&#x02013;1.66)</td><td align="char">0.238</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>2SRI</td><td align="char">0.31 (0.03&#x02013;3.84)</td><td align="char">0.362</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td>Causal bounds</td><td align="char">NA (0.12&#x02013;1.36)</td><td/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><italic>Abbreviations:</italic> CI, confidence interval; ITT, intention to treat; PP, per protocol; TR, treatment received; 2SRI, two-stage residual inclusion approach.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0110">Departures from random allocation can create uncertainty about the interpretation of trial results based on an ITT analysis. Various approaches have been proposed to allow an estimate of the effect of TR. We illustrated the use of four approaches for a binary outcome based on estimating an RR, including two IV-based methods. Binary outcomes are often one of, if not the key outcome in randomized trials <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and compliance to treatment allocation can rarely be taken for granted, which suggests that the potential use of such methods (including the causal bounds approach) as an ancillary analysis potentially have widespread application. A similar bounding approach can in principle be applied to a continuous outcome where a minimum and maximum value can be assumed for the outcome, and further, more restrictive assumptions were made <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The two-stage least squares IV approach can also be used for a binary outcome to estimate the risk difference although it does not constraint the probability between zero and one <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The IV approaches used here can and have been used in Mendelian randomization epidemiology studies <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p id="p0115">Interestingly, in our analyses, the causal bounds IV approach produced a more precise and potentially useful finding than the other IV-based analysis (2SRI), which had very wide CIs. In addition, it also produced a more precise estimate of the causal effect than the TR and PP analyses as well as requiring less strong assumptions regarding those who comply with allocation (i.e., absence of selection bias). Two-stage residual inclusion approach makes an additional assumption of linearity on the scale of interest which may not be appropriate <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Similarly, a two-stage fully linear approach could have been adopted although it has been demonstrated this may not produce a consistent estimator for ratios but could have been used to calculate the risk difference <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Appropriate CIs are not straightforward for any of the model-based IV analyses further providing merit to the nonparametric causal bounds approach. The lack of a point estimate could be viewed as a substantial disadvantage of a causal bounds approach. Accordingly, such approaches are sometimes referred to as &#x0201c;partial identification&#x0201d; methods <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, it is worth noting the level of uncertainty around the point estimate from some of model-based IV analyses can reduce the corresponding point estimate to little practical value.</p><p id="p0120">The disadvantages of the PP and TR analyses are well known <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and the assumptions required to provide an unbiased analysis are often implausible (those who comply do not differ in their characteristics from those who do not comply). IV approaches avoid making this assumption while preserving the benefits of randomization. However, they require additional assumptions beyond that of randomized treatment allocation. The plausibility of these assumptions will vary according to the situation. In the FILMS trial example, the assumption that randomization influence the TR is not problematic. Similarly, the exclusion restriction assumption also seems very plausible given both treatment arms receive a surgical operation which differs only in respect to a single component (peeling or not of the ILM). A minor caveat is the small number of patients did not have any surgery or additionally received another surgical intervention. The remaining IV assumption regarding independence of the unmeasured confounders and the IV, is partially met at least by random allocation, but, it is possible that allocation had some impact on such factors particularly given it was not possible due to the nature of the trial to fully blind all individuals involved in the study. The adjusted treatment received method required further assumptions of monotonicity, and in our implementation, additivity of effect of TR and the unmeasured confounders. In this example, the benefits of the simple application of the 2SRI approach over a causal bounds approach is dubious for the simple binary outcome setting. This problem of a lack of precision applies more generally to approaches which estimate the CACE <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The large effect of macular hole surgery (with or without) peeling is perhaps atypical though somewhat offsetting this was the relatively small size of the trial. Recent work has focused on attempts to increase the precision of such analyses given the large level of uncertainty reflected in our analyses <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p id="p0125">The change or not in outcome status over time as treatment is received could provide a more precise estimate of the treatment effect. A recent study compared a number of methods (including IV and mixed model approaches) for addressing noncompliance of a medical vs. surgical trial compared in the setting of a continuous outcome with repeated measures <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In principle, a similar approach could be carried out for a binary outcome which makes use of the repeated data although the robustness of any formal interference (i.e., calculating a 95% CI) is unclear. Another aspect not addressed here is the complication generated by the presence of missing data. This could affect both the precision of the estimates and also introduce bias. Further research on this topic in needed to explore this.</p><p id="p0130">Surgery might be considered a simple situation to address compliance as it can be considered a one-off event, which either occurs or does not <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, even in this context, we showed that different definitions of compliance are possible. The reality of surgical trials, similar to many other skill-dependent interventions in particular, does not fully fit this situation as the intervention can sometimes be repeated or delivered over a number of occasions, and varying ways. The analyses reported here in a less complex surgical trial (surgery versus surgery which differs only in a minor way <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>) still make the simplification that peeling of ILM was or was not carried out. However, a small number of participants did not receive any surgery or received another surgical intervention, or received another nontrial surgical procedure during the follow-up period. In addition, it is possible to repeat ILM peeling if the initial peeling was not complete as occurred in two cases; similarly, this was also not accounted for in the analysis. Finally, while we have focused implicitly on more surgery orientated compliance, the full intervention included a patient-dependent postoperative component of posturing (lying face down after the operation for prolonged periods of time) <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Limitations in data collection and reporting hinder more in-depth assessment of the impact of this aspect of compliance. Nevertheless, the methods here provide at least some statistical reassurance that the presumed interpretation of a casual treatment effect of ILM peeling is correct even though the ITT analyses did not always reflect this.</p><p id="p0135">In conclusion, this study has illustrated the use of different IV methods, which can be readily used to supplement the ITT analysis to address compliance for a binary outcome with the treatment effect expressed as an RR. A surgical randomized trial was used to illustrate their use, and the nonparametric causal bounds approach provided more certainty about the treatment effect once accounting for noncompliance. However, as highlighted, these methods require further assumptions to be made beyond the ITT analysis to assess a causal effect of treatment, and they tend to produce imprecise estimates despite representing a simplified scenario of the reality of compliance in a surgical setting. Nevertheless, their use can aid the interpretation of surgical trials in the presence of noncompliance, and we encourage the more routine adoption of these techniques, which allow the impact of compliance to be evaluated without compromising the benefits of randomization.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation
