This dynamic process involves coordinated effects of autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine factors. For the implantation to occur, a genetically normal blastocyst should hatch, appose, adhere, penetrate, and finally invade a well-synchronized endometrium, under the influence of estrogens and progesterone.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The time period during which the uterine environment is conducive to blastocyst implantation is called the window of implantation. In the natural cycle during this period, the uterus is prepared to receive a blastocyst and support further implantation through mediation by immune cells, cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, and adhesion molecules.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Several mechanisms are believed to play a role in improving the outcome. After endometrial injury, cytokines that are released during the repair process induce endometrial changes favorable for implantation. Endometrial injury also induces decidualization, which favors implantation as well. Uterine receptivity is diminished in controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) cycle compared with the natural cycle. In assisted reproduction technique, COS induces lower implantation rate than natural or ovum donation cycle suggesting suboptimal development due to the abnormal endocrine and paracrine milieu. The healing after the injury slows endometrial development, which is otherwise accelerated after stimulation, thereby increasing the likelihood for an in-phase[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] endometrium at the time of transfer. The effectiveness of this intervention has been evaluated in various studies done in <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) cycle. Barash <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] suggested a significant doubling of the implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates in cases who underwent repeated endometrial biopsies in the cycle immediately preceding the IVF. The Cochrane review[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (2012) found the benefit when endometrial injury was done in the luteal phase of the preceding cycle. Subsequently better implantation rates after local injury to the endometrium were reported by others like Raziel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Zhou <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Karimzadeh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Narvekar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] There is a heterogeneity in the method, timing and frequency of endometrial biopsy (EB) in various studies. Karimzade <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] used Novak curette.

None of the studies have tried this intervention in intrauterine insemination (IUI) which is one of the most applied treatment options for couples with infertility for various reasons. IUI is mainly done in couples with longstanding subfertility caused by either hostile cervix, a male factor, or by unexplained infertility.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The proposed hypothesis in our study is that EB preceding ovulation induction (OI) and IUI have the same beneficial effect on IUI outcome in patient undergoing COS as demonstrated in IVF through local inflammatory and angiogenesis mechanism.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The aim was to evaluate the effect of EB on IUI outcome in COS cycle and to compare differences in IUI outcome by EB in follicular and luteal phase of the cycle.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This is a prospective parallel randomized control study in a 1:1 allocation ratio conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, at a tertiary care center from August 2012 to March 2014.

Scratching of endometrium has been suggested to improve implantation and CPRs. It has been observed in various meta-analysis[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] that local endometrial injury (LEI) produced using hysteroscope or biopsy catheter in preceding or same cycle of ovarian stimulation is a reasonable procedure to improve reproductive outcome for women undergoing ART (IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection [ICSI]) particularly for women with previous unsuccessful embryo transfer. This procedure has also been tried in women undergoing first ART cycle with successful results. Barash <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] emphasized the possible role of endometrial injury on improved implantation and pregnancy rates in ART cycle. There is current need to examine the effect of this intervention in non IVF/ICSI situations like women undergoing COS cycles with IUI. Our study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of EB on IUI outcome in COS cycle and to compare the effect of EB done in the luteal phase or follicular phase with the cycle outcome.</p><p>A total of 251 subjects attending infertility clinic were included in the study. 86 cases with EB in luteal phase of previous stimulation cycle were included in Group A, 90 cases with EB in proliferative phase of same stimulation cycle were included in Group B and 75 cases with no EB in previous 3 months were taken in control Group C. Overall the clinical pregnancy (CPR) was significantly higher 31.1% in Group B as compared to 19.7% in Group A and 9.3% in Group C with (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003). The results of the present study indicate a beneficial effect of inducing LEI preceding COS with IUI cycles in the intervention group as compared to control Group especially in first cycle of IUI after EB in the follicular phase.</p><p>In our study endometrial thickness obtained on day of HCG, trigger was significantly high in Group B with mean ET 8.4 &#x000b1; 1.84 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002). The good endometrium development after scratching in the same phase may be due to increase angiogenesis and inflammatory mechanism which in turn may be one of the contributing factor for increase CPR in Group B.</p><p>In the luteal phase, the mean day for taking EB in Group A was 21.7 &#x000b1; 1.46. Pregnancy was maximum in cases with EB done on D22 (38.9%) of cycle but it was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.460). In the follicular phase, the mean day for taking EB in Group B was 2.14 &#x000b1; 0.68. Pregnancy rate was significantly more (32.1%) when EB was done on D2 with <italic>P</italic> = 0.001.</p><p>It is unknown whether pregnancy rate are better with scratching of endometrium in the preceding luteal phase or same stimulation cycle. In our study, EB was done in the luteal phase of cycle in Group A. CPR was found to be increased in intervention Group A (19.7%) as compared to the nonintervention Group C (9.3%). Worldwide the literature reports pregnancy rate of 9&#x02013;13% in IUI cycle. Our success rate in intervention Group A was 19.7%, which is high as compared to the reported literature.

Pregnancy outcome in intervention Group B with EB done in early follicular phase in same cycle of stimulation was significantly higher than control Group and it was also higher as compared to cases with EB done in luteal phase of preceding cycle in Group A but was not statistically significant. The risk of OHSS, multiple pregnancy, and abortion was not statistically significant in all three Groups. CPR was maximum after first cycle of OI and IUI following EB scratch in both Groups A and in Group B, and it was statistically significant.</p><p>Most of the work related to endometrial scratching has been done in IVF cycles with promising results. Very few studies[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] have evaluated the effect of endometrial sampling done in previous or same cycle of stimulation on IUI outcome with either no effect or improvement in pregnancy rates. Further studies with large sample size are required to know if the intervention in form of endometrial scratching will be beneficial in a particular subgroup of cases, maybe in our study most of the cases that benefitted from the intervention were of unexplained infertility group (41.9% in Group A, 53.3% in Group B, 46.7% in Group C). Severe endometriosis cases were directly referred for IVF and PCOS cases were included in ovulatory dysfunction None of the studies in IVF/IUI have mentioned effect of stimulation protocol and duration of infertility on CPR after EB in detail.</p><p>In developing countries like India with increasing infertility rates there is requirement of affordable, low cost interventions like endometrial scratching which can be done as an OPD procedure prior to OI and IUI cycles, thereby improving pregnancy rates before proceeding for high cost alternative ART procedures.</p><sec
