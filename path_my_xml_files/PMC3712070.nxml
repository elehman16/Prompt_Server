The purpose of this study was to determine whether SSTR2 antagonism (SSTR2a) ameliorates hypoglycemia in response to overinsulinization in diabetic rats previously exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia. Streptozotocin diabetic rats (<italic>n</italic> = 19), previously subjected to five hypoglycemia events over 3 days, received an insulin bolus (10 units/kg i.v.) plus insulin infusion (50 mU/kg/min i.v.) until hypoglycemia ensued (&#x02264;3.9 mmol/L) (experimental day 1 [Expt-D1]). The next day (Expt-D2), rats were allocated to receive either placebo treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 7) or SSTR2a infusion (3,000 nmol/kg/min i.v., <italic>n</italic> = 12) 60 min prior to the same insulin regimen. On Expt-D1, all rats developed hypoglycemia by &#x0223c;90 min, while on Expt-D2, hypoglycemia was attenuated with SSTR2a treatment (nadir = 3.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 vs. 2.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 mmol/L in SSTR2a and controls, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Glucagon response to hypoglycemia on Expt-D2 deteriorated by 20-fold in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) but improved in the SSTR2a group (threefold increase in area under the curve [AUC], <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Corticosterone response deteriorated in the placebo-treated rats on Expt-D2 but increased twofold in the SSTR2a group. Catecholamine responses were not affected by SSTR2a. Thus, SSTR2 antagonism after recurrent hypoglycemia improves the glucagon and corticosterone responses and largely ameliorates insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetic rats.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>The management of type 1 diabetes mellitus is impeded by the constant threat of hypoglycemia, caused by the inability to achieve physiological insulin replacement and because of a failure in the hormone counterregulation of hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Recurrent hypoglycemia increases the susceptibility to subsequent hypoglycemia, since it contributes to both defective hormone counterregulation and reduced symptom recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The reduction in symptom recognition for hypoglycemia has a profound impact on patient quality of life, and this population fears hypoglycemia more than long-term complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The elevated risk of recurrent hypoglycemia, often precipitated by intensive insulin therapy, frequently necessitates a relaxation in management, which ultimately places the individual at risk for earlier complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Currently, there are few prophylactic strategies that limit the risk of developing insulin-induced hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), perhaps because the neuroendocrine mechanism(s) of impairment has yet to be fully elucidated. None of these treatments would be considered a preventative pharmacological approach.</p><p>With repeated exposure to hypoglycemia, there are impairments in the neuroendocrine and autonomic responses to subsequent hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), perhaps because of defects in the regions of the central nervous system that detect and respond to hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In addition to numerous neuroendocrine deficiencies related to glucose sensing and blunted counterregulatory responses because of central deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), elevation in circulating somatostatin levels in type 1 diabetes mellitus has long been thought to impair the counterregulatory response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>Somatostatin acts on various receptor subtypes (somatostatin receptor type [SSTR]1&#x02013;5), being both a regulator of hormone secretion (typically inhibitory) and a neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). With respect to glucose counterregulatory hormones, somatostatin release in the brain lowers pituitary growth hormone secretion indirectly via hypothalamic suppression of growth hormone&#x02013;releasing hormone release and directly by acting on somatotrophs via SSTR2 and -5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In the adrenal gland, somatostatin inhibits acetylcholine stimulated medullary catecholamine secretion and inhibits corticosteroid secretion predominantly via SSTR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In humans, somatostatin lowers pancreatic glucagon and insulin release through SSTR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In rats, somatostatin inhibits insulin secretion predominantly through SSTR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and glucagon secretion exclusively through SSTR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Paradoxically, somatostatin concentrations are elevated at baseline and rise further during hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who are on exogenous insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Various animal models of type 1 diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and isolated islet studies in healthy rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) have demonstrated that elevations in somatostatin limit the glucagon response to hypoglycemia or arginine stimulation via SSTR2 activation. Since somatostatin also inhibits the release of all of the key hormones involved in glucose counterregulation (i.e., cortisol, growth hormone, catecholamines) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), an elevation in somatostatin levels in type 1 diabetes mellitus may be one of the reasons why glucose counterregulation fails. Accordingly, the systemic administration of a somatostatin receptor agonist exacerbates severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), likely because of reductions in glucose counterregulatory hormone levels to ensuing insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Thus, the use of a SSTR2 antagonist (SSTR2a) may be helpful in improving glucose counterregulation in this patient population. In support of this, we recently demonstrated that SSTR2a (PRL-2903) normalizes the glucagon and corticosterone responses to hypoglycemic clamp in diabetic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Since these were glucose clamp experiments, it was not possible to determine whether hypoglycemia could be prevented with SSTR2 antagonism. It is also unclear whether the improvement in the counterregulatory hormone response caused by SSTR2a would have favorable effects on glucoregulation in diabetes. In this present work, we tested the hypothesis that hypoglycemia can be prevented/attenuated with SSTR2 antagonism treatment in animals previously exposed to repeated hypoglycemic challenge by enhancing counterregulatory responses. We demonstrate here that the glucagon and corticosterone responses improve by SSTR2 antagonism and that the depth and duration of hypoglycemia are ameliorated in diabetic rats previously exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This was a repeated-measures randomized design study (placebo/placebo vs. placebo/SSTR2a) to test the effectiveness of SSTR2 antagonism on glucose and hormonal counterregulation during insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetic rats previously exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia. Nineteen male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Saint-Constant, QC, Canada) with an initial body mass of 275&#x02013;300 g were used. Rats were individually housed in opaque cages in a light- and temperature-controlled environment (12-h light:12-h dark cycle, 20&#x02013;22&#x000b0;C) and fed ad libitum with chow (Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI) with free access to food and water. After 1 week of experimenter handling and acclimatization, rats were given a single intraperitoneal streptozotocin (STZ) injection (65 mg/kg dissolved in 0.9% saline; Sigma) to induce diabetes. STZ-injected rats that did not become hyperglycemic within 48 h were excluded from the study. Morning (fed) glycemia (Ascencia Elite handheld glucometer; Bayer Canada, Etobicoke, ON, Canada), body mass, and food intake were measured daily. With use of aseptic technique, rats were anesthetized and catheterized with indwelling cannulae in the left carotid artery and right jugular vein 14 days after STZ injection. The cannulae were exteriorized, fed through a metal coil tether, and connected to a swivel system (rodent tether and swivel; Lomir Biomedical, Notre-Dame-de-I'&#x000ce;le Perrot, QC, Canada). This rodent tethering system allowed for manual, undisturbed blood sampling and infusions (arterial and venous catheters, respectively) and unrestricted movement of the rat while protecting the catheters. Catheters were flushed daily with heparinized (10 U.S. pharmacopeia units/mL) saline to ensure patency. Eighteen days after STZ injection, rats were subjected to recurrent hypoglycemia treatment over 3 days via a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp technique. (See below for details.) Twenty-one days after STZ injection, rats underwent a standardized 2-day back-to-back hypoglycemic challenge via insulin infusion either with or without SSTR2a. (See below for details.) All procedures were in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care Standards and were approved by the animal care committee of the University of Toronto</p><sec id="s2"><title>Recurrent hypoglycemia treatment.</title><p>Nineteen (<italic>n</italic> = 19) rats were subjected to five episodes of recurrent hypoglycemia over 3 days using a modified hyperinsulinemia-hypoglycemic clamp technique. Rats were partially fasted overnight (10&#x02013;15 g rat chow or &#x0223c;25&#x02013;40% ad libitum consumption with free access to 5% sucrose) prior to each day of recurrent hypoglycemia. On each morning of hypoglycemic challenge, basal blood glucose was measured at <italic>t</italic> = 0 min and insulin (10 units/kg) was injected subcutaneously to induce hypoglycemia. Glucose infusions (50% dextrose) were given at a variable rate to clamp glycemia at a target hypoglycemia of 3.0 &#x000b1; 0.5 mmol/L. Blood glucose was measured (Analox glucose analyzer, GMD-9D; Analox Instruments USA, Lunenburg, MA) in duplicate every 15 min for 180 min. During a rest period between 180 and 240 min, rats were given access to 5% sucrose water and intravenous glucose infusion to recover. At 240 min, rats again underwent a hypoglycemic challenge until 420 min. Food and sucrose water were fed to aid recovery after hypoglycemia treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Experimental days 1 and 2.</title><p>After this hypoglycemic conditioning period, each rat then underwent two additional experimental days of hypoglycemic challenge (i.e., with or without SSTR2a treatment), with measurements of their hormonal and glycemic responses. Rats were partially fasted overnight prior to each experimental day, as described above, to allow for standardization in food intake and preservation of liver glycogen stores. In the morning, rats were weighed, connected to venous infusion lines, and acclimated for 2 h prior to experimentation. Basal blood samples for glucose and hormones were taken at the start of the experiment (<italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;60 min) from freely moving, conscious rats with cannulae exteriorized outside of the cage. On experimental day 1 (Expt-D1), which served as the control day to measure the extent of counterregulatory failure caused by recurrent hypoglycemia, 0.9% saline infusion (1 mL/h) was started in all rats (<italic>n</italic> = 19) after basal samples were obtained at <italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;60 min. Blood glucose levels were measured in duplicate using a glucose analyzer at times &#x02212;60, &#x02212;40, &#x02212;20, and 0 min and every 10 min thereafter until 180 min. Blood samples for glucagon, catecholamines, and insulin were collected in chilled tubes containing EDTA (Sangon, Canada, Scarborough, ON, Canada) and Trasylol (Bayer Canada, Etobicoke, ON, Canada). Blood samples for corticosterone were collected in chilled tubes containing heparin. After plasma was removed, packed erythrocytes were resuspended in heparinized saline (10 U.S. pharmacopeia units/mL) containing 1% BSA and reinfused into the rat. After blood samples were obtained at <italic>t</italic> = 0, an intravenous insulin bolus (10 units/kg) was administered. For achievement of hypoglycemia with as little insulin administered as possible, an intravenous insulin infusion (50 mU/kg/min) was commenced and terminated at the experimenter&#x02019;s discretion. Infusions were delivered via digital pumps (PHD 22/2000 syringe pumps; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and both the volume of insulin infused and time when infusion was stopped were recorded. The purpose of Expt-D1 was to attempt to determine the minimal amount of insulin necessary to induce hypoglycemia (2.0&#x02013;3.5 mmol/L) without causing coma or convulsions and to serve as the control for glucose levels and hormonal responses for Expt-D2. Determining the insulin dosage specifically for each rat on Expt-D1 was necessary since insulin sensitivities of these diabetic rats varied. It is worth noting that neither glucose infusions nor SSTR2a was given on Expt-D1, since it was important to examine each animal&#x02019;s capacity to counterregulate after recurrent hypoglycemia. On Expt-D2, rats were randomly allocated to SSTR2a (<italic>n</italic> = 12) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 7) treatment. A greater number of rats were given the SSTR2a, since it was expected that results would be more variable in this group. The insulin regimen on Expt-D2 was identical to that used on Expt-D1 for a given rat so that any differences in treatment (placebo vs. SSTR2a) could be observed. Infusion of SSTR2a (PRL-2903, 3000 nmol/kg/min at 1 mL/h) was commenced at <italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;60 min and continued for 5-h duration of the experiment, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), to determine the effect of SSTR2a on the depth and duration of hypoglycemia. In the placebo-treated group, saline was infused in place of SSTR2a. At the end of 240 min on Expt-D2, all rats were quickly killed by decapitation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Plasma hormone measurements.</title><p>Plasma glucagon and insulin (LINCO Research, St. Charles, MO), catecholamines (LDN, Nordhorn, Germany), and corticosterone (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) were measured by radioimmunoassay using commercially purchased kits as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>SSTR2a.</title><p>This peptide antagonist (PRL-2903 and BIM-23458) was synthesized and provided by Dr. D.

Since the apparent attenuation in epinephrine response on Expt-D2 compared with Expt-D1 despite SSTR2a treatment may have been related to improved counterregulation in other hormones and to higher glycemic values overall, we also compared the catecholamine responses between Expt-D1 and -2 in the six rats who still developed hypoglycemia with SSTR2a treatment. In this analysis, we observed that SSTR2a was associated with a preserved epinephrine response to recurrent hypoglycemia (data not shown). Norepinephrine response to hypoglycemia was similar both between groups and between experimental days (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s13"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study is the first to show that the use of a selective SSTR2 inhibitor reduces the likelihood of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetic rats that have developed counterregulatory failure because of repeated exposure to recurrent hypoglycemia. This novel finding may have significant implications for the development of new prophylactic therapies targeting SSTR2 inhibition for hypoglycemia prevention in type 1 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Our prior work has demonstrated that SSTR2 antagonism improves some of the counterregulatory hormone response to hypoglycemic clamp in diabetic rodents naive to prior hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). This study extends these findings by showing that rodents exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia have improvements in their glucagon and corticosterone, but not catecholamine, responses to subsequent hypoglycemia when an SSTR2a is administered. More importantly, animals are shown to be more resistant to insulin-induced hypoglycemia with SSTR2a treatment. These findings are particularly relevant, since reducing the hypoglycemic nadir and reducing the duration of hypoglycemic exposure are both important in preserving normal brain function and preventing severe neuroglucopenia, seizures, and loss of consciousness or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). If selective SSTR2 antagonism is demonstrated to promote hypoglycemic resistance in the long term, without adverse side effects, then insulin therapies that include SSTR2 antagonism may have wider latitude for safety patients living with type 1 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Taking together the results of our prior study using SSTR2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and the observations that there are elevations in pancreatic gene expression and somatostatin levels in diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), we propose here that increased somatostatin concentration and/or signaling is one of the key contributing factors in the development of glucose counterregulation failure in type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, this study also reveals that some rodents still develop hypoglycemia even when somatostatin inhibition exists (&#x0223c;50% [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>]), perhaps because the glucagon response to hypoglycemia is not fully restored in rats exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia. Indeed, a comparison of glucagon responses in this study with that of nondiabetic rodents and rodents given SSTR2a during their first bout of hypoglycemia in our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) suggests that the decrement in counterregulatory responses to recurrent hypoglycemia is not fully restored by SSTR2 antagonism (&#x0223c;30 vs. 225 pg/mL glucagon response in this study compared with our prior study). Nonetheless, the ability of the SSTR2a to help preserve blood glucose levels &#x0003e;3.5 mmol/L in rats previously exposed to frequent hypoglycemia may have clinical relevance, as an earlier study demonstrated that hypoglycemia at 3.3 mmol/L reduced cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). It remains to be determined, however, whether prolonged SSTR2 antagonism therapy can limit the frequency of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes mellitus or whether it has any efficacy in limiting the high rate of occurrence of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Hypoglycemia, even when symptom free, leads to defective glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia unawareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Since these episodes substantially increase the risk of subsequent hypoglycemia, all hypoglycemic events place the individual at elevated risk for future (and more catastrophic) occurrences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). It has been suggested that delayed recovery of hypoglycemia may frequently occur in type 1 diabetic individuals in whom deficient epinephrine and glucagon counterregulation result in impaired hepatic glucose release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, avoidance of hypoglycemia helps to restore hypoglycemia awareness and perhaps glucose counterregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). This avoidance is typically achieved by a relaxation in insulin therapy, which can cause a deterioration in glycemic control, as measured by A1C levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Whether SSTR2a treatment deteriorates insulin sensitivity or allows for a restoration in glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia avoidance without any alterations in insulin therapy remains to be established. In this study, it would appear that the insulin pharmacokinetics, as assessed by the rate of change in glucose after intravenous insulin administration, were unchanged with SSTR2a treatment, which may be considered beneficial for overall patient control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p>In our prior study, we observed that SSTR2a appeared to promote an increase in glucagon release only during hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In this study, it would appear that the SSTR2a may increase glucagon release well before hypoglycemia ensues. Indeed, the glucagon response in the SSTR2a-treated animals rose well before the onset of hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This suggests that the antagonist may trigger enhanced hormone release in response to a decline in glycemia rather than to hypoglycemia per se. Although our prior work suggests that the provision of the same SSTR2a does not influence insulin sensitivity or glucose production during euglycemia or hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), a more generic effect of SSTR2a treatment on glucagon release cannot be ruled out at this time.</p><p>There is little doubt that somatostatin levels are increased with diabetes. Prosomatostatin mRNA expression in diabetic rats is elevated in islets compared with nondiabetic rats, and these levels remain elevated even after seven episodes of recurrent hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In humans with type 1 diabetes mellitus, circulating somatostatin levels are elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and pancreatic somatostatin levels are elevated by &#x0003e;10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), particularly in those with poor glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Thus, as with acute hypoglycemia, we propose here that increased pancreatic somatostatin levels may play a role in impairing glucagon release after recurrent hypoglycemia. Using this same selective SSTR2a, stimulated secretion of glucagon, but not insulin, is dose-dependently enhanced in perifused islets and in perfused pancreata of healthy rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The same antagonist also reverses the suppressive effects of an SSTR2 agonist on arginine-stimulated glucagon secretion in isolated human islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Based on the improved glucagon responses to hypoglycemia that we previously observed with SSTR2a treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and on our observations in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>), we assume that the effectiveness of SSTR2 antagonism on hypoglycemia prevention after recurrent hypoglycemia is primarily related to enhanced glucagon-mediated hepatic glycogenolysis. However, other possible mechanisms do exist. It may be that somatostatin antagonism increases glucose production or lowers glucose disposal. At present, however, there is no known direct effect of SSTR2 antagonism on hepatic glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. Prolonged infusion of SSTR2a under basal, nonclamped conditions does not appear to affect glucose turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Moreover, SSTR1 and SSTR3, but not SSTR2, have been detected on hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) and the SSTR2a used in this study has no reactivity with SSTR1 and 10-fold less binding affinity with SSTR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). As previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), corticosterone levels tend to be increased during hypoglycemia when SSTR2a is given (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). Elevations in corticosterone would also be expected to enhance hepatic glucose production and possibly limit peripheral glucose uptake. Interestingly, a direct effect of somatostatin to enhance insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake, but not basal muscle glucose uptake, has been demonstrated in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that inhibition of somatostatin in the current study could contribute to reduced muscle glucose clearance during hypoglycemia, although overall insulin sensitivity did not appear to be impacted by the use of the antagonist in this study. Evidence of SSTR subtypes on skeletal muscle is scarce, but SSTR2, SSTR3, and SSTR4 mRNA has been detected in rat skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Thus, a global reduction in somatostatin signaling may promote several antihypoglycemic mechanisms, some of which remain to be identified.</p><p>In addition to attenuated glucagon and corticosterone response to hypoglycemia, the catecholamine responses are also lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Somatostatin is thought to inhibit epinephrine release by receptor-coupled signaling initiated by acetylcholine-nicotinic receptor binding, subsequent membrane depolarization, and intracellular calcium increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), resulting in the consequent inhibition of adrenomedullary epinephrine secretion from the adrenal medulla. However, in our studies, SSTR2a did not improve the catecholamine response to hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>F</italic></xref>). We speculate that the apparent attenuation in epinephrine response to hypoglycemia was because glycemia did not reach the same nadir when SSTR2a was used, likely because the glucagon response was improved. Indeed, in the six rats that developed hypoglycemia despite SSTR2a treatment, the epinephrine response was identical to that observed on Expt-D1. Thus, we conclude that SSTR2a treatment does not significantly alter the catecholamine response to hypoglycemia, at least in rats that had diabetes for a relatively short period of time.</p><p>Our study has a number of limitations that should be mentioned. First, in spite of identical hypoglycemic conditioning leading up to the experimental days, the two groups of rats examined had different glucose counterregulatory responses to the hypoglycemia on Expt-D1. Indeed, the corticosterone and epinephrine responses in the rats that would receive SSTR2a the next day appeared to be slightly more impaired compared with the placebo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), which may have exaggerated the effectiveness of the antagonist on Expt-D2. On the other hand, if this group of rats did have significantly attenuated counterregulatory responses, one may consider that the antagonist is indeed effective even in animals that have completely abolished glucose counterregulation. Second, because of limitations in blood collection we did not measure the growth hormone response to hypoglycemia in this study, which may have been improved with SSTR2a treatment. In our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), we did not observe an effect of SSTR2a inhibition on growth hormone release during hypoglycemia (unpublished data). However, given that growth hormone is triggered by hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) and suppressed by somatostatin primarily via the type 2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), further studies are needed to determine whether SSTR2a treatment also helps to augment growth hormone release during hypoglycemia.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that hypoglycemia can be ameliorated by SSTR2 antagonism after recurrent hypoglycemia in diabetic rats, presumably at least in part by enhancing glucagon and corticosterone counterregulation. These results also help to support the role for pancreatic, and possibly circulating, somatostatin in attenuating the counterregulatory response in diabetes and that this defect can be countered using a pharmacological dose of SSTR2a. Although further investigation is necessary to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which euglycemia is restored by inhibiting somatostatin action and whether any other deleterious off-target effects occur because of regular treatment, these findings hold promise for a new pharmacotherapy for hypoglycemia prevention in type 1 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>J.T.Y.Y. is currently affiliated with the Toronto General Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This research was supported by grants from the Canadian Diabetes Association, MaRS Innovations, and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.
