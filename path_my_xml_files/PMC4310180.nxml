Therefore, they may help to identify those patients who need intravascular volume expansion, while avoiding unnecessary fluid administration in the other patients.

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical benefits of using preload dependence indices to titrate intravascular fluids during septic shock.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a single-center randomized controlled trial, 60 septic shock patients were allocated to preload dependence indices-guided (preload dependence group) or central venous pressure-guided (control group) intravascular volume expansion with 30 patients in each group.

Physiologic variable values did not change over time between groups, except for plasma lactate (time over group interaction, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.01). Mortality was not significantly different between groups (23% in the preload dependence group versus 47% in the control group, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.10). Intravascular volume expansion was lower in the preload dependence group for patients with lower simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), and the opposite was found for patients in the upper two SAPS II quartiles. The amount of intravascular volume expansion did not change across the quartiles of severity in the control group, but steadily increased with severity in the preload dependence group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with septic shock, titrating intravascular volume expansion with preload dependence indices did not change time to shock resolution, but resulted in less daily fluids intake, including red blood cells, without worsening patient outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01972828">NCT01972828</ext-link>.

Preload optimization is a major issue in the treatment of these patients. However, observational studies found a strong association between intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and positive fluid balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], suggesting that aggressive fluid resuscitation may be harmful. While several hemodynamic algorithms have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials during the first hours of septic shock resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the evidence is relatively scarce regarding the practical modalities of fluid administration some hours later. A substantial amount of physiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] have demonstrated that static preload indices (such as central venous pressure (CVP)) may not be reliable to assess fluid responsiveness (cardiac output change in response to fluid administration), especially in septic patients. In contrast, dynamic preload indices such as pulse pressure variation (PPV) or stroke volume change during passive leg raising (PLR) are highly reliable to assess fluid responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], should validity conditions for PPV accuracy be met. Driving intravascular volume expansion with dynamic preload indices should avoid unnecessary fluid administration, preventing pulmonary side effects, and select fluid-responsive patients. As a result, oxygen delivery should be optimized and organ failure shortened. However, while several studies have demonstrated a beneficial effect of volume expansion driven by preload dependence indices in the perioperative context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], none has been performed in septic shock patients.</p><p>We conducted an exploratory randomized controlled study to explore whether preload dependence-driven fluid management in ICU patients with septic shock would reduce the duration of cardiovascular failure, as compared to CVP-driven fluid management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This trial was an open-label, controlled, parallel-group study, with balanced randomization, performed in a 15-bed medical ICU. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under the number NCT01972828 and the study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes Sud-Est III). Patients were enrolled between 1 July 2007 and 30 July 2013. The attending physician was responsible for enrolling the patients in the study, and following the protocol.

Calibration of cardiac output was performed by intravenous infusion of 15&#x000a0;mL serum saline in triplicate, every hour during the first 6&#x000a0;hours of the study, and every 4&#x000a0;hours thereafter. Hemodynamic treatments were administered according to an hemodynamic algorithm (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), run at each episode of hypotension (defined by mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 65&#x000a0;mm Hg), every hour during the first 6&#x000a0;hours after inclusion, and every 4&#x000a0;hours thereafter until vasopressor weaning (defined by the absence of vasopressor reintroduction for at least 24&#x000a0;hours). Intravascular volume expansion was performed using CVP in the control group, and using both PPV when applicable (invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) with no spontaneous respiratory movement (SRM), sinus rhythm (SR), tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) greater than 7&#x000a0;ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> of predicted body weight (PBW), and absence of evidence for acute cor pulmonale (ACP)), or stroke volume change (&#x00394;SV) during PLR in the preload dependence group. PLR was performed from the supine position, for 1&#x000a0;minute, and preload dependence was deemed present if stroke volume increased by at least 10% during the procedure. Intravascular volume expansion was administered by aliquots of 500&#x000a0;ml over 15&#x000a0;minutes, to achieve a CVP of at least 8&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O in the control group, and a PPV below 13% or a stroke volume increase below 10% during PLR in the preload dependence group. The type of fluid used for intravascular volume expansion was left at the discretion of the attending physician. In both groups, MAP was maintained between 65 and 75&#x000a0;mm Hg using standardized vasopressors management.

The daily amount of fluids administered per protocol for intravascular volume expansion was significantly higher in the control group (917 [639 to 1,511] vs. 383 [211 to 604] mL.day<sup>-1</sup>, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

A multivariate analysis of variables associated with the daily amount of intravascular volume expansion was performed using treatment arm, SAPS II, and the following variables at time of inclusion as predictors: SOFA score, lactates, body weight). SAPS II, treatment arm and their interaction were the only significant variables retained in the final model. As shown on Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, intravascular volume expansion was lower in the intervention group for patients with lower SAPS II, and the opposite was found for patients pertaining to the upper two SAPS II quartiles. Furthermore, the amount of intravascular volume expansion was unchanged in the control group whatever the quartile of severity (lack of significance of the quartile effect), while a stepwise increase was observed as severity increased in the preload dependence group (as a result of the significant interaction). Similar results were observed using the amount of fluid administered for intravascular volume expansion during the first 12&#x000a0;hours of the study (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b).

The main findings of this study are that titration of intravascular volume expansion by using preload dependence indices, as compared to CVP: (1) significantly reduces the daily amount of fluids intake and RBC transfusion, without adverse effect on outcome; (2) results in higher fluid administration in those patients with the most general severity score.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p>Before discussing present results, some limitations should be acknowledged. First, patients were enrolled relatively late in the course of septic shock. It should, however, be stressed that this may decrease the probability of detecting an effect of the intervention being tested in the present study, while we observed beneficial effects regarding fluid requirement and lactate decrease. Second, expected shock duration was overestimated when computation of sample size was done, while we observed a mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation of shock duration amounting to 3.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.8&#x000a0;days in the control group, making the study underpowered to detect significant difference in time to shock resolution. Nonetheless, based on the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference in median time to shock resolution between groups, a maximal reduction of 0.8&#x000a0;days of shock duration may be anticipated with the use of preload dependence indices, a difference that may not be clinically relevant. Third, one may question that the control group reflects the standard of care, as the surviving sepsis campaign now recommends CVP-guided fluid loading in the early phase of septic shock resuscitation and fluid challenge thereafter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The target CVP level chosen in the present study is another questionable matter. A higher CVP target (that is 12 to 15&#x000a0;mm Hg) has been advocated in patients under mechanical ventilation or with preexisting decreased ventricular compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Nevertheless, should this recommendation be applied in the present study, it would have increased the amount of fluids given to the control group, and hence increase the difference with the intervention group, regarding this parameter. Four, PLR was performed from the supine position in the present study, while one study suggested that starting from the semi-recumbent position increased the diagnosis performance of the PLR test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, a meta-analysis of nine studies did not find any effect of the starting position on the diagnosis accuracy of the PLR test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Five, treatment arm blinding was not possible in the present study, and observer bias was hence uncontrolled, which may have influenced the main judgment criterion. Nevertheless, vasopressor weaning was strictly protocolled, performed by ICU nurses, and none of the investigators was involved in vasopressor tapering. Furthermore, no between-group differences in non-hemodynamic treatment could be documented (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Six, external validity of the study may be questionable because of the relatively low inclusion to screening ratio (10%). Seven, evaluation of tissue hypoperfusion as an incentive to trigger intravascular volume expansion was not performed, since many clinical or biological variables may be used at the bedside (elevated lactate, low urine output, low ScvO<sub>2</sub>, tachycardia, mottling, metabolic acidosis, increased capillary refill time, low cardiac output, among others) and explicit implementation of these variables into an hemodynamic protocol to avoid co-intervention bias in a non-blinded study raises issues such as interobserver variability (mottling, capillary filling time), or explicit definition of cutoff values (cardiac rate, pH, cardiac output). Nevertheless, the lack of tissue perfusion evaluation before fluid bolus was applied in both study arms and may not interfere with the effect (or lack of effect) on outcome. Eight, the study was erroneously registered after the inclusion of the last patient, ending up in a theoretical selective outcome reporting bias. Finally, we observed a relatively high mortality in the control group. However, mortality of the present study was in the range of recently published randomized controlled studies on severe sepsis (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>), while patient severity, comorbidities and rate of immunosuppressed patients were in the upper range, and exclusion criteria of patients with high expected mortality were less stringent in the present study.</p><p>Our study has, however, several strengths. First, the design, with protocolled hemodynamic management and associated treatments for septic shock, made intravascular volume expansion strategies the only distinct intervention between both treatments arms, allowing a direct comparison of the two fluid-loading strategies regarding their effect on patient outcome. Second, each hemodynamic strategy was applied for the whole duration of septic shock, from the early phase to the vasopressor withdrawal, contrary to previous studies that tested hemodynamic interventions applied in the first 6 to 8&#x000a0;hours of management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Third, we observed a strong adherence to the hemodynamic protocol during the whole study period. Fourth, the study population was characterized with a high prevalence of bacterial documentation and raised arterial lactate level at inclusion,</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Effect of preload dependence-driven intravascular volume expansion on plasma lactate</title><p>The beneficial effect on lactate decrease, that is the faster rate of decline observed in the preload dependence group, is in line with previous studies using dynamic preload indices performed in the perioperative setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In contrast to some of the aforementioned studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but in line with another one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the effect on lactate decrease was achieved in the present study with less intravascular fluids administration. However, this effect was identified on <italic>post hoc</italic> time-dependant analysis, while the predefined criterion (number of days with greater than normal plasma lactate) was not statistically significant. Therefore, these results should be addressed with caution and only viewed as exploratory for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Effect of preload dependence-driven intravascular volume expansion on fluid administration</title><p>An important finding of the present study is that driving intravascular fluid administration with preload dependance indices reduced the daily amount of administered fluids with, at most, no detrimental effect on outcome. The significant decrease in RBC transfusion requirement in the preload dependence arm may be a consequence of the lower amount of fluid administered in this group since hemoglobin levels were not significantly different between groups. Another important finding of this study is that preload dependence-driven fluid resuscitation resulted in a stepwise increase in the amount of administered fluids as patient severity increased (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), as opposed to CVP-driven resuscitation. This suggests that such strategy may help to tailor fluid administration, by selecting the most severe patients for aggressive fluid resuscitation, and emphasizes the lack of efficacy of CVP-driven resuscitation for that purpose.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Effects on outcomes</title><p>The present study did not find any significant effect of the intervention arm on shock duration, or any end point related to outcome. The interaction between patient severity and fluid administration may explain this finding since half of the intervention arm population was exposed to a more restrictive fluid resuscitation with no expected effect on shock duration and an expected beneficial effect on outcome criteria related to volume overload (the less severe patients), while the opposite was true in the more severe patients (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), making the study underpowered to detect significant differences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Clinical relevance of PPV</title><p>While we originally planned a combined use of PPV and PLR test to trigger fluid administration since many clinical scenarios preclude the use of PPV to test fluid responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], we observed that PPV validity criteria were marginally present in the study patients, mainly because of the strong adherence to low V<sub>T</sub> ventilation (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>), suggesting that PPV may be of little clinical use in the management of septic shock patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To sum up, in patients with septic shock titrating intravascular volume expansion with preload dependence indices did not change time to shock resolution but resulted in less daily fluids intake, including red blood cells, without worsening patient outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Key messages</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In septic shock patients, titrating intravascular volume expansion with preload dependence indices may have no effect on time to shock resolution.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This strategy is, however, associated with a decrease in both the daily amount of intravascular fluids and red blood cell transfusion, with no outcome penalty.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13054_2014_734_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
