Patients (aged &#x02265;12 years) with a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 50&#x02013;90% predicted and any combination of <italic>CFTR</italic> mutations, were randomly assigned, via a computer-based randomisation system, to receive 5 mL of either nebulised pGM169/GL67A gene&#x02013;liposome complex or 0&#x000b7;9% saline (placebo) every 28 days (plus or minus 5 days) for 1 year. Randomisation was stratified by % predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> (&#x0003c;70 <italic>vs</italic> &#x02265;70%), age (&#x0003c;18 <italic>vs</italic> &#x02265;18 years), inclusion in the mechanistic substudy, and dosing site (London or Edinburgh). Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the relative change in % predicted FEV<sub>1</sub>. The primary analysis was per protocol.

We noted a significant, albeit modest, treatment effect in the pGM169/GL67A group versus placebo at 12 months' follow-up (3&#x000b7;7%, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;1&#x02013;7&#x000b7;3; p=0&#x000b7;046). This outcome was associated with a stabilisation of lung function in the pGM169/GL67A group compared with a decline in the placebo group. We recorded no significant difference in treatment-attributable adverse events between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Monthly application of the pGM169/GL67A gene therapy formulation was associated with a significant, albeit modest, benefit in FEV<sub>1</sub> compared with placebo at 1 year, indicating a stabilisation of lung function in the treatment group. Further improvements in efficacy and consistency of response to the current formulation are needed before gene therapy is suitable for clinical care; however, our findings should also encourage the rapid introduction of more potent gene transfer vectors into early phase trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Medical Research Council/National Institute for Health Research Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation Programme.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cystic fibrosis has been a target for gene therapy since the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene was cloned in 1989.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Lung disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with cystic fibrosis, with a median age at death of 29 years (95% CI 27&#x02013;31).<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Early expectations of a rapid breakthrough were based on supposed ease of access to the target respiratory epithelium via inhaled aerosols.

Between June 12, 2012, and June 24, 2013, we randomly assigned 140 patients to receive placebo (n=62) or pGM169/GL67A (n=78), of whom 136 (97%) patients comprised the intention-to-treat population and 116 (83%) patients comprised the per-protocol population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Reasons for discontinuation in the intention-to-treat population were similar between groups (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Unless indicated otherwise, all subsequent details relate to the per-protocol population.</p><p>114 (98%) patients had paired pre-treatment and post-treatment measurements of % predicted FEV<sub>1</sub>. Of the two patients (both in the placebo group) who did not have paired measurements, one patient could not do the test because of a surgery-related pneumothorax and one withdrew because of time commitments and was unavailable for follow-up measurements. We recorded a significant ANCOVA-adjusted treatment effect in the pGM169/GL67A group versus placebo at 12 months' follow-up (3&#x000b7;7%, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;1&#x02013;7&#x000b7;3; p=0&#x000b7;046; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>) The relative changes within each of the individual groups were &#x02212;4&#x000b7;0% (95% CI &#x02212;6&#x000b7;6 to &#x02212;1&#x000b7;4) in the placebo group and &#x02212;0&#x000b7;4% (&#x02212;2&#x000b7;8 to 2&#x000b7;1) in the pGM169/GL67A group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Post-hoc analysis showed that 21 (18%) patients (n=6 in the placebo group and n=15 in the pGM169/GL67A group) had an improvement in % predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> of 5% or more of their individual baseline values. For comparison, the treatment effect in patients in the intention-to-treat population who had spirometry measurements both before dosing and within the protocol-defined window after their final dose (n=56 in the placebo group and n=65 in the pGM169/GL67A group) was 3&#x000b7;6% (95% CI 0&#x000b7;2&#x02013;7&#x000b7;0; p=0&#x000b7;039), with the 20 patients included in the intention-to-treat, but not per-protocol, analysis, receiving a mean of 3&#x000b7;7 doses (SD 1&#x000b7;9).</p><p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> summarises changes in a range of secondary outcomes.

We assessed whether a responder subgroup could be identified; the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref> summarises the prespecified subgroups.

Although some subgroups had larger treatment effects than others, these results were typically due to a greater decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> in the placebo group, rather than to any difference of effect in the pGM169/GL67A group (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Stratification by baseline % predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> suggested a difference, albeit non-significant, in treatment effect between patients with more severe disease (FEV<sub>1</sub> 49&#x000b7;6&#x02013;69&#x000b7;2% predicted), who had a treatment effect of 6&#x000b7;4% (95% CI 0&#x000b7;8&#x02013;12&#x000b7;1), and those with less severe disease (69&#x000b7;6&#x02013;89&#x000b7;9% predicted), who had a treatment effect of 0&#x000b7;2% (&#x02212;4&#x000b7;6 to 4&#x000b7;9; p<sub>interaction</sub>=0&#x000b7;065; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). In patients with more severe disease, post-trial and pre-trial changes in both the placebo group (&#x02212;4&#x000b7;9%) and the pGM169/GL67A group (1&#x000b7;5%) contributed to the treatment effect. Secondary outcomes showed a similar trend favouring the more severe category (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p><p>Patients in both treatment groups received a median of three (IQR one to five) courses of oral or intravenous antibiotics during the trial. Specifically, we assessed co-administered antibiotics during the critical analysis period from dose 11 to the end of the trial. Numbers of patients receiving any additional antibiotics were 26 (48%) in the placebo group and 30 (51%) in the pGM169/GL67A group (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> p=0&#x000b7;774). Thus, the observed FEV<sub>1</sub> treatment effect was considered to be independent of concurrent antibiotic courses.</p><p>No clinically relevant pattern of changes could be distinguished in the exploratory outcomes of activity and exercise monitoring and serum and sputum inflammatory markers (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). In the bronchoscopy group of the substudy, vector-specific DNA increased in 12 (86%) of 14 patients in the pGM169/GL67A group and was below the limit of quantification in all (n=7) placebo samples (p=0&#x000b7;001; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref>); vector-specific mRNA was below the level of sensitivity in both groups (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).

We recorded six serious adverse events, all in the pGM169/GL67A group (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Neither the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee nor the Trial Steering Committee regarded any serious adverse event as related to study drug; however, one event was considered to be possibly related to a trial procedure (bronchoscopy).

After monthly dosing for 1 year, we recorded evidence of a beneficial effect of gene therapy versus placebo on FEV<sub>1</sub>. No effect of sex, age, or whether patients were homozygous for the most common F508del <italic>CFTR</italic> mutation could be detected. No clinically important adverse events attributable to treatment with pGM169/GL67A were reported.</p><p>Although these findings are encouraging, they should be put into perspective. We noted a stabilisation of FEV<sub>1</sub> in the pGM169/GL67A group rather than an improvement. This stabilisation took place over a 1 year period and further work will be needed to see if this effect is maintained. The reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub> in the placebo group was within the range reported in some other prospective trials<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and is consistent with a median survival of 29 years, but is greater than would be expected from registry data.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Three factors are likely to have influenced this difference. First, the requirement for clinical stability at trial entry meant that patients might have been at their optimum respiratory health at this stage. Second, the enthusiasm of patients to enter the trial, accompanied by a focus on self-care, might have resulted in short-term improvements in lung function during the recruitment period. Both factors are likely to lead to a subsequent decline in lung function as patients regress to their mean values. Third, we included all available data, whether from stable patients or those with exacerbations, by contrast with registry data, which focuses on measurements obtained at annual review. Stabilisation of lung disease in itself is a worthwhile aim and we would caution against the bar being set too high for novel therapeutics in cystic fibrosis populations with an unselected range of mutations. The large response to ivacaftor in patients with class III mutations takes place in the context of correctly localised CFTR protein. By contrast, much smaller improvements in lung function were shown in the ivacaftor&#x02013;lumacaftor trial for the most common mutation (phe508del) in which the CFTR protein is misfolded and mislocalised.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>The response in our study was heterogeneous, with apparent responders and non-responders. The data suggest that an approximate doubling of treatment effect was achieved in patients with more severe disease stratified by baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>, supported by trends in other clinically relevant secondary measures. A larger trial with a stratified trial entry design, powered to assess subgroups, and that addresses the mechanisms of response heterogeneity, will be important to verify or refute these data. This differential response could relate to the dose deposited in the airways; in patients with lower baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> the relatively more obstructed smaller airways result in a larger proportion of the 5 mL dose being deposited in the larger airways. In pre-trial studies we assessed airway deposition in patients with cystic fibrosis with varying FEV<sub>1</sub> severity with technetium-99m labelled human serum albumin of similar droplet size (3&#x02013;4 &#x003bc;m, using a different nebuliser system) to the pGM169/GL67A formulation. Bronchial airway (generations 2&#x02013;8) fractional deposition was 2&#x000b7;9% of delivered dose (standard error of the mean [SEM] 0&#x000b7;2; n=33) in patients with 70&#x02013;90% predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> and roughly twice as great (6&#x000b7;0%, SEM 1&#x000b7;0; n=23) in those with 50&#x02013;70% predicted FEV<sub>1</sub>. An additional contributory factor to this enhanced efficacy might be the increased mitotic rate of more severely affected tissues,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> which decreases the proportion of time that the nuclear membrane is intact, the membrane acting as a barrier to plasmid DNA entry to the nucleus.</p><p>We cannot rule out that the changes recorded in the present study are the result of a non-specific response to the pGM169/GL67A formulation. The placebo was 0&#x000b7;9% saline rather than a scrambled or <italic>CFTR</italic>-deleted plasmid&#x02013;liposome complex. We selected 0&#x000b7;9% saline partly on the basis of pragmatic financial considerations, but mainly for ethical considerations, not wishing to expose patients with cystic fibrosis to first-in-man repeated pulmonary dosing of an untested product that might direct the expression of an immunologically active peptide or novel non-coding RNA molecule with deleterious biological functions. Furthermore, we wanted to compare progression on therapy with the natural history of the disease. In terms of alternative explanations for the effects we noted, we know of no evidence that monthly nebulisation of 0&#x000b7;9% saline is deleterious to lung function, nor that liposome alone produces physiological improvements in either patients without,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> or those with<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> cystic fibrosis. Delivery of non-CFTR encoding plasmid DNAs to the human airways has not been associated with a gain in CFTR chloride-channel function, nor improvement in any cystic fibrosis-related assay,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and plasmid DNA is generally associated with pro-inflammatory, rather than non-specific, beneficial effects.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> We did not identify any pathophysiological changes in the airways, such as inflammation or remodelling, nor any changes in bacterial species that might otherwise explain the outcomes. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that DNA&#x02013;liposome complexes augment host defences, stimulate mucus clearance, or enhance bacterial killing to an extent undetectable on semi-quantitative routine culture.</p><p>Results showing more robust changes in molecular CFTR surrogates would have been reassuring. Despite extensive optimisation of quantitative realtime-PCR assays, the pGM169-derived mRNA assay has poor sensitivity and is adversely affected by the inclusion of high levels of total RNA or modest concentrations of pGM169 plasmid DNA. In ovine studies we have shown that a 20 mL nebulised dose of pGM169/GL67A, four times that used in the present trial, is the lower threshold for reproducible detection of mRNA with this assay in airway tissue samples (unpublished).<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Thus, our inability to detect pGM169-derived mRNA after delivery of 5 mL of pGM169/GL67A to the human airways, although disappointing, was not surprising. In human tissues, we have noted the low sensitivity of assays assessing vector-specific mRNA from human samples in vivo,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and have noted the greater sensitivity of detection of electrophysiological changes, consistent with findings in this study.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The ratio of area sampled to area dosed is small. Although we recorded significant chloride secretory changes in the bronchial, but not the nasal, epithelium, we caution against placing undue weight on either observation. The size of the groups in the mechanistic substudy was limited by both the practicality of the procedures and the acceptability to patients of the additional invasive tests, leading to low statistical power for these measures. We would instead conclude that modest variable changes can be shown with currently available assays that remain insufficiently sensitive to detect changes in low levels of CFTR function when assessed in vivo in humans; further optimisation in these or other assays is needed.</p><p>Although we are encouraged by the first demonstration of a significant beneficial effect in lung function compared with placebo associated with gene therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis, the mean difference was modest, only recorded in some individuals, and at the lower end of the range of results seen in clinical trials which result in changes in patient-related care.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We did not formally assess infective exacerbations in view of the fairly small patient numbers in our study, but use of antibiotic courses as a surrogate identified no obvious treatment advantage.

The plotted value in panel B is the mean of all interpretable recordings (range 1&#x02013;3), and in panel C is the most negative value obtained from all interpretable recordings, at each timepoint for that patient. A more negative value is in the non-cystic fibrosis direction. LOQ=limit of quantification, PBNQ=positive but not quantifiable.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr4"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline and demographic characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th align="left"><bold>Placebo group (n=54)</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>pGM169/GL67A group (n=62)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Age (years)</td><td align="left">26&#x000b7;0 (13&#x000b7;0)</td><td align="left">23&#x000b7;6 (10&#x000b7;8)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">&#x0003c;18 years old</td><td align="left">17 (31%)</td><td align="left">23 (37%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">&#x02265;18 years old</td><td align="left">37 (69%)</td><td align="left">39 (63%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left">Sex</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Female</td><td align="left">25 (46%)</td><td align="left">31 (50%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Male</td><td align="left">29 (54%)</td><td align="left">31 (50%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left">Centre distribution number</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Edinburgh</td><td align="left">24 (44%)</td><td align="left">22 (35%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">London</td><td align="left">30 (56%)</td><td align="left">40 (65%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Height (cm)</td><td align="left">165&#x000b7;0 (10&#x000b7;6)</td><td align="left">163&#x000b7;6 (10&#x000b7;9)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Weight (kg)</td><td align="left">61&#x000b7;6 (15&#x000b7;6)</td><td align="left">61&#x000b7;0 (15&#x000b7;7)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">FEV<sub>1</sub> (% predicted)</td><td align="left">69&#x000b7;0 (9&#x000b7;9)</td><td align="left">69&#x000b7;9 (11&#x000b7;1)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Body-mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="left">22&#x000b7;4 (4&#x000b7;4)</td><td align="left">22&#x000b7;4 (4&#x000b7;5)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left">Mutation class</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Phe508del/Phe508del</td><td align="left">26 (48%)</td><td align="left">31 (50%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Phe508del/class 1&#x02013;6</td><td align="left">22 (41%)</td><td align="left">23 (37%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Not Phe508del/class 1</td><td align="left">1 (2%)</td><td align="left">3 (5%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Heterozygous/homozygous class 3&#x02013;6</td><td align="left">2 (4%)</td><td align="left">2 (3%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Phe508del/unknown class</td><td align="left">3 (6%)</td><td align="left">3 (5%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Data are mean (SD) or n (%), unless otherwise indicated.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Adverse events</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="left"><bold>Placebo group (n=54)</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>pGM169/GL67A group (n=62)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Lower airway respiratory symptoms</td><td align="left">7&#x000b7;9</td><td align="left">9&#x000b7;0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Gastrointestinal symptoms</td><td align="left">2&#x000b7;1</td><td align="left">1&#x000b7;8</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Fever or flu-like symptoms</td><td align="left">1&#x000b7;1</td><td align="left">1&#x000b7;4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Headache</td><td align="left">1&#x000b7;2</td><td align="left">1&#x000b7;1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Upper airway symptoms</td><td align="left">2&#x000b7;3</td><td align="left">3&#x000b7;4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Elevated liver function tests</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;3</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Haematuria</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;2</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Isolated raised inflammatory markers</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;8</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;7</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Other</td><td align="left">3&#x000b7;2</td><td align="left">3&#x000b7;3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total</td><td align="left">19&#x000b7;1</td><td align="left">21&#x000b7;2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Data are mean number of times the respective symptom was experienced by each patient during the trial.
