In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, we compared the effects of salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate (FP) (Seretide&#x02122;; SFC) and FP plus montelukast (FP/M) on sputum inflammatory markers, airway responsiveness, lung function, and symptoms in adult asthmatics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Sixty-six subjects were randomised to SFC or FP/M for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was changes in neutrophil, eosinophil, macrophage, lymphocyte, and epithelial cell levels in induced sputum. Additional outcomes included the change in other sputum markers of airway inflammation, airway responsiveness, symptom control, and lung function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both treatments had no significant effect on induced sputum inflammatory cells, although there was a trend for a reduction in sputum eosinophils. Both treatments significantly improved airway responsiveness, whereas SFC generally led to greater improvements in symptom control and lung function than FP/M. FP/M led to significantly greater reductions in sputum cysteinyl leukotrienes than SFC (treatment ratio 1.80; 95% CI 1.09, 2.94).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both treatments led to similar control of eosinophilic airway inflammation, although PEF and symptom control were better with SFC.</p></sec><sec><title>Study number</title><p>SAM40030 (SOLTA)</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Asthma is a complex disorder characterised by airway hyperresponsiveness and variable airflow obstruction in association with eosinophilic airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is usually the first line of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For patients whose asthma is poorly controlled on ICS therapy alone, current management guidelines recommend add-on therapy with a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist, or alternatively a leukotriene receptor antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A recent Cochrane systematic review of eight randomised controlled trials has shown that the addition of a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist (salmeterol or formoterol) to existing ICS therapy leads to more effective asthma control than addition of a leukotriene receptor antagonist (montelukast or zafirlukast) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The combination of a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>agonist and an ICS led to significant reductions in the risk of exacerbations, night awakenings, and rescue medication use, and significant improvements in lung function, symptoms, and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The exact relationship between the underlying inflammatory processes and the clinical expression of asthma is complex and not fully understood. Cross-sectional studies have shown only a weak correlation at best between the severity of airway inflammation, measured by inflammatory cell counts or nitric oxide exhalation, and airway hyper-responsiveness, severity of symptoms, or abnormalities in lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. There is limited information on the effects of long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists and leukotriene receptor antagonists on eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma. A better understanding of these effects might inform our understanding of the relationship between inflammation and the clinical expression of asthma. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of the combination of salmeterol and the ICS fluticasone propionate (FP) (Seretide&#x02122;; SFC) versus adding montelukast to FP therapy (FP/M) on airway inflammatory markers, and to relate these effects to changes in airway responsiveness, lung function, and symptom control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Asthma patients aged 18&#x02013;50 years, who were non-smokers and receiving a stable dose of up to 400 &#x003bc;g of beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) a day or equivalent ICS, but requiring further therapy, were recruited. Additional inclusion criteria included likelihood of compliance with the protocol requirements and ability, following instruction, to use an Accuhaler and mini-Wright peak flow meter. The criteria for randomisation were: a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 61&#x02013;85% of the predicted normal value; and a PC<sub>20 </sub>&#x0003c; 8 mg/ml with methacholine challenge. In addition, all patients had to have at least one of the following: diary card recording of symptoms (score of one or more for day and night combined) on &#x02265; 4 of the last seven days of the run-in period; recorded use of relief medication (inhaled Ventolin) on &#x02265; 2 different days during the last seven days of the run-in period; and a period variation in peak expiratory flow (PEF) of &#x02265; 10% over the last seven days of the run in period. Patients who did not meet the latter three criteria were able to repeat the run-in period once more. Patients who fulfilled any of the following exclusion criteria did not take part in the study: were taking or had previously taken additional asthma medication, other than an ICS or short acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist or oral corticosteroids in the last three months; acute respiratory infection or exacerbation of asthma within four weeks of screening, any additional underlying lung disease, or any significant disease warranting exclusion; hospitalisation or emergency treatment (for &#x0003e; 24 hours) for acute asthma in the last 12 months; were a smoker, had smoked in the last six months, or had a smoking history of 10 pack years or more; pregnant or lactating women, or women of child-bearing potential not using adequate contraception; evidence of alcohol, drug, or solvent abuse; hypersensitivity to any component of the study formulations, or taking medication contraindicated in combination with the study formulations; and previous entry to the study or receipt of any investigational drugs within four weeks of screening.</p><p>The study was approved by the ethics committee appropriate to each centre before any subjects were enrolled at that centre, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects gave written informed consent before entering the study. The study ran from May 2001 to August 2002.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design and treatments</title><p>This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, single-dummy, parallel group study comparing SFC with FP/M. After an initial screening visit, subjects participated in a 2-week run-in period to determine eligibility for randomisation based on a number of pre-specified criteria. During the run-in period, subjects continued to take their normal dose of ICS and recorded details of symptoms and relief medication use on diary cards. During the treatment period, subjects discontinued their normal asthma medication and were consecutively randomised according to a pre-defined randomisation list to either Seretide 50 (GlaxoSmithKline; salmeterol 25 &#x003bc;g/FP 50 &#x003bc;g) metered dose inhaler (MDI) two puffs twice daily (bd) (SFC) plus a placebo to montelukast once daily (od) at night or FP 50 &#x003bc;g MDI (Flixotide&#x02122;, GlaxoSmithKline) two puffs bd plus montelukast 10 mg od at night (FP/M) for 12 weeks, with an interim clinic visit at six weeks. Treatment allocation was concealed from the subject, pharmacist, and investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was the levels of inflammatory cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and epithelial cells in induced sputum. Secondary outcome measures were the levels of the inflammatory markers cysteinyl leukotrienes (C-LT), histamine, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in induced sputum, bronchial responsiveness to methacholine, the percentages of symptom-free days and nights, the percentages of rescue medication-free days and nights, and lung function measurements (FEV<sub>1 </sub>measured by spirometer and patient assessed morning and evening PEF). The safety outcome measure was adverse events (AEs).</p></sec><sec><title>Induced sputum collection and analysis</title><p>Subjects inhaled increasing concentrations (3%, 4%, 5%) of 5 ml nebulised pyrogen-free hypertonic saline, and after each inhalation were encouraged to cough sputum into a plastic container [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. If FEV<sub>1 </sub>fell by &#x0003e; 10% or 200 ml but &#x0003c; 20% or 400 ml during the initial inhalation, then 3% saline was used for the second and third inhalations. If FEV<sub>1 </sub>fell by &#x0003e; 20% or 400 ml or significant symptoms developed, nebulisation was stopped and the subject was treated with a short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist. The sputum samples were analysed for the following inflammatory markers: neutrophils; eosinophils; lymphocytes; epithelial cells; histamine, as a marker of mast cell activation; C-LT, as a marker of mast cell and eosinophil activation; and IL-8, as a marker of neutrophil activation. Sputum IL-8, C-LT and histamine were measured using standard ELISA kits (BD Pharmagen, Immunotech and Cayman chemicals respectively). These assays have been previously validated for use in sputum supernatants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The sensitivity levels of the assay were 13 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3</sup>, 0.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3</sup>, 50 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3 </sup>ng/ml for C-LTs, IL-8 and histamine. The intra-assay coefficient of variability was 5&#x02013;10% and the interassay coefficient of variability 3&#x02013;15% across a range of concentrations of mediators measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Methacholine challenge</title><p>After measurement of baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>, subjects were administered doubling doses of methacholine chloride (0.025&#x02013;25 mg/ml; manufacturer: methapharm inc) every five minutes followed by measurement of FEV<sub>1</sub>. The procedure was continued until FEV<sub>1 </sub>fell by &#x02265; 20% or until the highest concentration of methacholine chloride was reached. The cumulative provocation concentration of methacholine causing a 20% reduction in FEV<sub>1 </sub>(PC<sub>20</sub>) was determined by linear interpolation between log concentrations enclosing a 20% reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub>. The change in methacholine PC<sub>20 </sub>was expressed in doubling concentrations calculated for each subject using the following formula:</p><p><disp-formula>(log<sub>10 </sub>PC<sub>20 </sub>end of treatment - log<sub>10 </sub>PC<sub>20 </sub>baseline)/log<sub>10</sub>(2)</disp-formula></p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>As this was an exploratory study, no formal sample size calculation was carried out: sample size was, therefore, limited by subject availability.</p><p>All summaries and analyses are for the intention-to-treat population (all subjects receiving at least one dose of the study drug). No imputations were performed for missing data. Therefore if data were missing for either baseline or one of the timepoints, it was not possible to calculate a change from baseline. However, all available data have been used for relevant summaries. The change from baseline in levels of the primary inflammatory markers and IL-8 was analysed within each treatment group using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, owing to the non-normality of the data. Between group comparisons for the primary inflammatory markers, IL-8, symptom-free days and nights, and rescue-free days and nights were analysed using the van Elteren extension to the Wilcoxon rank sum test, adjusting for baseline values. The confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Hodges-Lehmann method, ignoring the adjustment for baseline and pooling all treatment differences.</p><p>The results of analyses with log transformed values (C-LT and histamine) and log<sub>10 </sub>transformed PC<sub>20 </sub>values are back transformed and presented as ratios of geometric means or doubling dose changes rather than log differences. The ratio of SFC to FP/M was also calculated and is referred to as the treatment ratio. Within and between group differences were analysed using the paired t-test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline values, respectively. Between treatment comparisons for change in FEV<sub>1 </sub>and morning and evening PEF were also analysed using ANCOVA, adjusting for baseline values, age, sex, and height. Age, sex and height were adjusted for in these analyses to balance out differences expected. All statistical tests were two-sided and significance was accepted at the 5% level.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Demographic and baseline characteristics</title><p>Of the 132 subjects enrolled into the study, 66 were randomised to treatment, 33 in each treatment group.

The results are based on a small exploratory study and should be considered as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive.</p><p>The primary outcome was the extent of airway inflammation as determined by the levels of inflammatory cells in sputum. We chose to analyse induced sputum samples as opposed to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or bronchial biopsy as the procedure is less invasive and has been shown to be more sensitive for detecting changes in markers of airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We found that sputum eosinophil counts were generally low in those patients with symptomatic asthma already established on treatment with a low or moderate dose ICS. Neither treatment combination led to significant changes from baseline in the primary inflammatory markers. Recent studies suggest reduction in peripheral blood eosinophil counts with the addition of montelukast to ICS therapy in patients with poorly controlled asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The lack of effect on sputum eosinophils might reflect the low baseline levels.</p><p>We did see a significantly greater reduction in the concentration of C-LT with FP/M compared with SFC. Montelukast has no known effect on leukotriene biosynthesis so an effect on C-LT concentrations would not be anticipated. Perhaps montelukast reduces the activation status of inflammatory cells producing C-LT. Neither treatment combination had any effect on the concentration of other inflammatory mediators.</p><p>A notable finding of the current study is that most patients with symptomatic asthma despite treatment with low dose ICS had no sputum evidence of eosinophilic airway inflammation. Moreover, the improvement in symptoms, airway responsiveness, and lung function seen with additional salmeterol, and to a lesser extent montelukast, was not associated with any change in the sputum eosinophil count. These observations provide further support for the view that the mechanisms that cause symptoms and abnormal airway function can be disassociated from eosinophilic airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The residual symptoms and abnormal airway function seen in our patients in the absence of eosinophilic airway inflammation could reflect the effect of permanent structural changes due to airway remodelling, although the beneficial effects of long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists seen in this and other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] suggest that they are, at least partly, due to the presence of a corticosteroid resistant, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist responsive abnormality of airway function.</p><p>Generally, SFC treatment led to better symptom control and improved lung function than the FP/M combination, with significantly more rescue medication-free nights and greater increases relative to baseline in morning and evening PEF. These results are consistent with the results of the Cochrane review, which suggested superiority for the long-acting &#x003b2;2-agonist and ICS combination over the combination of a leukotriene receptor antagonist and an ICS, with significantly greater improvements in lung function, symptom control, and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The findings of the current study are important in that they suggest that the beneficial effects of long-acting &#x003b2;2-agonist and ICS combination over the combination of a leukotriene receptor antagonist and an ICS are also seen in a population who do not have to meet inclusion criteria which include a large acute bronchodilator response. There has been concern that the greater suppression of clinical expression of asthma seen with long acting &#x003b2;2-agonists might be associated with masking of eosinophilic airway inflammation and perhaps a higher risk of serious exacerbations and/or airway remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our findings clearly indicate that, when given in the form of a combination inhaler, there is no evidence of worsening airway inflammation when salmeterol is added to low dose ICS.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When added to low dose inhaled FP, neither salmeterol nor montelukast were associated with significant changes in sputum inflammatory cells. The addition of salmeterol to FP produced significantly better symptom control and PEF than the addition of montelukast.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>IP has received payments for lectures and for attending scientific conferences from GSK and Astra Zeneca.
