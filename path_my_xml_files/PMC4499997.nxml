forward head posture and respiratory function. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty male and
female adults in their 20s with forward head posture were included in the study. The
subjects were divided randomly into experimental and control groups (n=15 each). Subjects
in the experimental group performed cervical sustained natural apophyseal glide three
times/week for four weeks while subjects in the control group did not perform the
intervention. The craniovertebral angle, forced vital capacity and forced expiratory
volume in the first second, as well as the % predicted value of each measurement were
assessed to determine the changes in respiration functions before and after the exercise.
[Results] The craniovertebral angle four weeks after the experiment was increased in the
experimental group, whereas the control group showed no significant difference compared to
baseline. The forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in the first second, and the
% predicted values thereof were significantly increased in the experimental group four
weeks after the experiment, but not in the control group. [Conclusion] Cervical sustained
natural apophyseal glide was determined to be effective in improving neck posture and
respiratory functions for patients with forward head posture.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cervical SNAG</kwd><kwd>Forward head posture</kwd><kwd>Respiratory function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Forward head posture is anterior positioning of the cervical spine, which is regarded as a
&#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; head posture and is commonly found in patients who experience problems with the head
and neck<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Particularly, forward head
posture is frequently found in people sitting in front of a computer for prolonged periods.
Load increases in the muscles and joints of the cervical spine as a result of forward head
posture are considered a major cause of musculoskeletal disorders<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sustained computer work affects the range of cervical
flexion, especially in the upper cervical part<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and forward head posture is related to reduced proprioception<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Respiration is a complex function that involves cooperation between the musculoskeletal and
nervous systems, by which air can move in and out of the lungs according to changes in the
volume of the rib cage<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The loss of
respiratory functions is related to functional disorders associated with trunk posture and
weakening of the respiratory muscles<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Forward head posture reduces muscle power in the neck, which is followed by a reduction in
muscle power of the respiratory muscles. Thus, damage in the respiratory muscles is
associated with damage of the motor control in the cervical spine. In addition, forward head
posture has a negative effect on the expansion of the thorax and alveolar ventilation,
thereby reducing the lung volume and vital capacity as well as weakening respirator
functions<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Joint mobilization is a method that applies traction and gliding techniques passively to
the articular surface in order to maintain or recover mobility back to the normal state.
These movements are applied by a physical therapist, and this is a passive technique that is
performed at slow speed, allowing the patients to stop the movement by themselves.</p><p>Mulligan first proposed the use of Sustained Natural Apophyseal Glide (SNAG) mobilization,
which can be applied for spinal pain treatment<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The concept of SNAG is to increase the treatment effects by having
patients perform active movements while removing pain in the lesions by means of
manipulative therapy. This is a new concept in the manipulative therapy field, and differs
from traditional manipulative therapy by combining the active movements of the patients with
additional passive movements performed with the aid of therapists<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. It should be noted that while applying SNAG mobilization,
the therapist needs to apply the exercise to be horizontal or perpendicular to the joint,
and the movements of the patient should be performed within a range in which the patient
does not feel any pain. At the end of the joint movement, the therapist may apply slight
overpressure<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Silveria et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> revealed that
respiratory functions can change as a result of forward head posture and that inappropriate
posture may worsen respiratory functions, particularly in patients with respiratory
diseases<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, forward head
posture can induce inappropriate posture, thereby causing compensation mechanisms to
increase the respiratory functions, and Kim et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> moreover reported that forward head posture induced weakening of
the respiratory functions.</p><p>Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the cervical SNAG
mobilization proposed by Mulligan on forward head posture and various respiratory
functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects included individuals whose craniovertebral angle was &#x02264;49&#x000b0;<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> in order to determine the effects of
cervical SNAG manipulative therapy on forward head posture and respiratory function, and the
subjects were randomly classified into an experimental group receiving cervical SNAG and a
control group not receiving the intervention. The changes after the exercise were measured
and compared against the baseline and between the two groups.</p><p>This study conducted experiments with male and female adults in their 20s who had forward
head posture. Thirty subjects who understood the purpose of this study and participated
voluntarily were randomly classified into the experimental (15 subjects) and control groups
(15 subjects). The exclusion criteria were as follows: subjects who had undergone operations
in the spinal bones or chest, had traumatic neck injury, had acute or chronic neuromuscular
pain not related to other body parts, had severe obesity (body mass index
[BMI]&#x0003e;40&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), had clinical abnormalities in the rib cage or spine, had
severe comorbid diseases, had diabetes or malignant tumors, and who were smokers.</p><p>Subjects in the experimental group underwent cervical SNAG manipulative therapy as an
intervention to treat forward head posture for flexion and extension, eight times per set,
three times a week for four weeks.</p><p>During the therapy, the subjects were seated on chairs with back support while a therapist
was positioned behind the subject. The therapist applied a force to the spinous process in
the upper side of the fixed joint with the thumb of the right hand and applied a passive
gliding exercise continuously, while the left thumb was placed with the right thumb. The
gliding exercise of the cervical SNAG for cervical flexion was performed by the subjects
actively repeating flexion of their necks and returning back to the neutral position. In
addition, cervical SNAG for extension was conducted by the subjects repeatedly performing
extension of their necks and returning back to the neutral position. Here, the application
of the passive gliding exercise maintained its direction in the anterosuperior direction
along the line of the articular surface of the facet joint while flexing the neck and
returning back to the neutral position, as well as when extending the neck and returning
back to the neutral position repeatedly<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To determine whether the subjects had forward head posture or not, the craniovertebral
angle was measure while respiratory function was measured using a spirometer.</p><p>The craniovertebral angle is measured to determine the presence of forward head posture,
which is assessed by the head position when observed laterally at the seventh cervical (C7)
vertebra. This angle is formed by a horizontal line drawn through the spinous process of the
C7 vertebra and a line joining the spinous process of the C7 vertebra with the tragus of the
ear. The more anterior head position is observed, the smaller the angle is<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the measurement, the subjects
maintained the upright posture while relaxing both their arms next to their trunk and gazed
at a predetermined point according to their eye height. To measure the accurate position
while taking a picture, positions of the tragus of the ear and the spinous process of the C7
vertebra were marked. Once a photo was shot laterally using a digital camera (IXUS951S;
Canon, China), the craniovertebral angle was calculated using ImageJ software (Rasband,
USA)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the study by
Nemmers et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, forward head posture is
defined by a craniovertebral angle in the range of 49&#x02013;59&#x000b0;. Thus, this study set the
criterion of forward head posture as &#x02264;49&#x000b0; in terms of the craniovertebral angle.</p><p>The respiratory functions of each subject were measured using a spirometer (SP-260
Pneumotacho Sensor; SCHILLER AG, Switzerland). Three measurements were taken and the mean
was chosen as the test result if they showed reproducibility.</p><p>The measurements were performed while the subjects were in the upright position, and
included forced vital capacity (FVC), % predicted value of forced vital capacity (FVC
%pred.), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and % predicted value of
the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1%</sub>pred.).</p><p>Differences in the forward head posture and respiratory functions between the two groups
before and after the experiment were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, whereas the
differences in forward head posture and respiratory functions before and after the treatment
period within a group were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The data were
analyzed using PASW ver. 18.0 (SPSS Inc., USA). The significance level (&#x003b1;) was set to
0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>This study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Catholic University of Pusan

and surrounding joints. Forward head posture can increase kyphosis, and excessive kyphosis
of the thoracic spine due to forward head posture can reduce the mobility of the thorax,
thereby having a negative effect on the respiration capabilities<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
changes in the posture have been known to affect the length of the respiratory muscles
during the breathing rest<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim et
al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> measured the craniovertebral
angle of healthy adults in their 20s and studied 15 subjects with forward head posture
(experimental group) and 15 healthy adults (control group) by measuring and comparing their
respiratory functions. The experiment result showed that the mean FVC %pred. of the subjects
in the experimental group was 81.95%, while that of the control group was 93.54%. Moreover,
the mean FEV<sub>1%</sub>pred. of the subjects in the experimental group was 90.20%, while
that of the control group was 99.62%, indicating that the respiration functions in the
experimental group were significantly lower than those of the control group.</p><p>In a study by Oh<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, the subjects were
divided into a joint mobilization group, for which cervical SNAG mobilization was applied; a
neuro-feedback group; and a control group, and changes in the neck postures after the
treatments were compared. The results showed that joint mobilization had the most
significant effect on postural improvements in the neck. In the present study, there was no
significant difference in the craniovertebral angle between the two groups before the
intervention, whereas the experimental group showed significant improvements after four
weeks of intervention. On the other hand, no significant changes were observed in the
control group after the four-week period. Hence, these results suggest that cervical SNAG
mobilization is effective in improving forward head posture.</p><p>Kim<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> divided subjects with forward head
posture into an experimental group, for which the McKenzie intervention was applied, and a
control group. No significant differences in respiration functions were observed between the
groups before the intervention, whereas significant improvements were noted in the subjects
in the experimental group after four weeks of intervention. Furthermore, another previous
study aimed to determine the effect of thoracic spine posture correction using chiropractic
manipulations, and divided the subjects into a thoracic spine correction group using manual
therapy and a thoracic spine correction group using an impulse gun, after which the
differences in vital capacity were compared before and after the interventions. The results
revealed that the subjects in both groups showed significantly increased vital capacity
after the interventions<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study,
the experimental group demonstrated significantly improved respiration functions after the
intervention, whereas no significant differences were observed in the control group compared
to at baseline. Accordingly, after the four-week intervention, statistically significant
differences in the respiration functions were found between the experimental and control
groups. Hwangbo<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted experiments
with 45 chronic neck pain patients who had thoracic kyphosis and divided the subjects into
thoracic joint mobilization, self-stretching exercise, and thoracic joint mobilization plus
self-stretching exercise groups. All three groups showed significantly improved joint range
of motion and respiratory functions after the interventions. The above study results are
consistent with those of the present study, in which postural correction through
manipulative therapy was found to be an effective method for recovering and improving
respiratory functions.</p><p>In conclusion, cervical SNAG mobilization, which has been previously shown to reduce neck
pain and increase the joint range of motion, can also help recover the posture of persons
with forward head posture and improve their respiratory functions.</p><p>As a limitation of this study, the experiments were conducted only on young adults in their
20s, and the effects of this treatment on people of various ages were not examined.
Furthermore, our study also did not verify how long the effects are maintained after the
intervention. Therefore, it will be necessary to conduct a study on the effects of cervical
SNAG mobilization on forward head posture and respiratory functions in subjects of various
ages and to determine how long the effects continue after the intervention in the
future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by RESEARCH FUND offered from Catholic University of Pusan.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Good</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Stiller</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Zauszniewski</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Sensation and distress of pain scales: reliability,
