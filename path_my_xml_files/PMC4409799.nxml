The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of increased water content during thermal cycling of hot water-treated acrylic on the surface hardness of acrylic denture base when compared to warm water treated acrylic. And to compare the bleaching effect of alkaline peroxide solution on the acrylic denture base on hot water and warm water treated acrylic.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Forty samples (10 mm &#x000d7; 10 mm &#x000d7; 2.5 mm) were prepared. After the calculation of the initial hardness 40 samples, each was randomly assigned to two groups. Group A: 20 samples were immersed in 250 ml of warm distilled water at 40&#x000b0;C with alkaline peroxide tablet. Group B: 20 samples were immersed in 250 ml of hot distilled water at 100&#x000b0;C with alkaline peroxide tablet. The surface hardness of each test sample was obtained using the digital hardness testing machine recording the Rockwell hardness number before the beginning of the soaking cycles and after completion of 30 soak cycles and compared. Values were analyzed using paired <italic>t</italic>-test. Five samples from the Group A and five samples from Group B were put side by side and photographed using a Nikon D 40 digital SLR Camera and the photographs were examined visually to assess the change in color.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Acrylic samples immersed in hot water showed a statistically significant decrease of 5.8% in surface hardness.

After setting of the stone, a thin layer of petroleum jelly was applied all over the set plaster as well as the dies. The counter of the flask was then poured with dental stone under vibration and finally the lid was placed over the counter and the entire assembly was secured using a dental clamp. After the dental stone had set according to manufactures instructions plus 10-15 min, the flask was opened, and the dies were gently teased out.

This water exerts a significant effect on the mechanical and dimensional properties of the polymer. Although the absorption is facilitated by the polarity of polymethyl methacrylate molecules, a diffusion mechanism is primarily responsible for the ingress of water. The introduction of water molecules within the polymerized mass produces two important effects. First, it causes a slight expansion of the polymerized mass. Second, water molecules interfere with the entanglement of polymer chains and thereby act as plasticizers.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>This water absorption along with the change in temperature of the environment in which the denture base is may cause degradation of the denture polymers.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Mechanical properties of the acrylic resin are affected by the heat and water sorption due to the changes in polymer chains which in turn soften the denture.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> on the other hand some studies showed a gradual increase in surface hardness of some denture base resins after water immersion.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>This improvement in the hardness property has been attributed in part to leaching of the residual monomer from the resin as the residual monomer may adversely affect the mechanical properties of denture base resins by having a plasticizing effect.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This rate of diffusion of monomer out of the resin into water decreases progressively.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>A routine denture cleaning regimen which includes the mechanical and chemical cleansing is also a very important part of the denture use and maintenance to remove and prevent reaccumulation of microbial plaque and also to remove mucin, food debris, calculus, and exogenous discoloration.</p><p>Alkaline peroxides cleansers which are used in this study when dissolved in water converts into hydrogen peroxide reduces the surface tension, and effervescent oxygen helps in mechanical cleaning which are more effective over a long period of immersion.</p><p>According to some studies, prolonged immersion of heat or chemically cured acrylic resin in peroxide cleansers did not affect the surface of the acrylic resins.</p><p>According to some studies, prolonged immersion of heat or chemically cured acrylic resin in peroxide cleansers did not affect the surface of the acrylic resins.
