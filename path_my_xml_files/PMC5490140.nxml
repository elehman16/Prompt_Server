Although blind insertion technique is most widely used, there are many techniques which are available such as priming the drain tube with a guiding instrument such as a suction catheter, a gum elastic bougie, a Flexi-Slip Stylet, direct laryngoscopy, and even a fiber-optic bronchoscope (FOB). The present study was undertaken to compare and assess the placement of LMA ProSeal using blind versus direct laryngoscopy techniques using FOB.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A prospective randomized comparative study of 110 patients divided into two groups of 55 each as Group I (blind insertion) and Group II (direct laryngoscopic insertion) after satisfying the inclusion criteria. The anatomical position was assessed by flexible FOB and evaluated based on fiber-optic scoring system.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>In the present study, demographic characteristics, vital parameters, Mallampati score, and Wilson's score were comparable in both the groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The fiber-optic score (FOS) 1 in Group II was 78.18% compared to 60% in Group I, but the difference was statistically not significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Furthermore, the mean FOS in Group II was slightly high (3.84 &#x000b1; 0.87) compared to Group II (1.62 &#x000b1; 0.87), but the difference was statistically not significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Further hemodynamic parameters (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) and complications (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) were comparable in both the groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The LMA placement scoring was similar in both blind and direct laryngoscopic techniques.

The LMA ProSeal offers higher glottic sealing pressure than the LMA classic, facilitating positive pressure ventilation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It has a built-in drain tube that allows gastric contents to bypass the pharynx. This specific feature is designed to decrease the risk of aspiration.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It includes all the benefits associated with the LMA airway such as fewer drugs used, lesser incidence of sore throat, reduced coughing and bucking on emergence, and improved hemodynamic stability.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>A fiber-optic bronchoscope (FOB) acts as a confirmation tool that assesses the adequacy of its position. Ideal intraoral positioning of an LMA ProSeal may be highly desirable. However, to date, very few studies have assessed whether blind technique or direct laryngoscopic technique of insertion is better. Hence, the present study was undertaken to assess and compare the placement of LMA ProSeal inserted by blind and direct laryngoscopic technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After institutional ethical clearance and written informed consent, 110 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I or II patients aged 18&#x02013;60 years of either sex, undergoing routine surgeries under general anesthesia with LMA were randomly divided into two groups of 55 each by a sealed envelope method. Group I blind insertion and Group II laryngoscopic insertion. Patients body mass index &#x0003e;35, previous neck surgeries, and upper airway anomalies were excluded from the study.</p><p>Preoperative airway assessment included the recording of Wilson's score and Mallampati grade. All the patients received oral pantoprazole 40 mg and oral ondansetron 4 mg on the morning of surgery as premedication. Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscularly was given half an hour before induction.</p><p>In the operating room, intravenous (IV) access was established and Ringer's lactate infusion started. Standard monitoring included electrocardiograph, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), and pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>). The LMA to be used was prepared for insertion with the cuff completely deflated and shaped, and its dorsal surface lubricated with a clear, water-based gel.</p><p>After preoxygenation for 3 min, the patient was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg, fentanyl 2 mcg/kg, and muscle relaxation facilitated by atracurium 0.5 mg/kg IV and ventilated for 3 min. The patient was placed in the sniffing position with the occiput rested on a firm pillow. LMA ProSeal insertion was done by anesthesia provider. The insertion technique for LMA ProSeal was identical to the recommended technique for the LMA ProSeal and included neck flexion, head extension, full deflation of the cuff, and the use of the index finger to press the LMA ProSeal into, and advance it around the palatopharyngeal curve in Group I. Direct laryngoscopy was performed using Macintosh blade to visualize epiglottis, the LMA ProSeal was then inserted until it was felt to seat in the hypopharynx and/or the proximal rim of the LMA ProSeal was all that could be seen in Group II.</p><p>All steps were performed with the cuff fully deflated and using a midline approach. Cuff inflation was done after insertion to obtain adequate airway seal. Fixation was done in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. LMA placement was confirmed with chest expansion and capnography. Patients were ventilated with 2 L/min fresh gas flow 6&#x02013;8 ml/kg tidal volume and respiratory rate 12&#x02013;14/min with circle system. Anesthesia was maintained with air oxygen mixture enriched with isoflurane 1%&#x02013;1.5%, and end-tidal carbon dioxide was maintained between 30 and 35 mmHg.</p><p>The anatomical position of the LMA ProSeal was assessed by introducing a flexible FOB into airway tube to a position proximal to the terminal end and graded as fiber-optic score (FOS) (1) clear view of vocal cords, (2) only arytenoid cartilages visible, (3) only epiglottis visible, and (4) no laryngeal structures visible.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>At the end of the procedure, after noting the patient's spontaneous breaths, neuromuscular blockade was reversed with injection neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg. After the return of protective airway reflexes, the LMA was removed.</p><p>Hemodynamic parameters including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, oxygen saturation, and pulse were recorded at baseline, induction, LMA insertion, 0, 1, and 5 min postinsertion. Presence of visible or occult blood after removal of airway device was also noted.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data obtained were coded and entered into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, using software SPSS version 18.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The categorical data were expressed in terms of rates, ratios, and percentage and continuous data were expressed as a mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. Independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare quantitative variables in the both groups. The categorical data were compared using Chi-square test. <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Based on a previous study and considering the 95% confidence interval, minimum detectable risk difference between the two groups as 15%, the sample size of 110 patients was arrived at. They were further divided into two groups of 55 each.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>The demographic data, ASA status, and Mallampati and Wilson score were comparable between the two groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].
