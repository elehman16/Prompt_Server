As such, there is a critical need to establish safe, practical alternatives to regular CR for enhancing cardiovascular function and health with aging in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The recent identification of several key molecular mechanisms responsible for CR-mediated longevity in model organisms has led to an exciting search for &#x0201c;CR-mimetic&#x0201d; interventions to improve cardiovascular and other physiological functions with aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In this regard, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) has emerged as a critical signaling molecule and essential substrate for sirtuins, a class of enzymes that mediate several of the beneficial effects of CR in model organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, including the maintenance of cardiovascular function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, CR has been shown to increase NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in pre-clinical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The cellular bioavailability of NAD<sup>+</sup> and related metabolites declines in animals and in humans during normal aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and may contribute to physiological aging by reducing sirtuin activity. Although NAD<sup>+</sup> can be synthesized de novo from the amino acid tryptophan, this process does not occur in all tissues, requiring most cells to rely on a salvage pathway for regenerating NAD<sup>+</sup> from other intracellular intermediates, which are primarily made available through dietary sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Vitamin B<sub>3</sub> (niacin: i.e., nicotinic acid and nicotinamide) enters this salvage pathway and acts as a NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor; however, nicotinic acid is associated with undesirable flushing at therapeutic doses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and nicotinamide does not reliably activate (and may even inhibit) sirtuins despite raising concentrations of NAD<sup>+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, administration of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide is unlikely to be widely adopted for maintaining health and function with aging.</p><p id="Par6">In contrast to these compounds, oral supplementation with either of the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolites, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or nicotinamide riboside (NR), increases levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> and improves multiple physiological functions in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that supplementation of NMN in the drinking water improved cardiovascular function in old mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Moreover, CR increases concentrations of NR and NAD<sup>+</sup> and restores normal circadian gene transcription in the liver, further suggesting that NR may act as a CR mimetic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Thus, NMN and NR are NAD<sup>+</sup> boosting compounds that hold promise for enhancing cardiovascular health and physiological function with aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Despite these encouraging results from preclinical studies, the tolerability and effectiveness of chronic supplementation with NMN or NR have not been established in humans. Because NR is readily taken up by cells and acts as a direct vitamin precursor for NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, its recent development as a dietary ingredient (NIAGEN<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, ChromaDex Inc., Irvine, CA) has provided the first opportunity to translate the potential benefits of NAD<sup>+</sup> boosting molecules to people. In this regard, a recent study showed that single doses of NR stimulated blood cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism in healthy humans in a dose-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, the tolerability of chronic NR supplementation and its efficacy for increasing NAD<sup>+</sup> bioavailability have not been established in humans, and we lack even initial insight into the potential of NR for improving cardiovascular and other physiological functions with human aging.</p><p id="Par8">To address these important research gaps, we conducted a small randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial of NR supplementation (500&#x02009;mg, 2&#x000d7;/day) to assess its overall tolerability and efficacy vs. placebo for raising levels of NAD<sup>+</sup>-related metabolites in healthy middle-aged and older men and women. We also took the opportunity to gain preliminary insight into the effects of chronic NR supplementation for improving cardiovascular and other physiological functions associated with risk of clinical diseases and/or disability with aging. Our results demonstrate that 6 weeks of NR supplementation at this dose is well-tolerated in humans and effectively increases blood cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations. Exploratory analyses of the effects of chronic NR supplementation on physiological function in this cohort of healthy middle-aged and older adults suggest that the potential for reducing systolic blood pressure and arterial stiffness may be the most promising hypotheses to investigate in future larger-scale clinical trials, particularly in individuals with elevated baseline blood pressure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subject enrollment and baseline characteristics</title><p id="Par9">Information on subject consent, randomization, testing and completion is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Sixty healthy middle-aged and older men and women between the ages of 55 and 79 years were consented for this study, which was registered on clinicaltrials.gov under the identifier NCT02921659 and conducted between March 2015 and September 2016. The individuals recruited for this study were lean (average BMI&#x02009;=&#x02009;24&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) and healthy, and were representative of the late middle-aged/older adult population within the greater Boulder County Colorado community. Twenty-five participants did not meet inclusion criteria and were excluded without being randomized. Four participants dropped out of the study prior to randomization due to a conflict with time commitment, and one individual was unresponsive to scheduling requests, resulting in a total of 30 subjects remaining for randomization. Of these, 15 subjects were randomized to Group A, which received placebo capsules during the first 6 weeks of the study before crossing over to receive NR capsules for the remaining 6 weeks. The other 15 subjects were randomized to Group B, which received NR capsules first followed by placebo. One subject was withdrawn from Group A due to a change in medication status that no longer met inclusion criteria, and two subjects in Group A elected to drop out of the study due to a complaint of side effects (see below). Two subjects were withdrawn from Group B due to a change in health or medication status that no longer met inclusion criteria, and one subject elected to drop out of Group B due to a non-study-related injury, resulting in a total of 24 subjects who completed the trial. Removal of these six subjects did not influence the overall makeup of the group because the characteristics for the 24 subjects who completed the trial were similar to those for all 30 subjects who were initially randomized (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>).

Additionally, our exploratory analyses of the effects of NR supplementation on physiological function suggest that the ability of NR to reduce SBP and aortic stiffness, two clinically important risk indicators of cardiovascular function and health, are among the most promising hypotheses to test in a future larger-scale clinical trial, particularly in individuals with above-normal baseline SBP.</p><p id="Par19">In this small initial intervention trial, NR was well tolerated and elicited no serious adverse effects. Additionally, we found that NR stimulated NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism without any difference in treatment-emergent AEs compared with placebo, supporting previous suggestions that NR may be a more suitable NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor than niacin (i.e., nicotinic acid and nicotinamide), which` also is capable of entering the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway, but is associated with a painful flushing sensation at therapeutic doses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The flushing response induced by niacin is specifically caused by the binding of nicotinic acid to the Gpr109A receptor on epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, an action that is not expected to occur with NR, thereby minimizing the risk of this side effect at equivalent doses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Although three of the subjects in our study did report flushing, two of these subjects were taking the placebo capsules, suggesting that NR itself did not appear to be associated with flushing. Despite these promising findings, we wish to emphasize that the size of the cohort in the present study is insufficient to establish the broader safety profile of NR at this dose. Larger, more definitive clinical trials, similar to those conducted with niacin, will be necessary to confirm this preliminary evaluation of tolerability and to more definitively assess its overall safety. However, indirect evidence for the potential safety of NR supplementation is suggested by the widespread use of niacin over past 60 years for the treatment of high cholesterol, with limited side effects other than flushing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">Niacin serves as important dietary precursor to NAD<sup>+</sup> and helps sustain cellular function and protect against pellagra, a condition characterized by dark pigmented skin, dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Like niacin, NR has been detected in cow&#x02019;s milk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and may theoretically act as another vitamin precursor form of NAD<sup>+</sup>. However, the amount of NR naturally consumed through the diet is likely much smaller than the dose tested in the present study. The primary natural sources of vitamin B<sub>3</sub> come from NAD<sup>+</sup>, NADPH and NADH, which are more abundant in food sources and are broken down into salvageable precursors, including niacin and NR. To protect against pellagra, the recommended daily allowances of niacin for adult men and women have been set at 16 and 14&#x02009;mg per day, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, whereas higher doses of niacin have beneficial effects on lipid profiles of individuals at risk for cardiovascular events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. It is plausible that the daily requirement for NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors may increase with advancing age due to decreasing NAD<sup>+</sup> bioavailability, although no such recommendation presently exits.</p><p id="Par21">An important goal of the present study was to identify clinically relevant physiological outcomes for future larger-scale (phase II) clinical trials of NR supplementation. The most promising result of these exploratory analyses was a trend towards an improvement in selective indicators of cardiovascular function. Compared with placebo, NR tended to lower SBP and aortic stiffness, two major independent risk factors for incident cardiovascular events and disease with advancing age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, in the overall group. A follow-up analysis suggested that this trend was most pronounced in individuals with baseline BP between 120 and 139&#x02009;mmHg, a subgroup currently classified clinically as having either &#x0201c;elevated&#x0201d; SBP (120&#x02013;129&#x02009;mmHg) or stage 1 systolic hypertension (130&#x02013;139&#x02009;mmHg). The mean decrease in SBP after NR treatment in this subgroup approached 10 mmHg&#x02014;a magnitude of change associated with a 25% decrease in incident CV events in a recent major anti-hypertensive drug trial in older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. If this magnitude of SBP reduction with NR supplementation is confirmed in a larger clinical trial, such an effect could have broad biomedical implications. SBP in this range (120&#x02212;139&#x02009;mmHg) is observed in ~50% of all middle-aged and older adults in the U.S.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> Moreover, SBP&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;140&#x02009;mmHg is responsible for at least one-third of all BP-attributable deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and is associated with increased risk of heart disease, stroke, cognitive impairment/dementia and chronic kidney disease, among other disorders of aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Importantly, for individuals with SBP of 120&#x02013;139&#x02009;mmHg, lifestyle modifications, such as healthy diet and regular exercise are recommended before prescribing anti-hypertensive medications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Given the low adherence to healthy lifestyle practices in middle-aged and older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, a natural, CR-mimicking, dietary supplement like NR with potential BP-lowering effects might represent a complementary approach for preserving cardiovascular health with aging.</p><p id="Par22">We also observed a trend towards a reduction in carotid-femoral PWV after NR supplementation in the present study, suggesting that this measure of aortic stiffness may represent another promising cardiovascular outcome of interest for a larger future clinical trial. As with the effects on SBP, individuals with higher&#x000a0;baseline BP appeared to demonstrate the largest mean changes&#x000a0;in carotid-femoral PWV in response to NR treatment. Carotid-femoral PWV is not only independently predictive of incident CVD in older adults, but has recently been linked to numerous other age-associated diseases and disorders including mild cognitive impairment, chronic kidney disease, and frailty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Thus, healthy lifestyle-mimicking dietary supplements with the potential to reduce age-related stiffening of the aorta would be of significant clinical interest. It should be noted that any NR-associated changes in BP may have contributed to corresponding changes in carotid-femoral PWV (and vice versa), so the changes in SBP and arterial stiffness are interrelated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">Little is known about the underlying mechanisms by which NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors may reduce BP and aortic stiffness in humans. NAD<sup>+</sup> is an obligate substrate for the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1), which is implicated in the maintenance of healthy vascular function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. In this regard, treatment with the proposed pharmacological SIRT-1 activator SRT1720 protects against the development of aortic stiffness and hypertension in Klotho-deficient mice (a model of accelerated aging), by lowering vascular oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Likewise, we have demonstrated that supplementation with NMN reverses aortic stiffening in old mice to youthful levels by increasing aortic SIRT-1 activation and reversing age-related increases in aortic oxidative stress, collagen deposition and elastin fragmentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Based on these preclinical studies, it is possible that NR may similarly affect BP and aortic stiffness in humans through a mechanism involving SIRT-1 activation; however, future mechanistic studies are needed to test this and related hypotheses. Such studies will be technically challenging in humans, and it will be important to try to separate the effects of SIRT-1 activation from the likely pleotropic effects of boosting the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolome.</p><p id="Par24">In addition to cardiovascular parameters, we also assessed the effect of NR on other domains of physiological function. Our findings suggest that a relatively short (6-week) intervention with NR did not change total energy expenditure or energy expenditure from fat oxidation (based on assessment of RER) at rest. We also did not observe any improvement in blood glucose control or insulin sensitivity. In both cases, it is important to note that this study was conducted in lean, healthy middle-aged and older adults without baseline metabolic dysfunction. These observations are in agreement with previous findings that NR modulates resting metabolic rate only in mice exposed to a high-fat diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, and does not influence blood glucose regulation in animals fed normal chow diets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Based on these preclinical observations, it is possible that chronic NR supplementation might improve metabolic function in groups who consume unhealthy diets and/or have metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and/or the metabolic syndrome.</p><p id="Par25">Our results also suggest that NR does not obviously improve aerobic exercise capacity or motor function in healthy middle-aged and older men and women with good baseline physical status. Although Frederick et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> recently identified a role for NAD<sup>+</sup> in rescuing neuromuscular function and exercise capacity in mice, these studies were conducted using a genetically induced model of impaired NAD<sup>+</sup> bioavailability that may represent more severe NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion than that which occurs with healthy aging. Future studies should explore the role of NR supplementation on aerobic exercise capacity and motor performance in groups with impaired mobility such as frail older adults and in individuals with chronic diseases associated with reduced cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise intolerance.</p><p id="Par26">In summary, the results of the present study provide initial evidence that chronic NR supplementation is well-tolerated in healthy middle-aged and older adults, and extend recent findings that acute supplementation with NR is effective for stimulating NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism in humans. Furthermore, we provide the first insight into the effects of NR supplementation on physiological function in humans, and identify SBP and aortic stiffness as promising cardiovascular outcomes to be assessed in larger-scale clinical trials. Future work should also compare the relative increases in NAD<sup>+</sup> and the physiological benefits of NR with conventional CR in order to further evaluate the use of this dietary supplement as a true &#x0201c;CR-mimetic&#x0201d; compound.</p><p id="Par27">Finally, we wish to emphasize certain limitations of this initial trial on chronic NR supplementation in humans. Because the physiological outcomes in this study were designed to be exploratory in nature, the associated statistical inferences for those variables were based on one-sided hypothesis testing and the alpha level was set at a conservative <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.006 to account for multiple testing. More targeted studies (e.g., phase-II clinical trials) with fewer outcomes based on two-sided statistical inference are needed to confirm the effects of NR supplementation on SBP and carotid-femoral PWV (aortic stiffness) before moving towards larger-scale (phase-III) clinical trials and any recommendation of NR supplementation for improving these cardiovascular health indicators. It is also important to note that although NR is presently available as a dietary supplement under the trade name NIAGEN<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (ChromaDex, Inc.), the dose tested in the present study exceeds the label-recommended dose and should be considered investigational until further work can be performed to confirm the safety and efficacy of higher doses for use by the general population. Lastly, the present study assessed the influence of chronic NR supplementation on healthy middle-aged and older adults, which may have reduced the likelihood of observing greater or, in the case of several outcomes assessed, any improvements in physiological function. Thus, future investigations should include studies on groups with cardio-metabolic diseases, motor deficits, impaired NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism, and/or other disorders to determine the efficacy of NR supplementation for enhancing health status in populations with impaired baseline physiological function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ethical approval, informed consent, and study location</title><p id="Par28">All procedures were approved by the University of Colorado Boulder Institutional Review Board.
