Such a model would need to reliably induce diarrhea in a high proportion of volunteers using the lowest possible inoculum to maximize safety and sensitivity. Previously we validated a challenge model that utilized a dose of 2x10<sup>7</sup> CFU of ETEC strain H10407 (LT<sup>+</sup>, ST<sup>+</sup>, CFA/I<sup>+</sup> and O78<sup>+</sup>) to induce attack rates for moderate to severe diarrhea (MSD) of ~60&#x02013;70%. Here we detail efforts to further refine the model in an attempt to determine if a lower challenge dose of H10407 can be used. Thirty subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive an oral administration of H10407 at doses of 10<sup>6</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup> CFU in bicarbonate buffer. After challenge, subjects were monitored for signs and symptoms of enteric illness and stool samples were collected to detect shedding of the challenge strain. Systemic and mucosal immune responses were measured using serum, antibody in lymphocyte supernatant and fecal samples. The attack rate was 13.3% (2/15) and 26.7% (4/15) for MSD in the 10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup> groups, respectively. Four MSD cases met criteria for early antibiotic treatment. All subjects but one shed the challenge strain in fecal samples. The frequency and magnitude of anti-LT toxin, CFA/I and LPS O78 immune responses were antigen, dose, severity of diarrhea and shedding levels dependent. Notably, although of lower magnitude, there were considerable immune responses in the subjects with no diarrhea. This may indicate that immune responses to asymptomatic infections of ETEC in children in the endemic countries may contribute to protection. Based on this and our prior studies, we conclude that a dose of 2x10<sup>7</sup> H10407 remains the lowest practical dose for use in future volunteer studies evaluating candidate vaccines and other preventive or therapeutic ETEC interventions.</p><p><bold>Trial registration:</bold> ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00844493">NCT00844493</ext-link>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Human challenge models can provide a platform for the initial evaluation of vaccine efficacy to down-select vaccine candidates before more expensive phase III trials are conducted. An ideal challenge model would need to reproducibly induce diarrhea in a high proportion of volunteers using the lowest possible inoculum to better maximize the sensitivity of the model. In this study, we attempted to refine the ETEC H10407 challenge model by characterizing the clinical illness induced by lower ETEC challenge doses. We also performed a comprehensive dose and clinical diarrhea severity dependent assessment of the immune responses. We found that some volunteers do become ill when challenged with these low doses, but the rates of moderate to severe diarrhea observed with these doses were too low to be useful for such volunteer studies. Therefore, we conclude a dose of 2x10<sup>7</sup> H10407 remains the lowest practical dose when evaluating candidate vaccines or other preventive or therapeutic ETEC interventions. Diarrheal illness, when it occurred, was associated with higher fecal shedding levels of H10407. The magnitudes of immune responses were dependent on the dose, antigen and severity of diarrhea. This new knowledge may contribute to a better overall understanding of the immune responses to ETEC and its relation to diarrhea severity which will help facilitate and guide ETEC vaccine development strategies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://data.crossref.org/fundingdata/funder/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1112376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bourgeois</surname><given-names>A.

In Africa and Southeast Asia, ETEC is also found to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in age-groups older than 5 years of age [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Studies have shown that children infected with ETEC are at higher risk of becoming stunted [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>As currently understood, the key virulence factors for ETEC are colonization factor antigens (CFs) and enterotoxins. CFs mediate bacterial attachment to host small intestinal epithelial cells and subsequent colonization, whereas enterotoxins including heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) toxins, occurring as either LT or ST alone or both LT/ST, disrupt fluid homeostasis in host epithelial cells, which leads to fluid and electrolyte hypersecretion and diarrhea [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>ETEC vaccine development has been a long standing WHO priority [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, there are no licensed vaccines for ETEC are currently available but several approaches to develop an effective vaccine are underway. A significant challenge to successful vaccine development is our poor understanding of the immune responses that correlate best with protection against ETEC illness. Although subclinical ETEC infections are very common in endemic countries, there is a gap of knowledge regarding the breadth and magnitude of immune responses to ETEC in asymptomatic cases which may prove helpful in guiding ETEC vaccine development strategies going forward.</p><p>Historically, the ETEC human challenge model has been considered an important tool in facilitating decisions regarding the most promising ETEC vaccines. The human challenge models can provide a platform for the evaluation and screening of vaccine efficacy before more expensive and more long-term field trials are conducted in at-risk age-groups in low and middle income countries and in travelers. To maximize its utility in this regard, it is essential that the model be optimized to ensure its reliability as a decision making tool. An ideal challenge model would reproducibly induce diarrhea in a high proportion of volunteers (&#x0003e;50%) using the lowest possible inoculum to better maximize the sensitivity of the model, particularly in the evaluation of preventive or therapeutic interventions. If the attack rate is too low, a much larger sample size will be needed. However, an excessively high dose might achieve high attack rates but increase the risk that these high challenge doses could overwhelm any vaccine-induced protective immunity and lead to the down selection of vaccines that might have potential as public health tools [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

The strain also produces colonization factor I (CFA/I). It is sensitive to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin, which are used typically to treat ETEC H10407 infections. A current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) quality production cell bank (PCB) for ETEC H10407 was prepared by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Pilot Bioproduction Facility (Silver Spring, MD). The manufacturing information and production records for the PCB of these strains were provided to the FDA under BB-IND-7766 (batch production record 285&#x02013;000, lot number. 0519). The ETEC H10407 challenge strain was stored in 2-ml cryostorage tubes (1 ml per tube) held at -80&#x000b0;C &#x000b1;10&#x000b0;C in the bio-production facility at WRAIR. Cryovials containing organisms from this PCB were transferred on dry ice from WRAIR to the CIR Enterics Research Laboratory, JHBSPH, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C&#x000b1;10&#x000b0;C in a locked and temperature-monitored freezer.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Inocula and challenge</title><p>The challenge inocula were prepared as described previously [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] with modifications to achieve the expected doses.

The number of CFU in the inocula was validated by titrating and plating on Luria agar plates (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) before and after administration to volunteers. A sample of the final inoculum was also examined by Gram stain for purity and by agglutination in anti-H10407 antiserum before being administered to subjects.</p><p>The bicarbonate buffer was prepared from USP-grade sodium bicarbonate (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) by dissolving 13.35 g of sodium bicarbonate in 1,000 ml of sterile water for irrigation (Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL). As with the earlier studies [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the bacterial challenge was administered in bicarbonate buffer after an overnight (9 hours) fast. At approximately 0900 h on the day of challenge, subjects drank 120 ml of the sodium bicarbonate buffer to neutralize gastric acidity.

Active solicitation regarding the following symptoms took place during the medical interview: fever, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, abdominal cramping, myalgia, malaise, bloating, flatulence, headache, lightheadedness, chills, constipation, and anorexia. Fever was defined as an oral temperature of 100.4&#x000b0;F or above. Severity of fever, vomiting, other symptoms and grades of stools were categorized as below [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Diarrhea was classified as mild (1 to 3 diarrheal stools totaling 200 to 400 g/24 h), moderate (4 to 5 diarrheal stools or 401 to 800 g/24 h), or severe (6 or more diarrheal stools or 800 g/24 h). The subjects were treated with either oral rehydration solution (Ceralyte; Cera Products, Inc., Columbia, MD) or intravenous (i.v.) fluid or administration of antibiotics as per protocol guidelines. All the subjects were treated with ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) approximately 120 h after challenge except those who meet the criteria for early antibiotic therapy and were treated earlier. To be eligible for discharge, subjects needed to have at least 2 negative stool cultures for ETEC H10407.

We have used an attack rate for MSD of 50&#x02013;70% as a reasonable barometer in our efforts to better optimize the ETEC human challenge model for use in evaluating preventive and therapeutic interventions for ETEC. Based on our observation in this most recent model refinement study, we conclude that a dose of 10<sup>7</sup> H10407 remains the lowest practical dose for use in future volunteer studies evaluating the efficacy of candidate vaccines and other potential preventive tools targeting ETEC.</p><p>Nevertheless, this study did demonstrate that lower H10407 doses (10<sup>5</sup> or 10<sup>6</sup>) were capable of causing MSD in some individuals. Although the mean incubation periods were similar for both the doses, the stool output and number of subjects with MSD were higher in 10<sup>6</sup> dose. There were no unexpected serious adverse events in either group through the 180 day follow-up period. Solicited gastrointestinal and systemic signs and symptoms were only marginally higher in the 10<sup>6</sup> group overall. Five subjects had vomiting and two had a mild fever.</p><p>In the study by Evans <italic>et al</italic> in 1978, [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] subjects were challenged with H10407, at a dose of 10<sup>6</sup> after fasting for 5 hours, and there was no discernible clinical diarrhea reported in these subjects following dosing. In the present study we found some severe cases at this dose as well as at the lower 10<sup>5</sup> dose suggesting that the overnight fast used in this study may have facilitated ETEC colonization and the subsequent development of illness. However, to determine the specific effect of the length of fasting period on clinical illness, a direct comparison of longer and shorter fasting periods is necessary. In our recent study, we have noted that an increased fasting time from 90 minutes before challenge to overnight can increase the diarrhea attack rate for another ETEC challenge strain, B7A (unpublished).</p><p>All the subjects except one shed the challenge strain even in this low dose challenge study. Although the overall shedding levels on day 2 were the same in both groups, the GM of the maximum shedding was higher in the subjects who received the higher dose. In this low dose study we found that 1.9x10<sup>7</sup> CFU/gm of stool on day 2 after challenge corresponds to the development of MSD. A similar correlation between a threshold level of shedding and a higher risk for MSD was shown by us using both quantitative stool culture and q-PCR in a previous study [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Similarly, in our previous ETEC vaccine immunization and challenge study using a higher challenge dose of 10<sup>7</sup> CFU of H10407, we also found 1.5x10<sup>7</sup> CFU corresponds to MSD [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The association between level of colonization and diarrhea risk is also supported by several recent field studies in which quantitative TaqMan PCR has shown a similar threshold effect [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Not surprisingly, subjects challenged with H10407 seroconverted and had mucosal responses to known ETEC virulence antigens LPS, LTB and CFA/I. However, the frequency and magnitude of responses tended to be higher in subjects challenged with the 10<sup>6</sup> dose compared to the 10<sup>5</sup> dose suggesting a dose-dependent trend. The differences in response to these two doses varied depending on the antigen and sample types. Interestingly, responses to LTB were higher in the lower dose group compared to the higher dose group in all types of samples. In this low dose study the highest IgA and IgG responses to LPS in serum, ALS and fecal samples were generally at day 9. For LTB and CFA/I IgA and IgG, the peak responses were either on day 9 or day 28. Similar to our previous findings [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] with higher H10407 doses, the frequency and magnitude of responses to CFA/I were lower compared to LPS and LTB in all the samples. It is interesting to note that the responses to CFA/I IgG in serum peaked on day 7 and kept on increasing until day 84. The magnitudes of the IgA responses to LTB and CFA/I in fecal samples were negligible in both dose groups. In general, immune responses induced by the lower doses used in this study were more modest than those seen earlier when a higher dose of H10407 (~10<sup>7</sup> CFU) was used. A more detailed comparison of the humoral and cellular immune responses induced across the full spectrum of H10407 challenges doses studies by our investigative team in recent years (10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> CFU of H10407) is currently underway.</p><p>There is a growing concern of asymptomatic colonization of enteropathogens in the gut of the children in the endemic countries because of its impact on longitudinal public health issues, such as growth faltering, oral vaccine low efficacy and poor neurocognitive development through environmental enteropathy/environmental enteric dysfunction [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Asymptomatic ETEC infections are common in endemic countries and may impact the intestinal health as well as long-term developmental potential in the children in these areas [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This low dose CHIM model of ETEC may serve as a tool to decipher these critical interactions. Furthermore, the levels of immunity induced by these asymptomatic ETEC infections is not well studied and needs to be better understood since these may contribute to protection in the field and may serve to diminish vaccine take. In this study we compared antigen-specific ETEC immune response profiles in the subjects with clinical and subclinical infections after challenge with low doses of ETEC which may better mimic more natural levels of exposure in the ETEC endemic areas. Notably, although of lower magnitude, there were considerable number of responders and increased titers in the subjects with no diarrhea. In this study we found that the magnitude of serum and mucosal antibody responses after challenge were symptom dependent with subjects developing MSD generally showing stronger responses than those experiencing asymptomatic colonization irrespective of the ETEC challenge dose.</p><p>Of note, the challenge bacteria were shed by all volunteers (except one) but the shedding level was related to the dose of the challenge and the severity of the symptoms. Thus, the magnitude of immune responses depended on the colonization levels, with the one exception being the responses to LTB where the responses were similar between those with MSD and those with ND.</p><p>In natural infection it is often assumed that some degree of pre-existing immunity to a given pathogen may contribute to an individual&#x02019;s susceptibility or resistance to infection and subsequent illness. In the present study we compared baseline serum and mucosal antigen-specific antibody levels to see if they are predictive of challenge outcome. Of the antigens evaluated, only LTB IgG levels in serum were significantly higher in subjects with no post-challenge diarrhea compared to subjects with MSD. A similar relationship has been previously noted by Porter and colleagues in their recent systematic review of ETEC CHIMs studies [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, further investigation is required to establish if LTB IgG levels in serum can serve as an indication of immunity to ETEC.</p><p>It is noteworthy that in our study, subjects with no history of exposure to ETEC and/or cholera (&#x0003e;2 years) given lower ETEC doses responded with very different clinical outcomes. Among those few subjects developing MSD, the incubation time was longer than has been generally seen at higher doses (~60 hrs versus 48 hrs) [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but the threshold level of shedding seen in these subjects was comparable to that previously associated with diarrheal illness in H10407 studies (&#x02265;10<sup>7</sup>CFU per gram of stool) [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; while subjects with mild or no illness exhibited much lower levels of ETEC shedding (approximately 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> CFU per gram of stool). The cellular and molecular basis for these differences deserve further investigation using new genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, systems biology and microbiome tools. These studies are now underway [<xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006442.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in the hope that they will lead to better defining host factors (immunological or microbiological) that may contribute to ETEC susceptibility and immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006442.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Supporting information on screening, randomization and blinding.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006442.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006442.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006442.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006442.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Selected solicited adverse events in the two groups.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006442.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006442.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) of H10407 shed on day 2 and maximum shedding.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006442.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006442.s005"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Dose dependent immune responses to CFA/I and LTB IgA in fecal extracts.</title><p>Geometric mean fold increases (95% confidence intervals) of antibody responses to CFA/I IgA in fecal (A), LTB IgA in fecal (B) from the day before challenge (day 0) and on days 4, 9, 28, and 84 following challenge with either 1x10<sup>5</sup> or 1x10<sup>6</sup> CFU doses of ETEC strain H10407.
