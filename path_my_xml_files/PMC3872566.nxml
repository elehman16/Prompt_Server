Low vision, though not categorized as blindness <italic>per se</italic>, has enormous social and economic implications in terms of economic loss and loss of productivity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Moreover, if the visual impairment occurs early in life, it has profound functional and psychological implications as well.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The global prevalence of pediatric low vision is estimated to be over 12 times that of childhood blindness and a third of global costs due to vision impairment and blindness are attributable to childhood.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] In order to reduce the degree of handicap associated with visually impaired patients, the most effective method is providing them low vision devices (LVDs) as a part of low vision rehabilitation with the aim to maximally enhance their residual vision. In developing countries, owing to lack of knowledge of some of the health care providers about the existence of such services and the associated financial implications, it is a challenge to rehabilitate children with visual impairment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>It has been documented that in patients with visual impairment, subjective complaints do not necessarily correlate with objective measurement of difficulty.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] This holds true especially in pediatric age group since children with visual impairment often cannot express their difficulties. Moreover, there is paucity of literature on how the functional vision performance of children improves after usage of LVDs.</p><p>The LV Prasad&#x02013;functional vision questionnaire (LVP-FVQ), developed by Gothwal <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] has made use of direct questions about the daily activities of children to assess the self-reported functional abilities of visually impaired children. In the present study, we have used the LVP-FVQ to evaluate the impact of vision rehabilitation on functional vision of children with visual impairment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 92 visually impaired children in the age group of 6-16 years attended the low vision clinic at Dr. Shroff's charity eye hospital over a period of 6 months (1 January 2012-30 June 2012). The inclusion of children in the category of visually impaired was as per the criteria of the World Health Organization for low vision.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The study was approved by the institutional review board and adhered to the declaration of Helsinki. A total of 35 children who were able to perform standard clinical vision tests and could correctly understand and respond to the questions were included. Children less than 6 year old, those with other disabilities in the form of intellectual impairment or hearing loss and those who had been using LVDs earlier were excluded from the study. Nature of the study and the possible outcomes were explained to the parents in detail and an informed consent was taken.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Methods</title><p>A complete ophthalmic history was taken including the visual requirements of the child, followed by a detailed ophthalmic examination. Unaided distant and near visual acuity (line acuity) was measured unilaterally and bilaterally using Logarithmic visual acuity chart &#x0201c;2000&#x0201d;, charts 1 and 2 (Precision vision, USA) at 3 m and LVRC &#x02212; Near Visual acuity test card (Low vision Resource centre, HK) at 40 cm (converted from N to M notation and thereafter to logMAR) under standard room illumination. Dilated retinoscopy was undertaken wherever indicated. Other tests of visual function were undertaken as and when required, including color vision, contrast sensitivity, visual fields, and visual electrophysiological tests.</p><p>Before initiation of low vision rehabilitation, a counseling session was undertaken with the parents to assess the visual needs of the child, to explain them the nature of visual impairment, and the possible influence as well as limitations of usage of LVDs. Thereafter, as per the visual requirements of the child, a trial of LVDs was given, keeping in mind the socioeconomic status of the family.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Prescription of low vision aids: Low vision devices for distance</title><p>The initial magnification power used for telescopes was predicted from the ratio of the denominator of the measured visual acuity to denominator of the desired visual acuity. LVDs for near: The required starting addition was initially determined using the Kestenbaum's rule (using the reciprocal of the distance visual acuity to calculate the dioptric power of the addition) and the ratio rule (comparing near visual acuity to target acuity). The reading addition power was again tested with the school books (continuous text) for all children.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Nonoptical devices</title><p>These include illumination devices such as lamps and reading stands, writing guides, bold-lined note books, and large printed books.</p><p>All children and their parents were given training sessions to familiarize them with the use of LVDs; care and maintenance of the devices was also explained. The types of LVDs prescribed to the subjects are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. At 2 months of initial dispensing of the LVDs, improvement in visual acuity was noted and the LVP-FVQ was readministered to the child by the same examiner. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; version 16.0) was used for statistical analysis and the Chi-square test was performed to assess the difference in functional vision post-LVD; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The various low vision devices prescribed for distance and near</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="OJO-6-170-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>The LV prasad &#x02013; Functional vision questionnaire</title><p>The LVP-FVQ was translated into Hindi (consistency checked by back translation in English) and administered to the child while away from the parents before and at 2 months of initiation of low vision rehabilitation in form of an oral interview. The questionnaire has 19 questions designed to cover four domains: Distance vision (six), near vision (six), color vision (two) and visual field (five). These 19 questions are related to difficulties in performing certain tasks which mainly rely on visual capabilities. An additional question 20 is related to global self-assessment of the child's vision as compared with his or her friends with normal vision. The response is graded on a 5-point scale (0-4); a &#x0201c;Yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;No&#x0201d; response is first required for each question. If the answer was &#x0201c;No,&#x0201d; it was recorded as &#x0201c;No difficulty&#x0201d; (zero score). If the answer is &#x0201c;Yes,&#x0201d; then the difficulty level is further categorized into 1-4 category; score 1 refer to &#x0201c;a little difficulty&#x0201d; and score 4 to &#x0201c;unable to do the activity due to visual reasons.&#x0201d; In instances that are gender-specific like threading a needle or lacing the shoes, an additional response of &#x0201c;not applicable&#x0201d; is used.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>There were a total of 35 children, mean age 10.5 &#x000b1; 3.2 years (range: 6-15 years), male:Female ratio was 4:1.

In the original study done by Gothwal <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and in another study using the LVP-FQL by Boshra <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] it was found that probability of children using category 1,2,3 was nearly zero. We had a similar observation that children in our study preferred to dichotomize the response, that is, they could either perform the task or could not and were not able to grade their difficulties. Boshra <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] concluded that that this could be because most children had visual impairment since birth or early childhood and thus could not judge the level of severity.</p><p>A number of studies have documented an improvement of visual acuity in children with low vision, following use of LVDs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Our study is first of its kind since we have made use of assessment of functional vision of the child using a time tested questionnaire for evaluation of outcome of low vision rehabilitation in children.</p><p>In our study, the basic questionnaire was given to the child before the rehabilitation process was commenced, while the second questionnaire to assess the improvement in the functional vision by the concerned LVD was administered at 2 months. An appropriate timing is important to allow a time lapse for the patient to have a full benefit with the LVD as well as not to make it too long after rehabilitation that results in fall of the of baseline levels owing to progressive nature of certain low vision eye conditions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>The important finding in our study was that 80% of children were going to regular schools and the most commonly reported difficulties were related to their studying/reading habits like copying from the blackboard, reading textbook at arm's length, and writing along a straight line. It was interesting to observe that a statistically significant improvement also occurred in the same activities which were related to their academics, that is, there was a significant decrease in number of children who were unable to do their routine activities due to visual reasons. This we feel is a very important inference of the study since a timely implementation of vision rehabilitation could help in maximizing their academic output. Low vision interferes not only with their routine and academic activities but it has also been now well-established that low vision has psychological consequences as well thus making the children feel depressed, anxious, fearful, and confused. Along with this, withdrawal and denial are also associated psychological problems that do not allow these children to be an integral part of the society and the educational system.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Another important finding in our study was that none of the children had received any specialist support earlier. Pal <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] did a study on 703 children attending blind schools and ascertained the need for spectacles and LVDs in children with useful residual vision. They concluded that there is large potential for these &#x0201c;incurably blind children&#x0201d; to benefit by use of spectacles and LVDs and emphasized the need of visual rehabilitation in these children. Khan <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] analyzed the perceived barriers to provision of LVDs among ophthalmologists in India and concluded lack of training/knowledge, lack of awareness, and nonavailability of LVDs as the major barriers. They emphasized the importance of increasing knowledge and awareness of ophthalmologists about the benefits of low vision rehabilitation.</p><p>To summarize, vision impairment if acquired early in life has a multifactorial impact on development of a child affecting the psychological and cognitive skill development; however, since most of the educational inputs are through visual sense, educational/academic output is one of the most affected and probably the most vital skill which is interfered with. Making use of a time-tested functional vision questionnaire designed specifically for children of developing nations, we observed that low vision interfered with the routine academic activities of most of the children and that there was a significant improvement in these activities post use of LVDs. An early visual rehabilitation could strengthen their visual abilities, thus improving their learning abilities and enabling them to continue getting education with their normally sighted peers.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shamanna</surname><given-names>BR</given-names></name><name><surname>Dandona</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>GN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Economic burden of blindness in India</article-title><source>Indian J Ophthalmol</source><year>1998</year><volume>46</volume><fpage>169</fpage><lpage>72</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10085631</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Daniel</surname><given-names>L Adams</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoyt</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Normal and abnormal visual development</article-title><year>2005</year><edition>3rd ed</edition><publisher-loc>London</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Elsevier Ltd</publisher-name><fpage>9</fpage><lpage>22</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pascolini</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Mariotti</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Global estimates of visual impairment: 2010</article-title><source>Br J Ophthalmol</source><year>2012</year><volume>96</volume><fpage>614</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22133988</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tabbara</surname><given-names>KF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Blindness in the eastern mediterranean countries</article-title><source>Br J Ophthalmol</source><year>2001</year><volume>85</volume><fpage>771</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11423445</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shaaban</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>El-Lakkany</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Swelam</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Anwar</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Low vision AIDS provision for visually impaired Egyptian patients-A clinical outcome</article-title><source>Middle East Afr J Ophthalmol</source><year>2009</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>29</fpage><lpage>34</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20142957</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Munoz</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>West</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Bandeen-Roche</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Fried</surname><given-names>LP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Characteristics of discrepancies between self-reported visual function and measured reading speed.
