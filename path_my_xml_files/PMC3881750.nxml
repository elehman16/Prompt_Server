Many studies had
shown that the material has higher levels of impact, fatigue and flexural strengths than
other denture resins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref></sup>. However,
fracture of removable prosthesis constructed from this material is still a common
clinical occurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref></sup>. A common measure to solve the situation is to
temporarily or definitively repair the denture. One of the problems with denture repair,
however, is that it is weaker than the original prosthesis and may re-fracture within a
short period of time. Often it occurs at the interface junction of the original base and
repair materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref></sup>. This may be
related to the weak adhesion between the old denture and new repair resin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>There are many factors affecting successful repair such as the materials used for
repair, the surface contour of repair joints, joint surface gap between the repair ends,
repair technique, and treatment given to the joint surfaces before repair resin
application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref></sup>. With the
development of glass-fiber reinforced composites in the industry, this has also inspired
a new approach to improve the performance of acrylic denture repair. A clinical
study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref></sup> has shown that glass
fiber-reinforced repaired denture did not re-fracture in the same location of the
previous repair indicating the strengthening effect of the glass fiber. Improvement in
fracture resistant of the repair when glass fiber was used for repair had also been
reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref></sup>. And for the placement of reinforcement materials,
additional central cavity was created within the specimens to accommodate the fibers.
However, the effect of these cavities alone was not investigated and therefore it could
not be certain the role played by the cavity preparation. On the other hand, most
<italic>in-vitro </italic>studies on reinforced denture repair concentrated mainly on
the effect of different type of reinforcements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref></sup>, even though the
longevity of the repair with water immersion is also considered to be clinically
important.</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the flexural strength of one glass
fiber-reinforced repair and two non-reinforced repairs with and without cavity
preparation 1, 7 and 30 days after water immersion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>Ninety-six rectangular specimens (64x10x2.5 mm were fabricated from heat-curing acrylic
resin (Meliodent, Bayer, Newbury, UK) by investing a perspex block (Plexiglass, London,
UK) in dental stone. Twenty-three gram of powder and 10 ml of liquid of acrylic resin
were proportioned, mixed, packed and processed into the mold following the
manufacturer's instruction. Polymerization was conducted in a water bath (Acrydig10,
Menfredi, Torino, Italy) with a long curing cycle of 70&#x000ba;C for 7h followed by 100&#x000ba;C for 1
h. After deflasking, the specimens were trimmed and polished and then immersed in water
at 37&#x000ba;C for 1 month to allow water saturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p>Specimens were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=24). One group was left intact without
repair (control). The rest of the specimens were cut into 2 halves with the joint ends
rounded off as this type of joint preparation has been shown to provide the strongest
repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref></sup>. For each repair
specimen, an index was made by making an open-ended stone mold that allowed the repair
ends to be moved providing a 2 mm gap between them. The gap was filled with the
auto-curing repair resin (Meliodent) using mixing powder:liquid ratio of 10 g powder for
7 mL liquid, following the manufacturer's instruction. Polymerization was carried out in
a pressure pot (Leone s.p.s., Firenze, Italy) for 10 min at a pressure of 2.2 bar and a
temperature of 45&#x000ba;C following the manufacturer's instruction. One of the groups was
prepared using conventional repair method (Group 1) where the joints were rounded before
repair resin was applied. The other two repair groups had in addition a transverse
cavity measuring 2x3.5x21.5 mm prepared at the joint ends; one group was repaired with
E-glass fiber (Fiber-Splint<sup>TM</sup> Lab-System, Polydentia SA, Mezzovico,
Switzerland), embedded within the cavity (Group 2), while the other group was repaired
without fiber reinforcement (Group 3). Fiber- Splint<sup>TM</sup> consisted of multiple
layers of silanized E-glass fiber strips and each layer consisted of unidirectional
fibers which were plaited in each other to form woven glass fibers. The manufacturer
claimed that the silanization of the glass fiber strip gives good bond with the resin.
From the pilot study, 2 layers of fibers with standardized weight of 0.01 g were used
for reinforced repair specimen (Group 2). The glass-fiber was impregnated with
light-curing adhesive resin (Fiber-bond, Polydentia SA, Mezzovico, Switzerland) as
recommended by the manufacturer. This acted as a wetting agent that improved the
adhesion between the glass-fiber and auto-curing repair resin. A light-curing unit (QHL
75, Dentsply/DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany) was used to polymerize the resin before repair
resin was filled in the gap.</p><p>The groups were further subdivided into 3 groups according to the time of water storage
at 37&#x000ba;C before the flexural strength test (n=8): 1 day, 7 days and 30 days.</p><p>The flexural strength was determined using a three-point flexural bending test according
to the ISO 1567:1999 specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup>
for denture base polymers. It was conducted on an Instron Universal Testing Machine
(Model 4302; Instron Inc., High Wycombe , UK). The crosshead speed during the test was 5
mm/min and the test was carried out in a water bath at 37&#x000ba;C.</p><p>The flexural strength (S) was computed from the equation:</p><p>S=3NI/2bd<sup>2</sup></p><p>Where "N" is the maximum force (N), "I" was the distance between supports (50 mm), "b"
was the width, and "d" was the depth of specimen.</p><p>Data were statistically analyzed by 2-way ANOVA for the effect of repair method,
immersion period and interaction. Kruskal Wallis and post-hoc Mann-Whitney with
Bonferroni correction were used for analysis within repair method and within immersion
period. All tests used a 0.05 level of statistical significance. Statistical
calculations were performed using SPSS for Windows (Release 12.01, SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA).</p><p>The fracture ends were inspected using a stereomicroscope (Kyowa SD-2PL, Tokyo, Japan)
at a magnification of &#x000d7;10 to determine the mode of failure at bonding interface. The
nature of failure was categorized adhesive (occurred at repair-denture base interface),
cohesive (within the repair material) and mixed (at interface and repair material). One
examiner was involved with the recording.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean flexural strength values of intact and repair groups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>. The result of 2-way ANOVA showed that
there was a statistically significant difference for the effect of repair methods
(p&#x0003c;0.001), the immersion periods (p&#x0003c;0.001) and the interaction between the two
factors (p&#x0003c;0.001). Kruskall Wallis and post-hoc Mann Whitney analysis showed no
significant changes in the flexural strength values between the 3 periods of water
immersion (p&#x0003e;0.05) for Groups 2 and 3. However, Group 1 and control showed
significant decrease in the mean flexural strength value after 30 days (p&#x0003c;0.05).
Post-hoc Mann Whitney analysis also revealed that at any period of water immersion,
control group showed a significantly higher flexural strength value than all the repair
groups (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><table-wrap id="t01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Flexural strength (MPa) of repair groups at different immersion period (mean &#x000b1;

In addition to
that, it is usually stored under water when it not in use. Therefore the influence of
water on the mechanical properties is also an important factor to be investigated. It
has been shown that the effect of water uptake by denture base polymers was to reduce
their mechanical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref></sup>. Similar results were observed in the
present study with regards to the flexural strength of intact heat-curing PMMA and
conventional repair group. A reduction in the flexural strength recorded after 1 month
of water immersion could be explained by the plasticization of the polymer matrix due to
water absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup>.</p><p>In the glass fiber reinforced repair and non-reinforced repair where specimens were
additionally prepared with central cavity perpendicular to the repair joints, no
reduction in the flexural strength over the period of immersion was observed. Therefore
based on this observation, the results suggested that the mechanical effects of cavity
preparation may have played some role in stabilizing the strength of the repair. This
could be explained by the increase in the surface area of interface between the repair
and base materials, which might have enhanced the bonding between them.</p><p>A repair that deteriorates in strength over a short period of time reduces the clinical
performance of the prosthesis. There are many available literatures reporting on various
reinforcement materials that enhanced the repair strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup>. However, research on the stability of fiber-reinforced repair is
very limited. A clinical study reported re-fracture of removable prostheses after one
year at other sites than previously repaired sites, indicating the effectiveness of
reinforcement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref></sup>. In the present
study where the strength was determined 30 days after immersion in water, glass
fiber-reinforced repair did not show significant deterioration in the strength. This was
in contrast to the suggestion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup> that
water could act on the siloxane bond between the resin matrix and the pre-silanized
E-glass-fiber to cause hydrolytic degradation. Some substances found in glass were
thought to be reactive to water that could further decreased the hydrolytic stability of
the reinforcement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup>. However in
another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup>, it was shown that
E-glass fiber had relatively good long-term stability against water absorption, although
the poor impregnation of fibers with polymer matrix predisposed the fibers-reinforced
composite to water absorption. In the present study the fibers were carefully embedded
within the repair material to ensure that they were not exposed to the environment. This
could have reduced the hydrolytic degradation by water and hence leads to the
observation of stability of the glass-fiber repair.</p><p>It was also observed in this study that the conventional repair exhibited flexural
strength ranging between 46-67% of that of intact specimens. This range was comparable
with another study which showed a reduction of between 36-65% of original
strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref></sup>. Berge, et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup> (1983) revealed value of
approximately 60%, while Leong and Grant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup> (1981) reported approximate value of 65%. The reduction in flexural
strength observed after repair which was in agreement with other findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup> could be related to the weak bond strength between
denture base and repair resin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup>. The weak bond was also evident from the
adhesive failure mostly observed in the specimens in this repair group. With inadequate
bond strength, fracture through the repair sites was more common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref></sup>.On the other hand, a higher percentage of
specimens in non-reinforced repair group with cavity preparation exhibited mixed mode of
failure. The same explanation as before can be made; with cavity preparation the surface
area for bonding with repair material increased.</p><p>The limitations of this study were that the study design did not simulate the actual
clinical situation: the specimen tested was different from the configuration of a
denture and immersion in water did not actually represent the actual oral environment.
Furthermore, only one type of fiber-reinforcement was used. Further investigations are
also necessary to evaluate the effect of aging on the mechanical performance of the
repair over a longer period of time. Fatigue test, which simulates better the clinical
forces, may also be suggested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limits of this study following conclusion were drawn:</p><p>None of the repair methods was able to restore the flexural strength of the heat-curing
