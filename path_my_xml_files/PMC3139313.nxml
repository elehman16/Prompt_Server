Despite the use of high-volume, low-pressure cuffs, certain patients remain at risk for cuff-induced laryngotracheal morbidity, even with short-duration anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The main symptom reported after tracheal intubation is sore throat, but patients also report hoarseness and dysphagia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Although the exact pathophysiology of post-intubation airway symptoms is not fully known, mucosal damage occurring at the cuff level is thought to be an important causative factor for tracheal morbidity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Tracheal arterial capillary pressure decreases when the cuff exerts pressure greater than 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, causing tracheal ischemia proportional to the pressure exerted by the cuff and to the duration of exposure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The ideal cuff pressure has not certainty been defined, but most anesthesiologists generally recommend a target of 20 to 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The length of time needed for an elevated cuff pressure to cause these complications is unclear, but mucosal damage has been demonstrated after only 15 minutes in an animal model.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>The three common methods of endotracheal tube cuff inflation used in clinical setting are the use of sealing pressure, inflation to a precise pressure (25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), or estimation of the cuff pressure by finger palpation. The aim of our study is to compare the three techniques regarding the prevention of tracheal leak and the incidence of post-intubation airway morbidity. We presuppose that inflation of the cuff to a sealing pressure is an easy way to maintain safe and effective cuff pressure as well as minimize post-intubation airway symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After approval from Research and Ethics Committee and written informed consent, 75 patients with ASA physical status I or II were enrolled in this prospective, controlled, randomized, blinded study. All patients were scheduled for surgical procedures under N<sub>2</sub>O free general anesthesia with an expected duration of 90 min or more. Patients undergoing head or neck surgery or patients with tracheotomy, laryngeal disease or laryngeal surgery, or those requiring placement of a nasogastric tube, or in whom intubation will be difficult (two or more trials), were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients were premedicated with 0.2 mg/kg diazepam administrated orally 90 min before anesthesia induction. On arrival to the operating room, standard anesthetic technique was conducted by consultant anesthesiologist of more than 15 year experience who is blind to the study design. After fixation of standard monitoring and preoxygenation for 3 min, anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/ kg and propofol 2.5 mg/kg. Neuromuscular block was achieved with rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg.Tracheal intubation was performed when maximum neuromuscular blocking effect assessed by the train-of-four count at the adductor pollicis was achieved. A Guedel airway was used for all patients during anesthesia. Endotracheal tubes (Lo-Contour; Mallinckrodt, Athlone, Ireland) with high residual volume, low-pressure cuff, with an inner diameter of 7.5 mm for female and 8.0 mm for male, were used in our study. Patients were randomly assigned, by opening a sealed envelope, to one of three groups. In the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 25), the ETT cuff was aspirated as much as possible and then inflated with air to achieve a cuff pressure of 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. In the sealing group (<italic>n</italic> = 25), the ETT cuff was aspirated as much as possible and then inflated with air to prevent air leaks during the inspiratory phase of mechanical ventilation of the patient when peak airway pressure was 20 cm H<sub>2</sub> O. In the finger group (<italic>n</italic> = 25), the ETT cuff was aspirated as much as possible and then inflated to a suitable pressure by palpation of the external balloon. The volume used to fill the cuff and the cuff pressure were recorded in each group using hand-held, manometer P-V gauge (Mallinckrodt Medical, St. Louis, MO) by an anesthesiologist who was blind to the studied group. The same anesthesiologist assessed tracheal leak by both audible technique and by observing the difference between inspiratory and expiratory tidal volume. Mechanical ventilation was controlled and adapted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide at 30&#x02013;35 mmHg. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (1&#x02013;2% end-tidal) and 30% oxygen in air, supplemented by boluses of fentanyl (1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g/kg). At the end of surgery, neuromuscular block was reversed with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and atropine 0.025 mg/kg and the pharynx was gently suctioned. Before tracheal extubation, patients breathed 100% oxygen for 5 min and the ETT was removed as soon as all of the following criteria were met: Full reversal of neuromuscular block (ulnar nerve T4/T1 ratio = 1); spontaneous breathing; and the ability to follow verbal commands (hand grip or eye opening) or else demonstrate purposeful unilateral movement (attempting self-extubation).The duration of surgery and intubation were recorded. Intravenous paracetamol and morphine were used for postoperative analgesia. At the time of discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and 24 h after tracheal extubation, patients were asked about three laryngotracheal complaints: Sore throat, hoarseness and dysphagia by an independent observer who was unaware of the patient allocation groups. He assessed the severity of these symptoms on a visual analog scale (VAS; where 0 = no discomfort and 10 = worst discomfort possible).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Demographic data, duration of surgery and intubation, dose of fentanyl, the volume of air injected in the cuff and intra-cuff pressure were analyzed by one-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction. Unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the control group and the other two groups. Gender ratio and the differences in the incidence of the laryngotracheal symptoms were analyzed by Fisher's exact or Chi-square tests. Probability (<italic>p</italic>-value) less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis was performed using Statistica software version 7.0 for Windows (Statsoft, Inc.).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant difference between the three groups regarding demographic data, duration of surgery and intubation and intraoperative fentanyl dose [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

This was expected as the cuff pressure in the control group was still in the safe range (below 30 cm H<sub>2</sub> O) which is unlikely to impair tracheal capillary mucosal perfusion. On the other hand, the cuff pressure in the finger group (48 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) had greatly exceeded the critical value, which could explain the higher incidence of sore throat in this group compared to the sealing and control groups.</p><p>Many studies had assessed the relationship between ETT cuff pressure and the occurrence of laryngotracheal complaints with contradictory results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] A recent study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] failed to show a significant effect of ETT cuff pressure on postoperative sore throat frequency. However, the study design, anesthetic technique and intubating circumstances were not controlled and a nasogastric tube was inserted in most patients.</p><p>Conversely, our study, as well as several clinical studies have shown a lower frequency of sore throat when cuff pressure was maintained below the critical value of 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O during anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Moreover, the effect of endotracheal tube cuff pressure exceeding tracheal capillary mucosal perfusion was confirmed in experimental settings.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>One of the common practice for anesthetists is to palpate the external balloon (contiguous with the cuff) after intubation to attempt to obtain a rough estimation of the intra-cuff pressure; our study supported by other several studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] have suggested that this is unreliable technique which could result in unnecessary high intra-cuff pressure with consequent laryngotracheal complains. Thus it is necessary to use a manometer to adequately assess intra-cuff pressure or to inflate the cuff with air to a sealing pressure.</p><p>In observation of the significant lower cuff pressure found in the sealing group than in the control group, air volume to fill the cuff was (against expectation) insignificantly smaller in sealing group compared to the control group. This could be explained by the high compliance of the high-volume, low-pressure cuff which allow the pressure to increase slowly between the pressures of 10 and 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, after which the addition of small volumes increases the cuff pressure significantly.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>In the current study, the incidence of sore throat was significantly higher in the finger group compared to both sealing and control group, whereas the incidence of both hoarseness and dysphagia was similar in the three groups. This finding have been supported by other investigators,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] who claimed the high tracheal cuff pressure as an important factor in the development of tracheal mucosal ulcerations whose severity was correlated to postoperative sore throat incidence. While other postoperative symptoms, principally hoarseness and dysphagia, were related to tracheal intubation and airway management, explaining their similar incidence in all groups.</p><p>Several studies confirmed that females are more commonly and strongly affected by intubation-related complaints.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] This inequity was not supported in our study. This could be explained by our small sample size, which designed to investigate the effect of pressure rather than the effect of gender on the incidence of post-intubation complaints.</p><p>As N<sub>2</sub>O has been declined in current anesthesia practice, to our knowledge, only Biro <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] had studied the effect of the intra-cuff sealing pressure up to an airway pressure of 25 cm H<sub>2</sub> O on the incidence of postoperative sore throat in a N<sub>2</sub>O-free anesthesia. They failed to show any protective effect of limiting endotracheal tube cuff pressure on post-intubation sore throat incidence. This could be explained by the use of a cuff pressure below the critical value (30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O). On the other hand, Braz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] support the idea of intra-cuff sealing pressure even in presence of N<sub>2</sub>O and postulated that &#x0201c;When it is not possible to monitor the cuff pressure, such as in head and neck surgeries carried out with N<sub>2</sub>O, preference should be given to the sealing cuff pressure, which prevents the occurrence of high cuff pressure, especially during the first 60 minutes of N<sub>2</sub>O anesthesia.&#x0201d;.</p><p>In our study we did not evaluate leakage of liquid past the cuffs of tracheal tubes in our three designed cuff pressure groups. This was a limitation of our study as the sealing cuff pressure is known to be able to prevent leakage of inspired gas but it does not necessarily prevent the aspiration of regurgitated gastric contents. This will be investigated in our next study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In anesthesia in which N<sub>2</sub>O is not used, an ETT sealing cuff pressure is a handy, undemanding and safe alternative to the standard technique of inflating the cuff to a pressure of 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, regarding prevention of air leak and low incidence of sore throat. Nevertheless estimation of the cuff pressure by finger palpation is an unreliable technique, which could result in high incidence of laryngotracheal complaints.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
