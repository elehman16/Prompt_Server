The main finding was that RF and anti-CCP predicted radiographic progression only in the group not treated with prednisolone.</p><p>The presence of RF and antibodies against citrullinated proteins/peptides (ACPA) has been found to predict the development of RA and also the severity of the disease, suggesting a possible pathogenic role for these autoantibodies.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> If so, the present finding that RF-positivity and anti-CCP-positivity did not predict radiographic progression in prednisolone-treated patients may imply that prednisolone affects the pathogenic mechanisms associated with these antibodies in early RA. This possibility is in line with a role for RF in joint damage progression beyond its direct effect on disease activity.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Interestingly, such effects of RF, independent of disease activity, have been shown to be significantly associated only with progression of the erosion score, but not with the joint space narrowing score.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Similarly, we have reported earlier that the hampering effect of prednisolone on radiographic progression was valid only for erosions.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The lack of association between autoantibody status and radiographic progression in prednisolone-treated patients is consistent with similar findings in patients treated with some biological agents.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> It is further in line with the findings in the BEST study where the association of ACPA status with joint damage progression was significantly more pronounced in patients treated with initial methotrexate monotherapy compared with those getting combination therapy with prednisolone or anti-tumour necrosis factor agents.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> One explanation might be that early and intensive reduction of inflammation, also found here in the P-group, may suppress a strong autoimmune response.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Such an explanation to the fact that the autoantibodies at baseline did not predict radiographic progression in the P-group is supported by the finding that more patients in this group reverted from seropositivity to negativity. In a recent study by Barra <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> on early inflammatory arthritis, seroreversion occurred at rates similar to those in the present study without any influence on the prediction of outcome. However, in another early polyarthritis cohort, the prognostic significance of initial RF and anti-CCP positivity was influenced by seroreversion of these antibodies.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Not only antibody status but also serum level changes might be of importance in the prediction of outcome. Here we found that the levels of RF and anti-CCP decreased in both treatment groups. The decrease of anti-CCP was significantly more profound in the P-group when the calculation was based on the patients who strictly followed randomisation and dose. We suggest that such a subgroup analysis is important to find specific effects of prednisolone. Reports on the predictive value of changes in autoantibody levels are limited, but one study on early RA reports that changes in RF and ACPA levels were not associated with radiographic outcome.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In established RA, RF and ACPA level reductions are reported to be closely linked to treatment-associated improvements.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, it remains unknown whether such reductions are associated with hampered structural changes.</p><p>In conclusion, the presence of RF and anti-CCP did not predict radiographic progression in patients treated with prednisolone in contrast to prednisolone-na&#x000ef;ve patients. The data imply that early treatment with prednisolone may modulate not only inflammation but also autoimmunity-associated pathogenetic mechanisms. The clinical implication would be that the unfavourable prognosis associated with RF-positivity and anti-CCP-positivity can be relieved by prednisolone treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e222" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005246.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e223" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005246.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank research nurse Margareta W&#x000f6;rnert for excellent assistance, MD Kristina Albertsson for scoring radiographs and the following members of the BARFOT study group: Maria Andersson, Kristina Forslind, Catharina Keller, Ido Leden, Bengt Lindell, Ingemar Petersson, Christopher Schaufelberger, Annika Teleman and Jan Theander.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> IH, AB, DvdH and BS were involved in the original planning of the low-dose prednisolone study and interpretation of data.
