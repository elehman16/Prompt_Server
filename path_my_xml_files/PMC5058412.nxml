Moreover, better endometrial growth has been associated with a higher pregnancy rate (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abdalla et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Dessolle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Palatnik et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, several efforts have been made to increase endometrial development with variable and contradictory results (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Senturk and Erel, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Takasaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Gleicher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">El Refaeey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Lebovitz and Orvieto, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Short-acting inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), such as sildenafil, have been proposed as useful agents for increasing endometrial development in patients with an endometrium that had previously undergone surgical treatment. The proposed principal mechanism of these drugs for obtaining a better endometrium is supposed to be an improvement of vascular flow (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Sher and Fisch, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Paulus et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Sher and Fisch, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Zinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Dehghani Firouzabadi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, the possible utility of administering a longer-acting PDE5 inhibitor, such as tadalafil, to achieve a thicker endometrium in patients with a non-operated endometrium under clomiphene ovarian stimulation remains unknown (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Forgue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Wrishko et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the principal aim of the present study was to assess the potential usefulness of tadalafil in terms of improving endometrial development in patients under clomiphene ovarian stimulation. A cross-over randomized study design was used and the outcome measures were endometrial thickness, the uterine artery pulsatility index, the uterine artery resistance index and serum estradiol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>We prospectively studied 30 infertile female patients during 53 cycles in an IUI programme using clomiphene citrate (CC) ovarian stimulation. Patients 18-42 years of age attending the Center of Reproductive Medicine CREASIS and Centro M&#x000e9;dico Zambrano Hellion at Tecnol&#x000f3;gico de Monterrey University were invited to participate and recruited from September 2014 to August 2015. Patients were randomized at the beginning of this cross-over study to start in either Group A (CC + tadalafil) or Group B (only CC), and because pregnancy was achieved in the first cycle for 7 patients, we included the other 23 patients who completed both cycles (46 cycles) in the final analysis. They were followed up until clinical pregnancy could be confirmed.</p><p>Informed written consent was obtained from all patients and this investigation received the approval of our internal Institutional Review Board on 27 August 2013 (reference no. IPDE5EC). The informed consents of participants were recorded in individual files. The trial was registered as ISRCTN95746843.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) no previous endometrium surgery (ii) no history of smoking (iii) both ovaries present and without morphological abnormalities (iv) regular menstrual cycles of 27 to 32 days in duration (v) no current or past diseases affecting the ovaries or gonadotrophin or sex steroid secretion, clearance or excretion (vi) no arterial hypertension (vii) body mass index (BMI) ranging between 18 and 25 kg/m2 (viii) no current hormone therapy and (ix) adequate visualization of both ovaries and the endometrium on transvaginal ultrasound scan.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><label>2.2</label><title>Protocol</title><p>Patients were randomized using previously sealed envelopes to start in either Group A or Group B. Only the patients who completed both cycles were included in the final analysis of this crossover study. For Group A patients were administered 100 mg/day clomiphene citrate from the 2nd to the 6th day of the cycle and 5 mg/day tadalafil from the 4th day to the 10th day of the cycle. Both drugs were administered at night. For Group B patients only received 100 mg/day clomiphene citrate from the 2nd to the 6th day of the cycle. All patients were evaluated on days 4, 8 and 10 of both cycles with ultrasonographic and hormonal measurements.</p><p>Ultrasound scans were performed with a vaginal probe (Logiq 3 Pro; General Electric Medical Systems, transvaginal probe E8C of 4-10 Mhz). On sagittal view of the uterus, the endometrial thickness was measured. Using colour doppler the uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) and the uterine artery resistance index (RI) were measured, and the means for both sides were calculated. To measure the uterine artery indices, the insonation angle used was between 0&#x000b0; and 30&#x000b0;, and the waveforms in three to six cardiac cycles were obtained from the ascending main branch of the uterine artery at the cervix level before it entered the uterus in a longitudinal plane. Additionally all data acquisitions were obtained under the same Doppler settings: gain 30, PRF 1.5 kHz and frequency 4.0 MHz. The follicle measurements were the means of two orthogonal diameter measurements and were obtained using the tissue harmonic system, as previously described (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Fanchin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2005a</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2005b</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Mendez Lozano et al., 2008</xref>). One blind single operator performed all measurements. Additionally, all data were digitally stored and were not analysed until the end of the study.</p><p>Hormonal measurements of serum estradiol, LH and progesterone were also performed on days 4, 8 and 10 of the cycles. All samples were obtained at 8 AM in the morning at the CREASIS (Center for Reproductive Medicine). The serum estradiol concentrations were determined using an automated multi-analysis system and a chemiluminescence technique (Advia-Centaur, Bayer Diagnostics, Puteaux, France). For estradiol, the lower detection limit was 15 pg/ml, the linearity was up to 1,000 pg/ml and the intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 8 and 9%, respectively.</p><p>AFinally, the women received a 10 000 IU hCG injection intramuscularly when the dominant follicle diameter exceeded 18 mm and the intrauterine insemination was performed 36 hours after the injection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The measures of central tendency and variability used when the data distribution was normal were the mean and standard error of the mean and those used when normality could not be ascertained were the median and range respectively. Data distribution normality was assessed by the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Unpaired data were compared by the unpaired Student&#x02019;s t-test or the Mann Whitney test, as appropriate. Paired data were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The chi-squared and Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. A P value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Even when this is the first study with tadalafil, we calculated the sample size according to differences observed on endometrium grow with other PDE5 inhibitors. Thus, we calculate 18 patients needed in this crossover study for a difference of at least 1 mm on endometrial thickness observed in 30% of them with a 0.05% significance level and 0.8 of power. In this crossover study, only patients with their own control cycle were considered for analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s4"><title>Results</title><p>Thirty participants were included in this cross-over randomized study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Fifty-three cycles of ovarian stimulation and intrauterine insemination were included. Those 53 cycles included 26 cycles with clomiphene and tadalafil treatment (Group A) and 27 cycles with clomiphene citrate treatment alone (Group B). As expected, 23 patients underwent both cycles, as pregnancy was achieved during the first cycle in 7 patients. Thus, 46 cycles were included in the analysis of the variables of interest. During the ovarian stimulation cycles, no additional drugs were administered and endometrial ovarian stimulation was never performed out of schedule, regardless of the response to the treatment.</p><fig id="g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>&#x02014; Cross-over randomized study: flow-diagram of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="FVVinObGyn-7-231-g001"/></fig><p>Regarding patient demographics, the average age of our patients was 31.8 &#x000b1; 0.9 years, the basal FSH level was 4.9 &#x000b1; 0.4 IU/ml, the antral follicle count (AFC) was 16.7 &#x000b1; 1.6 follicles and the total motile spermatozoa in the initial semen sample was 14.3 &#x000b1; 2 million.

Such vasodilators have been used successfully in patients with impaired endometrial growth due to structural damage to the endometrium.</p><p>Previously, sildenafil was shown to improve endometrial development (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Sher and Fisch, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). However, the effect of using these vasodilator drugs in patients with inadequate endometrial growth, which is not due to intrinsic damage but due to the negative effect of clomiphene citrate treatment on the endometrial growth has not been established yet. Therefore, we examined the effects of the addition of tadalafil to the classic protocol of ovarian stimulation with clomiphene citrate. Tadalafil was selected because of its longer half-life compared to sildenafil, which may result in a more sustained effect with fewer side effects.</p><p>This investigation aimed to limit the confounding variables as much as possible by having each patient be her own control in alternating cycles and by not altering ovarian stimulation regardless of patient response. Furthermore, the patients were randomized in Group A or Group B with and without the PDE 5 inhibitor, respectively. Additionally the Doppler ultrasound measurement settings were the same for all patients, and the Doppler ultrasound measurements were made in the same manner without changing any of the ultrasound settings.</p><p>The results we obtained are in line with previous studies that showed that a higher follicular vascular flow provided a significant benefit to ovo-follicular reproductive competence (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lozano et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Out of the 30 patients included, 23 completed both cycles and were included in the analysis of the comparative variables. Additionally, three measurement time points were used: baseline (day 4), at which time similar characteristics should be found for both cycles, day 8, at which time the first noticeable differences between cycles A and B could be observed and day 10 at which time the effect of tadalafil before the end of ovarian stimulation could be observed.</p><p>With the addition of a phosphodiesterase PDE5 inhibitor, we found no effect on the pulsatility index at any of the 3 measurement time points. This was in contrast to the findings of other researchers (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Sher and Fisch, 2002</xref>). It is possible that the acute effect of drugs on the pulsatility index is more noticeable for fast and short-acting drugs such as sildenafil.</p><p>The resistance index was also not affected by tadalafil at baseline but a strong trend of a decrease in the resistance index with tadalafil was observed on day 8 of the cycle (P = 0.059), and gradually a remarkable decrease was observed on day 10 of the cycle (P = 0.017). These changes were less pronounced in other studies that used of short-acting agents.</p><p>An important finding of this study was the improvement in endometrial development with the addition of tadalafil to the clomiphene ovarian stimulation protocol. With tadalafil, notable increases in endometrial growth were observed on cycle days 8 (P &#x0003c; 0.0002) and 10 (P &#x0003c; 0.0002).</p><p>However, even though the speed of the follicular growth of the leading follicle was not affected by tadalafil, the production of estradiol tended to respond faster on day 8 for the cycle with tadalafil (P = 0.06) in conjunction with a progressive decrease in the resistance index, resulting in proper endometrial development and a rapid response of the healthy endometrium. Of note, follicular growth was adequate in both cycles and the difference in estradiol production between the two cycles disappeared on day 10 of the cycles.</p><p>Even when the preliminary design of this study did not include pregnancy outcome, 10 pregnancies were achieved for an overall pregnancy rate of 18.86% per cycle. Six pregnancies were achieved under clomiphene citrate alone (22.2%) and 4 pregnancies were achieved under tadalafil and clomiphene (15.3%).</p><p>A better endometrium thickness but a similar pregnancy rates was observed in this study when adding tadalafil to the stimulation protocol.</p><p>In the present study, we observed better endometrial growth in cycles with tadalafil compared to cycles with clomiphene citrate alone. We also found a progressive decrease in the resistance index in the uterine arteries without changes in follicular development in the cycles with tadalafil. No significant difference in pregnancy rate between the two groups could be observed in this small series of patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
