Because the principal defect in emphysema is hyperinflation due to destruction of elastic tissue, conventional medical treatment still remains to be symptomatic treatment and of limited value due to failure to improve elastic recoil of lung tissue.<xref rid="b1-copd-11-1793" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Surgical treatment for emphysema, involves major thoracic surgery in a generally elderly population with limited breathing capacities. It directly addresses the problem of lung hyperinflation through resection of damaged tissue.<xref rid="b2-copd-11-1793" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Therefore the clinical utility of bronchoscopic methods for achieving lung volume reduction have been evaluated in patients with advanced emphysema because those procedures are uniformly safer than surgical volume reduction.<xref rid="b3-copd-11-1793" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Biological lung volume reduction (BioLVR) is a novel endobronchial approach, which uses biological agents aiming to reduce lung volume by blocking off the most emphysematous areas with a rapidly polymerizing sealant. The mechanism of action involves resorption atelectasis from airway occlusion, subsequent airspace inflammation, and then remodeling. This remodeling will lead to scarring that induces contraction of lung parenchyma and functional volume reduction can be expected within 6&#x02013;8 weeks.<xref rid="b4-copd-11-1793" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Aim of the work</title><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of bronchoscopic BioLVR therapy in patients with pulmonary emphysema.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This study was carried out at chest medicine department in collaboration with clinical pathology department and radiology department, Mansoura University Hospitals, Mansoura, Egypt from May 2013 to August 2015.</p><p>Fifteen male patients with heterogeneous emphysema were recruited in this study.

Supplemental oxygen was given using nasal catheter and oxygen saturation was monitored throughout the procedure.</p><p>Through the oral route, the bronchoscope was introduced and advanced to the targeted segmental bronchus that was previously determined by HRCT chest.</p><p>In this study, we introduced a novel technique to deliver the biological agent (locally prepared fibrin glue and autologous blood) to the targeted segment using a triple lumen balloon catheter (TXR-12-A, 7 FR/200 cm, Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-11-1793">Figure 1</xref>), which was introduced through the working channel of the bronchoscope and advanced 1&#x02013;2 cm beyond the tip of the bronchoscope.<xref rid="b7-copd-11-1793" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The triple lumen balloon catheter has three ports, one for inflation of the balloon by special air syringe (this will occlude the targeted segmental bronchus preventing regurgitation and spillover of the injected agent into other nontargeted segments) and two ports leading to separate channels throughout the catheter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-copd-11-1793">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In group (A), autologous blood was used. A 30 mL blood sample was drawn from the patient (through a catheter fixed in the femoral vein) and immediately injected through one port of the triple lumen catheter, plus 3 mL Cyklokapron (tranexamic acid 100 mg/mL) and 3 mL calcium chloride 10% (2.04 mmol of calcium) injected through the other port of the triple lumen catheter. Cyclokapron is a potent antifibrinolytic and thus could accelerate the clotting time. Calcium can decrease time required for formation of visible blood clot. Injection through both ports was done simultaneously. Mixing of the blood with cyclokapron and calcium chloride occurred distal to the inflated balloon and blood clotting occurred in the targeted segment.</p><p>After injection, the catheter was kept in position for (4&#x02013;8) minutes, the specific duration was previously determined according to the clotting time of each patient. The balloon was then deflated and the catheter was withdrawn. The procedure was repeated to the next targeted segment.</p><p>In group (B), fibrin glue was used. Fibrin glue was locally prepared from plasma containing fibrinogen and thrombin. Plasma containing fibrinogen was previously prepared by obtaining blood sample from the patient that underwent centrifugation after adding citrate, and then the supernatant plasma was separated. This maneuver was done in the clinical pathology department under sterile conditions. Thrombin was prepared from the commercially available Multifibrin-U, SIEMENS (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products Gmbh, Marburg, Germany), bovine thrombin (50 IU/mL).<xref rid="b8-copd-11-1793" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The required dosage ratio of plasma to thrombin to form a coagulum were previously calculated in the clinical pathology department after several trials. In this study, a dose of 30 mL fibrin glue (15 mL plasma plus 15 mL thrombin) was used per segment.</p><p>Patient&#x02019;s plasma and thrombin was injected simultaneously into the targeted segment through two separate channels of the triple lumen catheter after balloon inflation. The catheter was kept in position for 1 minute as fibrin glue formation in the targeted segment takes &#x0003c;1 minute. The procedure was then repeated in the next targeted segment.</p></sec><sec><title>Postprocedure follow-up for early and late complications</title><p>All patients were monitored for 24 hours postprocedure for the development of any early complications (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbations, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, cardiac ischemia, or myocardial infarction) as well as for late complications (eg, lung abscess and empyema).</p><sec><title>Outcomes evaluation</title><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Primary endpoint Reduction in the volume of the targeted emphysematous part at 12 weeks postprocedure was evaluated by:

However, there was no significant difference between groups A and B (<italic>P</italic>=0.726), as reduction in lung volume was (&#x02212;725&#x000b1;230 mL<sup>3</sup>) and (&#x02212;622.6&#x000b1;435.4 mL<sup>3</sup>) in groups A and B.</p><p>This significant radiological response was noticed in a clinical trial implemented by Criner et al,<xref rid="b3-copd-11-1793" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> who studied the therapeutic dose and safety of fibrin hydrogel in 50 patients with advanced upper lobe emphysema, comparing high dose treatment of 20 mL/subsegment (in 22 patients) and low dose treatment of 10 mL/subsegment (in 28 patients). They showed that radiologic response (in the form of increased linear densities, scarring, and atelectasis occurred at 6 weeks) was observed at 57%&#x000b1;17% of treatment sites using a dose of 10 mL per site and 68%&#x000b1;20% using a dose of 20 mL per site. Radiographic responses were larger in size after high dose (20 mL/subsegment) compared with low dose therapy (10 mL/subsegment).</p><p>Another clinical trial of BioLVR involved 25 patients with homogeneous emphysema was performed by Refaely et al.<xref rid="b9-copd-11-1793" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> They showed that radiological response in the form of peripheral atelectasis and scarring reactions were more extensive following 20 mL per site treatment than 10 mL per site treatment.</p><p>Also, results in both groups in our study are quite close to that found by Kramer et al,<xref rid="b10-copd-11-1793" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> who used AeriSeal (Aeris Therapeutics, Woburn, MA, USA) lung sealant for polymeric lung volume reduction (PLVR).

In addition, there was more significant improvement in RV/TLC in the fibrin glue group than in the autologous blood group at 12 weeks postprocedure (<italic>P</italic>=0.018).

In the high dose group, one patient developed deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus 4 days postprocedure.</p><p>COPD exacerbation occurred in one patient in group B (12.5%), which developed 1 week postprocedure and was controlled by medical therapy. This result was better than that found by Criner et al,<xref rid="b3-copd-11-1793" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> who reported that COPD exacerbations within the first 6 months of treatment were observed in nine of 22 high dose patients (41%); Refaely et al<xref rid="b9-copd-11-1793" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> also reported that COPD exacerbations were observed in three of 17 patients (18%) in the high dose group; Herth et al<xref rid="b11-copd-11-1793" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and Kramer et al<xref rid="b10-copd-11-1793" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> also demonstrated that treatment-related COPD exacerbations were observed in eight of 25 patients (32%) and three of 20 patients (15%), respectively. The low incidence noted in this study could be attributed to the biological nature of agents used in addition to use of balloon catheter that prevented spill over into other non-targeted segments.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>BioLVR using locally prepared fibrin glue and autologous blood is a promising method for therapy of advanced heterogeneous emphysema in terms of efficacy and safety as well as cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Small number of patients recruited in the study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Preliminary results of this study were presented at the 22nd Annual Congress of ERS, September 6&#x02013;10, 2014 in Munich, Germany as thematic poster presentation.
