Improving dyspnoea and exercise tolerance are now recognised as important goals in the treatment of stable COPD [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], with the measurement of exercise endurance considered a valuable component of COPD assessment, particularly in response to treatment interventions [<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Current trials of COPD treatments use a variety of exercise tests, such as the 6-min walk test, incremental and endurance shuttle walk tests, and cycle ergometry and treadmill tests [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In particular, constant work-rate cycle ergometry (CWRCE) is now often used in efficacy evaluations of long-acting bronchodilators because it allows a thorough evaluation of the physiological response during exercise and due to its documented responsiveness to treatment [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Exercise studies have provided insights into the mechanistic factors responsible for reductions in exertional breathlessness and improvements in symptom-limited exercise endurance in COPD following bronchodilator treatment [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These improvements include sustained lung volume reduction as a result of improved tidal expiratory flow rates and lung emptying, with reduced resting and exercise lung hyperinflation and a delay in the mechanical limitation to ventilation [<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Consequently, exertional dyspnoea is alleviated, leading to increases in exercise endurance time (EET).</p><p>There is a large body of evidence that the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) tiotropium can increase inspiratory capacity, reduce exertional breathlessness and improve EET in patients with COPD [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist (LABA) olodaterol is approved as a once-daily maintenance treatment for patients with COPD [<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and has been shown in two, 6-week, crossover studies to be effective in improving inspiratory capacity, reducing exertional breathlessness and increasing EET in patients with moderate to very severe COPD [<xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The pivotal 52-week TONADO studies demonstrated the bronchodilating efficacy of maintenance treatment with tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g and 5/5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g in patients with moderate to very severe COPD, with improvements compared with tiotropium and olodaterol monotherapies with respect to airflow limitation (assessed <italic>via</italic> forced expiratory volume in 1&#x02005;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>)), health-related quality of life (assessed <italic>via</italic> the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire) and dyspnoea during daily activities (assessed <italic>via</italic> the Transition Dyspnoea Index) [<xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The MORACTO studies further extended the evaluation of the efficacy of tiotropium/olodaterol by investigating whether the effects on lung hyperinflation, exertional dyspnoea and exercise tolerance seen with tiotropium and olodaterol monotherapies are maintained, or even extended, when the two therapies are combined.</p><p>The primary objective of the MORACTO studies was to investigate the effects of 6&#x02005;weeks of treatment with tiotropium/olodaterol compared with placebo, tiotropium and olodaterol on inspiratory capacity and EET during CWRCE in patients with moderate to severe COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Male or female patients (aged 40&#x02013;75&#x02005;years) were enrolled if they met the following inclusion criteria: post-bronchodilator (400&#x02005;&#x000b5;g salbutamol) FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity (FVC) &#x0003c;70%; post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x02265;30% and &#x0003c;80% of predicted normal (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2&#x02013;3); current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of &#x0003e;10 pack-years.

Following an initial screening visit, there was a 2- to 4-week run-in period to ensure clinical stability and perform baseline assessments.

All subsequent symptom-limited CWRCE tests were conducted at 75% of peak work rate. Prior to randomisation, two CWRCE tests were performed: the first was included as a &#x0201c;training&#x0201d; test, while the second represented the pre-treatment baseline test. Following randomisation, CWRCE tests were also conducted at the end of each treatment period, 2&#x02005;h after inhalation of study medication. Inspiratory capacity and intensity of breathing discomfort and leg discomfort (standardised version of the modified Borg scale [<xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]) were measured prior to exercise, every 2&#x02005;min during exercise and at the point of symptom limitation (end-exercise). Isotime was defined for each patient as the shortest exercise duration observed in all constant work-rate tests (baseline and all treatment periods). Heart rate and blood pressure measurements were also recorded during exercise and reported as 30-s averages. After completing each exercise test, patients identified the primary reason for stopping (due to leg and/or breathing discomfort or other reason).</p><p>The studies were carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice; written informed consent was obtained from each patient.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>End-points</title><p>The primary efficacy end-points were assessed after 6&#x02005;weeks of treatment: inspiratory capacity prior to exercise (2&#x02005;h post-dose, immediately prior to CWRCE) and EET during CWRCE.

The primary end-point of inspiratory capacity prior to exercise was met, with significant increases with tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 and 5/5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g compared with tiotropium 5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g, olodaterol 5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g and placebo. Additional serial assessments of inspiratory capacity during exercise demonstrated that these improvements were maintained at isotime and end-exercise. Improvements in inspiratory capacity were accompanied by significantly longer EET with both doses of tiotropium/olodaterol compared with placebo. However, despite statistically significant increases in inspiratory capacity for tiotropium/olodaterol <italic>versus</italic> tiotropium or olodaterol monotherapy, increases in EET with tiotropium/olodaterol were not consistently demonstrated compared with the monotherapies. <italic>Post hoc</italic> analyses did not identify any specific subgroup of patients exhibiting greater improvements in EET with tiotropium/olodaterol <italic>versus</italic> monotherapy; details of these <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses are provided in the supplementary material. As previously reported [<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], endurance time during constant work-rate exercise is asymmetrically distributed around the mean, with a significant skew towards long EETs. Therefore, in contrast to previous trials of cycling endurance time in COPD, statistical analyses were performed on log<sub>10</sub>-transformed endurance time data. However, in order to facilitate comparisons with previous studies, we also report the arithmetic mean treatment effects (supplementary table S7).</p><p>Exercise studies such as MORACTO have now become standard in many clinical programmes in COPD to gain a more comprehensive appreciation of the efficacy profile of new therapeutics. Two replicate studies were conducted for independent substantiation of the results. In addition, to be consistent with other studies in the phase III programme, two doses of tiotropium/olodaterol were investigated in the MORACTO studies. Finally, in contrast to early bronchodilator exercise studies [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], evidence of lung hyperinflation (<italic>e.g.</italic> FRC % pred &#x0003e;120%) was not an inclusion criterion in the MORACTO studies, as the intention was to enrol a study population that was broadly similar to other studies in the phase III programme. In line with a previous study of the effects of tiotropium on lung hyperinflation, dyspnoea and exercise tolerance, patients with exercise limitation related to factors other than fatigue or exertional dyspnoea were excluded from this study and there were no other protocol differences of note [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The inspiratory capacity results prior to and during exercise in MORACTO complement the results from the VIVACITO body plethysmography substudy [<xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which evaluated the effects of tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 and 5/5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g on lung volume parameters (FRC, residual volume, total lung capacity (TLC), inspiratory capacity) at rest in patients with COPD. In the VIVACITO substudy, after 6&#x02005;weeks of once-daily treatment, tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 and 5/5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g increased inspiratory capacity (TLC&#x02013;FRC) by 0.305 and 0.351&#x02005;L, respectively. Consistent with VIVACITO, in MORACTO, inspiratory capacity increased at week 6 by 0.218&#x02013;0.274&#x02005;L with tiotropium/olodaterol (2.5/5 and 5/5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g) compared with placebo. There is robust evidence that long-acting bronchodilator (LAMA, LABA) maintenance therapy in patients with COPD provides sustained lung volume reduction as a result of improved tidal expiratory flow rates and lung emptying, with reduced resting and exercise lung hyperinflation, and a delay in the mechanical limitation to ventilation, with a consequent alleviation of exertional dyspnoea and an increase in symptom-limited EET [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. With the availability of once-daily LAMA/LABA combinations, recent attention has focused on exploring the effects of combination therapy <italic>versus</italic> placebo and monotherapy on indices of lung hyperinflation, exertional dyspnoea and EET. B<sc>eeh</sc>
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> [<xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] investigated the effects of QVA149 (a combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium) <italic>versus</italic> placebo and tiotropium in patients with COPD with a post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> of 1.6&#x02005;L (56% predicted). Overall, 73% of patients were GOLD 2 and 27% were GOLD 3.&#x000a0;As with the present studies, the presence of lung hyperinflation was not an inclusion criterion. After 3&#x02005;weeks of once-daily treatment, the combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in inspiratory capacity compared with both placebo and tiotropium pre-exercise, at isotime and at end-exercise. Statistically significant improvements in EET during CWRCE at 75% of peak work rate were demonstrated compared with placebo; however, as in our studies, there was no significant difference in EET compared with tiotropium [<xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similar effects were observed in a study assessing the efficacy of umeclidinium/vilanterol in improving EET, using the endurance shuttle walk test, in patients with COPD. Improvements in EET were significant compared with placebo at week 12 in one study but this was not replicated in the parallel study. This was suggested to be due to the unexpectedly high placebo response in the second study [<xref rid="C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Inspiratory capacity indicates the position of tidal volume relative to TLC and, therefore, its proximity to the upper, less compliant reaches of the respiratory system's static pressure&#x02013;volume relation. The lower the resting inspiratory capacity, the closer the tidal volume is to the TLC and the greater the elastic load on the inspiratory muscles. As such, it is somewhat unexpected that the additional benefits of dual bronchodilation on inspiratory capacity noted by B<sc>eeh</sc>
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> [<xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and in MORACTO did not translate into less exertional dyspnoea and prolonged exercise tolerance. Although we do not have a definitive explanation for this observation, it may well be that in patients with moderate airway obstruction and relatively mild lung hyperinflation, an inspiratory capacity increase of 0.1&#x02013;0.15&#x02005;L during exercise for combination treatment <italic>versus</italic> monotherapy is not sufficient to have clinically important effects on exertional breathlessness. Also, there could be a limit for bronchodilation to immediately translate into better exercise tolerance. In fact, it may be unrealistic to expect the same exercise benefit when adding a second therapy to an existing one than when adding a therapy to placebo. Providing additional bronchodilation with a second bronchodilator may result in two outcomes during exercise [<xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]: prolonging exercise duration or shifting the locus of symptom limitation from dyspnoea to leg fatigue [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the latter situation, an improvement in exercise duration with bronchodilation is less likely [<xref rid="C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this situation, combining exercise training (to improve limb muscle fatigue) to bronchodilation could produce optimal results [<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>It is noteworthy that the study by B<sc>eeh</sc>
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> [<xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and the present studies used similar inclusion criteria to those used in the respective clinical programmes. While this was a reasonable approach to maintain consistency with study populations from other trials in the respective clinical programmes, it may have led to limitations in the ability to explore the relative effects of the combinations <italic>versus</italic> monotherapies by not ensuring that the study population had clear evidence of airflow limitation during exercise, <italic>e.g.</italic> by requiring evidence of lung hyperinflation and/or activity-related dyspnoea. Future studies that include a patient phenotype with more severe COPD, evidence of resting (and dynamic) hyperinflation at screening plus respiratory symptoms as their primary cause for exercise limitation are warranted. Approximately one-fifth of patients had cardiac disorders at baseline. This may have added an additional confounding factor due to lung&#x02013;heart interactions following anti-muscarinic and/or &#x003b2;-agonist stimulus. The study was further complicated by the incomplete-crossover design, whereby patients only received four of five possible treatments. Thus, some patients may have received tiotropium/olodaterol but not tiotropium 5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g. Furthermore, the incomplete-crossover design meant that each patient was followed-up over a relatively long period (&#x0003e;30&#x02005;weeks) during which their condition may have changed.</p><p>The lack of a significant difference in breathing discomfort at isotime between tiotropium/olodaterol and tiotropium may be contrasted with the statistically significant reduction in Transition Dyspnoea Index focal score observed in the pivotal TONADO studies, which is indicative of a reduction in the degree of dyspnoea experienced during everyday activities. Furthermore, a statistically significant reduction in rescue medication use for tiotropium/olodaterol compared with monotherapies is also suggestive of incremental benefit for tiotropium/olodaterol over monotherapies in alleviating symptoms. Thus, further studies are warranted to better understand the relationship between lung hyperinflation, exertional dyspnoea and exercise tolerance for combination monotherapy.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These two replicate studies have extended the evidence of the effects of tiotropium/olodaterol on lung hyperinflation by demonstrating increased inspiratory capacity prior to and during exercise compared with placebo or monotherapies.
