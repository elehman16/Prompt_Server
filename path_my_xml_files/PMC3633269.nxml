The most common symptom is heartburn, but acid regurgitation is also frequently seen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] However, symptoms and severity do not match. The pathophysiology is multifactorial and includes transient lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation, incompetence of LES, reduced esophageal clearance, and impaired resistance of the mucosa. Treatment of GERD is important because it is a chronic recurring disease with many complications including stricture and bleeding.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p><italic>Shankha bhasma</italic> is an Ayurvedic preparation commonly used in the treatment of GERD. It is the shell of a marine creature called <italic>Turbinella rapha</italic>. The chemical composition is CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Two types of <italic>shankha</italic> are available. One is vamavarta, that is, opening onto the left side and <italic>dakshinvarta</italic>, that is, opening onto the right side. <italic>Vamavarta</italic> is used for the preparation of <italic>shankha bhasma</italic>.</p><p>There are two methods of preparation of <italic>shankha bhasma</italic> as per <italic>rasatarangini</italic>. In the first method (method A), the <italic>shankha</italic> is made into pieces of 1 to 2 inch size with iron mortar and pestle, tied into a poultice amidst lemon juice for three hours, taken out, and washed with warm water. In the second method (method B), the sankha is made into small pieces of 1 to 2 inches in size by pounding it with iron mortar and pestle, tied into a poultice, and subjected to boiling in <italic>dolayantra</italic> amidst sour gruel for three hours, taken out, and washed with warm water. After purification by either of these methods, the <italic>shankha</italic> is kept in an earthen plate, closed with another one, sealed, dried, and subjected to incineration in a <italic>gajaputa</italic>, following which the <italic>shankha</italic> becomes white <italic>bhasma</italic> after two sequential incineration steps.</p><p>Though <italic>rasataranagini</italic> describes two methods of purification of <italic>shankha bashma</italic>, there is no study to address the superiority of either purification method in terms of clinical outcome. This study aims to determine the clinical outcome in GERD after treatment with two purified forms of <italic>shankha bhasma</italic> (<italic>bhasma</italic> A and <italic>bhasma</italic> B) as described above.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Criteria for patient selection</title><p>Patients aged 18 years or older with a history of heartburn for at least six months and having a current episode of moderate-to-severe heartburn for at least four days out of seven days prior to the commencement of the study were eligible to participate. The following were the exclusion criteria for the study: History of esophageal stricture/ulcer, evidence of gastroesophageal bleed within three days of entry into study, use of modern medication within the last one month, diabetes/hypertension/malabsorbtion syndrome, severe cardiopulmonary disease, renal disease, active malignancy, or cerebrovascular disease. Valid and informed written consent was obtained from the patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria.</p><p>Patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria were given sample A and sample B at a dose of 300 mg each[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] with gooseberry twice daily. The patients were asked to report every week in the outpatient department and note down the symptoms of heartburn every time it occurred in a diary, and they were followed for eight weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Design</title><p>This was a single-center, prospective, double-blind study in a hospital setting. Baseline evaluation was done with general medical history, use of alcohol, caffeine, review of past medications, and physical examination. The patients were not assessed endoscopically either at entry or during the study. Primary efficacy variable was proportion of patients with resolution of moderate-to-severe heartburn at weeks 4 and 8. Secondary efficacy variable was percentage of heartburn-free days, and any complication thereof.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Assessment of symptoms</title><p>Severity of heartburn was classified as None: No heartburn; Mild: Awareness but easily tolerated; Moderate: Discomforting heartburn causing interference with daily activities; Severe: Incapacitating heartburn preventing performance of normal daily activities.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was done on SPSS software version 18.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>RESULT</title><p>A total of 80 patients were included in the study over a six-month period in a medical college hospital that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Baseline characters of the patients were as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characters of the patients (<italic>n</italic>=80)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JNSBM-4-160-g001"/></table-wrap><p>These patients were randomized to receive either sample A or sample B by a computer-generated double-blind technique. Of the 80 patients, 70 patients were available for follow-up. The reason for discontinuation of the study was due to not reporting in the outpatient department (8 patients) and adverse experience (2 patients). Adverse experience was in the form of nausea and vomiting immediately after taking the study medication. The patients did not require any other intervention except discontinuation of the study drug.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Resolution of symptoms</title><p>The proportion of patients who experienced no heartburn or only mild heartburn was significantly more in group A than group B.

However, the percentage for this complication is extremely low (2.8%).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the treatment of GERD, symptomatic response to therapy is an important marker of clinical success because this factor is very troublesome for the patients. <italic>Shankha bhasma</italic> has been shown to be clinically effective in treating GERD in various studies, in rats,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and also in vitro.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Our study is the first of its kind to assess the clinical effectiveness in patients by two different purification methods. In the first method, <italic>shankha bhasma</italic> was purified by using lemon juice whereas in the second method, sour gruel in <italic>dolayantra</italic> was used. The patients were given 300 mg of <italic>shankha bhasma</italic>.</p><p>In our study, resolution of symptoms was statistically more significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005) in the lemon juice <italic>shodhan</italic> method than sour gruel method at four weeks (66 and 27%, respectively) and at eight weeks (71 and 31%, respectively). Although heartburn-free days were also higher in lemon juice <italic>shodhan</italic> compared to patients treated with <italic>shankha bhasma</italic> prepared by sour gruel method (48 <italic>vs</italic>. 20), adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting were reported by two patients administered <italic>shankha bhasma</italic> prepared by lemon juice <italic>shodhan</italic> method. In these patients, the adverse effects subsided following stoppage of the medication.</p><p>In previous studies evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of <italic>shankha bhasma</italic>, its neutralizing capacity was reported to be enhanced following coadministration of <italic>amalki churna</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] In another study, <italic>shankha churna</italic> when compared with <italic>shavasana</italic>, did not improve clinical outcome.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] However, both these studies were not randomized, and hence results are difficult to interpret, although our study was randomized to eliminate any element of bias. There was a statistically significant clinical benefit by using <italic>shankha bhasma</italic> purified by lemon juice compared to sour gruel, and hence we recommend the use of lemon juice for purification process of <italic>shankha bhasma</italic> and suggest a twice-daily dose of 300 mg along with gooseberry as therapy for GERD.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
