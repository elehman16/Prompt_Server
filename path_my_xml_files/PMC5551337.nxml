The inception of the surgical operating microscope and microsurgical procedures is an important step to achieve this goal. These advances could lead to more precise and less traumatic tissue manipulation, enabling precise coaptation of wound edges and healing by the first intention.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Surgical trauma is minimized during microsurgery, thus less cell damage and necrosis occur, resulting in less inflammation and reduced pain.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Furthermore, in root surface coverage procedures, a microsurgical approach using ophthalmic blades and microsurgical suture (6-0) substantially improved the vascularization of the grafts as compared with applying a conventional macroscopic approach.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The coronally advanced flap (CAF) procedure is a very common approach for root coverage. This procedure is based on the coronal shift of the soft tissues on the exposed root surface. It has been documented as an effective surgical technique and a predictable mucogingival surgical procedure used to achieve root coverage in the treatment of Millers Class I and II gingival recessions.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>A recent innovation in dentistry is the use of second-generation platelet concentrate which is an autologous platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) with growth factors and cicatricial properties for root coverage procedures. This material can be used as a reservoir for active biochemicals which are released slowly maintaining the grafted biomaterials in their respective positions. It not only reduces the bulk of graft material required but also makes a desirable connection between bone particles.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The use of connective tissue grafts (CTGs) has made esthetic root coverage a predictable procedure. The connective tissue autograft technique was originally described by Edel in 1974 and is based on the fact that connective tissue carries the genetic message for the overlying epithelium to become keratinized.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Improvements in clinical outcomes have been reported by adding CTG to the CAF. This approach is associated with greater probability of obtaining complete root coverage (CRC) in the treatment of localized recession compared with other technique. When carefully closed, palatal donor sites can heal by primary intention without a painful period of open granulation after trap door (TD) CTG procurement technique. This greatly reduces postoperative morbidity.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Hence, the present study was conducted to evaluate autologous PRF and autogenous CTG in gingival recession defects in conjunction with CAF using the microsurgical technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This randomized controlled clinical study was conducted in the Department of Periodontology from November 2013 to December 2015. The study was conducted by the ethical principles described in the Declaration of Helsinki 1998 revised 2008 after approval from IRDC (SDC/IRDC/2013/MDS-P/26) and IHEC (SDC/IHEC/2013/MDS-P/26).</p><p>Nonalcoholic, nonsmoker (self-reported) patients of both genders of age more than 18 years, with no contributory medical history, were recruited among those visiting the outpatient Department of Periodontology based on the following inclusion criteria. Patients (1) having at least one tooth in maxillary anterior teeth region with Millers Class I or Class II labial gingival recession defect; (2) in good general health with no contraindications for periodontal surgery; (3) not using antibiotics, corticosteroids, chemotherapeutics, immunomodulators, or others that modify the results of periodontal therapy during the last 6 months; (4) selected teeth must be free of endodontic treatment, buccal or interproximal restoration; and (5) who have not undergone any periodontal treatment in the preceding 6 months of initial examination were included in the study. All the participants received verbal information regarding the study protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient for participation in the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size determination</title><p>For the present study to ascertain the sample size (number of sites to be treated in each group), <italic>pre hoc</italic> analysis with the following method was done:</p><p>n = 2&#x000d7;(Z&#x003b1;/2 + Z&#x003b2;)<sup>2</sup> SD<sup>2</sup>/d<sup>2</sup> (where n: sample size per group; SD: pooled standard deviation being 0.5 in this; d: difference in the means (effect size); Z&#x003b1;/2: significance level, Z&#x003b2;: power of the study).</p><p>Assuming 80% power, 5% significance level with 95% confidence interval as well as assuming standard 0.50, the required sample size per group is 11 subjects in each group. Assuming 20% loss to follow-up, the final sample size is 13 in each group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Design of the study</title><p>For this randomized clinical study, randomization was conducted with the help of a random selection of sealed envelope having an equal chance of selection. These identical looking sealed envelopes consist of one of the three treatment modalities. Envelopes for each treatment modalities were equal in number to avoid heterogeneous sample size. The randomized controlled clinical trial comprised 36 patients (34 men and 2 women) with Millers Class I or II gingival recession present on the facial aspect of maxillary teeth with total sites of 45, which were divided into three groups as shown in flowchart [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart showing design of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-8-293-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Platelet-rich fibrin</title><p>For the present study, PRF was prepared as per the following protocol given by Patel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] For the successful preparation of PRF, speedy blood collection and immediate centrifugation before the clotting cascade is initiated are essential. PRF clot in the middle was thereby carefully removed by sterilized scissors. The centrifuge machine was placed close to the operatory, and all the efforts were made to minimize the time between the preparation of PRF and its placement in the defect so as to retain the maximum regenerative potential.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Connective tissue graft</title><p>The connective tissue autograft for the present study was obtained from the palate using TD technique.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Excess connective tissue and fat was carefully removed with the help of Castroviejo scissors. Care was taken to ensure that the incision does not extend more apical than 10 mm from cementoenamel junction (CEJ) of the maxillary posterior teeth and the distal extent of the incision should end no further than the mesial border of maxillary first molar.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Initial therapy</title><p>All the selected patients were informed about the cause of the recession and given detailed instruction for performing meticulous plaque control measures. All patients enrolled in the study underwent Phase I therapy. Reevaluation of Phase I therapy was done after 1 month. On the follow-up visit, an acrylic stent was fabricated as described by Lekovic <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] using cold cure resin for record of the clinical parameters at baseline, and the stent after that was preserved on the cast which was again taken into consideration after 3 and 6 months for recording the clinical parameters. The apical margin of the stent served as the measurement point: it was linear and positioned in the coronal third of the tooth, leaving the interdental papillae visible. A reference point (slot) was carved on the stent at the midbuccal area of the experimental tooth, to allow a reproducible periodontal probe positioning. All the clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months with the use of the same acrylic stent.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>Compliant patients with satisfactory oral hygiene maintenance were appointed for surgical therapy. Baseline clinical parameters were recorded on the day of the surgical appointment. Immediately before surgery, selected recession defects were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment modalities. All surgical procedures were performed under the microscopic vision using a surgical operating microscope (3D Medical system company, USA, with the magnification of 10&#x000d7;&#x02013;20&#x000d7;). All the incisions were given with microsurgical (ophthalmic disposable) blade. All the surgical procedures (experimental and control) were performed by the same investigator.</p><p>Before surgery, patients were asked to rinse their mouth with 10 ml of 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution as a presurgical rinse. The extraoral surfaces of the patient were swabbed with betadine (10% povidone iodine). The operative site was anesthetized with 2% lignocaine HCl with adrenaline (1:200,000) using block or infiltration technique. In case of experimental Group I (CAF with PRF), patient's blood sample was taken out for preparing PRF as explained above before giving incisions.</p><p>CAF performed in the study was according to de Sanctis and Zucchelli.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Two horizontal releasing incisions, mesial and distal to the recession defect located at a distance from the tip of the anatomical papillae equal to the depth of the recession plus 1 mm, without involving the gingival margin of adjacent teeth were given. An intrasulcular incision was made on the buccal aspect of the involved tooth. This was followed by two beveled oblique, slightly divergent, incisions starting at the end of the two horizontal incisions and extending to the alveolar mucosa. The resulting trapezoidal-shaped flap was elevated with a split&#x02013;full&#x02013;split approach in the coronal&#x02013;apical direction: the surgical papillae comprised between the horizontal incisions and the probable sulcular area apical to the root exposure were elevated split thickness keeping the blade almost parallel to the root, and the soft tissue apical to the root exposure was elevated full thickness inserting a small periosteum elevator into the probable sulcus and proceeding in the apical direction up to exposing 3&#x02013;4 mm of bone apical to the bone dehiscence. The releasing vertical incisions were elevated split thickness keeping the blade parallel to the bone plane, thus leaving the periosteum to protect the underlying bone in the lateral areas of the flap [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. To permit the coronal advancement of the flap, all muscle insertions present in the thickness of the flap were eliminated. This was done keeping the blade parallel to the external mucosal surface. Coronal mobilization of the flap was considered &#x0201c;adequate&#x0201d; when the marginal portion of the flap was able to passively reach a level coronal to the CEJ of the tooth with the recession defect. Exposed root surfaces were gently scaled and planed with Gracey curettes, followed by thorough saline irrigation.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Recipient surgical site preparation using disposable ophthalmic blade</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-8-293-g002"/></fig><p>For experimental Group I (CAF with PRF), surgical site was flushed with saline. PRF was then positioned on the recession defect and squeezed to form a membrane that covers the defect.

The gingival flap was repositioned with its margin located on the enamel in the both experimental and control sites and was held at that position with horizontal sling suture. Interrupted sutures were placed along the vertical releasing incisions.</p><p>Light cure periodontal dressing (Barricaid, Dentsply) was applied at the surgical site [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. Postsurgically, both test and control group patients were prescribed systemic antibiotics amoxicillin 500 mg TID for 5 days and the combination of brufen and paracetamol (ibugesic plus) bid 3 days. Postoperative written instructions were given to all the patients, and they were instructed to report to the department after 10 days. During this, plaque control was achieved with a 0.2% chlorhexidine solution rinse used twice a day.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Surgical site covered with light cure dressing</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-8-293-g004"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Patient follow-up</title><p>After 10 days of the surgery, the dressings and sutures were carefully removed without hampering the healing of soft tissue, and the surgical site was irrigated with normal saline.

Compared to the present study where mean root coverage of 74% was observed in PRF-treated group, Aroca <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported 80.7% of mean root coverage at 6 months.</p><p>In terms of CRC achieved at 6 months, in the present study, results showed that 100% CRC was obtained in 60% sites of Group I (CAF and PRF), 20% sites of Group II (CAF and CTG), and 27% sites of Group III (CAF alone). In contrast to Aroca <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] who reported CRC in 19% patients of CAF and PRF group as compared to CAF alone, where 100% root coverage was obtained in 52.3% patients, our results reported superior root coverage in PRF-treated site as compared to control group. Previous studies have reported CRC in about 18%&#x02013;93.5% of CTG-treated sites.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The variation can be attributed to differences in defect severity, surgical protocol, and other factors. When comparing results from different studies, definition and measurement of CRC may influence the results.</p><p>There was a significant increase in gingival thickness (GT-MB) in Group II (CAF and CTG) from baseline to 3 months and 3 months to 6 months. Regarding the increase in thickness, CTG-treated sites obtained better results as compared to PRF with CAF and CAF alone. Furthermore, studies have reported that increased gingival thickness is essential for the stable clinical outcome,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] as well as creeping attachment that occur after 6&#x02013;9 months. Although every care was taken while recording gingival thickness measurements using TGP technique, probe angulations, precision of manual probe markings, and reproducibility of the sites may be the source of error in TGP.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>There was a significant increase in AG and KG from baseline to 6 months in all the groups. In CAF sites alone or with PRF and CTG, increase in KG may be explained by the fact that mucogingival junction that demarcates the junction between the basal bone and the alveolar process has the tendency to reestablish itself to the original position, leading to gain in keratinized tissue height.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>There was no significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) difference in the PCS that represent patient's comfort regarding postsurgical pain and inflammation among the groups at baseline and 10 days. Similar to Bittencourt <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] even in the present study, no patient considered any one surgery more painful than other and considered all procedures uncomfortable for the first 10 days. There was a significant mean increase in PCS at 6 months in PRF-treated group, followed by CAF alone and least for CTG treatment groups. In accordance to the present study, Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] also reported a mean increase in PCS of 2.43 in PRF-treated sites after 6 months postsurgery. The homogenous fibrin network in PRF is considered by the promoters to be healing biomaterials containing platelets, growth factors, and cytokines that enhance soft tissue wound healing.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Jankovic <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] also reported improvements in early wound healing (first and second week postsurgery) in the group treated with PRF as compared to CTG-treated group. They advocated that patient discomfort data in PRF could be explained as a result of enhanced tissue healing and avoidance of a donor site surgical procedure. Cortellini <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported more number of patients experienced discomfort (swelling and pain) after CAF with CTG as compared to CAF alone, as observed in the present study.</p><p>PES was found to be significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) increased from baseline to 6 months in Group I and Group III, whereas the increase in PES was nonsignificant for Group II (CAF and CTG). Bitterncout <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] reported 100% patient satisfaction with esthetic results after recession coverage using microsurgical approach. Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported an increase in PES values in PRF treated-groups after 6 months postsurgery. The absence of scars and controlled increase in KG could justify patients&#x02019; satisfaction. However, the frequency of CRC could explain the difference in PES scores between various groups.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Further, a bulky look was obtained after CTG may be responsible for less PES in Group II (CAF and CTG).[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>There was statistically significant decrease in HS for Group I (CAF and PRF) but nonsignificant increase in Group III (CAF alone) followed by Group II (CAF and CTG) after 6 months postsurgery. Aroca <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported a decrease in HS in PRF-treated groups after 6 months postsurgery. Variation in HS observed in the study could be related to root coverage obtained.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>The procurement of CTG is technique sensitive procedure, and the optimal thickness of graft is an important determining factor. In cases of CTG-treated sites, the placement of CTG graft, the thickness of CTG, and size of the graft may somehow preclude its complete coverage by CAF. In contrast, PRF clot can be pressed into a thin membrane and easily covered by CAF. Therefore, in surgical technique, where vertical releasing incisions were performed for better visualization at the recipient site and reduction in surgical time,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in contrast to envelope flap or tunneling approach, vascularization of graft not covered by flap due to bulky size may result in the inferior clinical outcome as compared to CAF with PRF. Further, increased tension during suturing may cause impaired esthetics, disturb the initial wound healing, and result in less root coverage.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Therefore, in the present study, CRC in cases of CTG-treated sites was less as compared to PRF. However, if envelope flap or pouch and tunnel techniques are used, chances of complete coverage would have been more, even if some amount of graft is not covered by flap.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Although periodontal microsurgery plays a pivotal role in periodontal procedures, it is a skill that requires practice to achieve proficiency and presents special challenges in dexterity and perception. Its execution is technique sensitive and is thereby more demanding than conventional periodontal procedures.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Microsurgical technique results in better postoperative outcomes; however, training and extra space in clinical setup for surgical operating microscope may preclude its use in routine practice.</p><p>The drawbacks of the study were low sample size, short-term follow-up with fair oral hygiene instead of meticulous plaque control among subjects, and lack of histological evaluation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study inferred that although CTG has been considered as a gold standard regenerative material for the treatment of gingival recession defects, PRF may not be considered less than an alternative material for the management of recession defects regarding the percentage of root coverage as well as patient acceptance. PRF is autologous, simple to procure due to avoidance of donor site surgical procedure as seen in CTG, cost-effective, nonimmunogenic biomaterial with excellent handling properties. Concerning gingival thickness, CAF with CTG has a definitive edge over PRF with CAF and CAF alone and thus may have more predictable and stable long-term results in terms of creeping attachment.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, technique-sensitive CTG procurement requires precision and expertise and additional training.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bittencourt</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Del Peloso Ribeiro</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Sallum</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name><name><surname>Nociti</surname><given-names>FH</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Casati</surname><given-names>MZ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Surgical microscope may enhance root coverage with subepithelial connective tissue graft: A randomized-controlled clinical trial</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>2012</year><volume>83</volume><fpage>721</fpage><lpage>30</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21870975</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Kudva</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal microsurgery-magnifying facts, maximizing results</article-title><source>J Adv Med Dent Scie Res</source><year>2014</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>24</fpage><lpage>34</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Burkhardt</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>NP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Coverage of localized gingival recessions: Comparison of micro- and macrosurgical techniques</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>2005</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>287</fpage><lpage>93</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15766372</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pini Prato</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Pagliaro</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldi</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Nieri</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Saletta</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Cairo</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Coronally advanced flap procedure for root coverage.
