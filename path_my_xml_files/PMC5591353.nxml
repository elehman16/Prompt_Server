<italic>Purpose</italic> To evaluate effects on somatic and mental health of a multicomponent inpatient occupational rehabilitation program compared to a less comprehensive outpatient program in individuals on sick leave for musculoskeletal complaints or mental health disorders. <italic>Methods</italic> A randomized clinical trial with parallel groups. Participants were individuals on sick-leave for 2&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months with a sick-leave diagnosis within the musculoskeletal, psychological or general and unspecified chapters of ICPC-2. Potential participants were identified in the Social Security System Registry. The multicomponent inpatient program (4&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;days) consisted of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, physical training and work-related problem-solving including creating a return to work plan and a workplace visit if considered relevant. The comparative outpatient program consisted primarily of ACT (6&#x000a0;sessions during 6&#x000a0;weeks). Self-reported health-related quality of life, subjective health complaints, pain and anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed up to 12&#x000a0;months after the program. <italic>Results</italic> 168 individuals were randomized to the multicomponent inpatient program (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;92) or the outpatient program (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;76). Linear mixed models showed no statistically significant differences between the programs, except for slightly more reduced pain after the outpatient program. <italic>Conclusions</italic> This study presents no support that a 4&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;days multicomponent inpatient rehabilitation program is superior to a less comprehensive outpatient program, in improving health outcomes.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10926-016-9679-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Return to work</kwd><kwd>Sick leave</kwd><kwd>Musculoskeletal diseases</kwd><kwd>Absenteeism</kwd><kwd>Cognitive therapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsr&#x000e5;d</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>238015/H20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fimland</surname><given-names>Marius Steiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Liaison Committee between the Central Norway Regional Health Authority and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology</institution></funding-source><award-id>46056821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fimland</surname><given-names>Marius Steiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004590</institution-id><institution>Helse Midt-Norge</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Musculoskeletal and mental health disorders are the two leading causes of sickness absence in Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Five percent of the gross domestic product is spent on disability and sickness benefits, and this is by far the highest level in the OECD countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Most occupational rehabilitation programs described in the scientific literature are directed towards specific diagnostic groups, mainly musculoskeletal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Effects reported in the literature are ambiguous. For example, Jensen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] did not find added effects on return to work or pain reduction of multidisciplinary occupational rehabilitation compared to a brief intervention program for subjects with low back pain. In contrast, Lambeek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and Loisel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] reported that multidisciplinary occupational rehabilitation led to increased return to work and reduced disability, but with little effect on pain. Others have found increased return to work rates, but no effect on functional status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Studies on the effect of return to work programs for individuals with mental health disorders have also showed increased return to work, but no added reduction in symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, a recent study showed that work-focused cognitive behavioral therapy for individuals on sick leave with common mental disorders was more effective than usual care in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms, increasing health-related quality of life, as well as increasing or maintaining work participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">In Norway, the occupational rehabilitation services offer both inpatient and outpatient programs to increase work participation and improve health outcomes for patients on sick-leave, and the inclusion of different diagnostic groups in the same rehabilitation programs has been common practice for several years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, effects of such programs have never been evaluated with a rigorous study design. Recently, we participated in developing a multicomponent occupational rehabilitation program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The program consisted of cognitive behavioral therapy, physical training, creating a return to work plan, and a workplace visit if considered relevant by the participant and rehabilitation team. Physical exercise has been shown to reduce depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], seems to reduce pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and is recommended as an adjunctive treatment for anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Different diagnostic groups were included in the program. All activity at the center was framed within a cognitive behavioral therapy approach in the form of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The ACT model emphasizes accepting both negative and positive experiences, while focusing on a person`s values to guide them towards their goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In specific diagnostic groups there has been an increasing number of studies on the effect of ACT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although there are some inconsistencies in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], studies suggest that ACT may have beneficial effects on chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">We evaluated the effects of the multicomponent program delivered at the inpatient occupational rehabilitation center by comparing it to a less comprehensive outpatient program consisting mainly of ACT. In a recent study with 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up&#x000a0;we found no difference between the programs on number of sickness absence days and return to work&#x000a0;(under review). Here, we present results of secondary outcomes related to health as the programs also aimed to improve the participants` health status and health perception.</p><p id="Par6">We hypothesized that the inpatient program, to a greater extent than the outpatient program, would reduce pain, depression, anxiety and subjective health complaints and increase function and health-related quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p id="Par7">We conducted a randomized clinical trial with parallel groups, comparing an inpatient multicomponent program (4&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;days) with a single-component program (6 sessions during 6&#x000a0;weeks) (hereafter referred to as the inpatient- and outpatient program, respectively) for individuals on sick-leave due to musculoskeletal-, unspecific-, or common mental health disorders. Details about the study design have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The primary outcome in the main study was sickness absence (under review). The current study assesses effects on somatic and mental health in the inpatient program versus the outpatient program through 12&#x000a0;months follow-up. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Central Norway (No.: 2012/1241), and the trial is registered in clinicaltrials.gov (No.: NCT01926574).

Sick leave status at inclusion had to be at least 50&#x000a0;% off work. Exclusion criteria, assessed by a questionnaire and an outpatient screening performed by a physician, a physiotherapist and a psychologist, were: (1) alcohol or drug abuse; (2) serious somatic (e.g. cancer, unstable heart disease) or psychiatric disorders (e.g. high suicidal risk, psychosis, ongoing manic episode); (3) specific disorders requiring specialized treatment; (4) pregnancy; (5) currently participating in another treatment or rehabilitation program; (6) insufficient oral or written Norwegian language skills to participate in group sessions and fill out questionnaires; (7) scheduled for surgery within the next 6&#x000a0;months; and (8) serious problems with functioning in a group setting.</p><p id="Par9">Data was obtained by questionnaires and filled out at six time-points: at screening before inclusion, at the start of the program, at the end of the program, and three, six and 12&#x000a0;months after the inpatient program ended.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Programs</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>The Inpatient Program</title><p id="Par10">Consisted of group discussions (ACT based) led by team coordinators, individual and group based physical training, mindfulness, psychoeducation on stress and individual meetings with coordinator for work-related problem- solving and creating a return to work plan.

The two weeks at home included at least two contacts with the team coordinator (in person or by telephone) and a meeting with the employer if regarded relevant and the participant gave permission. A certified ACT instructor supervised the coordinators who mentored the participants before and during (monthly) the intervention. The program took place at Hysnes rehabilitation center, established as a part of St. Olavs Hospital, in central Norway.

One of two physicians (specialists in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation) or a psychologist, all three educated in ACT, led the sessions. The participants were encouraged to practise at home between sessions, including a daily 15&#x000a0;min audio-guided mindfulness practice. In addition the participants were offered two individual sessions with a social worker experienced in occupational rehabilitation and trained in ACT to clarify personal values and work-related issues. The intervention also included a motivational group discussion with a physiotherapist on the benefits of physical training. An individual session with both the social worker and ACT therapist present ended the intervention. In this session a summary letter was written to the participant&#x02019;s general practitioner.

The participants received text messages on their mobile telephone when it was time to answer questionnaires and as reminders if they did not respond. If they had not responded after two text-message reminders a project co-worker made a final phone call to remind the participant.</p><p id="Par13">Anxiety and depression were recorded using The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It consists of 14 items, where seven items measure anxiety and seven measure depression symptoms. It is scored on a 4-point Likert scale according to intensity of symptoms the last week. The maximum score is 21 on each subscale. HADS is widely used and has been found to perform well in assessing severity and detecting anxiety and depression, with a cut-off of 8 giving an optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. HADS was answered at all time-points, except at six months.</p><p id="Par14">Common somatic and mental health problems were recorded using The Subjective Health Complaints Inventory (SHC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which registers complaints in five subscales: musculoskeletal pain, pseudoneurology, gastrointestinal problems, allergy and flu. It consists of 29 questions regarding complaints experienced the last month&#x02014;each scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; to 3 &#x0201c;serious&#x0201d;. A severity score can be reported for each subscale or as a total score (score range 0&#x02013;87) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The questionnaire was answered at the start of the program, and three and 12&#x000a0;months after the program.</p><p id="Par15">To assess pain we used two questions from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The participants were asked to grade the strongest and average pain during the last week on a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) numeric rating scale. The pain questions were answered at all time-points, except at 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par16">Health-related quality of life was recorded using 15D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It contains 15 dimensions covering physical, mental and social well-being and generates a total score ranging from 1 (no problem on any dimension) to 0 (being dead). It has been suggested that the generic minimal important change is &#x000b1;0.015 and a large change is &#x000b1;0.035 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It should be noted that in the Alanne et al. study the cut-off for &#x0201c;slightly better&#x0201d; for pain and depression alone were 0.036 and 0.051, respectively. 15&#x000a0;D was answered at all time-points, except at screening and the end of the program.</p><p id="Par17">Functioning was recorded using COOP/WONKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It offers a self-reporting assessment of function in six domains. We used four of the domains: physical fitness, feelings, daily activity and social activity. Each domain is scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (no problems/not affected) to 5 (huge problems/considerably affected). Answers were used as a continuous score (range 1&#x02013;5). It was included at all time-points, except at screening and six months.</p><p id="Par18">Participants were asked to evaluate their general health on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 &#x0201c;poor&#x0201d; to 4 &#x0201c;very good&#x0201d;.

Repeated measurements (at the different time-points) were handled by including a random intercept for person in the models (thereby allowing the participants to start out at different levels) and a random slope for time (allowing individual development over time).

The median number of days on sick-leave the last 12&#x000a0;months before inclusion in the study (i.e. second randomization) was 226&#x000a0;days (interquartile range (IQR) 189&#x02013;271). Sick-leave diagnoses within the musculoskeletal chapter in ICPC-2 were most common (52&#x000a0;%), followed by psychological (38&#x000a0;%) and general and unspecified (10&#x000a0;%). The baseline characteristics of the participants in the two programs were fairly similar (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of participants<sup>a</sup>

Differences between the two programs, in addition to the inpatient versus outpatient setting, were that the inpatient program was more extensive and included physical training, creation of a return to work plan and a workplace visit in 13&#x000a0;% of the cases. However, these additional components did not induce additional benefits.</p><p id="Par38">Most occupational rehabilitation programs described in the scientific literature use some sort of cognitive behavioral therapy approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In ACT the participants are encouraged to accept pain rather than try to control it. It has therefore been argued that pain might not be the best outcome measure for acceptance-based therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This also applies to several of the other outcomes in this study like anxiety and depression, as ACT emphasize behavior change and not symptom reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This is line with our findings of modest changes for these outcomes. The outpatient program was slightly more effective in reducing one pain variable, but the difference was not clinically significant and due to the number of statistical tests performed this result should be interpreted with caution.</p><p id="Par39">We found an increase in health related quality of life in both groups measured by 15D, estimated to be 0.03 (95&#x000a0;% 0.01&#x02013;0.06) for the inpatient program and 0.05 (95&#x000a0;% CI 0.02&#x02013;0.07) for the outpatient program. The clinical importance of this change is uncertain, but it is in the area of cut-off suggested as a minimum important change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. When this is compared to the rather small changes observed on the other measures this might suggest that the focus of ACT on values and acceptance of negative experiences in life might have changed how the participants perceive their quality of life despite little change in health symptoms.</p><p id="Par40">Few randomized studies have included participants with different diagnoses in the same return to work programs. As we included individuals on sick leave due to musculoskeletal, mental or general/unspecific disorders, some had pain and others not, which was also the case for anxiety and depression symptoms. This would likely reduce the statistical power to detect between group effects. However, we performed subgroup analyses according to the participants` main sick-leave diagnosis. Participants with a psychological diagnosis had a somewhat larger reduction in depression symptoms than participants with a musculoskeletal diagnosis. However, there was no difference between participants with musculoskeletal and psychological diagnoses in reductions of average pain. As a substantial degree of overlap in symptoms is common in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and the diagnostic labelling by the general practitioner may be somewhat arbitrary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], we performed subgroup analyses for highest baseline scores on anxiety and depression symptoms and average pain. The estimates were fairly similar to the main analyses. It should be noted that the post hoc subgroup analyses were not planned a priori.</p><p id="Par41">The main strength of this randomized study was that all participants were invited from the Social Security System Registry, meaning there was no referral bias. Return to work rehabilitation centers have existed for about 30&#x000a0;years in Norway, but this is the first randomized controlled study investigating effects on somatic or mental health of such programs. The programs were not diagnosis specific and add important knowledge to a field where previous research has focused on diagnosis specific interventions. Also, the study included a broad range of validated health-related measures.</p><p id="Par42">Some limitations should be addressed. Firstly, the response rate for the questionnaires were low at 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. At the start and the end of the programs, more people answered the questionnaires in the inpatient program than in the outpatient program. The participants in the inpatient program answered the questionnaire at the rehabilitation center, while the outpatient participants did it at home. During follow-up, questionnaires were answered at home for both groups and the numbers of missing questionnaires were similar. We therefore assume that the structural differences in collecting questionnaire data account for the differences in responses between the two groups at the start and end of the intervention. For analyses we used linear mixed models which are less sensitive to missing values in outcome data. Still, these models rely on the assumption of &#x0201c;missing at random&#x0201d;, and we cannot disregard the possibility of bias due to loss to follow-up. However, we consider it unlikely that such bias should influence the two groups differentially and thereby the main results of the study. This assumption is strengthened by register-based sick leave data showing a similar number of sick leave days during 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up between participants responding/not responding to the questionnaire at 12&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par43">In the current study there was no usual care control group. Therefore, we cannot distinguish between the effects of rehabilitation and time. It should also be noted that the power calculation for the study was done with regard to the primary outcome (sickness absence) and not the secondary outcomes presented in this article.</p><p id="Par44">With regards to external validity it should be noted that from the over 3000 invitations sent, only 275 individuals accepted the invitation. A possible explanation might be that they had to be prepared to be away from their family for 2&#x000a0;weeks if randomized to the inpatient program. With only about 8&#x000a0;% of the invited accepting the invitation the generalizability of the results is a challenge. However, it should be noted that only a small portion of people on sick leave in Norway are referred to occupational rehabilitation centers. By inviting participants this broadly we were able to reach all individuals on sick-leave with these diagnoses without referral bias induced by the general practitioner.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par45">There was no substantial difference between the programs on somatic and mental health; hence, this study presents no support that a 4&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;days inpatient multicomponent rehabilitation program is superior to a less comprehensive outpatient program. Whether a longer lasting inpatient program will have greater effects on somatic and mental health will be investigated in an upcoming study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
