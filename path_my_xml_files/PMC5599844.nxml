with exercise on pain, health related quality of life and fall risk in male with
osteopenia or osteoporosis. [Subjects and Methods] 100 male patients with osteopenia or
osteoporosis participated in the study. They had T-scores &#x02264;&#x02212;1.5. Patients were randomly
assigned into four groups and treated with laser plus exercise, placebo laser plus
exercise, laser alone and placebo laser in groups I, II, III, and IV respectively. Laser
was applied to the lower back and hip regions. Exercises included aerobic exercises,
weight-bearing, flexibility, and strengthening and balance exercises. Treatment were
performed 3 times/week for 12 weeks. The measured outcomes were pain, health related
quality of life and fall risk. [Results] All measured outcomes were significantly
decreased post-treatment in all treatment groups. Laser plus exercises showed a higher
significant effect than exercises with a least significant effect in the laser group in
reduction of pain and quality of life. [Conclusion] High intensity laser is an effective
modality for male patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis. Laser combined with exercise
is more effective than exercises or laser alone in decreasing pain, fall risk an
increasing quality of life after 12 weeks of treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Exercises</kwd><kwd>High intensity laser therapy</kwd><kwd>Osteoporosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Osteoporosis has been defined as a systemic bone disease characterised by compromised bone
strength with a significant deterioration of bone micro architecture and decrease in bone
mass, leading to enhanced bone fragility and a high risk to fracture<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Osteoporosis is more prevalent in women, although about
15&#x02013;30% of the estimated osteoporotic fractures occurred in 2,000 were in men<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Men are less likely to receive therapy with
higher mortality rates after hip fractures as compared to women<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the Saudi Arabian male population, the prevalence of osteopenia was 46.3%, and
osteoporosis was 30.7% with an incidence of vertebral fractures between 20&#x02013;24%<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, the prevention of osteoporosis in males has an important role in improving the
health related life quality of middle aged and older adults<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A number pf previous researches investigated the physical therapy modalities in the
treatment of osteoporosis such as exercises<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, whole-body vibration training<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, pulsed electromagnetic field<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and low level laser therapy (LLLT)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Laser is able to
accelerate bone tissue healing through increase osteoblast DNA and RNA synthesis in vitro
studies<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the available literature there is a lack of evidence to the effect laser on
osteoporosis with no study has yet investigated its effect on humans. The limitation of low
power production and relatively limited penetration of the low power laser interfere with
its use in human to stimulate bone tissues. The recent developed pulsed Nd:YAG, infra-red
laser (1,064&#x02005;nm) provide high power (3KW) and high intensity laser therapy (HILT) that can
penetrate deep and is therefore able to stimulate the large and deep areas<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. HILT used for the treatment of many musculoskeletal diseases and
proved as a pain relieving modality for patients with knee osteoarthritis<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, chronic low back pain<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and chronic neck pain<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The effect of LLLT was administrated on animals or in vitro studies with no study
investigated the efficacy of HILT in male patients with osteoporosis. Therefore, there is a
need to investigate the effect of HILT alone or combined with exercise in the treatment of
men with osteopenia or osteoporosis. Hence, the aim of the study has been to investigate the
efficacy of HILT alone or combined with exercises on pain, health related quality of life
and fall risk in male with osteopenia or osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study design was a single blinded randomised placebo-control trial. This study was
approved by the Ethics Review Committee at Umm Al-Qura University, Saudi Arabia with a local
approval number (13-745-10). Sample size was estimated by the G-power program for Windows
with an estimated power=0.95, &#x003b1;=0.05, the effect size was 0.20 and it used F tests ANOVA for
four groups and two measurement intervals. The recommended sample size should be a minimum
of 92 patients in all treatment groups (23 patients in each group). The number of recruited
patients was increased (25 in each group) for a possible drop out.</p><p>A total of 100 males older than 50&#x02005;years of age volunteered to participate in the study.
Careful history was taken from each patient before participating in this study. All the
patients were diagnosed with osteopenia or osteoporosis (T-scores &#x02264;&#x02212;1.5) measured by
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) were included in this study. After baseline
examination, a full explanation was given to all patients about study aims, while a consent
form was assigned from every patient providing agreement for participation and publication
of the results.</p><p>Patients were excluded from the study if they had cardiac, liver, respiratory or any
advanced musculoskeletal problems (advanced osteoarthritis, bilateral hip replacement or
ankylosing spondylitis). Patients were also excluded if they were alcoholic, under steroid
therapy or any form of drug treatment with possible effect on bone metabolism. Furthermore,
patients with a body mass index below 18.5 and above 30&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were excluded from
the study.</p><p>Randomization was performed by a random number generator. Both the external evaluator and
the therapists were blinded from the randomisation process. The Group I received HILT and
exercises (HILT+EX), group II received placebo laser and exercises (PL+EX), group III were
treated by HILT alone (HILT) and group IV received placebo laser (PL) and served as the
active control group.</p><p>Pain intensity was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) at pre and post-treatment.
Patients were asked to report the level of pain in their low back area over the past few
days, using 10-cm VAS. Patients choose the severity of pain by placing a mark on a line,
with 0 (no pain) and 10 (the worst imaginable pain) marking the ends of the VAS line<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Health related quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated for all patients by a
self-administered ECOS-16 questionnaire. ECOS-16 is proved to have good psychometric
properties and considered as a useful tool to evaluate HRQoL to elderly with osteoporosis in
research as well as in clinical practice<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. ECOS-16 questionnaire includes four dimensions dealing with
physical function, pain, fear of illness and psychosocial function. The score for each item
ranges from 1 (best HRQoL) to 5 (worst HRQoL).</p><p>Fall risk measurement was done by a Biodex balance system (Biodex, New York, USA). Fall
risk test protocol is an available test measuring the balance of the subjects over 50 who
have different abilities of balance and allows identification of potential fall<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The patients stand on the platform and
concentrate to fix the center of gravity within the center of the base of support while the
platform was moving. The platform stability ranges from 1&#x02013;12, with 1 representing the
greatest instability. The lower the resistance level, the less stable the platform. Test
duration was 20 seconds; the level was eight, bilateral stance type with eyes open. The
patient performed three trial repetitions with 30 seconds rest period between sets. The
result was compared to the result of age matched healthy individual.</p><p>The HILT was produced by HIRO 3 device (ASA, Vicenza, Italy). The HILT machine provides the
following: a pulsed Nd, a YAG laser with peak powers 3 KW, average power 10.5&#x02005;W, a
wavelength of 1,064&#x02005;nm, fluency levels (510&#x02013;1,780&#x02005;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>), a brief duration
(120&#x02013;150 &#x000b5;s), low frequency (10&#x02013;30&#x02005;Hz), a 0.1% duty cycle, a probe diameter of 0.5&#x02005;cm and a
spot size of 0.2&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>. HILT was calibrated for constant output throughout the
study by the manufacturer.</p><p>All the patients received 3 sessions per week for 12 weeks. The therapist scanned
longitudinally and transversely the lower back, anterolateral, lateral and posterolateral
surfaces of the proximal thigh with 3,000 Joules delivered in the two phases of treatment.
The average treated area was about 200&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> with an average fluency of
15&#x02005;J/cm<sup>2</sup>. In the initial phase fast manual scanning was applied with gradual
increased the level of fluency to 510, 610 and 710&#x02005;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> in three successive
sub-phases and 500 joules in each sub-phase with a total 1,500 Joules. The final phase was
the same as the initial phase, except that the scanning was slow. The same parameters were
applied to the proximal thigh. The average area for the upper thigh was 300&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>
with an average fluency of 10&#x02005;J/cm<sup>2</sup> and the application time for each area was
approximately 18 minutes.</p><p>For placebo laser treatment, the patients in the group IV received PL only with a regular
walking at home and considering an active control group. The placebo laser was just a light
of the laser equipment without laser radiation. For the PL+EX group, the patients received
PL before applying the exercises. For HILT+EX group, patients received HILT and then
preformed the exercise-training program.</p><p>The exercise-training program included aerobic exercises, weight-bearing, flexibility,
strengthening and balance exercises. The program of exercises was performed three times per
week for three months. 20 minutes walking on the treadmill in a relative speed adjusted
according to the patient&#x02019;s tolerance with warm up phase for 5 minutes, 10 minutes of
stimulus phase with intensity 40% to 60% of the maximal heart rate and 5 minutes as cool
down phase. Strengthening exercises for abdominal, back, hip muscles and back stretching
exercises was performed. These exercises were repeated for three sets of 10 repetitions in
each set. Hip strengthening exercises were applied in a weight bearing position in front of
the wall bar and in non-weight earing positions using a Thera-band and sand bag with
variable weights, according to patient tolerance in three sets of each exercise with 10
repetition maximum (3 &#x000d7; 10 RM). Closed kinematic chain exercises in the form of leg press
exercise was applied using a Total Gym device. Static and dynamic balance training included
stance activities, transitional activities and gait Activities following a schedule of
training for 12 weeks. Patients in the HILT+EX and PL+EX groups were instructed to do the
same program of exercises at home once daily. Patients in all the treatment groups were
advised to do half an hour of daily walking. A booklet for exercise description was given to
them and a report of exercise compliance was obtained. Any three successive absences from
the exercise sessions would lead to the exclusion of patients from the study.</p><p>Patient demographic data as age, weight, height and BMI were analysed by one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS program for Windows, version 16. Comparison between groups
were carried out by ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni test. Comparison between the baselines
and after 12 weeks of treatments each group was performed by either t test or Wilcoxon sign
ranked test. The level of significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05 for all tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total number of 100 male patients participated in this study. The patients were randomly

histological risk. The high power (3KW) of HILT with a 1,064&#x02005;nm wavelength is able to
penetrate the deeper layer (up to 5&#x02005;cm) leading to a diffusion of laser energy more than the
LLLT (1&#x02013;3 cm). The low frequency (30&#x02005;Hz), high power emissions with very short pulse
duration of HILT is postulated to have a more penetrating effect<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, exercises were effective in decreasing pain and fall risk after 12 weeks of
treatment. The results of exercises of the present study were consistent with the results of
some of the previous clinical trials<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balancing exercises improve the static
balance and dynamic balance<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> as well as reduced concerns about falling and improved
gait in older adults with osteoporosis<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Moreover, balance-training program improved the fall-related self-efficacy, gait speed,
balance score and physical function in older adults with osteoporosis<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, exercises applied alone or with HILT were effective in Improving
HRQoL after 12 weeks of treatment.

fracture risk<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, resistance
exercises reduce pain and improve fitness level, psychological status and cognitive
function<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study shows a more significant effect of HILT when combined with exercises more
than the effects of exercises or HILT when applied alone. One explanation of the increased
efficacy is that HILT decreased the pain induced by exercises and it relieved the secondary
problems as the back pain and muscle spasm that accompanied with exercises. Moreover, HILT
may be responsible for increasing the muscle efficiency during exercise and the recovery of
muscle from fatigue induced by exercises<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>HILT is an effective physical therapy modality for male patients with osteopenia or
osteoporosis. Combined with exercise, HILT is more effective than PL+EX or HILT alone in
decreasing pain, fall risk an increasing HEQoL after 12 weeks of treatment. Further studies
discussing the effect of HILT with exercise to back and hip muscle strength may be
considered for the future. The effects of such combinations should be investigated in other
areas, such as in the cervical or forearm regions, or to be applied to females with
osteoporosis.</p><p>All the patients were instructed to do a home exercise program with half an hour of daily
walking, while exercise compliance was obtained from all of them. Although patients did not
report any shortage in home-prescribed exercise, we considered this a limiting factor in the
present study.</p><p>Patients in all treatment groups performed a regular walking at home. Although no patient
reported any shortage in the regular walking, it was considered as a limiting factor in this
study.</p><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This project was funded by the National Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation
