We aimed to test the applicability of the early virus response kinetics and the very rapid virologic response (vRVR) rate as quick outcome measures for accelerated comparative efficacy studies and as a foundation for a personalized response-guided therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Fifty eligible chronic HCV patients were randomized to either one of two generic sofosbuvir products (Gratisovir or Grateziano) at a daily dose of one 400 mg tablet plus a weight-based ribavirin dose. Data were compared between the groups for early virus response kinetics and vRVR rates in relation to the rates of final sustained virologic response at week 12 posttreatment (SVR12).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Log<sub>10</sub> transformed virus load (Log polymerase chain reaction) curves showed fairly similar rapid decline during the first 2 weeks, with no significant difference between the groups at four analysis points throughout the study by repeated-measures factorial analysis of variance test (<italic>P</italic>=0.48). The SVR12 rates were 96% (95% confidence interval, 79.6%&#x02013;99.9%) in Gratisovir group (24/25) and 95.7% (95% confidence interval, 78%&#x02013;99.9%) in Grateziano group (22/23). There was no statistically significant difference found by exact test (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.999). There was a significant association between the vRVR and the SVR12, with 100% positive predictive value (38/38 of those who had vRVR, achieved a final SVR12) and 82.6% sensitivity (among the total 46 with SVR12, 38 were having vRVR).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We can conclude from our study that the early HCV response kinetics and the vRVR rates could be used as sensitive quick markers for efficacy (with a very high positive predictive value for SVR12), based on our accelerated comparative efficacy research model. This might open the way for new models of accelerated equivalence efficacy studies along with the bioequivalence kinetics studies to test a generic drug against a reference. Also, the early response kinetics and the vRVR might be used as qualifiers for a personalized course of treatment. This could shorten unnecessarily long treatment courses in rapid responders and might help to avoid relapses in slow responders.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Video abstract</title><p>

This has created a need for new accelerated research methods and faster response predictive models to cope with the speed of new developments.</p><p>Frequently information becomes outdated by the time research is completed and the manuscript is published.</p><p>It had been observed during interferon-based therapy that early on-treatment virus kinetics was a good predictor of treatment failure. Those who did not achieve an early virologic response (undetectable serum HCV RNA level or &#x02265;logs reduction of virus load after 12 weeks) were at high risk of treatment failure, and this provided the basis for the treatment stopping rule at week 12.<xref rid="b4-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Now, with the faster and &#x0003e;90% SVR rates achieved with the DAA protocols, the early viral kinetics (ie, time to viral negativity) have become better predictors for treatment success rather than failure. The very rapid virologic response (vRVR; undetectable serum HCV RNA level at week 2) was found to be highly correlated with the final SVR achieved with dual sofosbuvir/ribavirin protocol, with very high positive but low negative predictive values.<xref rid="b7-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>It was also observed by many studies that combinations of highly efficacious DAA drugs that had consistently given &#x0003e;90% SVR12 rates in clinical studies for 12 or 24 weeks failed to have similarly high rates when given for shorter durations.<xref rid="b8-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Given these two important observations, we hypothesized that the duration of virus suppression or the time spent on-treatment with undetectable HCV RNA in the serum (or more perfectly with target-not-detected) is a more important determinant factor for cure than the antiviral activity of the molecule itself and there should be sufficient time spent on-treatment after viral negativity in serum for complete eradication of the virus from liver cells and other potential reservoirs such as the platelets and peripheral mononuclear cells.</p><p>Thus, the speed of virologic response (rapidity of virus load reduction) could be regarded as an important efficacy marker, as it combines both the molecular activity of the drug and the time factor.</p><p>As we have mentioned in our previously published interim report for this study,<xref rid="b10-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> we used two suggested outcome measures as indicators for the speed of response: the vRVR, which was defined as the undetectable HCV RNA level at the end of week 2 of therapy.<xref rid="b11-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> And the ultrarapid virologic response (uRVR), which we defined as an undetectable serum HCV RNA or a 4 log<sub>10</sub> or greater drop in HCV RNA at the end of 1 week of therapy.</p><p>In this final report of the same study protocol,<xref rid="b10-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> we further evaluated the validity of the speed of virus load reduction during the first 2 weeks of therapy and the vRVR rate as a quick time-saving endpoint for fast-track comparison of the efficacy of the two treatment options. Also, we tested whether the vRVR within 2 weeks could be used as a justification to personalize or shorten the recommended 24-week course of dual sofosbuvir plus ribavirin,<xref rid="b12-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> to only 16 weeks, given our aforementioned suggestion regarding the appropriate time needed for full virus eradication from the whole body cells, which we assumed from our personal unpublished experience and the work of Dahari et al that 3 months spent on-treatment with undetectable serum HCV RNA could be sufficient.<xref rid="b13-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives of our study were: 1) to study a new suggested model for a fast-track comparative-effectiveness research where both the speed and size of effect of the two treatments on HCV RNA virus load within just 2 weeks of therapy are used to compare the efficacy of the two generic sofosbuvir products Gratisovir (Pharco Corporation, Alexandria, Egypt) and Grateziano (European Egyptian Pharmaceutical Industries, Alexandria, Egypt.) in a dual antiviral treatment protocol, each given with a generic ribavirin product (Hepaverin), in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 4; 2) to compare the mean Log<sub>10</sub> reduction of virus load at weeks 1 and 2 after starting treatment, as well as the proportion of patients achieving uRVR and vRVR in both groups as a suggested fast-track model to compare efficacy in the interim analysis report; 3) to further compare the effect of both drugs (between-factor) on the virus load (within-factor) as repeatedly measured at 4 points (before treatment, week 2, end of treatment and 12 weeks after end of treatment) in this final report to check our fast-track model; 4) to compare the truncated 4 months versus the recommended 6-month duration of therapy in those who achieved vRVR; and 5) to evaluate the positive and negative predictive accuracy, and the utility of vRVR as a marker for comparative efficacy or for the rationalization of a truncated response-guided therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The study was conducted in an outpatient setting according to a randomized, open-label, comparative efficacy study design.<xref rid="b10-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>A repeated-measures factorial design with one between-factor (drug) and one within-factor (Log virus load by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) had two drug groups with 24 subjects each for a total of 48 subjects.

Detection of HCV RNA was by PCR quantitative measurements by COBAS Amplicor 2.0 (Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland), lower limit of detection of 10 IU/mL. Screening test for hepatitis B surface antigen, autoimmune hepatitis, anti-HIV, schistosoma Ag, liver and kidney functions tests, urine and stools analyses, complete blood count, blood glucose, pregnancy test. Upper abdominal and liver ultrasonography was also done at the clinics.</p><p>Patients fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria were included and randomly divided into two treatment groups using software-generated balanced 1:1 block randomization technique.</p><p>Group 1 started treatment with one Gratisovir 400 mg (Pharco) tablet daily after the main meal plus weight-based dosing of Hepaverin capsules (ribavirin), 1,200 mg if body weight was &#x02265;75 kg or 1,000 mg if body weight was &#x0003c;75 kg, twice daily orally; for a duration of 6 or 4 months according to further randomization for those achieving vRVR.</p><p>Group 2 started treatment with one Grateziano 400 mg (EEPI) tablet daily after the main meal plus weight-based dosing of Hepaverin capsules (ribavirin), 1,200 mg if body weight was &#x02265;75 kg or 1,000 mg if body weight was &#x0003c;75 kg, twice daily orally; for a duration of 6 or 4 months according to further randomization for those achieving vRVR.</p><p>At the end of week 2 of therapy, the patients were further divided into those who had vRVR (undetectable HCV RNA level at week 2) were randomized with a 1:1.5 block randomization technique into either 16- or 24-week course duration of therapy, respectively; and all those who did not achieve the vRVR completed the 24-week duration.</p><p>All included patients were handed their assigned treatment kit and were asked to revisit the clinic every week for follow-up and collection of clinical and laboratory efficacy and safety data. Blood samples were taken weekly for HCV RNA quantitative PCR test, complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, serum bilirubin, and creatinine as routine tests. Other nonroutine lab or imaging tests were done, according to each patient&#x02019;s condition, whenever deemed necessary.</p><p>Asking patients about the occurrence of any adverse event and counting the remaining tablets and capsules during each visit as a measure of compliance were also performed weekly. All patients were equally subjected to full psychological support, assurance, and motivation for raising their spirit and optimism during treatment as routinely done in our practice in management of patients with chronic illness.</p><p>All patients who had been randomized to the shorter 16-week course were subjected just before the end of the course to a PCR test for HCV RNA in peripheral mononuclear cells in addition to the routine PCR test in the serum done for every patient at the end of treatment. To be eligible to end treatment in the short-course group, we required the result of serum virus load to be target-not-detected in addition to negative result in peripheral mononuclear cells. This was done in order to assure that there was no known potential reservoir for clinical relapse in peripheral cells before the end of the shorter course.</p></sec><sec><title>End points</title><p>The following end points were evaluated and already reported in our previously published interim report:<xref rid="b10-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> 1) the mean reduction of Log<sub>10</sub> virus load in both groups after 1 and 2 weeks of starting therapy and reported in our previous interim report, 2) incidence of uRVR following 1 week of treatment, and 3) incidence of vRVR following 2 weeks of treatment.</p><p>The following end points were evaluated and reported here in our final report: 1) incidence of end of treatment response at the end of 24 versus 16-week course of treatment in those patients randomized 1.5:1 after achieving vRVR.

Also, all of those who did not finally achieve SVR12 were those who had not had a vRVR (100% [95% CI, 15.8%&#x02013;100%], specificity). The negative predictive value for negative vRVR to predict No SVR12 was low as expected (20% [95% CI, 2.5%&#x02013;55.61%], negative predictive value). Out of the 46 patients who finally achieved SVR12 at the end of the study, 38 were having vRVR at week 2 (82.61% [95% CI, 68.58%&#x02013;92.18%], sensitivity). This association was found to be statistically significant by the exact test (<italic>P</italic>=0.04).</p><p>Given that there was no difference between the two treatment arms, neither early on (vRVR) nor late (SVR12), we pooled the data of the two arms to calculate the overall ITT SVR12 rate, which was 92% (95% CI, 80.77%&#x02013;97.78%) and the PP rate, which was 95.8% (95% CI, 85.7%&#x02013;99.48%).</p><p>All our patients who had been randomized to either 16-or 24-week duration after having a vRVR achieved SVR12. Both groups had 100% SVR12 rates (95% CI 78.2%&#x02013;100% for 16 weeks and 85.2%&#x02013;100% for 24 weeks). Thus, the group treated with the shorter 16-week course in our study appeared to have a trend toward higher SVR12 rate than other reported rates for the tested 12-week course of treatment by the dual combination of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin in genotype 4.<xref rid="b9-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b14-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Doss et al had reported 77% SVR12 rate with 12 weeks and 90% rate with 24 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin therapy,<xref rid="b9-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> while Ruane et al reported 93% (95% CI, 77%&#x02013;99%) SVR12 rate in the 24-week group and 68% (95% CI, 49%&#x02013;83%) in the 12-week group.<xref rid="b14-dddt-10-2659" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>We suggest that the reason for this trend to higher SVR12 rate in our truncated 16-week course is that all patients assigned to the shorter 16 weeks were from those who had already responded very early and remained on-treatment for &#x0003e;12 weeks while they had no detected HCV RNA target in their sera. Also, the setting and the design of this study allowed for a very intimate and close patient&#x02013;physician relationship. So, in addition to the reasonably manageable number of patients per senior treating doctor, the frequent weekly visits and close monitoring of any adverse reaction and appropriate prompt management before it is aggravated or affected patient compliance could have had an impact on patients&#x02019; strict compliance and hope for cure. In addition to that, we speculate that the weekly supportive psychological measures that every patient was subjected to, as well as the eye-witnessing of the reports of viral negativity as early as only 2 weeks, could have had an impact on patient motivation, optimism, and hope for cure that may have had a positive impact on his or her immune functions.</p><p>We noted that both cases who relapsed were sharing in common two baseline characteristics associated with their schistosomal hepatic fibrosis: fairly large-sized spleen &#x0003e;18 cm and low baseline hemoglobin and platelet count indicating hypersplenism. This observation, in our opinion, is very important for further study in a country like Egypt, where concomitant schistosomal hepatic fibrosis is highly prevalent in chronic HCV cases, especially in the elderly group.</p><p>We postulate that the large hyperactive fibrocongestive splenomegaly might harbor a big intracellular reservoir for the virus that needs a longer time to be completely eradicated after serum negativity. We acknowledge the limitations of our small sample size, due to our limited resource setting in the face of significantly costly repeated laboratory tests and other expenses. It was difficult to apply the multivariate logistic regression analysis, as we planned, as a secondary end point because it needed a rather large sample size to give statistically significant odds ratios because of the low treatment failure rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We can conclude from our study that the early HCV response kinetics to the dual sofosbuvir and ribavirin therapy and the vRVR rates might be used as sensitive quick markers or end points for efficacy in accelerated comparative efficacy research with a high positive predictive value for SVR12. This might open the way for new models of accelerated equivalent efficacy studies, in addition to the already done pharmacokinetic bioequivalence to test a generic drug against a reference. Also, the early response kinetics might be used as a qualifier for a personalized course of treatment. This could shorten unnecessarily long treatment courses in rapid responders and might help to avoid relapses in slow responders especially for the costly sofosbuvir-based antiviral therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Abbass Helmy Charity Establishment and Egyptian Cure Bank for their kind help and support to the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>Sherine Helmy is working for Pharco Corporation.
