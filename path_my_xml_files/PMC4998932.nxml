Consequently, a proportion of people treated with antipsychotics develop galactorrhoea, amenorrhoea, gynaecomastia, erectile dysfunction, anorgasmia and osteoporosis in the long term.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Hyperprolactinaemia and its consequences are therefore common reasons for non-adherence and treatment discontinuation.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Although older first-generation antipsychotics (typical) were initially thought to be the culprits, second-generation antipsychotics (atypical) have also been implicated. Leucht <italic>et al</italic> in a meta-analysis comparing the tolerability of 15 antipsychotics found that most second-generation antipsychotics increased serum prolactin levels significantly.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Given that most clinicians chose an antipsychotic based on efficacy, risperidone is one of the most preferred second-generation antipsychotics.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, hyperprolactinaemia is evidenced in three-quarters of patients receiving risperidone, both the oral and long-acting intramuscular preparations.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Around 45% of those with hyperprolactinaemia develop symptoms pertaining to hyperprolactinaemia.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> To manage these side-effects, clinicians either switch to a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic medication or use dopamine agonists such as amantadine or bromocriptine.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> These strategies are not always successful and have been associated with a risk of relapse in psychotic symptoms. Among the newer antipsychotics, aripiprazole has been found to lower serum prolactin levels &#x02013; albeit non-significantly.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Aripiprazole is a high-affinity, low intrinsic activity, functionally selective partial D<sub>2</sub> agonist.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Natesan <italic>et al</italic> found that D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy of aripiprazole at clinically effective doses are typically more than 90% (compared with 65% for most other antipsychotics). They found that in animal models haloperidol and risperidone administration (with &#x0003e;80% occupancy) was associated with catalepsy and hyperprolactinaemia, whereas aripiprazole administration was not associated with these signs. They proposed that this dissociation between occupancy and functional antagonism was because of the partial agonism of aripiprazole.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> More recent research suggest that aripiprazole&#x02019;s functional effects depend on the cellular location and signalling proteins of the targeted D<sub>2</sub> receptor.<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This functional selectivity seems to be associated with lack of hyperprolactinaemia and indeed normalisation/reduction of prolactin levels in certain situations.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>To date, three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have explored the use of aripiprazole in treating antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinaemia.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The first study examined aripiprazole augmentation in haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinaemia; the second in risperidone-induced hyperprolactinaemia in males; and a third study exploring aripiprazole augmentation of risperidone/quetiapine reported reduction in prolactin levels as a secondary outcome measure. A recent meta-analysis found that these studies lacked details of random sequence generation, allocation concealment and masking.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In addition, two of them did not report on prolactin-related symptom recovery.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>We therefore conducted an 8-week double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of 10&#x02009;mg of adjunctive aripiprazole in patients with schizophrenia maintained on a stable dose of risperidone (median dose 6&#x02009;mg).

In summary, prolactin levels decreased by 58% in the aripiprazole group compared with an increase by 22% in the placebo group. Prolactin levels had normalised in 46% of the participants in the aripiprazole group compared with none in the placebo group. The NNT was 2.1, i.e. about two patients with hyperprolactinaemia would have to be treated with aripiprazole for one additional patient&#x02019;s hyperprolactinaemia to normalise. More importantly, we showed that this reduction in prolactin level was associated with an improvement in erectile dysfunction in five out of six patients. In contrast, one additional patient developed erectile dysfunction in the placebo group at follow-up.</p><p>Why does aripiprazole have a prolactin neutralising effect? Drugs such as clozapine and quetiapine are thought to have a favourable effect on prolactin levels because of their fast dissociation from D<sub>2</sub> receptors.<sup><xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Interestingly, aripiprazole in spite of having high affinity and slow dissociation from D<sub>2</sub> receptors, shows prolactin&#x02010;sparing properties. Although aripiprazole was classically described as a partial agonist, it is now known that its intrinsic action depends on the signalling environment of the D<sub>2</sub> receptors, indicative of functional selectivity.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In other words, the mechanism of action of aripiprazole (whether it acts as an agonist/partial agonist/antagonist) depends on the location and the second messenger system associated with the D<sub>2</sub> receptor to which it binds.<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Therefore, aripiprazole seems to be an antagonist at the mesocorticolimbic D<sub>2</sub> receptors, whereas the lack of cataleptogenic effects suggests partial agonist activity at the striatal D<sub>2</sub> receptors.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Similarly, the ability of aripiprazole to suppress serum prolactin in humans is likely to be mediated by partial agonism at the anterior pituitary D<sub>2</sub> receptors.<sup><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In addition to these mechanisms, aripiprazole is an agonist at 5HT1 and antagonist at 5HT2A receptors, which may contribute to its prolactin neutral effect.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Our findings are in keeping with previous reports of aripiprazole-induced reduction in prolactin levels.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Shim <italic>et al</italic> explored the use of high dose (15&#x02009;mg for the first 4 weeks and 30&#x02009;mg following that) aripiprazole in haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinaemia in an 8-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> They found that prolactin levels normalised in 88.5% of individuals with an 84.2% reduction in prolactin level. This was well above the normalisation rate/reduction seen in our study. Although this could be attributed to the lower dose of aripiprazole used in our study, a second study by Chen <italic>et al</italic> that used just 5&#x02009;mg of aripiprazole in males prescribed risperidone also found greater prolactin normalisation (67.6%) compared with our study.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Interestingly, a third study by Kane <italic>et al</italic> (10&#x02009;mg aripiprazole for augmentation) that reported changes in prolactin levels as a secondary outcome measure in patients treated with risperidone or quetiapine found lower prolactin normalisation rate (19.5%) compared with our study.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Taken together, these findings suggest that the dose differences in aripiprazole may not explain the difference in normalisation rates. However, there is some evidence to suggest that the prolactin normalising effect of aripiprazole may be dose-dependent.<sup><xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p>Our results suggest that reduction in prolactin was independent of baseline levels and gender, making aripiprazole a feasible option in the treatment of hyperprolactinaemia in both men and women. Although previous trials examined prolactin levels, only Shim <italic>et al</italic> reported the effect of aripiprazole on sexual side-effects.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> This was in the context of treatment with haloperidol, and they did not comment on sexual dysfunction in males. In our study, most of the men had an improvement in erectile dysfunction symptoms. This is consistent with previous studies that found aripiprazole to be associated with lower sexual symptoms compared with other antipsychotics. In women, unlike Shim <italic>et al</italic>, we found that menstrual symptoms persisted in most of our patients.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> This perhaps is because although there was a significant reduction, the prolactin levels remained well above the normal range (mean 1097 IU) in women. Once again, this could be attributed to the lower dose of aripiprazole in our study compared with Shim <italic>et a</italic>
<italic>l</italic>.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> It is also possible that continued treatment may have led to greater normalisation of hyperprolactinaemia and reversal of these symptoms over time. Although menstrual symptoms showed no change, galactorrhoea improved in the aripiprazole group. As seen in previous studies, none of the men complained of galactorrhoea. Galactorrhoea is a rare symptom of hyperprolactinaemia in males.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Our findings are similar to that of Hanssens <italic>et al</italic> who found that more men reported improvement in sexual side-effects on treatment with aripiprazole compared with women.<sup><xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> This may also explain why Chen <italic>et al</italic> reported greater normalisation rates at a smaller dose of aripiprazole, as theirs was an exclusively male sample.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> It is possible that different doses are required to treat hyperprolactinaemia in men and women. Longer follow-up periods (than two menstrual cycles in our case) may be required to ascertain improvement in menstrual symptoms.</p><p>In general, aripiprazole was well tolerated. Akathisia is a common side-effect with aripiprazole. However, we did not find any emergent akathisia in our sample. Extrapyramidal side-effects did not differ between the groups at either baseline or follow-up. Psychotic symptoms worsened in two patients in the aripiprazole group. This is in keeping with previous reports of worsening psychotic symptoms in people treated with adjunctive or those being switched to aripiprazole.<sup><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Previous studies have implicated high-dose antipsychotic therapy (chlorpromazine equivalent dose &#x0003e;700&#x02009;mg/day) and discontinuation of previous antipsychotics as risk factors for emergent/worsening psychosis with aripiprazole.<sup><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> In our study, the median dose of risperidone was 6&#x02009;mg/day (chlorpromazine equivalent of around 400&#x02009;mg/day), far less than that implicated by Takeuchi <italic>et a</italic>
<italic>l</italic>.<sup><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> As this was an adjunctive-treatment study, all our patients continued to receive risperidone throughout the study. Moreover, these symptoms were controlled by administering benzodiazepines. Although agonism pertaining to distinct conformations of upregulated D<sub>2</sub> receptors has been implicated, the exact mechanism underlying emergent/worsening psychotic symptoms during aripiprazole augmentation remains unclear.<sup><xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p><p>Our study had several limitations. Although we ensured that our sample size was based on power calculation, our trial was underpowered to conduct subgroup analysis. Even though we showed that our analysis was robust to differences in baseline prolactin levels and baseline gender differences in prolactin levels, further analysis to explore the differential effect of aripiprazole on men and women require large sample sizes. We examined a fixed dose of aripiprazole. Although meta-analysis of trials shows that the dose of aripiprazole does not seem to have an effect on the hypoprolactinaemic effect, a randomised, placebo-controlled trial with multiple doses will directly address this question.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> We explored the effect of aripiprazole on risperidone-induced hyperprolactinaemia. Although risperidone is one of the most commonly used medications, others such as sulpride and amisulpride are also associated with hyperprolactinaemia.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> There are some data to suggest that aripiprazole may be more effective in risperidone-induced hyperprolactinaemia compared with amisulpride-induced hyperprolactinaemia.<sup><xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Although the reasons for this specificity remain speculative, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are essential in confirming whether aripiprazole is effective in treating amisulpride-induced hyperprolactinaemia. In addition, measurement of plasma levels of both aripiprazole and risperidone may have given us a better understanding of the mechanism underlying this effect. We also did not rule out prolactin-secreting tumours in our sample. Extremely high prolactin levels merit further investigation and treatment. Detailed guidelines of how to deal with this is provided elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Although we showed significant reductions in sexual side-effects in men, longer follow-up studies are needed to see whether these effects are sustained and whether menstrual symptoms improve in females.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that adjunctive aripiprazole treatment is a safe, practical and effective treatment option for patients with risperidone-induced high prolactin levels. It is relatively well tolerated. Long-term studies are warranted to ensure long-term safety of this treatment.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s4"><title>Funding</title><p>The authors acknowledge financial support from Indian Medical Council of Research (ICMR), India.
