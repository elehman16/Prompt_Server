A local anesthetic injection allows painless treatment in the oral cavity; however, it provokes anxiety and fear in the patients, which is one of the main reasons for dental anxiety [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Each dentist in Canada injects approximately 1,800 cartridges of local anesthetics yearly [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Successfully administered local anesthesia allows the dentist to build a relationship with the patient, proceed with the appointment, and successfully complete the therapeutic procedure [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. An inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) is the most popular technique used to block pain stimulus from the mandibular molars [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Articaine (Carticaine) is one of the most recently developed local anesthetic drug available to dentists worldwide [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Articaine hydrochloride was developed by Rusching et al. in 1969 [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and approved for use in the United States in April 2000 [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Articaine accounted for about 25% of the total dental anesthetic sales in the United States in 2007 [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Considering the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, the duration of soft tissue anesthesia in a nerve block with 1.8 ml of 4% articaine was 4.3&#x02013;5.3 h [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The plasma half-life of articaine is short, approximately 20 min. The maximum dose of 4% articaine as a local anesthetic solution in a healthy adult weighing 70 kg is 7 carpules (1.7 ml) [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Vasoconstrictors are beneficial in dentistry when used with local anesthetics. There are clear indications for their use, among which improving the depth and duration of anesthesia are most important. Without them, many local anesthetic solutions would have a short duration of intraoral action [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Adding a vasopressor also has other benefits such as retarding the absorption of articaine leading to prolonged maintenance of its active tissue concentration, minimizing the systemic absorption of both the active compounds (articaine and epinephrine) [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], reducing systemic toxic effects, and providing hemostasis [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The most common vasoconstrictor is epinephrine, which is available in formulations of 1:50,000, 1:100,000, and 1:200,000. However, its cardiovascular effects should be considered before its use [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Epinephrine can be used for most dental procedures; however, it may be necessary to minimize the dose for patients receiving specific medications and for those with cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Epinephrine causes vasoconstriction by stimulation of &#x003b1;1 receptors in the mucous membranes. However, it also stimulates the &#x003b2;1 receptor in the heart, increasing the heart rate and the oxygen consumption and strength of contraction of the myocardium, and the &#x003b2;2 receptors, which causes vasodilation in the skeletal muscle [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Many studies regarding the hemodynamic effects of dental anesthesia using epinephrine-containing local anesthetic solutions in young healthy patients have been conducted. The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, clinical study was to compare the effects of 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine (A100) and 4% articaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine (A200) on the vital signs and onset and duration of anesthesia in an IANB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty adult patients (10 men and 10 women), with a mean age of 38.3 &#x000b1; 11.3 years (range, 18&#x02013;50 years), participated in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, clinical study. These patients had been admitted to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Dental Branch, Azad University, Tehran, Iran between 2014 and 2015 for the extraction of both the first mandibular molars. The study was approved by the Committee of the Ethics of Research on Human Beings of the Craniomaxillofacial Research Center, Azad Islamic University, Tehran, Iran. It was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from each patient. The exclusion criteria were as follows: systemic conditions in which injection of articaine with epinephrine is contraindicated [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], pregnancy, use of medications (over-the-counter pain-relieving medications, narcotics, sedatives, antianxiety, or antidepressants) that could affect anesthetic assessment, history of psychiatric illness, allergy to the components of the local anesthetic solutions, and local anesthesia in same region &#x0003c; 2 weeks before the experiment.</p><p>The procedures were performed during 2 separate appointments. In the first session, the side of the mouth for administering the IANB (right or left) and the type of anesthetic solution (A100 and A200) (Primacaine, Pierre Rolland, Bordeaux, France) were chosen randomly. This information was recorded. The surgeon and patient were blinded about the type of anesthetic solution administered. The injection was administered using an aspirating syringe (Aspirating Syringes, KAS A; Shanghai Kangqiao Dental Instruments Factory, Shanghai, China) with a long needle (27Gauge: 30 mm; Pierre Rolland, France). The timings of the onset (tingling or numbness of the lower lip indicated anesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve) [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the end of anesthesia were recorded using a stop watch, and the duration of anesthesia was calculated. The SBP and DBP were measured by means of an automatic digital manometer, Visomat (Zum Ottersberg, Wertheim, Germany), before the injection and 5 min later. In the second session, 7 days later, the protocol was repeated and the other anesthetic solution was injected in the other side, which had not received the injection in the previous session. Data were analyzed using the T-test and Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test. P-value was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In a crossover design, 20 subjects received 2 sets of IANB during 2 separate appointments spaced 1 week apart.

Articaine with epinephrine is one of the most commonly used anesthetic worldwide [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; however, epinephrine containing anesthetics may cause unwanted effects on the blood pressure, pulse rate, and hemodynamic condition of the patient; these effects were evaluated in this study. This study had a crossover design, which was advantageous because each patient acted as his own control. Thus, the individual characteristics of each patient did not influence the results of the study.</p><p>Hersh et al. compared the pharmacokinetic and cardiovascular effects of 11.9 ml A100 with the effects of 11.9 ml A200. They found that the short-term cardiovascular effects (increase in heart rate and SBP) were significant with A100 than with A200 [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These results demonstrated the effects of a larger volume of the local anesthetic.</p><p>Troullos et al. also reported a greater increase in the heart rate with larger volumes of epinephrine containing anesthetic formulations (8 cartridges of A100) [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, it can be concluded that increasing the amount of epinephrine in a nerve block injection increases the differences in the effects of A100 and A200. Hence, the likelihood of an increase in the heart rate or blood pressure (hemodynamic changes) with articaine containing epinephrine is dose-dependent. Regarding vasoconstriction with epinephrine, in low dosages, its absorption in the blood is slow but its hydrolysis is fast; therefore, the hemodynamic changes caused by it are not significant in these dosages that are used in routine dental procedures [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Few studies have reported that the blood pressure is usually stable after administration of anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine during nerve blocks or infiltrations [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our current study supports the results of previous human studies. Knoll-K&#x000f6;hler reported no differences in the effects of A100 and A200 (containing 4 ml [160 mg] of 4% articaine hydrochloride) on the heart rate or blood pressure of patients undergoing extraction of an impacted lower third molar [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Tofoli et al. [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Santos et al. [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found that the efficacy of A100 was equivalent to that of A200 in inferior alveolar nerve blocks. Moore et al. found no differences in the cardiovascular effects of A100 and A200 on using 1 cartridge volume for IANB [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It can be concluded that there were no significant hemodynamic changes on administration of 1 cartridge of the local anesthetic for IANB with negative aspiration in healthy patients.</p><p>In our study, the time taken for the onset of anesthesia was 1.4 and 2 min with A100 and A200, respectively. In previous studies, the time taken for onset was approximately 2&#x02013;2.5 min with A100 and 2.5&#x02013;3 min with A200 [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The duration of soft tissue anesthesia in a nerve block with 1.8 ml of 4% articaine was reported to be 4.3&#x02013;5.3 h [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These results of the onset and duration of anesthesia are similar to the results of our study.</p><p>In conclusion, there was no significant difference in the onset and duration of anesthesia between 1 cartridge volume of A100 and A200. Therefore, in operations requiring a larger amount of anesthetic solutions, A200 should be preferred in healthy patients; however, it may be necessary to minimize the dose for patients receiving specific medications and for those with cardiovascular disease. Thus, A200 might be preferable in patients with cardiovascular disease and in those taking drugs that enhance the systemic effects of epinephrine.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
