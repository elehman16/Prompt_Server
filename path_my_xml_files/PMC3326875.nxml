These indirect effects of biologically inert substances or inactive procedures will be considered under the umbrella term placebo effects.</p><p>Placebo effects presumably have different mediators depending on the specific learned association and whether referring to acquisition of the association or the placebo response. The central nervous system is the primary location and mediator of the physiological basis of the placebo effects through its role in learning and memory and its outputs on sensory, motor, and autonomic pathways as well as the immune and endocrine systems. People have individual traits that predispose them to be more or less responsive to certain stimuli; the interaction between the learned associations of the clinical situation and the person's particular biology produces a response. The response could be a basic physiological process, such as modulation of sensory processing, release of neurotransmitters or alterations in hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis or immune system activity. The placebo response could also be some more complex physiological process, including change in mood, change in motivation/effort, or cognitive set-shifting.</p><p>Many aspects of placebo effects, including verbal communication, interactions between person and health care provider, health care setting, practitioner characteristics, physical characteristics of a pill, type of treatment, and pill administration frequency. Additionally, anticipation or expectancy can refer to a response expectancy or self-efficacy expectancy, that is, one's sense of being able to achieve an outcome. Desire or motivation for improvement is another aspect of the placebo effect.
