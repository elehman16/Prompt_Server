However, with various methods to counter spasms, such as a block harvesting, the long-term outcome has improved significantly, and the RA is currently being used as the second graft of choice after the LITA in many institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Most literature reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] demonstrate excellent patency rates in protocol-driven studies and in symptomatic patients.

Use of additional SVGs was permitted in both groups depending on angiographic findings. The study protocol was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee, and investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written consent was obtained from all patients prior to the procedure.</p><p>Patients were included in the study if at least one target vessel for RA/SVG grafting had at least 80&#x000a0;% stenosis, was at least 1.5&#x000a0;mm in diameter, and had no diffuse distal disease. Patients were excluded in the case of a single-vessel disease and if they had undergone any concomitant acquired or congenital cardiac or aortic surgery. Hemodialysis was considered a strong contraindication for RA harvesting due to a concern about the need for possible upper limb dialysis access. The exclusion criteria were a positive Allen&#x02019;s test, a history of Raynaud&#x02019;s syndrome or vasculitis. In all cases, before RA harvesting, the adequacy of ulnar compensation was assessed by the Doppler method. The RA was always harvested from the non-dominant arm; bilateral RA harvesting was never performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedures</title><p>All patients underwent conventional angiography before surgery using retrograde femoral artery catheterization under standard fluoroscopy using an iodine contrast agent. Each angiogram was evaluated by two experienced cardiologists and the decisions were made by consensus.

Left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed using Simpson biplane formula.</p><p>All patients were operated at the Dedinje Cardiovascular Institute, Belgrade, Serbia, a tertiary care center. Open harvest of the RA was used in all patients. For the myocardial protection purposes we used 600&#x02013;1000&#x000a0;ml of cold antegrade modified St. Thomas cardioplegic solution to initially arrest the heart. Topical cooling of the heart was used during procedure (ice slash). Cardioplegia was repeated only if cross-clamp time exceeded 90&#x000a0;min. Cold blood cardiopegia was used only in patients with a EF&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;%. Side-biting clamps were used for performing proximal anastomoses in all patients. All RA grafts were deployed to the artery with at least 80&#x000a0;% stenosis, providing that it is considered an important coronary artery (smaller, same territory arteries or arteries supplying heavily infarcted areas were not grafted with radial artery). During or after the procedure no intravenous drugs were given to prevent RA spasm. However, we used topically verapamil and nitroglycerin solution (balanced to pH&#x000a0;7.4). All radial arteries were rinsed after harvesting and kept in this solution before implantation. All of our patients were given oral preparations of the calcium channel blockers during one year after surgery to prevent RA spasm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Patients were followed for 8&#x000a0;years since index surgery for the composite of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction and need for repeat myocardial revascularization (either surgical or percutaneous).

A history of peripheral vascular disease was associated with higher risk of RA occlusion, while grafting to a vessel with proximal occlusion improved RA patency. The same group and others in 2008 showed, via angiographic data at 1&#x02010;year post&#x02010;CABG, that diabetes mellitus was an independent predictor of graft occlusion, although RA grafting was protective in this subgroup versus the SVG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The RAPS study is the first multicenter clinical trial reporting radial graft patency beyond 5&#x000a0;years. In the other and larger multicenter CSP 474 VA trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the radial artery or saphenous vein was allocated to the second-best target as determined by the surgeon; they reported that at 1&#x000a0;year, complete graft occlusion was similar in radial and study SVGs (11&#x000a0;%). a 5-year extension is underway. At 5.5&#x000a0;years, the single-center RSVP (Radial Artery Versus Saphenous Vein Patency) study from London, England, reported that complete graft occlusion was markedly less frequent in radial grafts compared with SVGs directed to the circumflex territory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There was no apparent graft-by-territory interaction in the RAPS study, indicating that the relative benefit of the radial artery compared with the saphenous vein applies to both the right and circumflex territories. Graft patency was improved when the radial artery was directed to a more severely narrowed target vessel. The single-center Australian RAPCO (Radial Artery Patency and Clinical Outcomes) study scheduled angiographic follow-up within 5&#x000a0;years in a minority of patients and between 5 and 10&#x000a0;years post-operatively in the majority; they have published interim results from 5 to 10&#x000a0;years of follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Athanasiou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] included both randomized trials and observational studies in a meta-analysis to compare the patency rates across different follow-up intervals&#x02014;there were 7 studies with a follow-up &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;years. We updated their review with results from the RAPS study and new data complete to April 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Radial grafting was associated with a reduced rate of late graft occlusion compared with saphenous veins (for observational and randomized trials, odds ratio: 0.520, 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval: 0.342 to 0.790, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002; and for randomized trials alone, odds ratio: 0.491, 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval: 0.314 to 0.766, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002.)</p><p>When the type of harvest of the RA is concerned, recent prospective, randomized, open-controlled trial that included 119 patients demonstrated that following 5&#x000a0;years of the initial operation both RA harvesting techniques (open and endoscopic harvest ) are safe, effective and result in excellent patency rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>It is very difficult to develop an algorithm for the use of RA as a second conduit for surgical myocardial revascularization. Since it appears that RA is not superior in terms of clinical outcome to the vein grafts for the revascularization of the right coronary artery, we usually use RA for revascularization of the left side system. The main target for RA graft is reasonably sized (&#x02265;1.5&#x000a0;mm) obtuse marginal artery with at least 80&#x000a0;% stenosis. However, decision about use of RA graft should be tailored individually in order to achieve greatest clinical benefit for the patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The major limitation of the trial is the relatively small number of patients. Additionally, the follow-up duration in our study group was relatively short (8&#x000a0;years), which may lead to the underestimation of net clinical benefit in patients in whom RA graft was used. However, since this was a single-center randomized trial and patients were followed for a considerable time, we believe that a meaningful conclusions may be drawn from our data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this small randomised study our data indicate that there is no difference in the 8&#x000a0;year clinical outcomes in relatively young patients between those having a RA or a saphenous vein graft used as a second conduit, beside LITA, for surgical myocardial revascularisation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>IP has made substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data; have been involved in drafting the manuscript and revising it critically for important intellectual content; have given final approval of the version to be published.
