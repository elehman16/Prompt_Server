Underreporting of medical errors challenges attempts to understand causative factors and impedes efforts to implement preventive strategies. Audit with feedback is a knowledge translation strategy that has potential to modify health professionals&#x02019; medical error reporting behaviour. However, evidence regarding which aspects of this complex, multi-dimensional intervention work best is lacking. The aims of the Safe Medication Audit Reporting Translation (SMART) study are to:</p><p>1. Implement and refine a reporting mechanism to feed audit data on medication errors back to nurses</p><p>2. Test the feedback reporting mechanism to determine its utility and effect</p><p>3. Identify characteristics of organisational context associated with error reporting in response to feedback</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A quasi-experimental design, incorporating two pairs of matched wards at an acute care hospital, is used. Randomisation occurs at the ward level; one ward from each pair is randomised to receive the intervention. A key stakeholder reference group informs the design and delivery of the feedback intervention. Nurses on the intervention wards receive the feedback intervention (feedback of analysed audit data) on a quarterly basis for 12&#x000a0;months. Data for the feedback intervention come from medication documentation point-prevalence audits and weekly reports on routinely collected medication error data. Weekly reports on these data are obtained for the control wards. A controlled interrupted time series analysis is used to evaluate the effect of the feedback intervention. Self-report data are also collected from nurses on all four wards at baseline and at completion of the intervention to elicit their perceptions of the work context. Additionally, following each feedback cycle, nurses on the intervention wards are invited to complete a survey to evaluate the feedback and to establish their intentions to change their reporting behaviour. To assess sustainability of the intervention, at 6&#x000a0;months following completion of the intervention a point-prevalence chart audit is undertaken and a report of routinely collected medication errors for the previous 6&#x000a0;months is obtained. This intervention will have wider application for delivery of feedback to promote behaviour change for other areas of preventable error and adverse events.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Knowledge translation</kwd><kwd>Implementation</kwd><kwd>Audit</kwd><kwd>Feedback</kwd><kwd>Organisational context</kwd><kwd>Behaviour change</kwd><kwd>Quality improvement</kwd><kwd>Medication safety</kwd><kwd>Clinical decision-making</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Health care is inherently complex and therefore error-prone, and despite health professionals striving for high-quality patient care, medical error and threats to patient safety are ubiquitous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although estimates of the frequency of medical errors and injuries vary considerably, even the most conservative estimates indicate that the problem is widespread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Significantly, preventable medical errors are associated with immeasurable human costs and substantial economic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Widespread underreporting of medical errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] hampers efforts to analyse causative factors and hinders ability to systematically target preventative strategies. One strategy to promote reporting, <italic>audit with feedback</italic>, has the potential to modify health professionals&#x02019; behaviour; however, limited evidence exists regarding which aspects of this complex, multi-dimensional intervention work best.</p><p>In this paper, we report a study protocol to refine and test an audit with feedback intervention (the Safe Medication Audit Reporting Translation (SMART) intervention). The intervention is aimed to inform decision-making and motivate behaviour change among nurses in order to maximise reporting of medication errors and ultimately improve patient safety.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Use of audit to monitor performance and improve patient safety</title><p>In health care, auditing practice is widely used to measure performance and inform quality improvement initiatives. Collection of audit data and routine reporting of adverse events (AEs) provides evidence of performance in relation to quality standards and use of research evidence. While audit is necessary, used alone it is unlikely to be sufficient to improve quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Audit data, however, <italic>can</italic> be fed back to stimulate behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Feedback plays a key role in organisations, providing employees with information about performance that meets or fails to meet the expected standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, feedback can have a positive or deleterious effect (such as passive resistance), dependent on how it is delivered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This highlights the importance of intervention design in order to ensure that the feedback promotes and supports behaviour change to improve performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Evidence for audit with feedback</title><p>Evidence indicates that the effectiveness of audit with feedback is likely to be greater when: baseline adherence to the practice is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; health professionals actively participate in the change process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; the feedback includes clear and specific goals and a strategy for achieving them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; it is delivered in a timely manner in association with the respective behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; the feedback is delivered both verbally and in writing, and it is delivered by a person in a position of seniority, rather than an unknown source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; and the feedback is delivered in repeated cycles as opposed to a single episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Authors of a 2006 Cochrane review, and the updated review in 2012, of evidence for effectiveness of audit with feedback concluded that the intervention is one for which we know little about how, when and why it is most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, authors of the updated review concluded, &#x0201c;when optimally-designed and used in the right context, [audit with feedback] can play an important role in improving professional practice&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], p. 30). According to their findings, audit with feedback has potential to result in a small but meaningful improvement in health professionals&#x02019; behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Yet Foy et al. warn &#x0201c;&#x02026; audit and feedback will continue to be an unreliable approach to quality improvement until we learn how and when it works best&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], p. 50).</p><p>Feedback is not a simple stimulus, but rather a complex, multi-dimensional intervention that is dependent on characteristics of the organisational context, the individual recipient, the message and the source of feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Identifying six dimensions that impact on the form and intensity of feedback (recipient, format, source, frequency, duration and content), Jamtvedt et al. note that a lack of attention to different feedback intensities is evident in published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additionally, the literature provides limited description of feedback innovations in terms of the process of development and design characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Ivers and colleagues call for components of future feedback interventions to be carefully described, including the theoretical justification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The influence of contextual factors on the effectiveness of feedback is also being increasingly recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] but remains poorly understood. Hysong and colleagues found that settings perceived as high performing were more likely to rely on chart data for feedback and placed greater emphasis on educational approaches to feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Evidence, however, for the means by which such an intervention works in the context of complex healthcare organisations is scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The impact of medication errors upon quality and safety in health care</title><p>Over a decade has elapsed since the Institute of Medicine released their influential publication, <italic>To Err is Human</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], in which they reported that between 44,000 and 98,000 deaths occur annually as a result of medical errors. This report attracted international attention and significantly raised the profile of patient safety in hospitals and with health policy leaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>While some progress has been made since publication of <italic>To Err is Human</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care estimates that medication administration errors occur in 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% of all medicines administered, signalling an immense safety and quality issue. In England, medication administration error rates reportedly occur in 3&#x02013;8&#x000a0;% of all hospital admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], while in the USA, medication errors have been estimated to account for 7,000 deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The Institute of Medicine Committee on Identifying and Preventing Medication Errors estimates that at least 1.5 million preventable adverse medication events occur annually in the USA, warning that this is likely to significantly underestimate the problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Other international research indicates that medication administration errors are associated with 5&#x000a0;% to 20&#x000a0;% of AEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], with 35.1&#x000a0;% of these being preventable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Medication errors are underreported</title><p>The international literature laments the dearth of reliable statistics globally regarding medication error rates. The aforementioned medication error rates are just the tip of the iceberg according to the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This is further corroborated by literature in this area, with estimates of medication error reporting rates ranging from 25&#x000a0;% to 70&#x000a0;% of all medication errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Researchers found that 34.8&#x000a0;% of nurses and physicians reported less than 20&#x000a0;% of perceived errors within the previous 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>While reporting of such events is essential for promotion of a safety culture and to inform strategies to increase safety, there are numerous reasons for underreporting, including a perception that if no harm is caused, the error is not worthy of reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Lack of feedback has also been cited as one of the most common reasons for failure to report medication errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, system modifications, feedback and education are unlikely to lead to significant improvements in reducing errors if the information surrounding errors is misleading or incomplete. It is well recognised that significant underreporting masks the true incidence of the problem and the circumstances surrounding errors, seriously hampering efforts to identify potential solutions and strategically target preventative strategies.</p><p>Medication therapy is the most common medical treatment received by patients, and medication administration is a routine part of nursing practice. Errors in medication administration expose patients to preventable harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The human costs related to medication errors encumber those who are harmed, their families and friends, as well as the health professionals who care for them. Thus there are ethical, humanitarian and financial imperatives to expose the extent and aetiology of medication errors and AEs and implement strategies to improve detection, management and prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Evidence suggests that up to 80&#x000a0;% of medical errors are the result of system defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Thus, reporting of medication errors is fundamental to quality improvement efforts and redesign initiatives to promote safety in health care.</p><p>This study is designed to fill gaps identified in existing research in this field, specifically by exploring how, when and in what context feedback works best to influence medication error reporting behaviour among nurses. The findings of this study will add to knowledge about characteristics, including the content and intensity (dose) of audit and feedback that are important in influencing health professionals&#x02019; behaviour regarding reporting of medication errors. Measurement of health professionals&#x02019; perceptions of organisational context will enable us to assess the extent to which contexts perceived as more favourable are associated with increased reporting of errors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Aim, purpose and study objectives</title><p>This study aims to refine and test an audit with feedback knowledge translation intervention (SMART) in order to promote nurse reporting of medication-related errors in clinical practice and add to the evidence base regarding nurses&#x02019; response to audit with feedback.

The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework focuses on the relationship between three key elements (evidence, facilitation and context) in influencing the implementation of research in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This framework, however, has limited applicability in studying the influence of individual characteristics on behaviour change. For this reason, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), which helps explain an individual&#x02019;s intent to change their behaviour, also informs this study.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>PARIHS</title><p>The PARIHS framework was developed by Kitson et al. to help explain the reasons for success or failure of implementation projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. For the purposes of this study, <italic>evidence</italic> relates to data on medication error and reporting rates, <italic>context</italic> constitutes the ward environment (i.e<italic>.</italic>, culture, leadership and evaluation/feedback processes) that impact upon medication error reporting and <italic>facilitation</italic> denotes roles and strategies to promote the behaviour change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>TPB</title><p>The TPB is an extension of the Theory of Reasoned Action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], according to which behavioural intention is the precursor to actual behaviour and intentions are formed based on information or beliefs that a certain behaviour will lead to a particular outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Subjective norms, the perceived social pressure to comply with a behaviour, can determine whether or not an individual performs the behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>The TPB extends on the Theory of Reasoned Action to include individuals&#x02019; perceptions of behavioural control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Perceived behavioural control, perception of the ease or difficulty of performing the behaviour, is thought to influence both behaviour and intent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Inclusion of perceived behavioural control expands understanding of the constraints on behaviour and acknowledges that intentions do not always predict behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This is relevant to medication error reporting behaviour in that intent to report errors may be influenced by other factors that ultimately lead to non-reporting behaviour. It is also important to determine if feedback affects behavioural intent. Ajzen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] suggests that these constructs (beliefs, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control) will vary in their level of influence across settings and behaviours; for example, in settings where individuals have strong opinions and attitudes perceived behavioural control may be a less reliable predictor of intention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 161 studies using the TBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] supported the use of this theory to predict intentions and behaviour.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Pilot testing an intervention to improve medication error reporting</title><p>Consistent with the UK Medical Research Council guidelines for the development of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], we conducted a small study in a 32-bed acute care ward at a large private hospital to inform development and undertake pilot and feasibility testing of medication chart audit tools and the SMART feedback intervention.</p><p>Baseline audit data were collected on key aspects of medication administration. At baseline, all ward nursing staff were invited to complete the Alberta Context Tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], a questionnaire designed to elicit perceptions of the work context (including culture, leadership and feedback mechanism). The feedback intervention comprised Microsoft PowerPoint<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> presentations to display audit data and survey results in graph form, coupled with face-to-face discussions about the results. Additionally, copies of the results slides were displayed on the ward for staff to view. The feedback was augmented with information about the definition of a medication error, the importance of reporting medication errors and near misses and the importance of a no-blame culture.</p><p>Medication administration audit data were collected 2&#x000a0;months following the feedback intervention, and staff were re-surveyed about their perceptions of the work context 6&#x000a0;months following collection of the baseline data. The frequency of medication errors in the 12&#x000a0;months prior to the intervention and in the 6&#x000a0;months post-intervention was compared. We found an 80&#x000a0;% increase in the reporting of medication errors and a statistically significant improvement in perceptions of evaluation and feedback mechanisms (including access to data, review, monitoring and benchmarking). The considerable increase in frequency of error reporting in the post-intervention phase highlighted the potential for this intervention to improve error reporting across the organisation and beyond and the importance of more rigorous testing of the intervention.</p><p>This pilot work underpins the study that is the subject of this protocol.

In developing the feedback reports, we will seek advice from the key stakeholder group regarding presentation of data, including promotion of visual appeal (considering layout, use of white space, colour, use of illustrations/figures), striving to make the content understandable (clear and concise description and illustrations that can be readily understood), and ensuring that the content is relevant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Testing the SMART intervention</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Administration</title><p>In conjunction with the key stakeholder reference group, the timing and mechanism for delivery of the feedback report will be determined. At a mutually convenient time, the researcher will meet with the relevant nurse unit managers of the two intervention wards to explain the project and arrange a suitable time for delivery of the feedback reports. A brief information session will be conducted in conjunction with delivery of the first feedback report, at a time and location determined by the nurse unit manager. Feedback reports will be provided on a quarterly basis for 12&#x000a0;months. The &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; wards will not receive the SMART intervention.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Evaluation</title><p>For 12&#x000a0;months, routinely reported RiskMan data will be extracted weekly and point-prevalence chart audits will be conducted quarterly on all four wards. On the intervention wards, data will be collected to evaluate the feedback reporting process and to elicit the opinions of managers and nurses with respect to the understandability, usefulness and usability of the report content. The findings will inform modifications to the report for future waves of report delivery.</p><p>On a quarterly basis, 1&#x000a0;week following delivery of the feedback report, nurses will be invited to complete the post-feedback survey, a brief, paper-based survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The researchers, in conjunction with the key stakeholder reference group, will consider the findings of the survey and modify future feedback reports accordingly. These modifications will then be re-evaluated by survey. Thus, a series of feedback reports, each containing the most current medication error report rates (from the point-prevalence medication chart audits) and medication-related errors and AEs (from RiskMan data) will be produced and each will be informed by survey data evaluating the previous reports. If and when the survey data no longer indicate the need for future modifications, the feedback report will not be modified and the staff will not be re-surveyed. Completion of the survey will be voluntary, and return of the survey will imply consent. Survey data will be manually entered into an IBM SPSS Statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] database for analysis. Following the final 2&#x000a0;cycles of feedback, nurses on the intervention wards will be invited to participate in a focus group interview to discuss the process of using the feedback.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Process measures</title><p>Process measures include self-reported uptake of feedback reports (survey data), intent to change behaviour (survey data) and perceptions of the feedback report (survey data on report content, presentation; interview data).</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcome measures include point-prevalence audit data and medication error reports. While we expect to observe an increase in medication error reporting rate as a result of the intervention, at some point, potentially as a culture of medication safety is developed, we may observe a decrease in medication error reporting because the true rate of errors decreases.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Post-intervention data collection</title><p>Following the 12-month intervention period, the ACT will be administered to all nurses on all four wards. Six months following completion of the intervention phase (18&#x000a0;months post-baseline data collection), a repeat point-prevalence chart audit will be undertaken and a report of reported medication errors and AEs for the previous 6&#x000a0;months will be extracted from RiskMan. These data will be used to assess sustainability of the intervention.

Analysis will involve the use of simple descriptive statistics, including frequencies and cross tabulations, and bivariate analysis using correlations. Interrupted time series analysis will be used to assess for change over time in response to the feedback. Outcomes will include error rates identified during the point-prevalence chart audits and the error report rates identified from RiskMan data. These data will be aggregated at ward level.</p><p>We will also examine RiskMan data for the 12-month period prior to the intervention. Intervention dose will be the main predictor, operationalised as the number of nurses on the ward who self-report reading the feedback reports. Aggregated at ward level, scores for the eight dimensions of organisational context will also be included as predictors of medication error reporting rates. Multivariate regression analyses will include cluster correction to adjust for ward and site effect. Content analysis will be used to analyse string variable responses to open-ended questions about suggestions to improve reports. Qualitative data will be analysed using content and thematic analysis techniques.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Operational approval for the study has been provided by the Director of Nursing at the hospital. Ethics approval has been obtained from the hospital&#x02019;s Human Research Ethics Committee and Deakin University. Prior to commencement of the study, permission will be sought from the Nurse Unit Managers of the selected wards in order to access staff. This is a minimal risk study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Expected outcomes</title><p>We expect that this knowledge translation feedback intervention will result in improved quality and frequency of reporting of medication errors. This will enable us to understand the scale and nature of medication errors occurring in the intervention units. Our intent is to produce a parsimonious, efficient and effective method of providing feedback to health professionals about a quality-related measure of practice. We anticipate that this project will result in the development of a feedback approach that can be adapted for and evaluated in other healthcare settings and for additional areas of preventable adverse events. Importantly, this study is designed to add to the body of knowledge about how, when and in what context feedback works best.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Strengths and limitations of study</title><p>This study will add to the evidence base on use of audit with feedback among nurses. In particular, it will promote understanding of the potential for feedback to promote behaviour change regarding medication error reporting, how and in what forms nurses prefer to receive feedback and how the contexts in which nurses work affect their ability to report medication errors. Additionally, the study will contribute knowledge about the accuracy of medication error reporting, comparing hospital incident reporting system data with evidence of administration errors in medical record documentation.</p><p>Limitations of this study need to be acknowledged. The study is to be conducted at a single site, with a relatively small sample. While we will match intervention and control wards as closely as possible on the basis of clinical casemix, there is no guarantee that matched wards within the same hospital will be entirely similar (e.g<italic>.</italic>, differences in ward culture, patient acuity/type, staffing turnover); hence, we will adjust for differences using the available data. Feedback will be constructed based upon advice from the key stakeholder group. It is possible that this format will not suit all nurses, and so, some staff may not find the feedback meets their needs and may discount it as a result. Behaviour change in reporting may also occur as a result of other variables (such as policy changes and/or serious medication incidents that make staff more aware/anxious about reporting). Hence, not all behaviour change may be attributable to the feedback intervention. Potential for contamination of the control group exists; however, the organisation has a stable nursing workforce with a vacancy rate of less than 5&#x000a0;%. Thus, permanent staff do not commonly work across different wards, thereby limiting the risk of contamination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Dissemination and spread</title><p>This study will add new knowledge that will be of particular interest and relevance to health professionals and administrators. We will use a multi-faceted approach to disseminate the findings of this study to health professionals, administrators and policy-makers. We will present the results in journal articles and at local, national and international healthcare conferences. We will also communicate the findings through our formal and informal networks, nationally and internationally.</p><p>The partner organisation and members of the research team are committed to sharing new knowledge to promote safe, high-quality care delivery. Our findings will be disseminated through the collaboration&#x02019;s existing networks, and a summary of the findings and information on the study, in a plain language format, will also be posted on the university website. Members of the research team sit on a range of policy decision-making committees and professional associations. As such, they have extensive networks for wide dissemination of the study findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Study status</title><p>Data collection commenced in February 2015 and will finish in 2016. The data collection cycle is illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study has the capacity to make a significant contribution to the literature in terms of the efficacy of audit with feedback for nurses. Factors affecting reporting of medication errors will be clarified and will allow healthcare organisations to target quality programmes and feedback strategies to effect positive change. The theoretical basis and methodological design of this study integrates well-established theories and methods to comprehensively address the research questions. This intervention will potentially have wider application for the delivery of feedback to health professionals working in other settings, for other areas of preventable adverse events and to promote behaviour change in aspects of care such as use of clinical practice guidelines. These findings will inform development of future interventions, including system redesign, to prevent medication errors. This research has potential to inform initiatives to improve the quality and safety of care received by patients in the acute care setting and will also have significance internationally in the field of knowledge translation.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACT</term><def><p>Alberta Context Tool</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PARIHS</term><def><p>Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMART</term><def><p>Safe Medication Audit Reporting Translation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TPB</term><def><p>Theory of Planned Behaviour</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
