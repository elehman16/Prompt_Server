There is scarcity of information on effective health systems interventions to lower BP and reduce cardiovascular risk in Southeast Asian countries. We conducted a pilot exploratory trial on 100 adults aged 40&#x000a0;years or older with uncontrolled hypertension to optimize the design for a structured multi-component intervention in primary care clinics for management of hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Two clinics were involved, each enrolling 50 participants, with one as the intervention clinic and the other as the control (usual care). The intervention comprised the following four components: 1) an algorithm-driven intervention using a fixed-dose combination (FDC) antihypertensive treatment and lipid lowering medication for high risk individuals, 2) subsidized FDC antihypertensive medication; 3) motivational conversation (MC) for high risk individuals; and 4) telephone follow-ups of all individuals. The process outcomes were intervention fidelity measures. The outcomes of change in parameters of interest were healthy lifestyle index (composite score of body mass index, physical activity, dietary habit, dietary quality and smoking), adherence to antihypertensive medications, and systolic and diastolic BP from baseline to follow-up at 3&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Greater than 90&#x000a0;% fidelity was achieved for 3 of the 4 intervention components. Although not designed for conclusive results, the healthy lifestyle score increased by 0.16 (&#x000b1;0.68) with the intervention and decreased by 0.18 (&#x000b1;0.75) with usual care (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02). Adherence to anti-hypertensive medications at follow-up was 95.3&#x000a0;% in the intervention group compared to 83.8&#x000a0;% for usual care (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01). Systolic and diastolic BP decreased in both intervention and control groups, although statistical significance between groups was not achieved. Hypertensive individuals rated all intervention components &#x02018;highly favorable&#x02019; on a Likert scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings indicate that the proposed, structured multi-component approach for management of hypertension is feasible for implementation in primary care clinics in Singapore, with some changes to the protocol. The observed improvement in the healthy lifestyle index and adherence to anti-hypertensive medications is promising. A large scale, adequately powered trial would be informative to assess intervention effectiveness on BP and cardiovascular risk reduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

Over 1 billion people in the world have uncontrolled blood pressure (BP), and this number is expected to increase to 1.5 billion by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The implications of uncontrolled BP are even greater in Asian populations for whom the relationship between BP and stroke is steep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Successive reports from the National Health Surveys (NHS) have highlighted the consistently elevated burden of hypertension in Singapore. In the 2010 NHS, one in four adults aged 30&#x000a0;years or older suffered from hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. About 50&#x000a0;% of individuals with hypertension had uncontrolled BP, and only half of these individuals were on antihypertensive treatment. Immediate health systems interventions are therefore needed.</p><p>A systematic review of 72 randomized controlled trials evaluating several health systems strategies to control BP (self-monitoring, organization of care, educational initiatives directed at patients or physicians, nurse- or pharmacist-led care, automated appointment reminders) suggest benefit of organized or structured care comprising multiple strategies, compared to single interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. More recently, secondary analysis of pre- and post-implementation of structured hypertension management programs in the insured US population, with components including fixed dose combination (FDC) antihypertensive agents and medical assistant visits for measurement of BP, has demonstrated beneficial impact on BP control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, there is a dearth of empirical trial evidence on strategies to enhance effectiveness of comprehensive care for hypertension and other chronic conditions in Singapore and countries with similar healthcare infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Although the vast majority of patients seek care from private GPs, the data from the National Health Survey Singapore 2010 indicated that about 45&#x000a0;% of individuals with chronic conditions (hypertension or diabetes) visit the government subsidized polyclinics. We therefore conducted a pilot exploratory trial on 100 adults with uncontrolled hypertension to optimize the design of a structured multi-component interventional study in the primary care clinics for management of hypertension. The intervention consisted of the following four components: 1) an algorithm-driven intervention using fixed-dose combination (FDC) antihypertensive treatment and lipid lowering medication for high risk individuals; 2) subsidized FDC antihypertensive medication; 3) motivational conversation (MC) for high risk individuals; and 4) telephone follow-ups of all individuals with hypertension by a team of physician-supervised nurse practitioners and nurses. The comparator was usual care in the polyclinics.</p><p>The overall aim was to assess feasibility of intervention implementation in polyclinics with regards to fidelity of the main interventional components by using the polyclinic workforce and infrastructure to inform the design and scalability of a future full scale cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT). We also evaluated the impact of the proposed strategies on change in healthy life style, adherence to antihypertensive medications, and BP levels. In addition, using linear mixed model analysis, a limited evaluation of intervention acceptability was performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The feasibility study was a non-randomized, parallel arm, cluster allocation of two polyclinics: one clinic to the intervention group and one clinic to the usual care (control) group.

All individuals presenting at polyclinics undergo computerized cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk scoring (using Singapore version of CVD score for men and women) at triage. BP was measured thrice, in the sitting position with arm rested, using a digital device (OMRON HEM-7300). The average of the last two of three BP readings, obtained three minutes apart, was used to confirm eligibility. Those with BP &#x02265;&#x02009;140/90&#x000a0;mmHg were considered to have uncontrolled hypertension. Written informed consent was then obtained by the research coordinator. A total of 100 participants were recruited: 50 in each clinic.</p><p>The research coordinator administered a brief study questionnaire for information on socio-demographics. In addition, EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L was administered to ascertain health related quality of life. Anthropometric measurements obtained were waist, height and weight.

After CVD risk assessment at triage and measurement of BP by research coordinators, participants were triaged to physicians for evaluation, including prescription of antihypertensive medications per treatment algorithm.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Treatment algorithm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2016_1491_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>All participants with a CVD score indicating risk of acute coronary heart disease of 20&#x000a0;% or greater over 10&#x000a0;years, or with diabetes, or pre-existing CVD were categorized as &#x0201c;high risk&#x0201d;. All other participants were categorized as &#x0201c;low/medium risk&#x0201d;. In all &#x0201c;high risk&#x0201d; participants, the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), losartan, plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) diuretic was initiated as a single pill fixed-dose combination (FDC) at half-standard dose of each.

Although not designed to yield conclusive results, the intervention increased the healthy lifestyle score by an average (SD) of 0.16 (&#x000b1;0.68) at the intervention group with a decrease of 0.18 (&#x000b1;0.75) for usual care (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02) over 3&#x000a0;months. The adherence to anti-hypertensive medications at follow-up was 95.3&#x000a0;% in the intervention group compared to 83.8&#x000a0;% in usual care (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01). Systolic and diastolic BP decreased in both intervention and control groups, however the difference was not statistically significant. Participants rated the intervention components (MC, telephone follow-ups, subsidy on FDC) &#x02018;highly favorable&#x02019; on a Likert scale. A large scale, adequately powered cluster RCT of the proposed intervention with some additional measures to enhance physician prescription of FDC antihypertensive medications to eligible participants would be informative regarding the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the packaged approach for reduction of BP and cardiovascular risk in this population.</p><p>The conduct of developmental and exploratory research is important prior to undertaking full-scale trials to evaluate complex interventions or pragmatic trial. Such efforts allow opportunities to modify the approach to be evaluated in a full scale more resource intensive trial. Our feasibility study was conducted from a perspective of introducing practical strategies in local primary care clinics with heavy caseloads. The high fidelity of MC and telephone follow ups were key process outcomes observed in our trial, and the positive feedback from providers and hypertensive individuals indicates that the existing polyclinic infrastructure and workflow can be reconfigured, and the strategies institutionalized for long term delivery of the proposed strategies in the public health infrastructure in Singapore. At the same time, only 50&#x000a0;% of physicians prescribed FDC to eligible participants. Therefore, the full scale study design would need additional measures to further enhance prescription rates. A performance indicator such as a physician management checklist embedded in the electronic health system indicating whether FDC was considered could be an effective option. These strategies would be applicable to many other countries where physicians and non-physician health professionals work as a team for synergistic benefit to achieve BP control, which remains a global public health challenge.</p><p>Our feasibility results suggest a potentially favorable effect of the packaged intervention on the healthy lifestyle index which is consistent with reported literature advocating physical activity, weight management and healthy diet to optimize benefit of drug therapy on cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that GP practices offer an excellent avenue to address multiple risk factors including lifestyle modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Our study was designed to emphasize this important aspect of hypertension management during various points of contact with the individuals during and following the clinic visit. First, lifestyle advice was an integral part of physician treatment algorithm for all hypertensive individuals. Second, all individuals at high risk received MC by trained nurses. Use of MC is increasingly effective in the management of chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The MC curriculum used in our study was especially developed using local case-based scenarios, and focused on life style management and adherence to medications. Third, all individuals received monthly telephone follow-up during which a standardized checklist on lifestyle and medication adherence was administered by nurses trained in a MC, with counseling offered as needed. This strategy was also relatively low cost at S$ 4.5 for a monthly telephone call is an additional strength, although formal cost effectiveness needs to be evaluated in the full scale study. Finally, fixed-dose antihypertensive regimens offered to high risk individuals at a subsidized cost have been shown to improve adherence, as opposed to multiple single medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, our feasibility trial suggests that a packaged intervention using the unique combination of specified components is likely to improve the healthy life style score as well as adherence to antihypertensive medications in individuals seeking care in the busy polyclinics in Singapore.</p><p>The adjusted decline in systolic and diastolic BP within the intervention and the usual care groups was marked, however between-group differences were not significant. This suggests the possibility of a Hawthorne effect with BP regression to the mean in both groups at 3&#x000a0;months. However, the benefits of improved lifestyle and adherence to antihypertensive medications observed in the intervention group would require longer term follow up in a larger number of participants. An adequately powered study accounting for clustering is needed to study the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the intervention on BP and other clinically meaningful outcomes. Our study underscores the need for a control group in these comparisons.</p><p>Finally, a limited participant satisfaction survey indicated that both providers and participants appreciated the utility of the strategies.</p><p>Our findings have limitations. The parallel groups were allocated clusters, and differences in outcomes do not account for clustered data.. However, the main aim of the feasibility study was to conduct a pilot of standardized protocol incorporating the main components of the intervention and using the polyclinic workforce infrastructure which we were able to achieve with high fidelity. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate acceptability of key intervention components in predominantly older adults&#x02014;the fastest growing segment of Singapore population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, we believe a full scale study of the proposed strategies is feasible in the polyclinics to conclusively answer questions of clinical and cost effectiveness. The clues from our feasibility study on the healthy lifestyle index in conjunction to adherence to antihypertensive medications indicate success is likely for both aims.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our study on 100 individuals with uncontrolled hypertension in two polyclinics in Singapore resulted in high intervention fidelity and signaled improvement in healthy life style factors and adherence to anti-hypertensive medications compared to usual care. The packaged intervention needs to be evaluated perhaps with additional measures to enhance FDC prescription in a full scale trial for effectiveness and cost effectiveness on BP lowering and improvement of cardiovascular risk for future scalability and sustainability. Our proposed trial has significant clinical practice and public health policy implications in Singapore, and globally.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACEI, ACE inhibitors; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; BMI, body mass index; BP, blood pressure; CCB, calcium channel blockers; CME, continued medical education; CVD, cardiovascular diseases; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; FDC, fixed dose combination; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; HCTZ, hydrochlorothiazide; HLI, healthy lifestyle index; ICC, intra-cluster correlations; LOCF, last observation carried forward; MC, motivational conversation; MMAS-8, morisky medication adherence scale; NHS, national health surveys; PDC, Proportion of days covered; SBP, systolic blood pressure; SD, standard deviation.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12913_2016_1491_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Checklist for Telephone follow-up by Nurse Practitioners and Nurses (table).
