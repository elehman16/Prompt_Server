This study was conducted to evaluate the sustainability of interventions of the Heart Health Promotion from Childhood (HHPC) project, one of the 10 interventional projects of the Isfahan Healthy Heart Program.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The evaluation of HHPC included administrating surveys to 500 elementary and middle, and 500 high school students. The study participants were randomly selected from all schools in Isfahan. The questionnaires were administered by interviews to evaluate the sustainability of interventions.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results of interviews showed that interventions were sustainable in 100% of elementary school, 99% of middle school, and 87% of high school students. Training of healthy lifestyle behaviors was significantly higher in all-girls middle schools (P &#x0003c; 0.001). Daily morning exercise was more frequent in girls high schools (P &#x0003c; 0.001), while selling unhealthy food was more frequent in boys high schools (P &#x0003c; 0.001). The participants attributed the success of the program mostly to students&#x02019; agreement and cooperation.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Even though 5 years have passed since the end of the HHPC project, many of the interventions have been continued at the schools, often because healthy behaviors have become institutionalized in the target population. However, now all schools have the same level of sustainability, especially the middle and high schools, and all-boys schools. Therefore, it is important for future projects to place additional emphasis on these institutions for future school-based interventions.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Behavior</kwd><kwd>Community Health Planning</kwd><kwd>Institutionalization</kwd><kwd>Schools</kwd><kwd>Sustainability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The escalating rise of non-communicable diseases globally<xref rid="b1-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="b3-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> has required swift concerted action, at various levels of decision making from international level to the community level.<xref rid="b4-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Successful programs may not necessarily develop into a sustainable organizational strategy,<xref rid="b5-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> therefore evaluation of sustainability should be mainstreamed into the evaluation process.

<bold>Sustainability determinants</bold>
</p><p>To develop tools for measuring the sustainability of HHPC project, we defined its determinants. A review of the literature was performed using keywords such as &#x0201c;sustainability,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;institutionalization,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;implementation,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;health promotion program,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;healthy lifestyle,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;health program&#x0201d; in PubMed and Google Scholar.

</p><p>The sample size of this survey was 1000 consisted of 500 elementary and middle school students and 500 high school students. Samples were selected using cluster random sampling. In each municipality areas in Isfahan, 100 students (50 from high school and 50 from elementary and middle school), were interviewed.

Based on the pollution distribution of Isfahan, 50% female and 50% male students were selected for interviews. The mean ages of elementary, middle and high school students were 10.84 &#x000b1; 0.84, 13.72 &#x000b1; 0.99, and 16.38 &#x000b1; 0.95 years, respectively.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ARYA-10-107">Table 1</xref> shows the determinates of sustainable interventions according to elementary school children responses. All participants responded positively to the presence of healthcare staff and the existence of morning exercise. Boys were more satisfied with this exercise than girl&#x02019;s significantly (P = 0.002). All schools have a healthy snack bar services with boys reporting more satisfaction than girls (P &#x0003c; 0.001). Determinants like parental pressure or liking the food ranked as the highest among factors influencing compliance with schools&#x02019; healthy food plans. Almost all girls and boys experienced improvement in their health after the HHCP implementation, students&#x02019; acceptance, then authorities approval and family support were the most important reasons for continued interventions.</p><p>The determinants of sustainable interventions in middle schools and students&#x02019; opinions on continued or discontinued interventions are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ARYA-10-107">table 2</xref>. While all girls&#x02019; schools have healthcare staff, only 48% of boys&#x02019; schools had them. Training of healthy lifestyle behaviors was persisted in all and 88% of girl&#x02019;s and boy&#x02019;s schools respectively (P &#x0003c; 0.001). Training children during morning programs was the most frequent method used among girls and boys, but its frequency is significantly higher in girls schools (P &#x0003c; 0.001). Daily morning exercise and cafeterias selling healthy snacks were available in most schools. Boys believed more in the effect of HHCP interventions on their health and behavior changes than girls (P &#x0003c; 0.001). The frequency of boys satisfactied with snack bars services and daily morning exercise were significantly higher than girls (P = 0.002 for both). Authorities&#x02019; approval for continuing interventions followed by the student&#x02019;s acceptance and integration into the school curriculum were the most frequent reasons for continued interventions. Discontinuation of interventions was higher among all boys schools (P = 0.010). The reasons for discontinued interventions were; other priorities considered by school staff, lack of rules in schools and lack of human resources.</p><p>The sustainable interventions in high schools and student&#x02019;s opinions on continued or discontinued interventions are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ARYA-10-107">table 3</xref>. While integrating interventions was similar in girls&#x02019; and boys&#x02019; high school, only 22% of boy&#x02019;s schools have health care staff compared to 66% of girls schools (P &#x0003c; 0.001). High school children of both sexes referred to receiving training during morning programs as the most frequent method while face to face education by the teachers as the least used method. The frequency of boys trained for tobacco control was higher than girls (P &#x0003c; 0.001). Daily morning exercise was more frequent in girls schools (P &#x0003c; 0.001) while selling unhealthy food was more frequent in boys&#x02019; high schools (P &#x0003c; 0.001). Students acceptance followed by authorities&#x02019; approval, and family support were the most frequent reasons for success, while lack of related rules and the perception that interventions were not needed in schools were the most reasons for failure. Other priorities considered by school staff followed by lack of willingness of authorities were the main reasons for discontinued interventions according to students&#x02019; opinions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we evaluated the sustainability of HHPC interventions 5 years after the completion of the project by conducting qualitative and quantitative studies. The results obtained from the qualitative study constitute the variables used to develop questionnaires that were later administrated in the surveys. The survey conducted on schoolchildren of all grades showed that most of the interventions were sustainable in 100% of elementary schools, 99% of middle schools, and 87% of high schools.

The surveys assessed how far HHPC intervention activities were sustainable and ongoing 5 years after the completion of its research phase in 2006.</p><p>Among 19 studies that were reviewed by Scheirer, 18 reported its continuity, 6 reported continued benefits, and 2 reported continued community capacity.<xref rid="b9-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Shediac-Rizkallah and Bone study showed that sustainability is influenced by the manner in which the program is designed and institutionalized, the factors involved in the performance of the program in related places and the characteristics of the environment and target population.<xref rid="b14-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> While our study showed that the main reason for sustainable interventions according to the schoolchildren view points in all grades were their acceptance of the intervention followed by authorities approval and their families support. One of the important reasons that led to the sustainability of HHPC interventions is the fact that IHHP projects were performed simultaneously<xref rid="b22-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> which helped to increase the dose of interventions and had a booster effect.<xref rid="b26-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Furthermore, the managers of each project involved the directors or chiefs of cooperating offices or organizations in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of interventions, a strategy that later helped in institutionalizing these interventions and saving the study funds to perform the research part of the whole program.<xref rid="b28-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Most of the studies on sustainability have evaluated only the outcomes and maintenance of health results.

During the HHPC, Isfahan Provincial Health Center and Provincial Education and Training Office had close cooperation. Since the chiefs of both organizations were HHPC directors, they integrated several of its interventions in their daily activities. Apparently, such cooperation has substantially increased the sustainability of the HHPC. They are performing a healthy lifestyle program with expanded areas of interventions and have added the evaluation, follow-up of interventions and continuous reporting as part of their activities.</p><p>HHPC was an intervention project that was conducted in schools and kindergartens, aiming to improve lifestyle habits and to prevent and control CVD risk factors. The target groups who were trained on healthy nutrition, tobacco control measures and physical activity include children and adolescents, their parents, school staff, and health care providers. Our results of school children showed that the sustainability of health-promoting interventions in elementary and middle schools of Isfahan was high as currently 100% of elementary schools and 99% of middle schools have integrated the interventions, including educational programs, morning workouts and ban of unhealthy food sales like snacks including chips and cheese balls.</p><p>The number of interventions integrated in girls&#x02019; middle schools was 100%, however it was less in boys&#x02019; middle schools, and the least in boys&#x02019; high schools. For example, sales of unhealthy food reached 46.8% in boys&#x02019; high schools. Furthermore, only 39.6% of boys in high schools did morning exercise. We considered interventions to be sustainable if they were implemented in at least 60% of target places, therefore, the interventions in high school boys were often non-sustainable. Lack of need of these interventions was the response provided by 41% of boys in middle and high schools.</p><p>Differences in childrens&#x02019; perception might be one of the reasons of the results in this study, however, questions with large sex-based differences were direct and objective like whether they have a healthy snack bar services in their schools or whether they received educational sessions or not. Furthermore, the principals of girls school are usually women and boys&#x02019; ones are men in Iran, a fact that may lead to better results among girls, as women pay more attention to health behaviors.<xref rid="b40-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Another reason might be related to girls attitude and behaviors, because girls in this age are more concerned about their body shape and health, which may lead them to do more physical activity and eat healthier food.<xref rid="b42-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="b43-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>Taking the opportunity of morning programs to teach students and conduct daily exercise might be effective. Morning programs are conducted daily in all schools in Iran. In this program, different issues about life, society, religion, family, and environment are discussed. Because all students took part in these programs, schools can take advantage of this opportunity to educate all students about the interventions. Furthermore, policy makers, school teachers, and principals have used this opportunity as the most important way to teach students programs. In addition, daily exercise is done in 100% of elementary schools and most of middle and high schools. Another advantage of the morning programs is the participation of principals and some teachers beside students in these programs. It seems that students will be encouraged to have a healthy behavior when they see their principals&#x02019; exercise or modify their lifestyle.</p><p>When tobacco control is considered, boys&#x02019; school&#x02019;s were more successful in continuing their activities than girls&#x02019; schools. The difference was significant in this regard. It may be related to the higher frequency of tobacco use among boys than girls and the early age of starting tobacco among boys in Iran<xref rid="b44-ARYA-10-107" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ARYA-10-107">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>HHPC sustainable interventions may also be related to improved knowledge and practice of the target population, together with the school childrens' acceptance, feeling of necessity for the interventions by policy makers, proper planning and implementation, developing rules/legislation, training of the teachers and principals, frequent evaluations and application of their results, and use of appropriate opportunities and available facilities.</p><p>Considering the results obtained and the fact that the implementation of these interventions does not need extra financial and human resources, it can be applied in other countries in the region because of the similarity in culture, socioeconomic status, and religious beliefs.</p><p>The strengths of our study are that it included qualitative component beside a comprehensive literature review to extract the determinants that constitute the variables related to sustainability to be included in the survey questionnaires; that school children in different grades and both sexes; and that our study was conducted 5 years after project completion.</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although 5 years have passed since the final phase of HHPC project, its interventions still continues at schools and in some cases, outcomes in lifestyle change have been sustained in populations. The sustainability is higher in elementary and middle schools than high schools and in girl school more than boy school. Therefore, it is important for future projects to put additional emphasis in these institutions for future school-based interventions to ensure intervention sustainability.</p></sec><sec><title>What&#x02019;s New</title><p>Although there are several studies on healthy lifestyle promotion or NCD prevention, few studies have examined the sustainability of their interventions. Such studies may need a combination of qualitative and quantitative components which can make the study complicated and hard to conduct. This study was done not only on school children at all grades, but on their parents and teachers, it consisted of qualitative and quantitative parts and was done 5 years after the completion of the original study.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The study has been supported by the World Heart Federation grant.
