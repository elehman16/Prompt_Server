Costs of consultation, diagnosis, treatment and partner notification for STIs were only fully covered or reimbursed in 39% of countries.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This indicates that further activities and support are required to increase chlamydia testing in many countries.</p><p>To increase chlamydia testing rates across the EU, the general practice could play a greater role in testing, as two-thirds of young people visit their GP practice annually.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Young people report that GP surgeries are an acceptable venue for chlamydia testing and, furthermore, they think it is the GP surgeries&#x02019; &#x02018;duty&#x02019; to offer it.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>
</p><p>In England, we previously developed a complex chlamydia intervention, termed Chlamydia Intervention Randomised Trial (CIRT), that aimed to increase chlamydia testing for young people in the general practice setting by influencing: personal attitudes of GP staff to offering chlamydia testing routinely to young people, social norms in the practice around chlamydia testing and opinions of their young patients about testing and perceived behavioural controls in the practice setting of general practice (GP) staff and their patients.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The CIRT was based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). TPB is a psychological behaviour change theory that helps researchers to understand an individual&#x02019;s behaviour. The TPB can also be used to inform intervention development.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> In this setting, the behaviour was GP staff offering a chlamydia test to all young people 16&#x02013;24 years in the general practice setting. The intervention aimed to positively influence personal attitudes (GP staff emotional reactions towards chlamydia testing in the practice and beliefs that chlamydia testing makes a difference), subjective norms (positively influencing all practice staff and patients&#x02019; beliefs about the value and ease of chlamydia testing in general practice and their motivation to undertake testing) and addressing real or perceived behavioural controls (staff and patients&#x02019; perception of their ability (knowledge&#x000a0;and skills) and degree to which various external factors (eg, time limitations) make it easy versus difficult to test all young people) (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 1</xref>&#x000a0;for constructs of the TPB).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017528.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1</label><caption><title>suppl&#x000a0;1</title></caption><p>

</p></supplementary-material><p>The key components of CIRT included: an interactive workshop displaying the practice&#x02019;s chlamydia testing rates, the importance of and procedure for chlamydia testing, with examples of scripts to use in a consultation, and action planning; posters; patient leaflets; computer prompts; and ongoing feedback. In 2010, CIRT, in South West England,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> significantly increased chlamydia testing rates, and the effect was sustained. CIRT more effectively increased testing if GPs used computer reminders and participated in further feedback, with a chlamydia support worker.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Translation of CIRT&#x02019;s educational resources into other European languages, and adaptation where necessary, presents a real opportunity to increase testing in other countries, particularly where testing in general practice is low. Previous groups who have adapted public health interventions for different EU countries<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> highlight the importance of understanding the major differences in needs between the previous and future target groups and of maintaining the key elements of the intervention.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>This paper describes the qualitative needs assessment used to determine the needs of primary healthcare general practice staff, stakeholders and trainers to inform the adaptation of CIRT for a wider primary healthcare audience within England and three EU countries that vary in their chlamydia control programmes (Estonia, France and Sweden), so creating ChlamydiA Testing Training in Europe (CATTE).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting</title><p>The needs assessment was undertaken by five centres in four countries: England, within the primary care unit and National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) of Public Health England; Estonia, within the Department of Public Health at the University of Tartu; Sweden, within the University Hospital, &#x000d6;rebro; and France, within the Nice University Hospital D&#x000e9;partement de Sant&#x000e9; Publique, Nice. The assessment and resource development were undertaken by a multidisciplinary team including microbiologists, public health and primary care researchers and clinicians.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>In 2013, in order to obtain a sample of GP staff working in small and large rural and urban practices, involved in training students or not, of different gender and range of age, we aimed to interview at least eight GP staff in each partner country. In Estonia, France and Sweden, GP staff were approached purposively to fulfil these criteria, using the routine existing GP practice contacts list used by the institution. In France, where doctors work singlehandedly, more individuals were interviewed to obtain more opinions. In England, where the modified intervention would be piloted across the country, we approached GP practices in three areas, which were inner city London, rural and urban (Islington, Warwickshire&#x000a0;and Bournemouth). English practices were ranked&#x000a0;by 2012 chlamydia screening rates; six practices in the highest tertile in each area were approached in random order. We then purposively selected six practices with low chlamydia testing numbers that were closest geographically to these high testing practices.</p><p>To ensure the training was appropriate, feasible and fitted in with local sexual health policy, future trainers who would be involved in intervention delivery and four stakeholders involved in the provision or commissioning of local public and sexual health services were purposively selected and interviewed. Trainers were nurses, general practitioners or public health physicians with some knowledge of sexual health but not specialists.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interview schedule</title><p>All researchers worked together to create semistructured interview schedules based on the TPB (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">supplementary file 2</xref>). The schedule covered participants&#x02019; (GP staff, stakeholders and trainers) own and perception of others&#x02019; views on the importance, perceived effectiveness and current practice of offering chlamydia testing, condoms, contraception and sexual health services in general practice and GP staff&#x02019;s confidence and other external factors influencing their ability and intention to do so. We also guided all participants through the contents of the English CIRT, asking their opinions about each component and its delivery. The interviews also explored the optimum training models in each country. The interview schedule was piloted with four GP staff in England, with alterations made after the first two by the English researchers and repiloted with two more GP staff. Only minor changes were made after this schedule was piloted and with one or two GP staff in each of the other countries. Potential participants were approached by email or phone through the practice managers, and interviews were conducted face to face in a private room in the GP practice, lasting between 11&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;57 mins. In Sweden, interviews were also conducted in the county clinical microbiology laboratory (see&#x000a0;online&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP3">supplementary file 3</xref> recruitment flow&#x000a0;charts). Interviews in each country were in their native language and slightly modified to allow for any differences in the focus of sexual health education requested by stakeholders. Interviewers were practiced in the skill of interviewing, using probing as opposed to leading questions. The researcher made field notes of salient themes and main findings, during and after the interview.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017528.supp2</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2</label><caption><title>suppl&#x000a0;2</title></caption><p>

</p><p>Many GP staff thought that combining the offer of chlamydia screening with an offer of contraception and condoms was a very good idea, but most said that they would struggle to fit this all in within a normal consultation, without extra resources; some suggested it should just be offered in young persons&#x02019; clinics. Stakeholders stressed that, if condoms were offered, they should be free to patients and practices. Most GP staff in all countries reported a need for an update on: sexual health and chlamydia, how to test, treatment and partner notification.

Many GP staff reported that patients preferred to seek sexual health services elsewhere, as patients were anxious about confidentiality, or sexual health services were not readily available in GP practices. There was a common GP staff belief in all countries that patients needed to ask for chlamydia testing, rather than staff proactively offering it; they suggested that posters would facilitate the offer of testing. All participants reported great value in providing young people information about surgery sexual health services, as posters, invitation cards, leaflets or website information. In France, participants reported that patients needed a detailed leaflet, as they knew less about chlamydia. A few GP staff, with a diverse population, stressed the importance of providing information in different languages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Barriers to chlamydia testing in general practice</title><p>Time and pressures of other waiting patients were cited by all participants in each country as the key barrier to GP staff offering chlamydia testing and sexual health services.

</p><p>Forgetting to make the offer was common in all four countries. GP staff in England suggested that computer prompts or templates could be helpful to develop a consistent approach to chlamydia testing, enabling all staff, including receptionists, to be involved. Although some participants in other countries thought computer prompts were a good idea, implementation would be too complex due to the many different GP computer software systems.</p><p>In Sweden, as GP staff were paid for all chlamydia tests, they could undertake tests whenever it was clinically indicated or patients requested them, if they had time. Other countries&#x02019; GP staff and stakeholders cited that limited practice funding for chlamydia testing meant that they were less likely to undertake this work, compared with other paid for public health interventions. A few GP staff in England reported that, where a locally enhanced service (LES) payment system, in which practices were given extra payments for submitting more chlamydia tests in young patients, had previously been in place and GP staff were already in the routine of asking about screening, screening had continued, despite the funding being withdrawn.</p><p>In Sweden, because diagnostic staff were available in each practice, arranging chlamydia testing was reported to be much easier by GP staff and stakeholders. In all other countries, many GP staff were not completely aware of the exact specimen collection procedures and the availability of self-sampling. As some male GP staff were not aware of self-sampling, they reported that they would need a female chaperone in the room, if testing a woman for chlamydia, and this made the testing procedure more time consuming while they arranged this. Most GP staff were enthusiastic about self-taken vaginal swabs, but some in all countries thought that asking women to do a vaginal swab would be more difficult than urine. A few GP staff raised the issue that they did not know if the patient would actually return the test once they picked up the kit, and several suggested that doing the test there and then may increase tests returned. When suggested to other GP staff, this testing &#x02018;there and then&#x02019; approach sometimes raised time and practicality barriers. In France, patients cannot complete the test within their GP practice; they have to take the test to a laboratory with a GP prescription and their health insurance card to get the test analysed and be reimbursed for it. French GPs suggested that a patient information leaflet would help to increase patient awareness of this complex process.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Workshop delivery</title><p>All stakeholders agreed that, as in CIRT, chlamydia testing should be the central component of the CATTE intervention.

</p><p>GP staff indicated that workshops should be facilitated by experienced trainers, ideally by peers. Most participants agreed that workshops should be held in the practice.

In Sweden, a stakeholder indicated that the content of the educational workshop was more suited for <italic>&#x02018;</italic>staff at Youth Health Centres&#x02019; who deal most with young people&#x02019;s sexual health. Other trainers and GP staff indicated that, due to other practice priorities, it would be a real challenge to obtain training time within GP surgeries, but that persuading practice managers of the benefits of training would facilitate bookings and also help implementation of the intervention. French trainers and stakeholders suggested shorter one-to-one academic detailing for the single-handed GP staff; in Estonia, it was recommended that joint workshops with several practices would&#x000a0;be more efficient and may help influence social norms, as the activity could be more of an area initiative and enthusiastic staff may be able to influence others.</p><p>Generally, trainers, stakeholders and GP staff were happy with the range of proposed materials used in CATTE. Participants agreed the need for a whole team approach but thought it would be very difficult to ensure full team attendance. Participants emphasised the importance of individualising the educational workshops for each GP practice and determining how identifying an individual as the sexual health champion in each practice could influence the staff team, converting the postworkshop enthusiasm into an increase in testing. A few GP staff in England and Estonia suggested that discussion of case studies or role play would be appropriate to increase staff confidence to offer screening. Staff capacity to provide the educational workshops and follow-up, and funding of them, was identified by stakeholders as a barrier to implementation, on a significant scale.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Other suggestions to increase chlamydia testing</title><p>GP staff&#x02019;s opinions on whether non-clinical staff, such as receptionists, should be involved in offering chlamydia testing were very dependent on the surgery waiting area.

Trainers highlighted the need for GP manager and receptionist training, so that they could understand the importance of chlamydia testing. In Sweden, stakeholders reported that diagnostic staff working in the practice could offer tests, and therefore they should be invited to workshops.</p><p>A few GP staff reported that: a sexual health lead within each practice, and an informative website, could facilitate testing and feedback. Other GP staff suggestions included: offering young people token gifts for returning a test and texting results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>Findings across the four countries were similar, and as each country only suggested minor adaptations to suit their country&#x02019;s sexual health service, this supports adaptation of the English training model, for other countries as CATTE. Using the TPB constructs allowed us to determine the factors influencing GP staff intention to offer chlamydia testing in the general practice and make sure they were addressed in the CIRT intervention, when modified for wider use. The negative attitudes of some GP staff and the influence of their negative colleagues&#x02019; attitudes had a major impact on their intentions to undertake chlamydia testing. GP staff in many practices did not consider that this work was of high-eno ugh priority in the little time they had to see patients, and most did not wish to raise it in a consultation unrelated to sexual health. The CIRT workshop aims to increase positive attitudes towards testing, by stressing how common the infection is, how testing can reduce spread, morbidity and long-term complications and that patients want GP staff to provide the offer. Feeding back testing rates and newsletters will also help to influence these attitudes. Stakeholders stressed the importance of having key practice staff attending the workshop; this will require workshop facilitators to check which practice staff are most influential and confirm they can attend. There were many behavioural controls identified in all countries; knowledge and skills around the exact testing process and how to maximise sample return was lacking in all countries and needs to be covered in all workshops. Finally, time and forgetfulness were problems in all countries and encouraging the use of computer prompts, if possible, with easily accessible testing kits, should be encouraged. The scripts already present in the CIRT materials will help the GP staff to develop skills to offer tests more quickly. The testing procedure did vary in different countries, which will need addressing in the training. In Sweden, there were diagnostic staff in the practice, whereas in France the procedure was much more complex and will be a more difficult external barrier to overcome.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>We included countries that varied in their chlamydia control programmes from little testing in primary care in France to an established NCSP in England.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> We spoke to different GP staff, trainers and stakeholders, gaining a wide range of opinions about facilitators and barriers to delivering sexual health services and training in primary care across four countries. However, to facilitate implementation in other countries, further needs assessment may be needed to inform any further training modifications in that country. The study could have included more participants from each country to enrich the data and possibly find more facilitators or barriers to the intervention; however, the data was very consistent and we did reach data saturation in each country. To facilitate consistency of data analysis, we used a common thematic framework; this may have biased researchers towards finding common themes; however, we do not think this is so as several themes were only found in single countries, and countries produced representative quotes for the themes they described.</p><sec id="s6a"><title>Other work in this area</title><p>It is interesting that the barriers to chlamydia testing in general practice we identified in this study are similar to those identified across primary care settings: in England<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref>&#x000a0;and Australia.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> Continued barriers to sexual health provision in general practice indicate that behaviourally based interventions are needed to allow chlamydia testing to become embedded in routine practice. GP staff in the previous CIRT study who successfully increased their practice&#x02019;s chlamydia screening<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> had implemented many of the suggestions made by staff in the other countries of this study, including: computer prompts that helped staff remember to make the offer, having a designated lead and feedback about the general practice&#x02019;s testing rates. In CIRT, ensuring patients&#x02019; collected samples when still in the general&#x000a0;practice was not attained in most general practices,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and this was seen as challenging in this study. This aspiration will be difficult for most practices, unless the process is very clear, and kits are readily available. Australian primary care nurses indicated that the provision of training, streamlining chlamydia testing and simplification of pathology ordering processes would also facilitate nurses&#x02019; chlamydia testing.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> As other work has found little significant difference in GP care provision in our four countries involved,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> the intervention should be easily transferable.

</p><p>All GP staff outside of Sweden cited financial pressures as a major barrier.

We hope our work has added to this body of evidence by confirming these successful facilitators and identifying other facilitators that could be used to increase chlamydia testing, including giving GP staff scripts to use to increase capability of offering tests, use of computer prompts or templates, patients undertaking the test immediately in the surgery before leaving the practice, peers as trainers&#x000a0;and whole team approach including training receptionists.</p></sec><sec id="s6b"><title>Implications</title><p>This needs assessment indicated that CIRT could be adapted to address the needs of GP staff in four EU countries with a range of chlamydia testing provision in general practice.

It would be valuable for future evaluations to use a multifactorial design that includes financial incentives only in one arm.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e312" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017528.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e314" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017528.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) and wider project group in England, especially Kevin Dunbar, John Saunders, Anthony Nardone and Thomas Hartney, and all members of the 3Cs &#x00026; HIV Project Group (Deborah Shaw and Sharron Ainslie).
