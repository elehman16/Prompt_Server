cycling exercise on the balance and gait abilities of chronic stroke patients. [Subjects]
Thirty-two chronic stroke patients were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=16)
or a control group (n=16). [Methods] All of the subjects received the standard
rehabilitation program for 30 minutes, while the experimental group additionally
participated in a daily session of stationary cycling exercise for 30 minutes, 5 times per
week for 6 weeks. To assess balance function, the Berg Balance Scale and timed up-and-go
test were used. The 10-m walking test was conducted to assess gait function. [Results]
Both groups showed significant improvements in balance and gait abilities. The
improvements in the Berg Balance Scale and timed up-and-go test scores (balance), and 10-m
walking test score (gait) in the stationary cycling exercise group were significantly
greater than those in the control group. [Conclusion] This study demonstrated that
stationary cycling exercise training is an effective intervention for increasing the
balance and gait abilities of chronic stroke patients. Therefore, we suggest that
stationary cycling training is suitable for stroke rehabilitation and may be used in
clinical practice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Stationary cycling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Post-stroke gait dysfunction is a major impediment that affects functional ambulation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.

stroke patients in clinical and research settings. Among these interventions, repetitive
motor training can alter brain representation maps and is mainly and basically used for
managing the motor function recovery in stroke patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, which specific therapeutic modalities most efficient
repetitive motor training remains unclear.</p><p>Skilled activity is necessary to drive brain changes that might lead to improvements in
functional activities such as gait<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Stationary cycling, which requires less balance capability, has been used for training
patients with or without nervous system disorders who have difficulty in maintaining balance
and independent gait<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cycling and
walking share similar locomotor patterns of reciprocal flexion and extension movements and
alternating muscle activation of antagonists<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cycling can improve functional mobility and acts as a pseudo
walking task-oriented exercise<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Besides
improving muscle strength, cycling exercise also facilitates muscle control of the lower
limbs, which may allow putting more weight on the affected leg while standing. For this
reason, stationary cycling exercise has been used with various other interventions in the
clinical environments<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the
pure effect of cycling exercise is uncertain in chronic stroke patients. Therefore, this
study investigated the effects of stationary cycling exercise on the balance and gait
abilities of chronic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, pretest-posttest controlled trial.
In this study, 38 chronic stroke patients who were hospitalized were recruited. All
experimental procedures and contents were explained to each participant, who provided
written informed consent thereafter. All of the experimental procedures were approved by the
institutional review board of Sahmyook University. The inclusion criteria were as follows:
presence of hemiparesis secondary to stroke that had occurred in the past 6 months; ability
to walk 10&#x02005;m independently with or without an assistive device; ability to communicate and
understand, with a Mini-Mental Status Examination score of more than 21 points; no visual
disorders or visual field deficit; and no known musculoskeletal conditions that would affect
the ability to walk safely. The 6 subjects who refused to participate in the present program
or did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded from the study.</p><p>The subjects were randomly assigned to the following 2 groups by using a table of random
sampling numbers: the experimental and the control group. Evaluation and data analysis were
performed by a single physical therapist. Both the subjects and the therapist were blinded
to group assignments of the patients. All of the participants were evaluated before training
and at the end of the 4-week training period. The patients in the experimental group
performed the cycling exercise 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Both groups
received traditional therapy for 30 minutes per session, 5 times a week for 4 weeks.
Stationary bicycle training has been used in order to improve the balance and walking
abilities of stroke patients. In this study, only the lower extremity part of a
dual-extremity ergometer (Super Dynamic 3000, Shingwang Medical) was used.</p><p>To perform the exercise, the patient mounted a stationary bicycle safely under supervision,
and the therapist adjusted the position of the seat and tied the ankles and calf to the
pedals. The therapist was fully aware of the order and method of the stationary bicycle
training, and the patients performed the exercise after receiving instructions and
familiarizing themselves with the ergometers, including test runs. The resistance was set at
1 of 4, which corresponded to 25&#x02013;30&#x02005;W on the stationary bicycle. The patient was riding the
bicycle at 50&#x02013;60&#x02005;rpm without stopping, for 30 min, 5 times a week for 6 weeks.</p><p>The subjects&#x02019; balancing skills were rated using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS; range, 0&#x02013;56),
and the timed up-and-go (TUG) test was used to evaluate dynamic balance abilities. The
patients were asked to stand up, walk at a comfortable speed to a point marked 3&#x02005;m away from
their chair, turn around, walk back, and sit down in the chair. The total time required to
complete this process was measured with a stopwatch. Three trials were performed, and the
mean time was recorded. The cut-off TUG test score that indicated normal versus below normal
performance was 12 seconds. The intra-rater (<italic>r</italic> = 0.99) and inter-rater
(<italic>r</italic> = 0.98) reliability values were high<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BBS and TUG test scores were obtained by an experienced
physical therapist blinded to the group assignment.</p><p>Gait ability was measured by using the timed 10-m walking test (10MWT). For the 10MWT, 10&#x02005;m
was measured on the floor by using a tape measure, and the start and end points were marked
with tape. In order to provide sufficient distance for acceleration and deceleration,
intervals of 2&#x02005;m were added before the start and after the end marks. The subjects were
instructed to walk as usual at a comfortable speed. The 10-m walking time was measured with
a stopwatch for the period from the moment the subject&#x02019;s feet passed the starting line to
the moment they crossed the finish line. The subjects practiced once, and all measurements
were made 3 times, using the average value of the 3 measurements in the analysis. . For the
10MWT, the test-retest and inter-rater reliability have been reported to be 0.95 and 0.90,
respectively; both of these values are very high<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) ver. 18.0 was used for data
analysis. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze the general characteristics of the
subjects. In order to examine the effects of the intervention in each group, a paired t test
was conducted. In order to investigate differences between the groups, an independent t test
was performed. For all data, the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> level was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The demographic characteristics of the participants are shown in the <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group<break/>(n = 16)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group<break/>(n = 16)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12/4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13/3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.2 &#x000b1; 6.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.7 &#x000b1; 6.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165.0 &#x000b1; 7.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">169.0 &#x000b1; 6.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.5 &#x000b1; 10.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.8 &#x000b1; 10.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lesion side (right/left)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10/6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMSE (score)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.10 &#x000b1; 1.74</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.80 &#x000b1; 2.12</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD.

abilities of chronic stroke patients. The results demonstrated that the stationary cycling
exercise supplemented with conventional therapy led to better balance and gait abilities
than the conventional therapy alone.</p><p>First, the stationary cycling training was found to have a positive effect on dynamic
balance as measured by using the TUG test. The results are similar to those obtained in a
previous study by Kim et al., who compared ergometer bicycle training with treadmill walking
training in stroke patients and reported significant improvement in TUG test scores in both
groups, although the differences between the groups were not significant<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. This suggests that the effectiveness of
cycling training in improving locomotor function is similar to the effectiveness of
treadmill exercise in stroke patients. Preliminary evidence suggests that cycling training
programs reduce musculoskeletal impairment after stroke. In terms of muscle strength,
cycling exercise enabled patients to bear more weight on the affected leg. A study by Kuo
and Zajak suggested that the muscles that may be particularly important for this purpose are
the hamstrings, rectus femoris, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior. These were all
activated during the cycling task, which requires reciprocal flexion and extension movements
of the hip, knee, and ankle<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is
interesting that Lustosa et al. reported a significant correlation between muscle strength
and improvement in TUG test score. Therefore, we assumed that in this study the mechanism of
TUG test score improvement in stroke patients was muscle strengthening<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Second, cycling exercise improved gait abilities in chronic stroke patients. This result is
similar to those of previous studies. Repetitive bilateral training and treadmill walking
with or without suspension have a positive effect on walking ability<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Repetitive practice is known to be important for motor
learning, as the repetitions enable the system to coordinate muscle synergies<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cycling and walking share similar locomotor
patterns of repetitive reciprocal flexion and extension movements. Hence, stationary cycling
exercise, which employs reciprocal movement of the lower limbs and requires coordination of
corresponding muscles, effectively increased the gait ability.</p><p>Cycling training stimulates motor regions in the central nervous system and activates the
cerebral cortex which eventually improves motor learning and balance. This effect certainly
applies to chronic stroke patients. Based on the results, stationary cycling training can be
effective in rehabilitation of stroke patients with gait and dynamic balance deficits.</p><p>This study has the following limitations that we plan to address in future studies,
including the small sample size and relatively short intervention duration. Further
large-scale, long-term controlled clinical studies are required to verify the clinical
benefits of stationary cycling exercise training.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Wade</surname><given-names>DT</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Measurement in neurological
