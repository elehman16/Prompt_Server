After surgery, areola problems such as skin and fat necrosis, hypertrophic scarring, sensory loss, deformation, retraction, and malposition, as well as severe complications such as infection and hematoma requiring reoperation can be observed.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The incidence rate of such complications varies between 10% and 30%.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup></p><p>Bleeding at the surgical site contributes to an increase in these complications. The primary aims in surgery are to enable surgical visibility with minimal bleeding and to minimize the duration of surgery. In recent years, a controlled hypotensive anesthesia method has often been preferred in various surgical procedures where excessive bleeding is expected and visibility is limited in order to enhance surgical visibility and reduce microtrauma related to reduction in surgical manipulation, as well as surgical bleeding associated with the volume of resected tissue.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> The beneficial effects of controlled hypotension on the volume of intraoperative blood loss have been described in general surgery, neurosurgery, and orthopedic surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> There are a limited number of studies in the literature regarding the use of the controlled hypotension method in breast reduction operations where excessive bleeding is expected (mean 700 to 800&#x0200a;mL).<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p><p>For controlled hypotension, inhalational or intravenous anesthetics are used, with esmolol, a short-acting &#x003b2;1 adrenoreceptor antagonist, being an adjuvant drug of choice in recent years. Esmolol has been suggested to be more reliable and effective because it does not lead to reflex tachycardia and causes less intraoperative hemorrhaging.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> In the literature, propofol anesthesia has been shown to be more effective than isoflurane or sevoflurane anesthesia in terms of its effects on surgical bleeding, the operation site, and the duration of operation.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p><p>The primary aim of our this study was to compare the effects of 2 diverse anesthesia methods, namely propofol/remifentanil (PR) and sevoflurane/remifentanil (SR) anesthesia of esmolol-induced controlled hypotension on the surgical visibility, surgical bleeding, and duration of operation in breast reduction surgery.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was started after obtaining Local Ethics Committee approval No. 2012/187 from Karadeniz Technical University Faculty of Medicine and the written consent of patients. The study was performed on a total of 50 patients in the American Society of Anesthesiologists I&#x02013;II risk group, who had various social, functional, and cosmetic complaints were aged between 18 and 65 and planned to undergo a breast reduction operation. The study power was determined at 85.6% to 90%. The study was conducted between 2 groups who were randomized into PR (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25) and SR (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25) groups using the sealed envelope method and then underwent breast reduction operation in the plastic reconstructive surgery room. The intraoperative surgery period was divided into 3 periods; incision (I), hemostasis (H), and closure (C). Incision period was used for deepithelialization of the skin, the hemostasis period for operative area hemostasis, and the closure period for wound closure and creation of the areolar complex.</p><p>Patients with anticoagulant drug use, bleeding diathesis history, uncontrolled systemic diseases (eg, diabetes mellitus, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), resting blood pressure values of systolic &#x0003e;140&#x0200a;mm&#x0200a;Hg or diastolic &#x0003e;90&#x0200a;mm&#x0200a;Hg, coronary insufficiency (myocardial infarction), neurological deficits, peripheral vascular disease, renal and liver disease history, morbid obesity, chronic drug use, or drug allergy history were excluded. The data obtained were recorded by an anesthesiologist outside the team and interpreted after surgery by the team.</p><p>For the routine monitoring of patients in the surgery room electrocardiography, heart rate (HR), noninvasive blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) (Spacelabs Medical, WA), bispectral index (BIS; Aspect Medical Systems, Inc. Newton, MA), and neuromuscular monitoring (train-of-four [TOF] method; TOF-Watch SX, Dublin, Ireland) were assessed. The HR, mean arterial pressure (MAP), SpO<sub>2</sub>, BIS score, and EtCO<sub>2</sub> values of patients were recorded every 5 minutes before and after the surgical incision, at the end of the operation and after extubation; the total duration of anesthesia and duration of operation including incision, hemostasis, closure, and total values were also recorded.</p><p>A vascular line was prepared for anesthesia induction and saline crystalloid solution replacement. Within 30 minutes before the surgery, 5&#x0200a;mL/kg/h 0.9% NaCl was administered followed by premedication with 0.03&#x0200a;mg/kg midazolam IM (1 hour prior to surgery). Following a 0.5&#x0200a;mg/kg loading dose of esmolol IV to both groups 1 minute prior to induction, a 0.1 to 0.3&#x0200a;mg/kg/min esmolol infusion was administered so that the MAP would be between 50 and 65&#x0200a;mm&#x0200a;Hg after induction. Hypotensive anesthesia was administered as a standard in both groups during the incision period, and the esmolol infusion was stopped during the hemostasis and scar closure stages. After 3 minutes of preoxygenation, 1&#x0200a;mg/kg lidocaine was administered 60&#x0200a;seconds before propofol injection to prevent pain due to injection. Anesthesia induction was performed with 2 to 3&#x0200a;mg/kg propofol, 1&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl, and 0.6&#x0200a;mg/kg rocuronium IV for muscle relaxation, and once the BIS score was reduced to below 60 and the TOF response disappeared, endotracheal intubation was performed. Patients were ventilated using mechanical ventilation at 6&#x0200a;mL/kg tidal volume, 10 to 12&#x0200a;breaths/min, and 32 to 35&#x0200a;mm&#x0200a;Hg EtCO<sub>2</sub>. After induction, both groups received a total gas flow of 4&#x0200a;L/min, a 1:1 O<sub>2</sub>/air rate, and continuous 0.2&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg/min remifentanil for the maintenance of anesthesia, keeping the BIS between 40 and 60. Group SR received 1% to 3% sevoflurane, whereas group PR received 100 to 200&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg/min propofol infusion maintenance of anesthesia. In the case when the MAP and HR were 20% above the baseline despite having reached the higher value of the esmolol infusion rate (0.3&#x0200a;mg/kg/min), 10 to 20&#x0200a;mg esmolol were administered every 5 to 10 minutes over the course of 1 minute. When the BIS was &#x0003e;60 without hypertension or tachycardia, 0.5 to 1&#x0200a;mg/kg bolus propofol was administered in group PR, and sevoflurane concentration was titrated in 1% increments up to a maximum of 3%. An HR below 45&#x0200a;beats/min was considered as bradycardia, and 0.5&#x0200a;mg atropin IV were administered at repeated doses (maximum 3&#x0200a;mg) if not sufficient then the esmolol infusion was reduced in doses of 0.1&#x0200a;mg/kg/min. A MAP below 50&#x0200a;mm&#x0200a;Hg was considered hypotension; in that case, 1st, the dose of the hypotensive agent was reduced if there was no improvement after 5 minutes, then a bolus of 10&#x0200a;mg ephedrine was administered IV. This bolus was repeated twice if the MAP did not remain &#x0003e;50&#x0200a;mm&#x0200a;Hg for 5&#x0200a;minutes. If this goal was not reached, the hypotension was considered as refractory, and we administered positive inotropic agents. These cases were excluded from the study. All the possible complications were recorded.</p><p>When the TOF was 25% at the end of the operation, neuromuscular block was recovered with 0.05&#x0200a;mg/kg neostigmin and 0.02&#x0200a;mg/kg atropine, and patients with sufficient spontaneous respiration (TOF above 75% and a BIS score &#x0003e;80) were extubated. After extubation, all patients were transferred to the postanesthetic care unit and observed for possible early complications for an hour. At the end of this observation, patients with a modified Aldrete score of over 9 were sent to their rooms.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup></p><p>The total volume of intraoperative bleeding was measured by using a suction canister and weighing gauzes.

The aim is to enable surgical visibility with minimal bleeding and thus decrease the complications. Surgical bleeding is affected by regional capillary circulation, as well as arterial and venous pressure.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the controlled hypotensive anesthesia method is preferred in order to decrease bleeding and improve surgical visibility in breast reduction surgeries where a large amount of resected tissue and excessive bleeding are expected.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> There are many methods and techniques in the literature used for controlled hypotensive anesthesia.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Boezaart et al<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> observed that esmolol provided optimal surgical conditions when controlled hypotension was performed with esmolol and sodium nitroprusside under inhalation anesthesia in functional endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). In the study in which Srivastava et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> compared esmolol with nitroglycerine, esmolol was found to enable optimal surgical conditions, reduce intraoperative bleeding, and cause less tachycardia throughout the operation. In our study, we also chose to use esmolol, a &#x003b2;1 adrenoceptor antagonist, in order to provide controlled hypotension, due to its rapid release, short half-life, and not causing tachycardia or rebound hypertension, as well as its easy titration capability.</p><p>The use of inhalation anesthetics alone is not recommended for controlled hypotension because of their respective adverse effects. Therefore, inhalation agents have to be used with adjuvant agents.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Superiority between hypotensive anesthesia with inhalation agents is questionable in the literature.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Therefore in our study we preferred sevoflurane, which is frequently used in our clinic.</p><p>Anesthetics agents can affect the amount of blood loss through various pharmacological effects on the degree of vasodilatation and HR.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Both propofol and inhalation agents have a dose-dependent vasodilatory effect.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> When compared to isoflurane, an inhalation agent, sevoflurane generally does not change the HR whereas propofol inhibits the baroreflex and thus leads to bradycardia, and propofol suppresses more cardiac output than sevoflurane.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>In a study by Ahn et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> HR was significantly lower in the PR group compared to the SR group, whereas there was no difference between MAP values in patients who had no cardiovascular disease but received controlled hypotension during ESS. The researchers also observed a lower amount of intraoperative blood loss in the PR group, which had lower intraoperative HR. Nair et al<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> evaluated the effect of beta-blocker premedication on the surgical field during ESS. They found that surgical bleeding scores were correlated with HR, but not with MAP. A low HR leads to the overfilling of veins and decreased venous leakage at the surgical site. In addition to bradycardia resulting from propofol-inhibited baroreflex, it is thought that an opioid such as remifentanil, which is used in infusion constantly, might also increase such an effect. In our study, the consumption of infused remifentanil was the same in both groups, whereas HR was significantly lower in the PR group, including the I and H periods compared to the SR group. MAP changes were not statistically significant in either groups.</p><p>A limited number of studies in the literature have reported the use of controlled hypotension in breast reduction surgeries where the risk of blood loss and the possibility of transfusion are high.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>In a study evaluating hemodynamic changes and surgical ischemia with a sodium nitroprusside infusion in hypertrophic breast removal surgery, Vazeery et al<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> observed that the hypotensive group did not need a transfusion. Kop et al<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> compared normotension with controlled hypotension in breast reduction surgery. They found a positive correlation between blood pressure and the amount of blood loss. They reported that blood loss was reduced by more than 50% with controlled hypotension in the incisional surgery period. This reduction was achieved with a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 20% to 25%. In addition, the amount of blood received through drains during the postoperative period was found to be significantly lower in the hypotensive group in the same study. In our study, there was a 35% to 40% reduction in MAP in the surgical incision period in both groups. We also saw a significant decrease in the amount of both the intraoperative blood loss and the blood received through drains postoperative in the PR group as compared to the SR group, under hypotensive anesthesia enabled with esmolol. We believe that the reason for the reduction in intraoperative and postoperative bleeding during surgical incision in the PR group was due to a significant decrease in the HR.</p><p>Scar-site hematoma incidence following breast reduction is 0.3% to 2.6%.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> In the literature, the overall breast reduction complication rate has been reported to be higher, especially in those with resected breast tissue of more than 1000&#x0200a;g.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Among these, in the study in which Hussien et al<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> examined the effects of intraoperative hypotension on the development of scar-site hematoma following breast reduction, the total amount of resected breast tissue was higher than 1000&#x0200a;g (1215.4 vs 1104.0&#x0200a;g), despite not being statistically significant, in the group with hematoma development during the postoperative period (6). In our study, although the total amounts of resected breast tissue were much higher (2187.04 vs 1939.8&#x0200a;g), no hematoma was observed in the postoperative period. In the same study mentioned above, hypotension in the intraoperative hemostasis period was associated with the development of scar hematoma in postoperative period. In our study, hypotensive anesthesia was as not performed during the intraoperative hemostasis period nor the following closure period and no complication related to bleeding such as scar hematoma was observed in the postoperative period. The more breast tissue removed correlated more intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. We believe that hypotension during intraoperative hemostasis may increase the risk of hematoma development due to changes in blood pressure in the postoperative period.</p><p>Breast reduction surgery requires careful evaluation in terms of operation duration for the anesthesiologist, the surgeon, and the patient, as well as the possibility of blood transfusion. In this surgery, intraoperative blood loss and the possibility of transfusion can be reduced and a comfortable surgical site can be provided thanks to the controlled hypotensive anesthesia method. The early discharge of patients could in turn contribute to a reduction in hospital costs.</p><p>One of our study's limitations was the failure to calculate the rate of reaching hypotension and the percent decrease in blood pressure. Also, continuous invasive hemodynamic monitoring is recommended in hypotensive anesthesia to monitor beat to beat variation in blood pressure. Limitation of our study is measured intermittently of MAP. Another limitation, because there was no device in our clinic, was that target-controlled infusion was not used to deliver the anesthetic agents. We believe advanced studies are required to examine the effects of controlled hypotension on breast reduction surgery.</p><p>In conclusion, the PR anesthesia technique of esmolol-induced controlled hypotension reduces the duration of incisional surgery, improves surgical visibility, and decreases the amount of intraoperative and postoperative blood loss reliably and effectively compared to the SR anesthesia technique.</p><p>Therefore, we recommended the PR anesthesia technique of esmolol-induced controlled hypotension due to the reduced duration of incisional surgery, improvised surgical visibility, and effectively lost blood.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BIS = bispectral index, ESS = endoscopic sinus surgery, EtCO<sub>2</sub> = end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, Hb = hemoglobin, HR = heart rate, MAP = mean arterial pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub> = peripheral oxygen saturation, TOF = train-of-four.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kop</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name><name><surname>Spauwen</surname><given-names>PH</given-names></name><name><surname>Kouwenberg</surname><given-names>PP</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
