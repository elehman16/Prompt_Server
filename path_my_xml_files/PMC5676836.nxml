In addition to the impairments typically associated with ASD, several studies have estimated that around half of children and adolescents also meet the diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder (reviews by Kerns and Kendall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2012</xref>; Simonoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2008</xref>). Moreover, reported prevalence rates are considerably higher than in typically developing children (Kerns and Kendall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2012</xref>) and in children with specific learning disabilities (Gillott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>). In school settings teachers have also reported that anxiety-related issues are among the most common presenting problems for young people with ASD (Waddington and Reed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2006</xref>). Further research has found that these difficulties impact on social functioning and academic performance (Bellini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>; Reaven et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2009</xref>; Sze and Wood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2007</xref>). For example, Sukhodolsky et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2008</xref>) found significant positive associations between negative social experiences in school and anxious affect in children with ASD. Researchers have suggested that the relationship between anxiety and social difficulties in school is bi-directional; the presence of anxiety contributes to, as well as results from, the challenges experienced by many children and adolescents with ASD (review by White et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Given the prevalence and impact of anxiety in young people with ASD, treatment approaches for this population have received increased empirical attention. One treatment option for young people with ASD is cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT; Beck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1979</xref>). A fundamental principle of CBT is to address the behavioural manifestations of anxiety, as well as the underlying negative cognition often associated with anxious affect (Rotheram-Fuller and MacMullen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2011</xref>). It is proposed to provide individuals with an opportunity to learn skills to challenge dysfunctional beliefs and replace them with more adaptive and positive thinking (Beck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">1993</xref>). CBT continues to be a primary treatment recommendation for anxiety disorders (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, NICE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>). Several recent reviews have highlighted its efficacy (compared to wait-list controls) for the treatment of anxiety in typically developing children and adolescents (e.g., James et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>) and those diagnosed with ASD (Kreslins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>; Sukhodolsky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">In addition to assessing the effect of CBT on anxiety symptoms, further research has explored its broader impact on attention and behaviour. Several frameworks suggest that increased anxiety is associated with poor attentional control and selective attention or hypervigilance for the detection of environmental threat (review by Richards et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>). Recent studies have found that CBT can have a positive impact on the reduction of threat biases and poor attentional control typically associated with anxious affect (Hadwin and Richards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>; Malowsky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2010</xref>; Reinholdt-Dunne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). Consistently, further findings show that asking individuals to suppress negative reactions to aversive stimuli led to increased activity in brain regions associated with attentional control and less activation in those linked to negative affect (Ochsner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2002</xref>). Further evidence indicates that CBT can lead to reduced anxiety and fewer negative thoughts in typically developing young people (Waters et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2008</xref>) and those diagnosed with ASD (Chalfant et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2007</xref>; Sofronoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2005</xref>). With respect to changes in behaviour more broadly, Storch et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2013</xref>) reported reductions in anxiety following CBT, in addition to improved parent-reported social functioning.</p><p id="Par5">While emerging findings have been encouraging, there are still relatively few studies that have assessed the effectiveness of CBT for young people with ASD and these have typically been explored in clinic-based settings. Given that children and adolescents with ASD can show difficulty in generalising learned skills to new contexts (Bellini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>), it is important to consider whether schools might be an effective context for the delivery of CBT interventions. The use of school-based CBT for anxiety in typically developing children is well supported (for a review see Neil and Christensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2009</xref>) and researchers have suggested methods for adapting school-based interventions for use with pupils with ASD (Rotheram-Fuller and MacMullen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2011</xref>). This agenda has become increasingly significant in the context of an increased focus in the UK over the last two decades towards inclusive education, where schools are expected to educate all pupils within a mainstream setting and to &#x0201c;actively seek to remove the barriers to learning and participation that can hinder or exclude pupils with special educational needs (Department for Education <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2001</xref>, p. 5).&#x0201d; While this initiative allows all students to receive support to meet their potential in a conventional school environment, research has shown that pupils with ASD can find inclusion anxiety-provoking, particularly at secondary level (Browning et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>; Humphrey and Lewis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>), highlighting the need to develop initiatives within schools to support inclusion.</p><p id="Par6">The current study used a randomised control trial (RCT) to measure the effectiveness of a school-based CBT intervention (versus a wait-list control) on the reduction of anxiety symptoms (including social worries) in adolescents diagnosed with ASD. In addition, it aimed to provide preliminary evidence to explore the broader impact of a CBT intervention on social responsiveness, as well as attentional control and attention to threat. It was anticipated that pupils in the intervention group would experience a significantly greater reduction in anxiety in comparison to the wait-list control group, who attended mainstream school as usual. We used multiple informants (teachers, parents and self-reported) to provide an accurate and robust picture for anxiety change (see Kasari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>). In addition, we anticipated that the intervention would have broader benefits with respect to increased social responsiveness and increased attentional control (i.e., lowered levels of distraction and reduced attention to threat).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par7">The participants included 35 pupils from four mainstream secondary schools located in the south-east of England (<italic>Mean age</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13.2, <italic>SD</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.1, range 11.10&#x02013;15.80; 31 boys).

To address variance in the time since diagnosis (range 6&#x000a0;months to 13&#x000a0;years), the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ; Rutter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">b</xref>) was used to confirm that pupils met the criteria for ASD. Participants were also required to have a verbal and total IQ score of &#x02265;70 and to be currently experiencing clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, as measured by elevated scores for either teacher reported school anxiety (score&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;17; Lyneham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2008</xref>) or parent reported anxiety (score&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;24 on the Spence Children&#x02019;s Anxiety Scale; Spence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1998</xref>).

This measure assesses an individual&#x02019;s ability to focus attention to identify whether a centrally presented arrow is pointing left or right and ignore flanker arrow heads. Flankers are either consistent with (congruent condition) the direction of the central arrow, pointing in the opposite direction (incongruent condition) or have no relationship to the central stimuli (neutral condition; see Rueda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2004</xref>). In the current task, each display appeared immediately after a (500&#x000a0;ms) fixation cross, and remained on screen until either the participant made a response or 1500&#x000a0;ms passed. All participants completed 12 practice trials before performing 3 blocks of test trials, each consisting of 48 individual trials and with 16 trials of each type (congruent, incongruent and neutral) presented in a random order. The overall task took around 10&#x000a0;min for each child. No feedback was provided for correct or incorrect answers. On each trial, accuracy and response time was recorded. Preliminary analyses looked at reaction times (RTs) for each trial type; however, the focus of the analysis for this task was a conflict score, calculated by subtracting the mean RT of the congruent items from the mean RT of the incongruent items. Higher scores are indicative of greater distractor interference or distractibility (Rueda et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Attention to Threat</title><p id="Par15">In order to explore attention to threat, an emotional stroop colour matching schematic face task was used (see Hadwin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>). Angry, happy, fear and neutral face schematic face stimuli were employed, with each face being made up of a pair of eyes, eyebrows and a mouth. The face outline was red, blue, green or yellow. The presentation screen was black. Participants saw 24 trials for each emotion; 12 emotion faces and 12 inverted face control trials, making a total of 72 randomly presented trials. Inverted faces were used to ensure that responding reflects interference of emotional stimuli and not face parts. Upright and inverted face stimuli were presented individually and in the same position on the screen, remaining on screen until either the participant made a response or 1500&#x000a0;ms passed. Participants were asked to match the outline colour of a picture on the screen to the coloured buttons as quickly and accurately as possible. The responses were made using a response box that included red, blue, green and yellow buttons positioned in a fixed order from left to right. On each trial, accuracy and response time was recorded. To address task validity, preliminary analyses looked at reaction times (RTs) for each trial type. Attentional bias scores were calculated by subtracting individual mean RT values for colour matching in neutral faces from matching angry, happy and fear faces. Positive scores indicate increased interference to colour matching for emotion versus neutral faces and negative scores facilitation and bias scores that tend to zero indicate that there was no difference between colour matching between faces.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>CBT Intervention</title><p id="Par16">We used the &#x02018;Exploring Feelings&#x02019; manualized CBT intervention created by Attwood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>). This 6-week programme uses developmentally appropriate language and materials designed for use with pupils with ASD. Each of the six sessions lasted for 90&#x000a0;min and in the current study was led by the same researcher in all four settings. The intervention delivery was supported by a teaching assistant (TA) in each school, who participated in the sessions and retained regular contact with the pupils outside of the sessions. This approach enabled the TA to reinforce strategies learned within CBT sessions across the school day, and to remind and encourage the pupils to use learned strategies when they were experiencing elevated anxiety. This delivery model is unique in its active targeting of generalisation skills outside of the CBT session, in a naturalistic environment.</p><p id="Par17">At the end of each session, a home project was explained to participants and discussed at the start of the next session. Worksheets for the sessions were taken home on completion of the intervention.

In the first stage of recruitment, the researcher approached all secondary schools located within one district in the south of England (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9) and provided information regarding the study. Four schools indicated interest in participating, and were asked to identify all pupils attending the schools with an ASD diagnosis. Forty-nine adolescents with ASD were identified by school personnel and the study information was sent home for parents to consider. Following informed written consent from 47 parents, they completed the questionnaires related to social communication, social responsiveness and anxiety. Educational records were checked to confirm formal ASD diagnosis. Parents of adolescents who did not meet the inclusion criteria to take part in the study were informed directly by the researcher (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12).</p><p id="Par19">Form tutors who spend extended time with the pupils each day and receive feedback from staff regarding the pupils&#x02019; performance and well-being were asked to complete the social responsiveness scale, school anxiety and social worries questionnaires. The same teacher completed these measures at all three time points. The researcher then met individually with pupils to administer the WASI, the attention tasks, and the anxiety and social worries questionnaires. Informed assent was received from all adolescent participants prior to completing the pre-measures.</p><p id="Par20">Following completion of the pre-intervention measures, a total of 35 participants were available for the study.

Participants assigned to the wait-list control group were given the opportunity to receive the intervention as delivered by schools after the study was completed.

The aim of the current study was to extend this evidence base to investigate if CBT is an effective intervention to reduce symptoms of anxiety and social worry in a community derived sample of adolescents with ASD when delivered within a school setting. The use of a community sample allowed us to highlight that some adolescents attending mainstream school experience anxious affect (as reported via parents or teachers), and that identification of elevated anxiety symptoms had either gone unnoticed or untreated. Following a CBT intervention adolescents with ASD (versus a wait-list control group) showed greater reductions in anxiety symptoms, school anxiety and social worry, as reported by parents, teachers and young people themselves, and these results were maintained at a 6&#x000a0;week follow-up. In addition, teachers reported marginally increased social responsiveness for young people in the intervention group, which was most evident 6&#x000a0;weeks post-intervention. The impact of the intervention on attentional control and attention to threat was less clear; considering attention bias to threat, both groups showed reduced interference of threat stimuli to achieve task goals. In addition, the intervention group showed less distractibility overall, and although this difference was most marked post intervention and at follow up; this group difference was not sensitive to time.</p><p id="Par38">The results of the current study support previous findings to show that CBT is an effective intervention for reducing symptoms of anxiety and social worry in a community sample of adolescents diagnosed with ASD, and where positive effects were maintained 6&#x000a0;weeks following the intervention. These improvements support the use of the Exploring Feelings intervention (Attwood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>) in school settings and are consistent with the findings of previous studies in young people with ASD (e.g., McNally et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>; Reaven et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2012</xref>; review by Kreslins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>). The intervention used in the current study was designed specifically for use with young people with ASD and the current results support recent modifications in the development of CBT interventions for this population, in terms of delivery and content (review by Moree and Davis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>). Specifically, the intervention uses a coping model rather than a curative model (Beebe and Risi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2003</xref>) and a more directive teaching approach (Anderson and Morris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par39">Previous findings suggest that for school-based interventions to be effective in terms of generalization and maintenance of effects, there is a need for teachers to incorporate strategies that promote these qualities (e.g., teaching new skills in natural settings and using everyday consequences to reinforce new behaviours; Machalicek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2008</xref>). The generalization of target skills may require additional training for the teaching staff and parents. In the current study, front-line school staff were directly involved in the intervention delivery and followed the guidance given by the intervention facilitators to encourage adolescents to use taught skills across the school day. In addition, the intervention included homework tasks that also served to engage parents in the reinforcement of new skills. Reviews of CBT indicate that parent involvement in the delivery of interventions is as effective as individual or group based interventions (James et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>). The inclusion of parents and teachers in the current study is reflected in the positive results across different sources; from adolescent self-report, as well as parents and teachers (see Chalfant et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2007</xref>, for similar findings). It suggests that skills taught within the CBT sessions resulted in symptom change that was evident across different contexts.</p><p id="Par40">Consistent with previous research, the findings also showed that the intervention had a small positive effect on social skills more broadly, as reported by teachers (Storch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2013</xref>; Sukhodolsky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2008</xref>). Although the social responsiveness scale has previously been used to identify characteristics of ASD (rather than as an outcome measure), there is emerging evidence that it is a measure that is sensitive to change following treatment for individuals with ASD (Lopata et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2010</xref>; White et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2013</xref>). Previous research has, however, shown that young people with ASD can show difficulty in generalising taught social skills to contexts outside of the teaching environment (Bellini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>; White et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2007</xref>). These findings fit with the current study, which found that parents did not report change in social responsiveness following the intervention. There is a need for future research to systematically explore the impact of practice opportunities within the intervention environment and across different contexts to understand their importance in effecting and maintaining positive change for young people with ASD.</p><p id="Par41">Previous research has shown that anxiety in children and adolescents is associated with poor attentional control and an attention bias to threat (review by Dudeney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2015</xref>) and that this selective attention to threat is reduced following a CBT intervention (i.e., reduced attention to threat stimuli in the pursuit of task goals; Hadwin and Richards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>; Reinholdt-Dunne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). The current study also found that (parent-reported) anxiety was associated with increased interference of threat stimuli in an emotional stroop task and it supports the proposition that anxiety related threat biases are a feature of anxiety in adolescents with ASD. The current study however did not find links the CBT intervention with improvements in attentional control or a reduced bias to threat. The results showed that both groups showed increased resistance to distraction post-intervention and at follow-up; this was greater in the intervention group but this difference was not significantly associated with time. This result, if replicated with a larger sample size to demonstrate group differences over time, would fit well with a growing literature that has highlighted a bidirectional relationship between attentional processing and the regulation of anxious affect (e.g., Bishop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>). In addition, it supports the proposition that re-appraisal can facilitate the regulation of negative affect, allowing individuals to meet task goals (Ochsner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2002</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Limitations and Future Directions</title><p id="Par42">The current study represents a novel exploration to highlight the effectiveness of CBT in a community sample of adolescents in a school setting. It extends previous research to deliver the intervention in a context that was more familiar to adolescents and that showed beneficial effects on generalisation across contexts and functioning. The findings have implications for professionals working with children and adolescents with ASD with elevated anxiety to provide some guidance in contexts where interventions can be implemented to effect positive change. There are however several limitations linked to the current study. Firstly, the researchers did not formally measure treatment integrity. In addition, there was no active control group to explore whether CBT was more effective than other interventions and to control for time spent in the intervention. Moreover, researchers and raters were not blinded to condition allocation at post-intervention or follow-up, leading to potential over-reporting of change and active control groups can help to meet this difficulty. Finally, longer-term follow-up assessment of outcomes would yield useful information towards determining the durability of findings. Future research should consider exploring the efficacy and feasibility of a school-based intervention that aims to both reduce anxiety and increase social competency and attentional control. Moreover, larger sample sizes will allow greater consider of what mechanisms are important in understanding change.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par25">Please note that because of the exploratory nature of secondary outcomes, we have not corrected for multiple comparisons in this table.</p></fn><fn id="Fn2"><label>2</label><p id="Par27">Further analyses controlling for T1 anxiety scores in both analyses support this pattern of results, showing a main effect of group and indicating fewer anxiety symptoms for the intervention compared with the control group (all other effects were not significant).</p></fn><fn id="Fn3"><label>3</label><p id="Par30">Analyses controlling for T1 group differences in school anxiety scores showed a significant main effect of group, highlighting more anxiety symptoms at T1 and T3 in the control group compared with the intervention group.</p></fn><fn><p>This work was submitted as part of Sarah Luxford&#x02019;s (previously Sarah Fossey&#x02019;s) Doctorate in Educational Psychology dissertation.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Author Contributions</title><p id="Par450">This research formed the basis of SL's Doctorate in Educational Psychology.
