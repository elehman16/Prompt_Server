All ivermectin and 97%&#x02013;100% of moxidectin treated participants had Mazzotti reactions. Statistically significantly higher percentages of participants treated with 8 mg moxidectin than participants treated with ivermectin experienced pruritus (87% vs. 56%), rash (63% vs. 42%), increased pulse rate (61% vs. 36%) and decreased mean arterial pressure upon 2 minutes standing still after &#x02265;5 minutes supine relative to pre-treatment (61% vs. 27%). These reactions resolved without treatment. In the 8 mg moxidectin and ivermectin arms, the mean&#x000b1;SD number of microfilariae/mg skin were 22.9&#x000b1;21.1 and 21.2&#x000b1;16.4 pre-treatment and 0.0&#x000b1;0.0 and 1.1&#x000b1;4.2 at nadir reached 1 and 3 months after treatment, respectively.

Control of onchocerciasis as a public health problem and possibly even elimination of onchocerciasis infection relies on annual community-directed mass treatment with ivermectin. Given concerns about possible emergence of ivermectin resistance of the parasite <italic>Onchocerca volvulus</italic> and elimination of infection in areas where very high numbers of vectors can result in continued parasite transmission even when only few parasites are present in only a few people, research for drugs with higher effect on the parasite remains important. A series of non-clinical and clinical studies was planned to find out whether moxidectin, a veterinary anthelminthic, is sufficiently safe for mass treatment and has a better effect on the parasite than ivermectin. We report here results from the first study in infected people conducted to assess in small numbers of individuals the adverse reactions to the killing of parasites by moxidectin. A single dose of 8 mg moxidectin reduced skin parasite numbers better and for a longer time than ivermectin. The frequency and severity of adverse reactions was so low that a larger study to better characterize the adverse reactions to moxidectin and compare its efficacy with that of ivermectin was initiated.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Pfizer provided drug for this study as well as systems for analysis of the data.

It was not known whether the putative microfilaricidal activity of moxidectin would be associated with a combination of severe Mazzotti reactions (i.e. the complex, acute inflammatory response of the body to the effect of the drug on microfilariae), similar to those seen after diethylcarbamazine treatment which make diethylcarbamazine unsuitable for mass treatment <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Bryceson1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002953-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Consequently, the study was designed to determine in a small number of participants whether moxidectin induces severe reactions at a frequency suggesting that development of moxidectin should be discontinued. If that was not the case, the study was designed to determine the moxidectin dose(s) with an adverse reaction profile suitable for further clinical testing. Further clinical testing in a large number of participants would allow to better define moxidectin's safety profile and to quantify the difference in the effect of moxidectin and ivermectin on skin microfilariae levels.</p><p>The participant-safety driven design resulted in a study duration of &#x02265;1.5 years.

Consequently, as a sensitivity analysis, the analysis of the change in mean skin mf density in the e-mITT population as well as descriptive statistical analysis were conducted after exclusion of three ivermectin treated participants with inadequate response to the microfilaricidal effect of ivermectin. (ii) Review of the unblinded data further showed that the time after treatment at which the skin mf density reached the nadir and the time at which an increase in skin mf density started varied significantly, in particular among the ivermectin treated participants. This resulted in a substantial underestimate of the percentage of ivermectin treated subjects whose skin mf levels decreased below the level of detection in the planned &#x02018;by time point&#x02019; analyses. To characterize better the variability in the response to the drugs, the follow up time point at which the skin mf density reached the lowest measured value (nadir) and the follow up time point at which a sustained increase of the skin mf density started (determined as the time of the first of two successive skin mf densities above the nadir or month 18, if first value above the nadir was at month 18) was determined for each participant. Subsequently, the percentage of participants who reached the skin mf nadir and whose skin mf density started to increase was calculated for each follow up time point and treatment group. (iii) After finalization of the statistical analysis plan, the results of modelling of onchocerciasis elimination through annual mass treatment with a stochastic transmission model were published <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Duerr2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This model quantifies the effect of an anti-onchocercal drug as the average reduction from pre-treatment of the skin mf levels in the population in the year following the treatment.

High skin mf densities were observed in some participants with 0 or only 1 onchocercal nodule.

Pre-treatment skin mf densities of some participants with 0 or 1 excised onchocercal nodule were several times higher than those in some of the participants with &#x02265;3 excised onchocercal nodules.

This suggests that the macrofilariae accessible through nodulectomy represent only a fraction of those present in the body as well as considerable inter-individual variability in this fraction. Since assessment of macrofilariae was only a secondary objective, nodules and macrofilariae were assessed by only one parasitologist (SKA).

Since a single dose of 150 &#x000b5;g/kg ivermectin does not kill macrofilariae (see e.g. <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Duke3" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002953-Albiez2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>), this indicates a pre-treatment imbalance in the proportions of live and dead female macrofilariae between the ivermectin treatment group and the moxidectin treatment groups. Even if the excised macrofilariae were representative of all macrofilariae in the body, this imbalance makes conclusions about the relative effect of ivermectin and moxidectin on macrofilariae viability impossible. Consequently, the only conclusion on the effect of moxidectin on the macrofilariae the histology data support is that a single dose of 2 mg, 4 mg or 8 mg had neither sterilized all excised macrofilariae to month 18 nor killed all excised macrofilariae by 18 months follow up.

SSPH disappears rapidly after lying down <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Awadzi8" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and OCRC staff observations of participant behaviour following an SSPH episode show that it does not interfere with resumption of their normal daily activities. In OCRC studies, SSPH incidence among participants treated with 150 &#x000b5;g/kg ivermectin was variable and sometimes high (e.g. 11% <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Awadzi11" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> or 22% <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Awadzi12" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>). In contrast, SSPH incidence reported from large scale use of ivermectin is in most cases low or 0, even in hyperendemic areas, when higher than standard doses were used or when significant decreases in standing MAP were measured <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Awadzi8" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Awadzi13" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002953-DeSole1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. SSPH has furthermore not been an impediment to CDTI covering by now &#x0003e;75 million people <xref rid="pntd.0002953-African2" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. OCRC experience shows that SSPH occurs when study participants get up (e.g. as part of the procedure to assess postural hypotension or after a bed rest) and immediately or shortly thereafter have to stand still (e.g. during the OCRC procedure or while urinating). SSPH is not usually seen when participants get up and move around naturally. This link between SSPH and standing still could explain the discrepancies between the results in OCRC studies and reports from large scale use of ivermectin. Underreporting by the treated individuals during large scale use is another possible explanation consistent with the OCRC observations that the symptoms of SSPH (severe dizziness, weakness, faintness) are shortlived and do not interfer with resumption of normal activities. This could result in SSPH not being a &#x02018;memorable&#x02019; experience reported to the investigators. Consequently, the data to date do not suggest that a higher frequency of SSPH after moxidectin vs. ivermectin treatment, if shown to be statistically significant in the Phase 3 study (which used OCRC procedures), will be an impediment for evaluating moxidectin in community studies. These studies would allow to assess the potential significance of SSPH for mass treatment when appropriate advice is given to participants as in the early community studies of ivermectin <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Awadzi13" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.</p><p>Four participants treated with ivermectin did not show a decrease in skin mf levels meeting the criteria of adequate response to the microfilaricidal effect of ivermectin defined by Awadzi et al. <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Awadzi6" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Given that the participants were recruited from an area in Ghana without mass-treatment with ivermectin at the time of recruitment for this study, it is unlikely that this reflects drug pressure-induced selection of parasites with low susceptibility to ivermectin's microfilaricidal activity. It, thus, needs to be considered that the variability of the response of <italic>O. volvulus</italic> to the microfilaricidal activity is larger than had been observed by Awadzi et al. at the time they analysed their available data to derive criteria for adequate parasite response <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Awadzi6" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. A larger variability of the response of <italic>O. volvulus</italic> to the embryostatic effect of ivermectin than considered &#x02018;adequate&#x02019; in some studies <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Awadzi6" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002953-OseiAtweneboana2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> has been deduced from a meta-analysis of the data from a large number of clinical and field studies <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Coffeng1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, a single dose of 2 mg, 4 mg or 8 mg moxidectin resulted in a significantly lower skin mf density and higher proportion of participants with undetectable skin mf earlier and for a longer period of time than ivermectin. Detectable levels of skin mf 18 months after treatment in 83%, 73% and 65% of participants treated with 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg, respectively, show that a single dose of moxidectin did not prevent skin repopulation with mf in all participants and thus did not kill or sterilize (permanently or to month 18) all macrofilariae in all participants. The histology data do not allow further conclusions about the biological basis of the long term differences in skin mf densities between the treatment groups, because of the pre-treatment imbalance between treatment groups in the percentage of dead and/or dead and calcified female macrofilaria (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002953.s005">Table S5</xref>) and because the macrofilariae in the palpable onchocercal nodules were not representative of all macrofilariae in the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002953-g009">Figures 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002953-g010">10</xref>). This is not surprising given the small sample size, chosen based on safety considerations, and not in view of allowing conclusions on treatment differences in the effect on the macrofilariae.</p><p>Determining a sample size sufficient to conclude with a pre-specified power and significance level that the effect of two treatments differs by at least a pre-specified amount requires a good estimate of the effect size in the comparator arm and the variance in the efficacy parameter (see e.g. <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Noordzij1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Farrokhyar1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>). For macrofilariae, the comparator effect size may vary with the endemicity of the area and treatment history of the study area and participant. The effect size variance depends on biological and methodological factors which include: (i) inter-individual variability in the fraction of total nodules in the body which the excised nodules represent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002953-g009">Figure 9A</xref>), (ii) variability in the fraction of total worms of each category (female, male, live, dead, &#x02026;) which the excised worms represent and which is not necessarily the same as the fraction of total nodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002953-g009">Figure 9</xref>, Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002953.s005">Table S5</xref>), (iii) variability between the macrofilariae within each participant in the variable evaluated (e.g. age, reproductive activity <xref rid="pntd.0002953-SchulzKey1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>), (iv) method-specific factors such as for histology the extent to which the number of sections per nodule examined permits representative characterization of all worms in the nodule, quantitative vs. semiquantitative assessment, inter-observer variability (see e.g. <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Awadzi3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Bttner1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>) and (v) variability in macrofilariae exposure and susceptibility to the drug (e.g. macrofilariae age dependent, nodule location dependent). Analysis of the pooled raw data from different past studies may help quantitate some of these variabilities and provide the basis for calculating sample sizes for future studies. This may also help resolve the question of the extent to which cumulative doses of ivermectin affect macrofilariae reproductive capacity and viability. As pointed out for the reproductive capacity, this has significant implications for whether, where and how elimination of <italic>O. volvulus</italic> infection with ivermectin can be achieved <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>.</p><p>The pre-treatment imbalance in this study in the percentage of female macrofilariae assessed as dead and/or dead and calcified between the ivermectin and moxidectin treatment groups (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002953.s005">Table S5</xref>) shows the importance of stratification of study participants for randomization to treatment groups by number or at least proportion of dead and live macrofilariae in the palpable nodules (determined with a non-invasive method such as ultrasonography <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Mand1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>) to reduce the probability of false conclusions from post-treatment data.</p><p>Given the absence of data on the biological basis for the low skin mf levels 12&#x02013;18 months after moxidectin treatment, the relative value of moxidectin and ivermectin for reducing disease transmission will be considered without any assumptions about this basis. The transmission model developed by Duerr and coworkers <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Duerr2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002953-Duerr3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> includes examination of the effect of a drug which reduces skin mf density irrespective of the effect on the macrofilariae. It shows that mass-treatment with a skin mf reducing drug can lead to elimination by increasing the threshold biting rate (TBR), i.e. the annual biting rate (ABR, number of vectors taking a blood meal from one person/year) below which onchocerciasis cannot remain endemic. With increasing efficacy of the intervention, quantified as the annual average reduction (AAR) in skin mf density in the population, the TBR increases in a non-linear manner: in an area with a TBR without intervention of 700 bites per person per year, the model predicts a TBR of approximately 1200, 2000 and 5000 when the AAR is around 65%, 80% and 95%, respectively. The AAR after treatment with ivermectin and 8 mg moxidectin in this study were 88% and 98%, respectively. The AARs after treatment of communities would be different because of different distribution of pre-treatment skin mf densities and treatment coverage. However, and provided the relative superiority of 8 mg moxidectin over ivermectin is confirmed in the Phase 3 study, moxidectin would have a higher AAR than ivermectin suggesting that, according to this model, moxidectin could lead to elimination in areas with higher ABRs than ivermectin.</p><p>CDTI occurs at a time chosen by the community and is in many cases furthermore dependent on logistical conditions (e.g. availability of funds for activities the public health system needs to conduct to enable CDTI). This results in CDTI in areas with seasonal transmission not always happening within the time window optimal for achieving elimination, i.e. a time that results in the lowest skin mf levels in the population when the vector population is largest. The longer period of undetectable skin mf levels after moxidectin compared to ivermectin would reduce the negative impact of community treatment occurring outside the optimal time window on transmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002953.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
