The incidence rate of mild form of this clinical condition after <italic>in-vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) is 33% and for moderate and severe form, the incidence rate is 3-6% and 1-3%, respectively.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The corner stone of this syndrome is shifting of fluid from vessels into the intracellular space.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Although the underlying pathophysiology still unknown but vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through interaction with VEGF receptor-2, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 are suggested to be the mediators of vascular permeability.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Fluid therapy, thromboembolic prophylaxis, and ascites control are suggested as possible treatments. Yet, no definite treatment is available for this syndrome, and therefore therapy is supportive and conservative according to the severity of symptoms. Other suggested strategies are cycle cancelation, use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, coasting, and intravenous (IV) albumin.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] First introduced by Asch <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] many randomized clinical trials demonstrated the potential protective role of IV albumin in the prevention of OHSS.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, some studies suggest that human albumin (HA) does not decrease the incidence of OHSS[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and that due to possible side effects, HA in not recommended[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in OHSS prevention. Hydroxylethyl starch (HES), another colloid solution was also suggested as an alternative to HA in the prevention of OHSS. A recent study on 9 RCTs revealed that compared to albumin, HES demonstrated a significant decrease in the incidence of severe OHSS.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The effect of Cabergoline (Cb), a dopamine agonist which dephosphorylates VEGFR-2 and, therefore, inhibits the development of new vessels and vascular hyperpermeability was studied in a few studies. Alvarez <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that Cb reduces moderate OHSS in patients undergoing assisted reproduction.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Another randomized clinical trial comparing HA and Cb showed that low dose oral Cb decrease both incidence and severity of OHSS.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Up to now, no study was designed to evaluate the prophylactic effect of these three strategies at a time. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of IV HA, HES, and Cb in preventing OHSS in patients at severe risk of developing severe OHSS, who undergo IVF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>This study was designed as a randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy of the three different strategies Cb, HA, and HES in the prevention of OHSS following IVF. Ninety-one eligible patients referring to Al-Zahra hospital and Isfahan fertility center during July 2012-October 2013 for IVF were enrolled in the study by convenient sampling method. Inclusion criteria were being at high risk of developing OHSS, which was either one of the followings: Estradiol value &#x0003e;3000 pg/ml and/or more than 20 follicles on the day of HCG administration and/ or previous history of OHSS. Written consent was obtained from all the participants. Patients with any history of drug sensitivity or co-morbidity were excluded. The study was approved by Isfahan Ethical Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (project number: 392298).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Follicle stimulation protocol</title><p>All the patients went through a same stimulation protocol. The patients were given oral contraceptive for one cycle. On day 21<sup>st</sup> of menstrual cycle, GnRH-agonist was started with a daily dose of 1 mg subcutaneously and was continued for 10 days or until bleeding occurs followed by 0.5 mg daily SC until at least two follicles &#x02265;17 mm in diameter were detected in transvaginal ultrasound, human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) 150 IU daily was started on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of menstruation for 7-12 days until at least two follicles &#x02265;17 mm in diameter were detected in transvaginal ultrasound. Transvaginal ultrasound was conducted every 2 days from 5<sup>th</sup> day after HMG administration up to detection of favorable follicles mentioned above. After maturation of follicles was confirmed on ultrasonography, GnRH-agonist, and HMG was stopped and hCG, 5000 IU was administered Intramuscularly. Meanwhile, serum estradiol level was measured 5 days after HMG administration and on the day of hCG injection. Vaginal suppository of progesterone 400 &#x003bc;g daily is started after hCG administration. Patients considered high risk according to the criteria mentioned above were enrolled in the study. Thirty-six hours after administration of hCG, oocyte retrieval was performed through vaginal ultrasound-guided procedure. IVF was performed and fertilized embryos were then transferred into uterus.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Treatment</title><p>Ninety-one eligible patients were randomly assigned into three groups using random number table.

It varies from a cystic enlargement of ovaries in a mild form to life-threatening clinical condition in more severe forms, needing hospitalization, and prompt therapy. Many preventive strategies and suggested such as volume expanding through IV albumin and HES, and GNRH agonists such have be as Cb. The findings from this study suggest that administration of 1000 ml of HES 6% has a higher prophylactic effect compared to administration of IV HA and oral Cb and that administration of one dose HES 6% on the day of ovum pick up is related to a lower risk of developing severe OHSS in infertile patients going through IVF.</p><p>To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the risk of developing severe OHSS in the three different groups of patients receiving IV HA, Cb, and HES. Many other studies have previously compared the effect of HA, HES, and Cb with a control group or together with each other. K&#x000f6;nig <italic>et al</italic>. were the first to report a significant reduction in the development of moderate to severe OHSS after use of HES 6%. Of all 51 infertile patients who received a 6% HES solution, only one patient developed moderate OHSS and it significantly differed of that of placebo group with an incident rate of 14% for moderate to severe OHSS.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] These finding was in accord with our study that none of the patients in HES group had severe OHSS. Only two patients developed moderate OHSS in HES group, leading the incident rate of 6% for moderate OHSS. In another study, 16 patients with severe OHSS were hospitalized and received either albumin (10 patients) or HES (6 patients) as a colloid solution. The results revealed that 6% HES solution may be even more effective than HA in the treatment of severe OHSS.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, their sample size was small, and HES was used after OHSS was established, compared to our study in which HES was used as a prophylactic agent on the day of ovum pick up.</p><p>Compared to HES and Cb, the incident of severe OHSS was higher among patients who received HA. Also, the incident rate for a mild form of OHSS in patients receiving albumin was significantly higher than HES and Cb. Although some studies have shown the effect of albumin in reducing the incidence of severe OHSS,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] many recent studies have demonstrated that HA is not a proper intervention in preventing OHSS[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] due to side effects and the possibility of worsening OHSS.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Different strategies have been suggested for the administration of HES. In this study, we preferred to use the previously suggested dose of 1000 ml 6% HES solution. Gokmen <italic>et al</italic>. used a dose of 500 ml and reported to be as effective as the routine dose of 1000 ml.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The effect of Cb as a prophylactic therapy for OHSS was studied in several surveys;[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] however, no study compared the effect of Cb and HES. Our results showed that the incident of moderate to severe OHSS was significantly higher in those patients who received Cb than those who were administered HES (<italic>P</italic> = 0.031).</p><p>Our results reveal that by administrating 1000 of 6% HES on the day of oocyte retrieval, the incidence of OHSS will be minimized in patients at high risk of developing this clinical condition, compared to administration of Cb and HA.</p><p>Our study was the first one to compare the effect of these three strategies on a group of infertile women undergoing ART. Further studies with focusing on drug dosage and timing of administration are highly recommended.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec
