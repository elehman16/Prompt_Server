This study evaluated the LUMOback, an activity tracker that targets sitting time, as part of a cluster-randomized workplace sitting intervention in desk-based office workers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>Study objectives were to explore: (1) office workers&#x02019; self-directed LUMOback use, (2) individual-level characteristics associated with LUMOback use, (3) the impact of LUMOback use on activity and sitting behaviors, and (4) office workers&#x02019; perceived LUMOback acceptability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Exploratory analyses were conducted within the activity tracker intervention group (n=66) of a 2-arm cluster-randomized trial (n=153) with follow-up at 3 and 12 months. The intervention, delivered from within the workplace, consisted of organizational support strategies (eg, manager support, emails) to stand up, sit less, and move more, plus the provision of a LUMOback activity tracker. The LUMOback, worn belted around the waist, provides real-time sitting feedback through a mobile app. LUMOback usage data (n=62), Web-based questionnaires (n=33), activPAL-assessed sitting, prolonged (&#x02265;30 min bouts) and nonprolonged (&#x0003c;30 min bouts) sitting, standing and stepping time (7-day, 24 h/day protocol; n=40), and telephone interviews (n=27) were used to evaluate study aims. LUMOback usage data were downloaded and described. Associations between user characteristics and LUMOback usage (in the first 3 months) were analyzed using zero-inflated negative binomial models. Associations between LUMOback usage and 3-month activity outcomes were analyzed using mixed models, correcting for cluster. LUMOback acceptability was explored using 3-month questionnaire data and thematic analysis of telephone interviews (conducted 6 to 10 months post intervention commencement).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Tracker uptake was modest (43/61, 70%), and among users, usage over the first 3 months was low (1-48 days, median 8). Usage was greatest among team leaders and those with low self-perceived scores for job control and supervisor relationships. Greater tracker use (&#x02265;5 days vs &#x0003c;5 days) was significantly associated only with changes in prolonged unbroken sitting (&#x02212;50.7 min/16 h; 95% CI &#x02212;94.0 to &#x02212;7.3; <italic>P</italic>=.02) during all waking hours, and changes in nonprolonged sitting (+32.5 min/10 h; 95% CI 5.0 to 59.9; <italic>P</italic>=.02) during work hours. Participants found the LUMOback easy to use but only somewhat comfortable. Qualitatively, participants valued the real-time app feedback. Nonuptake was attributed to being busy and setup issues. Low usage was attributed to discomfort wearing the LUMOback.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The LUMOback&#x02014;although able to reduce prolonged sitting time&#x02014;was only used to a limited extent, and its low usage may provide a partial explanation for the limited behavior changes that occurred. Discomfort limited the feasibility of the LUMOback for ongoing use. Such findings yield insight into how to improve upon implementing activity trackers in workplace settings.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>wearable electronic devices</kwd><kwd>fitness trackers</kwd><kwd>sedentary lifestyle</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>workplace</kwd><kwd>adult</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Desk-based workers engage in high levels of sedentary time [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] (ie, waking behaviors spent in a sitting, reclining, or lying posture with low energy expenditure [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]), putting themselves at risk of musculoskeletal [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and cardio-metabolic issues [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Much of this sitting time is in prolonged, unbroken bouts [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which have additional cardio-metabolic risks compared with sitting with regular breaks [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, desk-based workers spend only a small percentage of their workday stepping (&#x0003c;10% of work time) [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and engage in minimal amounts of moderate to vigorous activity both in and outside of work hours [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Given that sedentary work is increasing [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and workers spend the majority of their day at work [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], there is a need to design and evaluate interventions that target the desk-based workplace.</p><p>In recent years, consumer-based activity trackers have become a popular component of workplace wellness programs to increase workers&#x02019; physical activity [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and it is expected that by 2021, 171.9 million activity trackers will be in workplaces worldwide [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Most trackers offer features known to be important for behavior change including self-monitoring, real-time feedback and prompting, guided goal setting, and rich and tailored feedback data [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Their popular use in workplace wellness programs indicates that they may be a feasible and acceptable intervention strategy for organizations to disseminate [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and there is emerging evidence to suggest that consumer-based activity trackers can improve physical activity outcomes in desk-based workers [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Despite these findings, investigation concerning how desk-based workers use consumer-based trackers, which worker characteristics are associated with use, and whether workers find trackers acceptable and appealing has been scarce. The limited evidence suggests that although initial engagement is high [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], use may drop off in the long term [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Tracker users have been shown to fall into distinct groups, with high use seen among young and fit adults, as well as older adults with a desire to improve their health [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Acceptability may depend on user motivation and ease of use of the tracker [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, it is also unknown whether use of a consumer-based activity tracker that targets and provides real-time <italic>sitting</italic> feedback can result in reductions in desk-based workers&#x02019; sitting time. Strategies that target increases in activity may not lead to reductions in sitting time [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and therefore, trackers that specifically target sitting time need to be evaluated.</p><p>To address these gaps, this study explored the usage and acceptability of an activity tracker (the LUMOback) that provided real-time feedback on sitting among desk-based office workers participating in a cluster-randomized workplace trial, targeting reductions in prolonged sitting time [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The LUMOback tracker was chosen over other activity trackers because it is one of the few commercially available trackers that specifically measures and provides real-time sitting feedback [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The aim of this study was to explore the following: (1) participants&#x02019; LUMOback usage (ie, device wear); (2) which personal, health, job, and activity characteristics were associated with greater LUMOback usage; (3) the relationship between LUMOback usage and changes in sitting and activity outcomes both at work and across all waking hours; and (4) participants&#x02019; acceptability and perceptions of the LUMOback.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants and Design</title><p>Details of the study [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the effectiveness outcomes [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have been reported previously (trial registration: ACTRN12614000252617). Briefly, participants were desk-based office employees of a large international property and infrastructure group. Workers were recruited in teams from 2 locations (A and B). Teams were cluster-randomized to receive either organizational support strategies alone (Group ORG; 9 manager-led teams; 87 participants) or organizational support strategies plus the provision of a LUMOback tracker (Group ORG+Tracker; 9 manager-led teams; 66 participants). The intervention was ongoing; data collection occurred at baseline and 3 and 12 months post intervention commencement. Only the Group ORG+Tracker is examined in this study. The organizational support component, designed to be workplace driven, was delivered by a workplace champion (the organization&#x02019;s Head of Workplace Wellbeing) and consisted of an information booklet; emails with tips to stand up, sit less, and move more; and involvement of senior executives to support the study. Participants in both groups also received individualized feedback concerning their sitting time and physical activity as recorded by the activPAL after each assessment. The study was approved by the University of Queensland Behavioural and Social Sciences Ethical Review Committee (approval number: 2014000089). All participants provided written informed consent, which covered the 3-month evaluation, with reconsent required to participate in the 12-month evaluation [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The LUMOback Tracker</title><p>The activity tracker provided to participants was the LUMOback activity tracker (LUMO Bodytech, Mountain View, CA, USA). The LUMOback is worn as a belt around the lower back (over or under clothing) and provides real-time feedback (through a mobile app) on sitting, standing, sit-to-stand transitions, walking, running, step count, posture, and sleep. Users can set posture alerts that vibrate the belt when the user is in a poor lumbar posture (identified by pelvic tilt angle) and set sitting time push notifications to their phone when sitting for periods of 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 hour, or 2 hours (user-defined). The LUMOback provides valid and reliable measures of sitting time and number of steps [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>LUMOback trackers, along with a 4-page instruction booklet, were distributed by the workplace champion in study week 1. Participants set up their LUMObacks in their own time but had the contact details of the project coordinator and the workplace champion for any questions. LUMOback setup required calibration to the user&#x02019;s sitting and standing posture, and this was guided through the app and booklet instructions. The LUMOback was originally designed as a posture rather than as a sitting device [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As such, the default settings of the tracker were to have vibrating alerts (based on posture) on and sitting notifications off. To be consistent with evaluating the use of the tracker as it would be used outside of the research context, these settings were not preadjusted by project staff; however, the booklet instructions indicated that both these settings could be changed by the participant if the participant wished. LUMOback data were downloaded by project staff and monitored for usage during the study period. No specific instruction was given to participants on how much to wear the LUMOback; however, participants who did not have any LUMOback usage data were followed up by the project coordinator (via email or phone) or by the workplace champion (in person) to troubleshoot issues about setup during weeks 3 to 10. Participants were permitted to keep the LUMOback after the study ended.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Collection</title><p>Usage data were collected from LUMO Bodytech every 2 weeks during the initial 3 months and periodically thereafter. Participants completed Web-based questionnaires (via LimeService, used to address aims 2 and 4) at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months. The questionnaires collected data on sociodemographics (baseline), health and job characteristics (baseline, 3 months, and 12 months), LUMOback acceptability (3 months), and usage of behavior change techniques (eg, goal setting and prompting) in the LUMOback app (3 and 12 months). Height and weight measurements were collected objectively in person at the baseline assessment or via self-report (used in aim 2). Sitting and activity data (used to address aims 2 and 3) were collected at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months via the activPAL3 activity monitor (PAL Technologies Ltd., Glasgow, Scotland, UK). Telephone interviews, conducted 6 to 10 months after intervention commencement, were used to collect qualitative data regarding the LUMOback&#x02019;s acceptability to participants (used to address aim 4). Because so few participants reconsented for the 12-month assessment, aims 2 and 3 consider only usage and outcomes over the first 3 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Personal, Health, and Job Characteristics</title><p>Key participant characteristics, as measured at baseline, were age, gender, highest level of education completed, job category (senior or team leader, managerial staff, other general staff), use of other activity-promoting apps and wearable devices (yes or no), confidence using a smartphone (1-5 scale, least to most confidence), desired sitting at work (&#x02265;50%, &#x0003c;50% of work time) [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], knowledge of the health impacts of sitting (1-5 scale, least to most knowledge) [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], musculoskeletal symptoms (Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], categorized as problems over the last month [yes or no] in the upper body, back, and lower extremities), and physical and mental health-related quality of life (Short Form-12 version 1 [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], 0-100 scale) and several other health- and job-related scores, all measured on a 1-10 scale. Specifically, these were stress [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], job control [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], work satisfaction [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], supervisor relations [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] (all from the Health and Work Questionnaire), and job performance (self-rated job performance scale [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). For all of the health- and job-related scores, apart from stress, higher values are desirable. Height and weight measurements were used to calculate body mass index at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Activity</title><p>Sitting and activity data were collected via the activPAL3 monitor. At each assessment, participants were asked to wear the monitor for 7 days, 24 hours per day. Further information on monitor processing has been provided in previous trial publications [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Activity outcomes considered here are time per 10 hours at work and time per 16 hours awake spent engaged in sitting, prolonged sitting (&#x02265;30 min continuously), nonprolonged sitting (&#x0003c;30 min continuously), standing, and stepping. To take into account variations in work times between assessments, and between individuals, work hour outcomes were standardized to a 10-hour workday by multiplying by 10 hours and dividing by work wear time. Similarly, overall waking hour outcomes were standardized to a 16-hour day by multiplying by 16 hours and dividing by waking wear time. Work and waking times were collected by self-report.</p></sec><sec><title>LUMOback Usage</title><p>For participants who set up the LUMOback, data on LUMOback usage were downloaded as comma-separated value files from LUMO Bodytech. Each file contains date and time-stamped summaries per 5 min time interval on activity and posture in various metrics, and an indicator of whether the LUMOback was not worn or charging. Daily usage (hours/day) was estimated by calculating the time elapsed between the first and last 5-min time window each day during which the LUMOback recorded an activity other than lying down, and then subtracting from this usage time any probable device nonwear time (or sleep time) occurring during this period. Only days with &#x02265;1 hour of usage were counted as days of usage. Participants with at least 1 day of usage were classed as LUMOback &#x0201c;users&#x0201d;; those with no days of usage, or who self-reported never using the LUMOback, were classed as &#x0201c;nonusers.&#x0201d; Others who reported using the LUMOback but lacked usage data were classed as having an &#x0201c;unknown&#x0201d; degree of usage.</p><p>LUMOback usage over the initial 3 months of intervention was considered: continuously (days), as a binary classification (&#x02265;5 days or &#x0003c;5 days), and as a 4-category classification (nonuser, limited user, infrequent user, or frequent user). The thresholds used for the 4-category classification were 0, 1-4, 5-15, and &#x02265;16 days, respectively, over 3 months. Long-term (12-month) usage was also assessed for the subset of participants who had opted for the 12-month assessment. LUMOback usage during the activity monitor assessment (yes or no) was also considered to provide some insight as to whether the timing of LUMOback wear (not just how much it was worn) was important for activity changes. Usage/nonusage during the activity monitor assessment was determined by the presence/absence of &#x02265;1 day with &#x02265;1 hour of usage over this time frame, or by self-report when LUMOback data were not available.</p></sec><sec><title>LUMOback Acceptability</title><p>All questionnaire items assessing LUMOback acceptability were created for the trial. Acceptability questionnaire items were closed response (1, not at all; 2, somewhat; 3, not sure; 4, comfortable/easy; and 5, extremely comfortable/easy) and assessed for the following: comfort of the LUMOback, the ease of setup of the LUMOback and app, ease of navigation and use of the app, and ease of LUMOback calibration to the user&#x02019;s posture. Participants&#x02019; perceived usefulness of the LUMOback overall and of specific features such as the graphs, sitting notifications, and vibrating alerts were also assessed in closed-response items: 1, not at all; 2, somewhat; 3, not sure; 4, useful; 5, extremely useful; and, when relevant, 6, did not notice/use. Frequency of use of the behavior change features was also assessed (eg, &#x0201c;When wearing your LUMOback, how often did you have it set to vibrate?&#x0201d;), with response options from 1 (never) to 6 (all the time). The full list of questions is provided in Multimedia Appendix 1 of the study protocol [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>All participants who had not withdrawn after the 3-month assessment were eligible to take part in the telephone interviews. To ensure representation across teams, it was planned that at least 2 participants per team would be interviewed, plus the team managers. Interviews continued until the data were saturated and at least 2 members per work team were interviewed, unless there were more than 5 unsuccessful attempts to interview. The lead author (CLB, in location B) conducted and recorded (using Audacity) one-on-one telephone interviews with participants (predominantly in location A), ranging in duration from 9 to 28 min (mean duration 14 min). These semi-structured interviews covered topics of general thoughts on the LUMOback, participant likes and dislikes, barriers to usage, use of the sitting notification, influence of work team on LUMOback use, and general activity tracker preferences.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample Size</title><p>The sample size was determined based on the needs of the cluster-randomized trial [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This study was exploratory and not powered on study aims. Minimum differences of interest (MDI) in this study were 30 min of sitting and standing and 15 min of stepping between LUMOback usage categories (&#x02248;per 10 days of usage), and 2 days of LUMOback usage between groups (categorical variables), per amount of activity equivalent to the above, or per 1 standard deviation of other continuous variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in STATA version &#x02265;13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Significance was set at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.05 2-tailed. Analyses were of all evaluable cases with missing or &#x0201c;unknown&#x0201d; data excluded. Mean and standard deviation were reported for continuous variables, and percentage was reported for categorical variables.</p><p>To address aim 1, usage was described. In the case of non-normally distributed variables, the median and the 25th and 75th percentiles were reported in addition to the mean and SD. To address aim 2, associations of characteristics with LUMOback use (adjusting for age, sex, and location) were statistically tested using zero-inflated negative binomial models (which accounted for the excessive zeros, as indicated by the Vuong test). Results are reported as contrasts of marginal mean outcomes. To address aim 3, associations of LUMOback usage with activity outcomes were examined using linear mixed models, adjusting for baseline value of the outcome, age, and sex and correcting for team cluster. Models were checked for nonlinearity, non-normality of residuals, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, and influential cases. Outcomes were transformed when this improved models, with the results from these models presented back-transformed to regular units. Results are presented with and without influential cases, if these cases were found to change the interpretation of the results.</p><p>To address aim 4, acceptability of the LUMOback was described quantitatively, based on the questionnaire items, and qualitatively, based on thematic analysis of interview data. Qualitative interviews were transcribed verbatim using F4 software (audiotranskription, Marburg, Germany). Participant idiosyncrasies (eg, &#x0201c;um&#x0201d;) were removed after transcription. Author CLB coded initial themes (using NVivo version 10 and Microsoft Office Word). These were then compared and contrasted with a second researcher and discussed and decided upon. Themes were not preidentified; however, some of the questions in the semi-structured interview had a narrow focus that heavily contributed to some of the themes.

Uptake was modest overall (43/66, 65%) and within those provided a LUMOback (43/61, 70%). Nonusers&#x02019; (n=18) reported reasons for nonuse were as follows: being too busy to set up (6/18, 33%), personal disruptions during the study period (4/18, 22%), having technical difficulties setting up (3/18, 17%), pregnancy (1/18, 6%), and unknown (4/18, 22%). An additional &#x0201c;user&#x0201d; was later classed as a nonuser as they only had a very small and invalid amount of usage data (&#x0003c;1 hour), bringing the total number of nonusers to 19.

The real-time feedback was valuable to users, and greater use of the LUMOback appeared to assist with reducing the amount of daily prolonged sitting during the intervention. However, only 70% (43/61) of participants provided with a LUMOback used it. Among those who used the LUMOback, the amount of usage (left to the participant&#x02019;s discretion) was very limited, with a median of 8 days of usage, and a maximum of 48 days of usage out of a possible 91 days. Being too busy, technology issues during setup, and a lack of interest were possible reasons for nonuse. Within users, comfort was a key reason for low usage of the LUMOback. Having lower self-perceived job control and weaker supervisor relationships were significantly associated with more LUMOback usage; while participants who were senior staff and team leaders, and participants with a better health profile also tended to use the LUMOback more than their counterparts.</p><p>Workplace tracker interventions have previously seen high levels of tracker uptake (96-99%) [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, in line with the findings observed in this study (where uptake was 70%), uptake of trackers when offered in real-world workplace wellness programs can be more modest (25-100%) [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this study, some nonusers reported a lack of interest in their LUMOback tracker. Tracker use is a personal decision, and some workers simply may not want or need a device to track their behavior. As such, offering trackers to everyone is not necessarily going to be a catch-all solution, but just one of many strategies a workplace could offer its workers. Issues with setup of the device may also have impeded its uptake. Although the participants in this study felt confident using their smartphone, work demands and technological difficulties may have meant that in-person set-up support was still needed. This finding, in line with a previous study reporting technology barriers to tracker uptake [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], suggests that investing in additional support at the initiation stage may be warranted. Indeed, in one study where such support was provided (eg, downloading the app and setting up the tracker for the participant), uptake was 100% and usage was high across the study (median use of 95% days across 16 weeks of intervention) [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Even among those who proceeded to use the belt-worn LUMOback, usage was low.

Usage in the studies without these additional features [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was typically lower (15-60% of participants still using their tracker after 2 months). These findings suggest that additional strategies may be needed to achieve high tracker usage.</p><p>Social support strategies, such as being part of a team, sharing results with others, and participating in workplace competitions, may also be associated with increased uptake and use of activity trackers [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study, senior and team leaders tended to use the LUMOback more than other employees. Participants in these roles likely had a higher responsibility for managing health and safety issues, had more direct contact with the workplace champion (who was at a similar managerial level), and as such may have been more motivated to use their LUMOback tracker. Senior and team leader support facilitated LUMOback uptake for some participants, but they did not discuss ongoing LUMOback use with their teams. A greater extent of role modeling and discussion might be useful to promote tracker usage and could provide a means to alleviate issues with setup and calibration.</p><p>Greater users of the tracker tended to be healthier, which is consistent with previous research [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A novel finding was that participants with high self-perceived job control and supervisor relationships used the LUMOback for significantly fewer days. It may have been that these participants felt more freedom and confidence in their work roles to discontinue use of the tracker. Participants who had musculoskeletal problems at baseline used the LUMOback for fewer days than those without problems. It is possible that minor back pain following the posture advice, which was reported by 3 participants in the adverse outcomes of the trial [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], was a reason for less use in those participants who already had musculoskeletal problems at baseline. The waist-worn belt may have also been particularly troublesome for those with pre-existing back problems.</p><p>Comfort of the LUMOback appeared to be a key contributor to the low overall usage identified in this study. Participants reported dislike of the belt placement, and some noted that the LUMOback was difficult to wear with clothing. Similar findings have been reported with the Actigraph GT3X+ when attached via a belt [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and for trackers worn tightly secured to the body [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Alternatives to belts, such as wristbands and clips, may be especially useful for long-term use with office clothing. However, the wrist and hip wear positions suited to wristbands and clips are not ideal for measuring sitting time [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] as they can lead to standing being misidentified as sitting. Other barriers identified by participants in this study and across other tracker research include a lack of perceived data accuracy, forgetting to use or charge the tracker, and difficulty using the tracker [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These findings suggest that, even with additional support, trackers need to be comfortable, accurate, discreet, and easy to use to facilitate ongoing use.</p><p>Consistent with other workplace tracker studies [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we saw very limited usage of the LUMOback after 3 months (ie, only 1 out of the 21 participants whom we could follow up). However, the need for continuous self-monitoring of behavior is debatable [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Disuse of a tracker after a short period could indicate that participants have learned about their behavior and made changes rather than indicating failure to change [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Alternatively, the intermittent usage observed for some participants may reflect that self-monitoring provides a way to reidentify and adjust behavior as needed. Our findings did not suggest that the behavioral impact of the LUMOback is limited to the time frame over which it was worn; usage during the activity monitoring did not appear to predict behavior change any better than usage over the intervention generally, much of which occurred early on. A period of initial tracking may be sufficient to facilitate 3-month behavior changes. However, further research is needed to understand the interplay between tracker use and behavior.</p><p>Encouragingly, even within a group who used the LUMOback to a limited degree, larger favorable behavior changes during the intervention were seen in those with high usage compared with those with low or no usage. Greater usage during the intervention was significantly associated with overall time per day spent in prolonged sitting and, although there should be caution in interpreting this result, time spent in nonprolonged sitting during work hours. Unlike the majority of commercially available activity trackers [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the LUMOback used posture measurement to detect and prompt on sitting time, which may be why this particular tracker was able to facilitate improvements in prolonged sitting time during the intervention. However, the LUMOback is no longer commercially available. Thus, it is recommended that current and future commercial activity trackers include features to distinguish between sitting and upright postures so that they can appropriately measure and prompt on sitting time.</p><p>Notably, use of the LUMOback was not significantly associated with changes in sitting, standing, and stepping time. Greater changes in these behaviors may require greater use of the LUMOback and/or additional behavioral strategies. Environmental modifications to the workplace (eg, sit-stand workstations) and/or changes to the design of work tasks (eg, activity-based working, where workers can change workspace depending on work task) may also be needed to support regular shifts between sitting, standing, and moving.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>A key study strength was that use of the LUMOback was self-directed by the participant and was provided as part of a broader workplace program. Thus, the findings are likely to be indicative of how a tracker may be implemented and used as part of a real-world worksite-driven program. The evaluation over the longer term enabled the examination of how the LUMOback was being used over time (and by whom), whereas the qualitative investigation added depth to the findings by exploring the reasons for lack of uptake and ceased use. It is recommended that future tracker evaluations take this mixed-methods approach.</p><p>This study was not powered a priori on the aims of this paper. Confidence intervals around estimates indicated that substantial differences in sociodemographic and health- and job-related predictors of usage and substantial differences in activity changes by usage may have been missed due to inadequate precision. Moreover, the limited differences in activity changes by usage may in part be due to a mismatch between when participants used their LUMOback and when we captured their behavior. Evaluating usage and behavior over a more similar time frame (the assessment period vs the intervention) did not tend to strengthen associations; however, our examination would not detect very short-term effects of usage on behavior (eg, on the same day or at the same time). This may be an important question to address in a sample with sufficient usage. Biases may have had an impact on the results. Due to the small sample size, it was not possible to adjust for all potential confounders. Information was not collected on those who declined participation or who were never approached. LUMOback nonusers were also more likely to drop out of the study than LUMOback users. This attrition bias suggests our results, if anything, are likely to underestimate the associations of usage with behavior change. Although only some participants participated in the telephone interviews, interviews were conducted in both LUMOback users and nonusers, and a range of perspectives was collected. Generalizability is limited to the type of tracker used (belt-worn tracker focused on posture and sitting) and to the context of its use. Notably, it was allocated and provided by others (not chosen or purchased by the user) in the context of a team-based workplace-delivered organizational intervention. Use of a tracker that is self-selected by participants might lead to greater uptake and/or longer usage. Self-selection may especially encourage usage in those with high job control who may be accustomed to having a high level of autonomy in their working life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A tracker that provides real-time feedback on sitting time was associated with the reduction of prolonged sitting time during a workplace-delivered sitting-reduction intervention. The tracker evaluated was not particularly suitable for ongoing use in office workers, but this study has provided insight into barriers and facilitators for uptake and ongoing tracker use in this population.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a Vanguard Grant (Award ID: 100216) from the National Heart Foundation of Australia, a grant from the Office Ergonomics Research Committee, and Lendlease.
