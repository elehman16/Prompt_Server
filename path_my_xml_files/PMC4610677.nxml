Most cardiovascular diseases are associated with loss of functional cardiomyocytes, which are not replaced due to the limited regenerative capacity intrinsic to the heart. In recent years, cell-based therapy has been presented as a potential therapeutic strategy for cardiac regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC), in particular, have emerged as a promising candidate for cell-based therapies [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These cells have important intrinsic features for therapeutic settings namely: easy isolation from a small aspirate of bone marrow, adipose tissue or from other sources of perinatal origin (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. umbilical cord) and high <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion potential [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], multilineage differentiation capacity [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], ability to modulate immune responses and secrete various cytokines that play a role in processes such as angiogenesis, inflammation, cellular migration and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although there is no clear evidence that MSC can differentiate into myocardial cells [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the advantages of a MSC-based therapy could lie in the immunomodulatory effects mediated by these cells, as well as the ability of MSC to promote growth, survival or differentiation of other cells in the damaged myocardial area through paracrine mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These properties have encouraged pre-clinical and clinical research to explore the potential role of MSC as a cell-based treatment for heart disease [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The use of intracoronary (IC) artery infusion in cell-based therapy is based on standard knowledge and catheterization techniques allowing direct delivery of a large number of cells into myocardial regions. With this advantage, the IC route has been the most used delivery method of hematopoietic cells (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. mononucleated cells, MNC), including stem/progenitor cells, in cardiovascular cell-based research [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, its use for administration of MSC is still a matter for debate. With a diameter of 10&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;m, MSC are larger than heart capillaries (5&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;m) and there is the risk of microcirculation obstruction [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The potential safety issues of intracoronary MSC-based therapies, namely microinfarctions, should be addressed with solid pre-clinical research, as current data is limited and controversial.</p><p>Coronary flow reserve (CFR) is the maximum increase in blood flow through the coronary arteries above the normal resting volume and is measured to assess the flow in the epicardial artery and in the microcirculatory bed. The index of microcirculation resistance (IMR), allows a quantitative, invasive, and real-time evaluation of the coronary microcirculation status independently of the epicardial vessel. IMR is defined as distal coronary pressure multiplied by the hyperemic mean transit time (mm Hg &#x000b7; seconds, or units [U]) [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Current interventional cardiology techniques allow for the simultaneous measurement of CFR and IMR with a pressure-temperature sensor-tipped wire. Mean transit time is derived from thermodilution after IC injection of room-temperature saline and it correlates to the coronary absolute flow. Disruption of the microvascular bed is associated with a significant increase in IMR and this can be determined immediately after an IC intervention using the same catheter based procedure. IMR assessment is expected to clarify how MSC IC infusion affects heart microcirculation.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Objectives</title><p>The overall goal of the present work was to study the IC artery delivery of human MSC in a large animal model&#x02014;swine&#x02014;closely resembling coronary circulation and arterial anatomy in humans. Specifically, this study was designed to examine heart microcirculation damage with IMR assessment after MSC IC injection in the animals compared to a control group (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. no cells administered). We also evaluated the differences in hemodynamic, electrocardiographic and coronary epicardial artery flow parameters upon administration of MSC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Overview</title><p>Eighteen swine (males Duroc and females F1 Large White X Landrace) with a weight of 25 to 40 Kg (31 &#x000b1; 5 Kg) were randomized to receive either (i) 1 million MSC/kg corresponding to approximately 30x10<sup>6</sup> MSC resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with human albumin (HA), or (ii) cell-free PBS/HA solution (placebo&#x02014;control group).

These cells were isolated from Bone marrow (BM) aspirates from healthy donors upon informed consent according to the protocol described by dos Santos and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Briefly, the mononuclear fraction was separated using a Ficoll gradient and cells were isolated based on their ability to adhere to tissue culture plastic (polystyrene) upon cultivation in low-glucose Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented (10%) with MSC-qualified fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone). For cell preparation in the present study, multiple vials of BM MSC from a single donor (kept cryopreserved in a liquid/vapour phase nitrogen tank) were thawed and plated at 3000&#x02013;6000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> on T-175 flasks (BD Falcon) using DMEM-10%FBS and expanded upon consecutive passaging to reach the target cell doses for administration. Cells at passages P5-P7 were used in the present study. Cell number and viability were assessed using the Trypan Blue exclusion method (Gibco) and counting cells on a hemocytometer under an optical microscope (Olympus).</p><p>MSC were characterized by flow cytometry using specific monoclonal antibodies according to criteria defined in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Over 95% of the population should express CD73, CD90 and CD105 and not express (less than 2%) CD14, CD19, CD31, CD34, CD45, CD80 and HLA-DR. For this purpose, cells were incubated for 15 minutes in the dark with a panel of mouse anti-human fluorescent-labeled monoclonal antibodies (all from BioLegend, except anti-CD105 (Invitrogen)). Cells were then washed with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. A minimum of 10 000 events were collected for each sample and the CellQuest&#x02122; software (Becton Dickinson) was used for acquisition and analysis. The differentiation potential of MSC was tested using biochemical methods after <italic>in vitro</italic> induction of osteogenesis, adipogenesis, and chondrogenesis using specific culture media.</p><p>In order to prepare administration, expanded cells were resuspended in a HA-containing (1%) solution prepared by dilution (1:30) of a stock solution (30%, Albunorm, Octapharma) in PBS. Multiple samples of cell suspensions were observed under optical microscopy at different time points upon resuspension to verify the occurrence of cell aggregation. Cells were transported from the cell culture laboratory at IST-iBB to animal facilities at room temperature and administered within 2 hours.</p><sec id="sec011"><title>Animal care and catheterization procedures</title><p>Animal procedures were approved by the Ethical and Animal Welfare commission of the Veterinary Medical School, Universidade de Lisboa, and the study was authorized by the national regulatory authorities.

Anesthesia was induced by intramuscular injection of azaperone (2 mg/kg), atropine (1 mg) and after 15 minutes, ketamine (20 mg/kg). In the catheterization laboratory, a venous catheter (22 G) was placed in the marginal ear vein, through which sodium thiopental (6 mg/kg) was injected. Anesthesia was maintained with mechanical tracheal ventilation (tidal volume of 10 ml/kg) and inhaled isoflurane (2%). After placing a 6F sheath in the femoral artery, anticoagulation was achieved with intravenous heparin (300 U/ kg). Hemodynamic and electrocardiographic monitoring was maintained during the entire experiment. Aorta and left ventricle pressure measurements were done with a 6F pigtail catheter and for selective catheterization of the left main artery a 6F Amplatz left 0.75 was used. All heart catheterization procedures were conducted under fluoroscopy.</p><p>At the end of the experiment, animals that received MSC were euthanized with intravenous sodium thiopental.

In pre-clinical studies these cells have been shown to engraft in the heart, reduce infarction size and allow for an improvement in ventricle contractile function in rodent [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and larger animal models [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In the present work, we studied the IC delivery of human BM-derived MSC in a swine model, closely resembling coronary circulation and arterial anatomy in humans. We chose to use culture-expanded, human BM-derived cells defined by the standards of the International Society of Cellular Therapy (ISCT) [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], since these cells, despite representing a heterogeneous cell population, have been widely exploited experimentally and in clinical trials. For instances, Hare and co-workers reported in 2009 a double-blind controlled phase I study demonstrating the safety of the intravenous route of MSC in patients with myocardial infarction [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. More recently, Bartunek and colleagues, in the C-Cure trial, demonstrated the safety associated with signs of clinical benefit of MSC endomyocardial injections in patients with chronic heart failure [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The IC cell delivery of MSC has proven to result in an increased cell engraftment within the infarcted tissue of porcine compared to the intravenous route [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The comparison of IC delivery <italic>versus</italic> the endocardial route is more controversial [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While IC delivery is based on coronary procedures that are part of clinical practice nowadays, the endocardial administration of cells relies on more complex techniques that interventional cardiologists are not familiar with. Nevertheless, despite the advantages of the IC route, there is apprehension about the size of MSC and the possibility of microvascular obstruction [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], myocardial microinfarctions [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and decreased coronary flow [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] upon MSC delivery. In this context, preclinical data has been controversial but some recent studies support the safety and clinical benefit of MSC IC delivery [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>It has been hypothesized that microcirculatory entrapment of MSC and their consequences to coronary flow are probably dose related. For instance, Hong and colleagues performed an IC dose escalating study in 3 pigs, injecting 1, 3, 10, 30, 100x10<sup>6</sup> of adipose-derived stem cells with 30 minute intervals [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Coronary blood was not changed at a cumulative dose of 14x10<sup>6</sup>, but further injections after cumulative dose of 44 x 10<sup>6</sup> were associated with a progressive decrease in the coronary filling time culminating in hypokinesia of the anterior apical wall. With this data in mind, we chose to use infusions of 30x10<sup>6</sup> MSC (roughly corresponding to 1x10<sup>6</sup> MSC/kg) in the present study. This could be a suitable dose since there were no periprocedural complications with IC infusion of MSC and no hemodynamic deterioration, arrhythmias or compromised coronary epicardial vessel flow were observed.</p><p>Currently no IC delivery strategy has emerged as the optimal administration method for cell administration. Previous studies have used the stop-flow methodology as described by Strauer and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], with slight variations between these. Briefly, with this technique a coronary vessel is occluded with an over-the-wire balloon and cells are injected through the central lumen of the balloon-catheter in several occlusion-reperfusion series. Theoretically this could avert cell backflow or rapid cell washout. On the other hand, this technique may lead to MSC accumulation, and even aggregation, increasing the risk of cell entrapping. Another disadvantage is the risk of coronary dissection with the balloon, particularly in non-stented vessels. In our experiment, human MSC were slowly infused using a microcatheter and an infusion pump syringe, at a constant flow and without coronary occlusion. We speculate that with this approach MSC are drifted towards the microcirculation in smaller numbers and at a constant rate, which potentially prevents or minimizes microvessel sludging. Our findings support that this continuous infusion with coronary flow maintained could potentially be a safer way of IC administration of MSC.</p><p>To our best knowledge, the present study is the first one to address the acute microcirculatory effects of IC MSC delivery using IMR measurements and a controlled and blind research design. IMR evaluation relies in a complex technique and our group previously performed its validation in a porcine model [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Here, MSC infusion resulted in a significant, but not so impressive, increase of IMR to 15.3 &#x000b1; 3 U. This suggests that several degrees of microcirculation compromise could be distinguished by IMR assessment, which could be useful towards the establishment of an optimal MSC dose scheme to study safety and efficacy. We believe that demonstrating changes in microcirculation, in vivo and in real time, after the intracoronary administration of these cells is not trivial, since we still lack the limits on what is normal or what defines an unwanted effect of any intervention. However, it can be the first step to clarify the potential clinical value of IMR in future studies.</p><p>We also observed a small increase in IMR at 5 minutes in control animals (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. no cells administered) that could be related to coronary manipulation during saline infusion. In fact, only after 30 minutes, a significant difference between groups occurs. This possibly means that we should wait before measuring IMR instead of doing it immediately after an intervention to assess acute effects of any procedure.</p><p>Hong and collaborators also addressed the microcirculatory effects of IC injections of adipose-derived stem cells with IMR measurements [<xref rid="pone.0139870.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These authors reported a significant increase from baseline in IMR at 7 days in the high-dose group (receiving 50x10<sup>6</sup> cells) (11 &#x000b1; 1.3 <italic>vs</italic>. 17.8 &#x000b1; 3.2, p = 0.04, respectively), and no significant changes in the low-dose group (10x10<sup>6</sup> cells). Despite the different MSC source (adipose) used and a distinct IC infusion technique (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. cells were delivered at a rate of 1.3 ml/min with alternating 3-min infusions and 3-min periods of reperfusion), our results are in line with those obtained by Hong and co-workers, which clearly demonstrates the potential for microvasculature obstruction with MSC IC delivery. The differences observed between the two studies, namely the more expressive increase in IMR observed in our work might be also the result of differences in the studied population (healthy <italic>vs</italic>. post-myocardial infarction animals), and time of IMR assessment. In contrast to the previous work, our operators were blinded for the assessment of IMR, which avoids operator-induced bias.</p><p>Most importantly, CFR had no significant change, confirming that epicardial circulation was unaffected during the experiment and that IMR is a better and more specific parameter for microcirculation assessment.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>We used healthy animals with normal microcirculation and extrapolating our results to the context of heart disease should be done with caution. A histological study to confirm the presence of microvessel obstruction was not performed, and so we can only consider this as a hypothesis for the occurrence an increase in IMR. On the other hand, a side-by-side comparison between IC infusion techniques was not done and thus our results warrant further research.</p><p>Overall, IMR enables the assessment of the microcirculation status by Interventional Cardiologists. Correlating IMR values after IC delivery of MSC with data about cell fate and distribution, histological analysis and long term clinical benefit in the context of heart disease are important issues that should be addressed in future work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrate the feasibility of use IC delivery to administer culture-expanded human MSC without compromising hemodynamic, electrical stability and epicardial coronary flow. However, our study does provide definitive evidence of microcirculatory disruption exposed by a significant increase in IMR. The impact of these microcirculatory effects and the potential applications of IMR warrant further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0139870.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Tables with all the relevant research results.</title><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0139870.s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was financially supported by research funds from the Cardiology Department of Hospital de Santa Marta and by Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal, through the project EXPL/BIM-MED/1970/2013 CARDIOSAFER and grants SFRH/BD/90001/2012 and SFRH/BD/51572/2011 awarded to M.
