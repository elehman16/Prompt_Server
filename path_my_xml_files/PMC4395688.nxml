martial art training on radial bone strength, upper- and lower-limb muscular strength,
shoulder joint mobility, balance performance, and self-efficacy in elderly participants.
[Subjects and Methods] Twelve seniors voluntarily joined the VT training group, and
twenty-seven seniors voluntarily joined the control group. The VT group received VT
training for three months, while the control group received no training. The bone strength
of the distal radius was assessed using an ultrasound bone sonometer. Muscular strength in
the limbs was evaluated using a Jamar handgrip dynamometer and the five times sit-to-stand
test. Shoulder joint mobility was examined using a goniometer. Balance performance and
self-efficacy were evaluated using the Berg Balance Scale and the Chinese version of the
Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, respectively. [Results] The results revealed
a nonsignificant group-by-time interaction effect, group effect, and time effect for all
outcome variables. However, general trends of maintenance or improvement in all outcome
parameters were observed to a greater extent in the VT group than in the control group.
[Conclusion] VT training might be a potential fall-prevention exercise that can be used to
maintain general physique, balance, and confidence in the elderly population. A further
randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm this postulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Martial arts</kwd><kwd>Postural balance</kwd><kwd>Aged</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Falls are a common cause of morbidity and mortality among the elderly population. Body
balance and lower limb muscular strength are common therapeutic targets to reduce the risk
of falls among community-dwelling older adults<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Balance and strengthening exercises not only reduce the risk of falls and associated
injuries but can also improve overall body management, reduce physical impairments, and
above all, help to sustain a healthy lifestyle<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Various fall-prevention programs incorporating static, dynamic, and functional balance
activities have been devised for the elderly by physiotherapists<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nevertheless, conventional physiotherapy practices often
vary in frequency, intensity, and duration and are often regarded as single-component and
monotonous practices<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. For
community-dwelling older adults, a progressive exercise program that can strengthen body
functions while at the same time adding interest and activity to their sedentary lifestyle
would be a more motivating intervention to prevent falls.</p><p>In Asian cultures, practising traditional martial arts such as Tai Chi could be a popular
means of maintaining general physique<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Martial arts training is regarded as a multicomponent exercise program, unlike
single-component interventions that focus on just one of the risk factors associated with
the likelihood of falling. A martial arts program integrates multiple components or
activities targeting muscular performance, functional balance, postural control, and
importantly, cardiovascular endurance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Nevertheless, only a few studies have used randomized controlled clinical trials to provide
evidence for the effects of martial arts training such as Tai Chi<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, karate<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>,
judo<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, taekwondo<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and kung fu<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> on health and fitness.</p><p>Invigorated by the strong image of Bruce Lee and Ip Man, Ving Tsun (VT) is another popular
traditional Chinese martial art that may improve balance performance, muscular strength, and
bone strength in older adults<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. VT is
characterized by speedy and dynamic yet stable punching techniques and footwork. It
comprises three primary elements: structural development forms, reflex-development drills,
and tactical development drills. Forms and drills are practised for the initial development
of various VT skills in a practical and active way, while tactics are incrementally used to
prepare learners for real-life self-defense. The forms are solitary exercises that are
designed to sharpen focus and improve body balance, attentiveness, and proprioception. They
aim to teach the hand positions, techniques, and defining movements at each level of VT. In
conjunction with the forms, the drills instil the principal structure and mechanics; timing,
dexterity, and interceptions; and kinesthetic senses<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Founded on the basis of balance, structure, and stance, VT is a simple fighting skill that
can be used to improve consistency, body balance, and simultaneous body movements, mainly
through high-impact training practices such as wooden dummy training and sticking-hand
exercises<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study found that elderly VT practitioners had higher
radial bone and handgrip strengths and better standing balance performance than healthy
seniors who were not VT practitioners. These improvements are attributable to the various
components of the VT training. First, VT involves repetitive upper limb striking movements
that continually load high peak forces and impacts on the forearm bones. The bone strength
of the distal radius, therefore, increases to accommodate these mechanical demands. Second,
repeated practice of striking and sticking-hand techniques and fundamental standing control
requires continuous contraction and relaxation of the upper and lower limb muscles, which
should theoretically increase muscle strength. Third, better standing balance control is
accredited to the important VT foundation techniques. In practicing static balance control,
practitioners sustain postural stability during a variety of upper limb movements<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In view of the above, we speculated that VT might offer a potential regular physical
activity for healthy seniors to sustain better physical functions and balance, and hence to
reduce the risk of falls. Building on the pilot study<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, this study is the first prospective, non-randomized controlled
trial to investigate the effects of short-term VT martial art training on radial bone
strength, upper- and lower-limb muscular strength, shoulder joint mobility, balance
performance, and self-efficacy in the elderly population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-nine participants were recruited from a neighborhood elderly center by convenience

until they were mildly sweating. They were allowed to rest if absolutely necessary. The VT
training session was conducted by an experienced VT coach. The participants were also
required to practice the VT exercises at home every day (excluding the VT class days) for an
hour, building on those practiced during the face-to-face training sessions. To ensure all
participants complied with the home exercises, they were asked to update the coach on their
progress before every training session. The control group did not receive VT training within
the study period. However, they were invited to join other courses (with no physical
training component) at the elderly center.</p><p>All participants were assessed before the start of the VT intervention and again after the
VT training. The participants from both groups underwent pre- and post-intervention
assessments in four domains: (1) radial bone strength, (2) upper- and lower-limb muscular
strength, (3) shoulder joint mobility, and (4) balance performance and confidence.</p><p>The bone strength of the distal radius was assessed using a Sunlight MiniOmni Ultrasound
Bone Sonometer (Sunlight, BeamMed Ltd., Petah Tikva, Israel). Several studies have reported
that this ultrasound system is both reliable (intra-operator precision at distal radius =
0.36%) and precise (in vivo precision = 0.4% &#x02212; 0.8%)<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The detailed assessment procedures have been reported by Fong et
al<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In brief, the assessor slowly
rotated the ultrasound transducers (within the probe) around the distal radius. The speed of
the ultrasound wave (SOS,&#x02005;ms<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) traveling through the outer surface (outer
2&#x02013;6&#x02005;mm) of the radial bone was measured. The SOS values were then converted into a T-score
immediately using inbuilt computer software<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. This score indicates the standard deviation relative to the
population reference values of healthy young adults. It reflects the bone&#x02019;s fragility and is
highly correlated with bone strength<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The average SOS T-score of the three
trials obtained from the radius of the dominant side was used for analysis.</p><p>The handgrip strength of the dominant hand was assessed using a Jamar dynamometer (Sammons
Preston, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Standard assessment procedures were followed<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, as described in a previous study<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Briefly, participants squeezed the
dynamometer as hard as possible three times, and the highest grip-strength value was used
for analysis. The inter- and intra-rater reliabilities of this test have been reported to be
good to excellent (ICC = 0.94&#x02013;0.98) in adults<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The five times sit-to-stand test (FTSTS) was used to functionally assess lower limb
muscular strength. This test has good to excellent reliability (ICC = 0.64 &#x02212; 0.96) and has
been widely applied among elderly populations<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The detailed assessment procedures were reported by Ng and
colleagues<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In summary, participants
were invited to stand up and sit down five times as quickly as possible. Each participant
performed the test three times. The average time taken to complete the three trials was used
for analysis. A longer FTSTS time denotes weaker lower limb muscles<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Shoulder joint mobility was assessed through a flexion movement in a seated posture. A
universal goniometer was used to measure the active joint range of motion (ROM). The
assessor set the goniometer&#x02019;s stationary arm parallel to the lateral midline of the trunk
and the movable arm parallel to the lateral midline of the humerus pointing towards the
lateral humeral epicondyle<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
reliability of the ROM measurement depends on the assessor maintaining accurate reference
points for the goniometer axes during shoulder movement<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The shoulder flexion ROM of the dominant arm was measured twice,
and the mean ROM (degree) of the two trials was used for analysis.</p><p>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was used to measure the functional balance performance of the
participants. The BBS is a 14-item test with a 5-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4.
Given that the 14 items are derived from functional movements in everyday life, this
assessment was relevant, easy, and safe for the elderly participants to perform. The sum of
the item scores (0&#x02013;56) was used for analysis. A total score of 40 or below indicates the
presence of fall risk<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Fear of falling was measured by the validated Chinese version of the Activities-specific
Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, as it has been demonstrated to have good reliability (ICC =
0.87)<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Participants were invited to
rate their self-perceived balance confidence level from 0 (no confidence at all) to 100
(full confidence) when performing 16 daily activities. The 16 item scores were averaged to
obtain the mean ABC score (range 0&#x02013;100), which was used for analysis. A lower mean ABC score
indicates greater fear of falling<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The normality of all continuous data was checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Independent t-tests (for continuous data) and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests (for nominal data) were
used to compare the baseline and demographic characteristics of the VT group and the control
group. The intention-to-treat principle (last observation carried forward) was applied to
deal with missing data. To test the overall time-by-group interaction effects of VT training
and to avoid the probability of inflating type I errors, a single two-way repeated measures
multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), incorporating all outcome variables, was
performed. The between-subject factor was group, and the within-subject factor was time. If
there were significant between-group differences in any of the demographic or outcome
variables at baseline, the baseline data for the outstanding demographic or outcome
variables were treated as covariates.</p><p>After the multivariate analysis, univariate analyses were performed as necessary, using
paired and independent t-tests. The significance level was set at 0.05 (two-tailed). All of
the statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All 39 older adults (VT group, n = 12; control group, n = 27) were eligible to participate

There were significant differences in age, body height, and

average score, and BBS total score (p&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table

indicating possible improvements in lower limb muscular strength. In contrast, the control
group required more time (0.76&#x02005;s) to complete the FTSTS test at the post-intervention
assessment compared with at the pre-intervention assessment (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>(4) Although the improvement in shoulder flexion ROM was minimal (0.4%) after VT training,
there was a slight deterioration (1.2%) in the no-training control group over time (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>(5) A trend of improvement was also observed in the ABC score after VT training.

the control group over time (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>(6) BBS scores increased by 1.54 units in the VT training group but by only 1.26 units in
the control group at the post-intervention assessment (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to examine the health
effects of short-term VT martial art training in an elderly community-dwelling sample. Our
findings revealed nonsignificant differences in radial bone strength, limb muscular
strength, joint mobility, balance performance, and self-efficacy among the VT group
participants. Nevertheless, trends of improvement in these fitness attributes were
noticeable in the VT training group.</p><p>First, regarding the radial bone strength, participants from the VT group made greater
progress than those in the control group. This improvement can be explained by the constant
upper limb striking movements throughout the three months of VT training. According to
Wolff&#x02019;s law of bone remodelling<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
repetitive forces and impacts on the forearm bones during sticking-hand drills should
enhance distal radial bone strength to accommodate the increased mechanical demands. Hence,
the bone is remodelled and becomes stronger to endure this additional load when it
encounters increased loading during VT practice<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. The improvement in the current
study was not as apparent as that reported in a previous study of habitual elderly VT
practitioners<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The difference is
mainly attributable to the different training periods and VT curricula used in the two
studies. In the study by Fong et al., elderly VT practitioners had trained for an average of
16&#x02005;years and also practised a wide range of forms, drills, and tactics. This long-term
regular high-impact training could improve radial bone strength, which could lessen the risk
of distal radius fractures as a result of falls<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the VT participants only trained for a short time
(three months). They were also practicing at the beginner level, which focuses on basic
techniques and hardly touches upon intensive practices using wooden dummies and sandbags.
Therefore, their bones experienced limited exposure to high impact forces, which was
insufficient to cause any dramatic improvements in bone strength.</p><p>Second, as for the muscular strength in the dominant upper limb, rather stable performances
were observed in the handgrip test in both groups over time. In contrast, there was a clear
difference in lower limb muscular strength performance between the two groups after the VT
training: the VT group had improved, while the control group had deteriorated. Despite this
encouraging observation, the between-group difference was not significant. This finding was
again contrary to that of the previous study on habitual elderly VT practitioners<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, probably for the same reasons as
mentioned above. The improvements could also be due to the emphasis on hand forms and
footwork in VT training. Repeated practice of the elbow striking and kicking techniques
during VT training might strengthen the extrinsic and intrinsic limb muscles as a result of
frequent contraction and relaxation<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Third, similar to muscular strength, shoulder joint mobility improved in the VT group
following training, but not in the control group. Although this effect was not significant,
there was a clear trend of improvement. As shoulder flexibility is dependent on the
physiological adaptation of connective tissues, physical activity consisting of stretching
movements would be expected to increase the elasticity of muscle and soft tissues around the
joint, rendering a greater ROM<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, the frequent and unique shoulder stretching movements during VT training (e.g.,
Bong Sau and Fak Sau)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> might lead to
local, if not universal, maintenance or enhancement of shoulder joint mobility.</p><p>Finally, concerning balance control and confidence, there were modest improvements in the
functional balance task and self-efficacy evaluation in the VT group. This supports the
findings of the previous study<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Unlike
the sensory organization test used in the previous study<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, this study examined participants&#x02019; balance control with two
well-formulated scales to assess functional balance performance and self-efficacy in the
context of the participants&#x02019; everyday lives. As suggested in the previous study, the
improvement in standing balance control can be attributed to the fundamental balance
practice underlying the theory of VT<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Balance, structure, and stance are the basic elements incorporated into every VT form and
drill curriculum<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is unsurprising,
therefore, that VT training can strengthen static and anticipatory postural control systems
and balance confidence, thereby enhancing postural stability in the course of different
functional movements<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Overall, given
the trend of improvements demonstrated in this short-term VT intervention, the findings
substantiate the use of VT training as a fall-prevention program to strengthen overall
physical fitness and improve balance performance and confidence.</p><p>There are a number of limitations to the present study. First, as the sample size,
particularly in the VT group, was quite small, there was inadequate statistical power to
obtain significant results. Second, the attrition rate was quite high, with 33.3% of the
subjects from the VT group and 18.5% of the subjects from the control group failing to
complete the final assessment. The reasons for drop out are unknown, as the subjects were
lost to follow-up, so selective drop out from the VT training was possible. Third, the
limited training period may have been insufficient to detect significant improvements in the
outcome parameters. Finally, the participants were not randomized and the assessor was not
blinded, which may have introduced bias and confounded the results. Based on this study, it
is not possible to establish causal relationships between practicing VT martial arts and the
aforementioned physical benefits. Further studies should include a larger randomized sample,
blind assessments, a comprehensive training protocol and documentation, and a longer VT
training period to identify the beneficial effects. Moreover, including older participants
may also be appropriate because physical performance declines significantly after 80&#x02005;years
of age<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup> but fall-prevention exercise
programs currently available usually target individuals who are younger than 80&#x02005;years
old<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. Evidence-based VT
fall-prevention programs should be developed for people in their 80s.</p><p>To conclude, Ving Tsun martial art might be a potential fall-prevention exercise, as it
might improve radial bone strength, lower limb muscular strength, functional balance
performance, and balance self-efficacy in the elderly population. Further studies with more
participants and a longer intervention period are needed to provide more robust evidence of
these beneficial effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Shun Ching Ving Tsun Martial Arts Association for providing Ving Tsun training
