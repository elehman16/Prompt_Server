Fifteen subjects were each assigned to a mirror therapy group and a sham therapy group.
The Fugl-Meyer Motor Function Assessment and the Box and Block Test were performed to
compare paretic upper-extremity function and hand coordination abilities. The functional
independence measurement was conducted to compare abilities to perform activities of daily
living. [Results] Paretic upper-extremity function and hand coordination abilities were
significantly different between the mirror therapy and sham therapy groups. Intervention
in the mirror therapy group was more effective than in the sham therapy group for
improving the ability to perform activities of daily living. Self-care showed
statistically significant differences between the two groups. [Conclusion] Mirror therapy
is effective in improving paretic upper-extremity function and activities of daily living
in chronic stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Mirror therapy</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Upper extremity function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>At least 85% of stroke patients experience hemiplegia and upper-extremity function of at

applied mirror therapy to patients with chronic stroke of at least a 6 month duration who
were in stage IV according to the Brunnstrom recovery scale. Furthermore, this study
examined the effects of the therapy on upper-extremity function and activities of daily
living in these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with 30 adult hemiplegic patients. Before the interventions were
conducted, the homogeneity of the upper-extremity function of the paretic side and the
abilities of the patients in the two groups to perform activities of daily living were
assessed. The subject selection criteria were as follows: 1) a diagnosis of hemiplegia due
to stroke; 2) scores of &#x02265; 24 points on the Mini-Mental State Exam-Korean (MMSE-K), which
indicated the patients had no difficulty with cognitive functions; 3) paretic
upper-extremity movements corresponding to Brunnstrom&#x02019;s stage IV classification; 4) no
difficulties with perceptual abilities, including hemineglect based on the Motor-free Visual
Perception Test (MVPT); 5) stroke of at least a 6 month duration; and 6) voluntary consent
to participate in the study. Fifteen of the patients were assigned to the mirror therapy
intervention, while the other 15 were used as the control group. This study was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of Inje University. The general subject characteristics of

cards, and the cards were randomly selected for each group. Information regarding gender,
age, dates of onset, and lesion sites were obtained through the medical records and the
MMSE-K. The mirror group participated in the mirror therapy program five times a week for 30
minutes for four weeks, in addition to conventional occupational therapy. The control group
was treated with a sham therapy program five times a week for 30 minutes for four weeks, in
addition to the conventional occupational therapy. After the interventions, the paretic
upper-extremity function, hand coordination abilities, and abilities to perform activities
of daily living were re-evaluated with the FMA, BBT, and FIM. To maintain consistency, these
parameters were evaluated by the same occupational therapist before and after the treatment
in both groups.</p><p>The mirror therapy program of Yavuzer et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> was applied to the study subjects. The paretic hand of the patient
was placed on the back of the mirror, and the nonparetic hand was placed in front of the
mirror. When the program began, the patient was instructed to gaze at the nonparetic upper
extremity reflected in the mirror. The mirror showed the reflected movements of the
nonparetic side only. The pronation and supination of the forearm and the flexion and
extension movements of the wrist and fingers on the nonparetic side were performed
sequentially. Five sets of each motion consisting of 30 motions/set were conducted, and a
resting time of one minute was given after each set. Each motion was explained by the
therapist, and the therapist assisted the patient if assistance was necessary. The sham
therapy applied to the control group was conducted in the same way as the therapy applied in
the mirror group except that the reflected movements of the nonparetic hand could not be
observed because of the use of non-reflecting mirrors.</p><p>The collected data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Descriptive statistics were used to examine the general characteristics of the subjects.
Independent sample t-tests were performed to compare paretic upper-extremity function and
the abilities of the two groups to perform activities of daily living before and after
intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The paretic upper-extremity function and coordination abilities were significantly

activities of daily living in chronic stroke patients. In contrast to previous mirror
therapy studies, which were conducted with subacute stroke patients<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, this study focused on chronic stroke patients. According
to previous work, bilateral motor training is effective in enhancing the activity of the
motor cortex and the recovery of motor functions in chronic stroke patients<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consistent with this previous study, the
present findings showed the upper-extremity items in FMA improved when mirror therapy was
applied.</p><p>Differences in upper-extremity function after intervention in the mirror group were
compared with those in the control group treated with sham therapy. The mirror group showed
significantly greater differences compared to the control group, with improvements in
paretic upper-extremity functions (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Similar results were reported by Yavuzer et
al.,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> indicating that visual illusions
that make patients feel as if their two hands are symmetrically moving simultaneously
activate both the left and right cerebral hemispheres and increase the excitability of the
paretic limb.</p><p>Based on the present result, the mirror group showed a significant improvement in the
abilities to perform activities of daily living compared to the control group. The bilateral
upper-limb training in mirror therapy using visual feedback improved paretic upper-extremity
function, which, in turn, enhanced the performance of activities of daily living. The area
of self-care showed statistically significant differences when the subitems of the abilities
to perform activities of daily living in the mirror group were compared with those of the
control group. This finding is attributed to the recovery of upper-extremity function.
Improvement in self-care is one of the most important aspects in performing activities of
daily living<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. That is, if unable to
independently perform self-care, the patient cannot live independently and must depend on
family members or others for assistance.</p><p>This study confirmed that mirror therapy is effective in improving upper-extremity function
and self-care in the performance of activities of daily living. A limitation of this study
is that the patients met specific selection criteria; hence, the findings cannot be
generalized to all stroke patients. In addition, patients with visual-field defects and
hemineglect were excluded from this study. Studies with patients with visual-field defects
and hemineglect are needed, in addition to long-term follow-up studies to determine whether
the interventional effects are sustained. Mirror therapy programs tailored to patients with
different levels of functioning and Brunnstrom&#x02019;s stages should be developed. In addition,
studies that use brain images are necessary to examine the effects of mirror therapy on the
activation of the brain in stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Luke</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Dodd</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Brock</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Outcomes of the Bobath concept on upper limb recovery
