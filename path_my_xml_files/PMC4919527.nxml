Animal research suggests that colon-derived SCFAs modulate feeding behavior via central mechanisms. In humans, increased colonic production of the SCFA propionate acutely reduces energy intake. However, evidence of an effect of colonic propionate on the human brain or reward-based eating behavior is currently unavailable.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We investigated the effect of increased colonic propionate production on brain anticipatory reward responses during food picture evaluation. We hypothesized that elevated colonic propionate would reduce both reward responses and ad libitum energy intake via stimulation of anorexigenic gut hormone secretion.</p><p><bold>Design:</bold> In a randomized crossover design, 20 healthy nonobese men completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) food picture evaluation task after consumption of control inulin or inulin-propionate ester, a unique dietary compound that selectively augments colonic propionate production. The blood oxygen level&#x02013;dependent (BOLD) signal was measured in a priori brain regions involved in reward processing, including the caudate, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, anterior insula, and orbitofrontal cortex (<italic>n</italic> = 18 had analyzable fMRI data).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Increasing colonic propionate production reduced BOLD signal during food picture evaluation in the caudate and nucleus accumbens. In the caudate, the reduction in BOLD signal was driven specifically by a lowering of the response to high-energy food. These central effects were partnered with a decrease in subjective appeal of high-energy food pictures and reduced energy intake during an ad libitum meal. These observations were not related to changes in blood peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucose, or insulin concentrations.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results suggest that colonic propionate production may play an important role in attenuating reward-based eating behavior via striatal pathways, independent of changes in plasma PYY and GLP-1.

The hedonic properties and constant availability of highly palatable energy-dense foods promote their overconsumption and weight gain, whereas hedonic and reward-based eating behaviors are in turn influenced by peripheral homeostatic signals such as gut hormones (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Hedonic responses to food are thought to involve a network of corticolimbic brain structures, and are modulated by emotional and cognitive factors, as well as sensory cues and anticipated reward.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that metabolites produced by the colonic microbiota may affect central appetite regulation (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Resistant starch (RS)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5"><sup>12</sup></xref> supplementation alters activation in hypothalamic nuclei and gene expression of neuropeptides involved in appetite regulation in rodents (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The consumption of nondigestible carbohydrates (NDCs) also reduces energy intake and weight gain in animal models (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Several physiologic benefits associated with the consumption of RS and other NDCs may be mediated through the actions of their fermentation products, namely, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The principal SCFAs produced via bacterial fermentation are acetate, propionate, and butyrate, present in the colon in the approximate molar ratio of 60:20:20 (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Our research group demonstrated that increasing circulating acetate directly suppresses appetite via central hypothalamic mechanisms in rodents (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Our recent findings from human studies suggest that propionate may also be an important SCFA contributing to appetite regulation (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The acute intake of an inulin-propionate ester (IPE), which selectively increases colonic propionate production, reduced ad libitum energy intake and increased plasma concentrations of the anorexigenic gut hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), supporting results of in vitro experiments (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Furthermore, a long-term elevation in colonic propionate production protected against weight gain and reduced hepatic lipid content (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The exogenous administration of GLP-1 or its analogs and/or PYY reduces brain reward system responses to viewing food pictures in humans (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, to date, to our knowledge, there are no studies demonstrating an effect of SCFAs on human brain food-reward responses to influence eating behavior. In the present study, we examined the effect of an acute increase in colonic propionate production on energy intake and brain regions involved with reward processing and hedonic eating, including caudate, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, anterior insula, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), in healthy nonobese men in a randomized crossover design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). We used fMRI to measure activation by the BOLD signal in these regions of interest during an established food evaluation task that used high energy (HE)&#x02013; and low energy (LE)&#x02013;density food pictures (primary outcome measure) (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). We hypothesized that increasing colonic propionate production after intake of IPE would reduce anticipatory reward responses during evaluation of food pictures, a measure of food cue reactivity, compared with control inulin via the stimulation of the anorexigenic gut hormones GLP-1 and PYY (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and would reduce ad libitum energy intake.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Study day protocol.

Exclusion criteria included the following: weight gain or loss &#x0003e;3 kg in the previous 3 mo, any chronic illness or gastrointestinal disorder, history of drug or alcohol abuse in the previous 2 y, use of antibiotics or medications likely to interfere with energy homeostasis in the previous 3 mo, claustrophobia, contraindications for MRI scanning, daily smoking, gluten or lactose intolerance, consumption of a vegan or vegetarian diet, or depression as assessed by a Beck Depression Inventory II score &#x0003e;10 (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Food supplements</title><p>IPE designed for targeted delivery of propionate to the colon was produced as previously described (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Inulin was chosen as a control supplement, with the use of the same inulin used to prepare both the IPE and control supplements. This controlled for residual fermentation of the backbone NDC. In vitro fermentations of IPE and inulin suggest comparable increases in acetate and butyrate production; thus, any differences in our outcome measures can be attributed to the preferential increase in propionate production with IPE (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Study day protocol</title><p>Twenty healthy men participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subject, single-blind crossover study. Subjects attended 2 separate study visits &#x02265;6 d apart after an overnight fast.

Weight, height, and body fat measurements were collected with the use of bioimpedance analysis (BC-418 analyzer; Tanita UK). At each visit, subjects completed a Positive and Negative Affect Schedule to measure mood during the previous week (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).

Breakfast was a chocolate milkshake and snack bar (574.5 kcal; 86.4 g carbohydrate, 18.8 g fat, 14.7 g protein, and 3.2 g fiber). Lunch (180 min) was a cheese sandwich and snack bar (558 kcal; 62.3 g carbohydrate, 24.9 g fat, 21.7 g protein, and 2.8 g fiber).</p><p>At 300 min, subjects completed a 60-min MRI session (Siemens 3T Verio MRI scanner) in the Imperial Clinical Imaging Facility.

An acute increase in colonic propionate reduced the BOLD signal during an evaluation of food pictures in the caudate (dorsal striatum) and nucleus accumbens (ventral striatum) in nonobese men, which was greater for HE than for LE foods. Indeed, in the caudate, elevated colonic propionate specifically reduced the BOLD signal during evaluation of HE but not LE food pictures. Increased colonic propionate production also reduced the appeal of HE food pictures and prolonged the time taken to rate their appeal, an implicit measure that suggested reduced wanting (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Furthermore, this reduced activation in striatal brain reward systems was accompanied by a reduction in ad libitum energy intake. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that an acute increase in colonic propionate or any other SCFA has been shown to significantly reduce anticipatory food hedonic responses and associated BOLD signal changes in brain regions associated with reward processing in humans.</p><p>Changes in striatal the BOLD signal to food cues previously have been associated with physiologically relevant alterations in food reward processing and eating behavior (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In the satiated fed compared with fasted state, there is a reduction in the ventral striatum BOLD signal during evaluation of HE compared with LE food pictures, and a preferential reduction in the appeal of HE foods, when an fMRI paradigm identical to that of the current study is used (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The reduced ventral striatum BOLD signal to HE food pictures in the fed compared with fasted state has also been correlated with a subsequent reduction in ad libitum energy intake (<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Similarly, satiation decreases BOLD responses to food taste in the nucleus accumbens (<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), whereas duration of food deprivation correlates with a greater caudate BOLD signal in response to actual and anticipated receipt of palatable food (<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Satiation also decreases regional cerebral blood flow at rest, another marker of neuronal activity, in the caudate and nucleus accumbens (<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Greater activation in the nucleus accumbens to food pictures is predictive of future snack consumption and reduced weight loss success in an obesity lifestyle intervention (<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Alterations in caudate activation to actual or anticipated receipt of HE palatable food have been linked to genetic variations in the dopamine receptor D2 (<italic>DRD2</italic>) gene, which is highly expressed in the striatum and linked to increased BMI, familial risk of obesity, and prospective weight gain (<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In addition, after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, obese patients have lower activation in the caudate and nucleus accumbens when HE foods are evaluated, and have lower HE food appeal than patients after gastric banding surgery (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Acute suppression of plasma PYY and GLP-1 in patients after RYGB surgery increases food reward responses in the nucleus accumbens (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). RYGB has been associated with increased colonic propionate production in animal models (<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). This evidence supports a role of the striatum in altered reward processing and food consumption patterns. It suggests that increased colonic propionate may modulate the engagement of this brain-reward circuit, resulting in a reduction in energy intake, although we could not demonstrate a direct correlation between changes in the BOLD signal and energy intake in our study.</p><p>Previous research in animal models supports the role of NDCs and SCFAs in central appetite regulation. RS supplementation reduces activity in hypothalamic appetite regulation centers as assessed by manganese-enhanced MRI and stimulates anorexigenic hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin expression in rodents (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Acetate itself suppresses appetite via central hypothalamic mechanisms (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and also has been shown to have other central effects (<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). By contrast, no known studies have investigated the effect of SCFAs on central appetite regulation in humans. We did not find any significant effect of elevated colonic propionate on the hypothalamic BOLD signal during food picture evaluation in the current study. However, BOLD imaging in the hypothalamus has poor reliability related to its small-size, partial-volume effects because of close proximity to the third ventricle and cerebrospinal fluid spaces, and artifact from the internal carotid artery. Furthermore, an interpretation of changes in the overall BOLD signal in the hypothalamus may be complicated by the multiple smaller hypothalamic nuclei containing both orexigenic and anorexigenic feeding neurons.</p><p>One of the major limitations of NDC supplementation is that large doses are needed to observe effects that are in line with those noted in animal studies. For example, our research group previously has shown that &#x0003e;35 g NDC/d is needed to suppress appetite and stimulate an increase in plasma PYY concentrations (<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). However, the development of IPE uniquely allows for the targeted delivery of a known amount of propionate directly to the colon, which normally only would be obtained from a high-fiber diet, without the associated gastrointestinal side effects (e.g., abdominal bloating or flatulence). We have previously shown with the use of a <sup>13</sup>C-labeled variant of IPE that &#x0003e;80% of the bound propionate is released coincident with breath hydrogen. This suggests delivery of the majority of bound propionate to the colon (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). We estimate that a 10-g dose of IPE delivers 2.36 g propionate to the colon, which is 2.5 times habitual daily propionate production. In the current study, the breath hydrogen data suggests significant fermentation by 210 min and at the time of the MRI session. Despite this, we were unable to detect any difference in serum propionate between treatments. Our current measurement may have lacked sensitivity to record minor increases in peripheral circulatory propionate, particularly when measured at a single postprandial time point. This is unsurprising, because &#x0003e;95% propionate present in the portal vein is extracted by the liver, resulting in only a minor fraction reaching the peripheral circulation (<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Nevertheless, we have previously demonstrated a significant increase in propionate <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in the peripheral circulation, revealing that the bound propionate from IPE is absorbed from the gut and is available systemically (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The significant increase in butyrate observed after both treatments could be explained by the interconversion of acetate to butyrate from microbial fermentation of inulin (<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). However, it is unclear why this would be reflected in serum butyrate when splanchnic extraction has been shown to balance gut butyrate production (<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p><p>In addition to reduced striatal responses to food pictures, we observed a 9.5% reduction in energy intake after subjects received IPE, in line with previous observations (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, there was no difference in plasma PYY and GLP-1 concentrations between treatments, a finding that is not in line with our original hypothesis. It previously has been demonstrated that an increased intake of NDCs and colonic SCFA production can improve body composition and reduce energy intake independent of changes in peripheral gut hormone concentrations in mice (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). This suggests that alternative mechanisms are responsible for the appetite-regulating effects associated with the consumption of NDCs and SCFAs, and for the changes in the striatal BOLD signal and food appeal during food picture evaluation in the current study. Propionate is a gluconeogenic precursor, both at the gut epithelium and liver, and ruminant studies consistently have demonstrated that an elevated portal concentration of propionate depresses energy intake, which is abolished with hepatic vagotomy or total hepatic innervation (<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). However, we did not identify any difference in blood glucose or insulin concentrations between treatments, in agreement with previous reports (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Other possible mechanisms driving our observations may be via the induction of vagal signaling in the gut or portal vein through stimulation of free fatty acid receptor 3 (<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Further work is needed to gain a better understanding of the gut&#x02013;liver&#x02013;brain signaling pathways in response to increased colonic propionate. This would provide information about whether our observations are a direct effect of propionate on neural pathways or a secondary response mechanism to propionate metabolism.</p><p>We believe the major strengths of our study are the following: <italic>1</italic>) the use of fMRI, a well-validated noninvasive measure of human brain activity; <italic>2</italic>) the incorporation of a well-established food evaluation paradigm that is sensitive to peripheral signals influencing appetite and reward-based eating behavior, such as gut hormones and after bariatric surgery (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>); <italic>3</italic>) the exclusion of nonspecific effects on the BOLD signal with the use of a control fMRI task; and <italic>4</italic>) the within-subject crossover design. A limitation of our study is the lack of energy intake data for 5 subjects, which may have reduced the ability to detect correlations between outcome measures. Another limitation was the inclusion of only a nonobese male cohort. The findings will need confirmation in an obese cohort and in women, who may have altered reward and emotional responses to food. The effect of long-term IPE supplementation on striatal reward responses also remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In conclusion, elevated colonic propionate significantly reduced the striatal BOLD signal during evaluation of HE foods, reduced HE food picture appeal, and reduced energy intake at an ad libitum meal in nonobese men, an effect that was independent of changes in plasma PYY, GLP-1, and glucose and serum insulin. These results suggest that colonic propionate may play an important role in human appetitive and reward-based eating behavior at least in part through brain striatal pathways.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Tom Clarkson for the synthesis of the inulin-propionate ester and Milena Rundle, Amin Alamshah, Katerina Petropoulou, and Annette Henry for their assistance with the radioimmunoassay.</p><p>The authors&#x02019; responsibilities were as follows&#x02014;APG and GSF: designed the study; CSB, ESC, and HA: recruited the subjects; DJM, TP, and CT: provided the materials; CSB, ESC, HA, NC, JF, CI, and AB: collected the data; CSB, ESC, APG, and GSF: analyzed the data; CSB, ESC, DJM, IG-P, SF, EH, APG, and GSF: interpreted the data and wrote the manuscript; and all authors: read and approved the final manuscript.
