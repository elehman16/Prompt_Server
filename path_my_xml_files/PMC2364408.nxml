        <p><italic>Objective:</italic> A study was carried out to compare 3 treatment regimens
for vaginal candidiasis.</p> 
<p><italic>Methods:</italic> A total of 150 women with clinical and mycological evidence of vaginal candidiasis were
randomized to receive 50 mg of oral fluconazole daily for 6 days (50 women), a single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole (50 women), or 100 mg of intravaginal clotrimazole daily for 6 days (50 women). They were assessed at 5&#x02013;15 days (short-term assessment) and again at 30&#x02013;60 days (long-term assessment) after the completion of treatment.</p>
<p><italic>Results:</italic> <italic>Candida</italic> species were completely eradicated from the vagina in 88% or 80% in the 6-day oral fluconzaole group, 76% or 70% in the single oral fluconazole group, and 72% or 60% in the intravaginal clotrimazole group at short-term or long-term
assessment, respectively. The rates of clinical effectiveness were 92% or 88% in the 6-day oral fluconzaole group, 80% or 76% in the single oral fluconazole group, and 72% or 58% in the intravaginal clotrimazole group at the short-term or long-term assessment, respectively. Treatment-related side effects
were not found in any group.</p>
 <p><italic>Conclusions:</italic> This study suggests that the treatment of vaginal candidiasis with oral fluconazole is effective and that a single oral fluconazole dose might be one choice in the treatment of vaginal candidiasis.
