Awareness about the new methods and strategies for tracheal tube extubation is necessary for a safe and successful extubation. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of laryngeal mask airway (LMA), streamlined liner of the pharyngeal airway (SLIPA) and I-gel in extubation time of tracheal tube. A one-single randomized clinical trial was conducted in 105 eligible patients in three groups including LMA, SLIPA and I-gel. The patients were under surgery after general anesthesia with propofol (2&#x02013;3 mg/kg) and fentanyl (1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g/kg). Hemodynamic responses and extubation consequences including coughing rate, laryngospasm, airway obstruction, apnea, breath holding and straining of patients, vomiting, and need for re-intubation were recorded every 5 minutes since inserting of supraglottic airway devices (SADs) until patients restore consciousness. Analysis of data was conducted in SPSS software by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and ANOVA for repeated measurements tests. The overall successful insertion was 100% for LMA and I-Gel and this rate was 97.1% for SLIPA method. A significant decrease was observed in trend of hemodynamic responses in all three groups. Nevertheless, the MBP was lower in LMA group and lower HR was observed in I-Gel and higher HR occurred in SLIPA (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Three groups was same statistically regarding sore throat, vomiting, coughing, breath holding, apnea, laryngospasm, and re-intubation need (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). However, the incidence rate of apnea, and laryngospasm, as well as re-intubation need in SLIPA group was 2.9%, respectively. LMA, I-GEL and SLIPA could be considered as useful and safe devices for ventilation control after tracheal tube removal at the end of operation. Three devices were same regarding to sore throat, vomiting, coughing, and breath holding. However, LMA showed lower side effects while SLIPA was related to more occurrences of apnea, laryngospasm, and re-intubation need.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anesthesia</kwd><kwd>extubation</kwd><kwd>I-Gel</kwd><kwd>Intubation</kwd><kwd>laryngeal mask airway</kwd><kwd>pharyngeal airway</kwd><kwd>streamlined liner of the pharyngeal airway</kwd><kwd>supraglottic airway devices</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Removal of endotracheal tubes is an important stage in the recovery from general anesthesia and may have some potential risks.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Early extubation could reduce the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) in patients who have been intubated and undergoing mechanical ventilation. Moreover, it increases the patient comfort and the ability of airway cleaning due to effective coughing. However, defeat in extubation and re-intubation is one cause of prolonging stay of patients under mechanical ventilation and increasing the mortality, treatment costs and need for tracheostomy.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> According to studies by the American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA), obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are at higher risk in complications during extubation.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In addition, aging, long staying under mechanical ventilation, anemia, increased underlying disease severity, continuous intravenous sedation, and extubation without previous planning are associated with the increased risk of extubation failure in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>In common surgical operations the adverse events are more common after removal of tracheal tube in contrast to the tracheal intubation.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Moreover, these extubation complications including tachycardia, hypertension and hypotension occur in patients with ischemic heart disease at the time of patient extubation and recovery period.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Moreover, respiratory complications including trauma around the pharynx and larynx, coughing, decreased oxygen saturation of the blood, breath holding, masseter spasm, laryngospasm, airway obstruction, and aspiration may occur.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Increase awareness about the new methods and strategies for tracheal tube extubation are necessary for a safe and successful extubation with regard to increasing consequences of tube removal. Therefore, using standard tools for extubation should be have minimum characteristics such as the ability to ventilate and oxygenate, help to re-intubation in emergency times, access to the airway, non-interference with the patient's comfort and without side effects. For this reason, use of supraglottic airway devices (SADs), Stylet, or endotracheal tube exchanger are recommended by the ASA for high-risk patients.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Advantages of using SADs are the lack of laryngoscopy, less invasion of the respiratory tract, better patient tolerance, ease of insertation and less coughing.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and Streamlined liner of the pharyngeal airway (SLIPA) and I-gel are some various types of SADs.

Therefore, sometimes by awakening the patients at the end of the procedure, some complications might be occurring despite the fact that the tracheal extubation criteria are met. However, since there were no comparative studies the safety and effectiveness of SLIPA and I-gel, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of using SLIPA and I-gel with laryngeal mask in extubation time of tracheal tube.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study is a one-single randomized clinical trial that conducted on patients undergoing elective surgery in lower limbs after general anesthesia.

Isoflurane and mixed 50% of nitrous oxide and oxygen were used to continue the general anesthesia, at the end of the surgery and after the anesthetic gases have stopped and throat suctioned under direct vision the Laryngeal mask placed behind the trachea with empty cuff in the first group.
