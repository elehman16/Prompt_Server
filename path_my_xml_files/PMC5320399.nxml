Maize is a common staple, and milling affects nutrient and nutrient-modifier profiles.</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> We investigated the interaction of maize milling methods (i.e., whole grain compared with refined) in male Mongolian gerbils aged 29&#x02013;35 d with conventionally bred provitamin A&#x02013;biofortified (orange) or white maize on VA and zinc status.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Study 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 67) was a 2 &#x000d7; 3 milling (whole compared with refined) by VA [no&#x02013;vitamin A placebo group (VA&#x02212;), orange, and VA-supplemented group (VA+)] design, with 4 wk of VA depletion followed by six 4-wk treatments (<italic>n</italic> = 10/treatment). Study 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 33) was a 2 &#x000d7; 2 milling-by-zinc [no-zinc placebo group (Zn&#x02212;) compared with zinc-supplemented group (Zn+)] design, including 2 wk of VA depletion followed by four 3-wk treatments (<italic>n</italic> = 8&#x02013;9/treatment). For study 1, positive and negative control groups were given supplemental VA at equimolar amounts to &#x003b2;-carotene equivalents consumed by the orange groups (74 &#x000b1; 5 nmol/d) or placebo, respectively. For study 2, positive and negative control groups were given 152 &#x003bc;g Zn/d or placebo, respectively.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Milling significantly affected zinc concentration, providing 44&#x02013;45% (whole grain) or 9&#x02013;14% (refined) NRC requirements. In study 1, orange maize improved liver VA concentrations (mean &#x000b1; SD: 0.28 &#x000b1; 0.08 &#x003bc;mol/g) compared with the white maize groups (0.072 &#x000b1; 0.054 &#x003bc;mol/g). Provitamin A bioefficacy was similar. In study 2, neither zinc nor milling influenced liver retinol. Refined Zn&#x02212; gerbils weighed less than others by day 14 (46.6 &#x000b1; 7.1 compared with 56.5 &#x000b1; 3.5 g, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Milling affected pancreas zinc concentrations (refined Zn&#x02212;: 21.1 &#x000b1; 1.8 &#x003bc;g Zn/g; whole Zn&#x02212;: 32.5 &#x000b1; 5.8 &#x003bc;g Zn/g).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Whole-grain intake improved zinc and did not affect provitamin A bioefficacy. Other factors affected by milling (e.g., shelf life, preference, aflatoxin fractioning) need to be considered to maximize health.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>bioconversion</kwd><kwd>iron</kwd><kwd>retinol</kwd><kwd>vitamin A</kwd><kwd>pancreas</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Micronutrient deficiencies, including vitamin A (VA)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5"><sup>8</sup></xref> and zinc, are prevalent and lead to considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Approximately 30% of the world&#x02019;s population has inadequate zinc intakes, contributing to 28 million disability-adjusted life years because of diseases attributable to zinc deficiency (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The primary clinical effects of inadequate zinc intake are reduced growth, impaired immune function, and adverse pregnancy outcomes (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Furthermore, 190 million preschool-aged children and 19.1 million pregnant women are estimated to be at risk for VA deficiency (VAD) (defined by serum retinol concentrations &#x0003c;0.7 &#x003bc;mol/L), further increasing morbidity, the risk of death, and the same clinical adverse effects as zinc inadequacy (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Considering that the regional prevalence of zinc inadequacy and VAD have substantial overlap (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), it is pertinent to address multiple micronutrients to maximize benefit in target populations.</p><p>Biofortification is a plant-breeding or agronomic strategy to increase the nutrient content of staple crops. Maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) is a target for increasing provitamin A carotenoids because populations at risk for VAD consume white maize varieties that are devoid of carotenoids as a staple food. Biofortified orange varieties have been shown to be efficacious in improving or maintaining VA status in gerbils and humans (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Zinc is also a target for biofortification (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>); however, many factors affect the zinc content of crops and its bioavailability, including soil zinc content, plant genetics, and zinc absorption inhibitors (e.g., phytates, fiber) (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the milling method affects numerous nutritional aspects of maize (among other crops), including zinc, fiber, fat, and amino acid contents (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Zinc and fiber have several interactions with VA and provitamin A carotenoids in humans. For example, zinc is essential for retinol-binding protein synthesis, and fiber inhibits &#x003b2;-carotene absorption (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, the interactions of VA and zinc status are not entirely clear, and it has been suggested that zinc is required for &#x003b2;-carotene bioconversion (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The liver is the primary storage site of VA; therefore, liver concentrations are the gold standard for VA status assessment because liver stores can be mobilized during times of low dietary intake (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Serum retinol concentrations are homeostatically controlled over a wide range of liver reserves and thus are not a sensitive indicator of VA status (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Although most zinc is found in bone and skeletal muscles (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), the liver and pancreas are part of the rapidly exchanging zinc pool in the body and respond to dietary zinc intake (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The pancreas is implicated in regulating zinc homeostasis through zinc binding and transport proteins that control excretion into the gastrointestinal tract (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Furthermore, pancreatic zinc concentrations have been shown to be more sensitive to dietary zinc intakes than liver in mice (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In addition, King and Keen (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) have shown that fecal zinc concentrations indicate the homeostatic regulation of absorption and excretion and respond to differences in dietary intake.</p><p>Investigating the nutritional impact of the milling method is pertinent because it is a modifiable factor that could be readily implemented. Although milling affects various nutrients and nutrient modifiers within consumed foods, its effects on provitamin A carotenoid bioefficacy and zinc status must be established to inform biofortification and nutrition education efforts. This study investigates the interaction between the milling method of maize and provitamin A carotenoid content on liver VA and zinc status in Mongolian gerbils (<italic>Meriones unguiculatus</italic>), which are useful as models because they absorb and metabolize provitamin A carotenoids similar to humans (i.e., they partially cleave provitamin A carotenoids to meet VA needs and absorb extra provitamin A carotenoids intact) (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Zinc tissue concentrations have also been studied in gerbils fed standard rodent diets (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Maize.</title><p>The biofortified orange maize was developed at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center as part of the HarvestPlus biofortified maize research project (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The orange maize was formed by making all possible crosses and mixing the resultant seed with the use of 5 maize lines bred for a high concentration (17&#x02013;24 &#x003bc;g/g) of provitamin A, most of which is &#x003b2;-carotene. The seed was shipped from Mexico to Zambia. The grain of this orange maize variety was produced on a commercial farm in Central Province, Zambia. After being harvested, the grain was analyzed and had &#x0223c;18 &#x003bc;g &#x003b2;-carotene equivalents (&#x003b2;-CEs)/g. White maize was a common variety purchased from local farmers in Eastern Province, Zambia. Maize was processed according to refined or whole-grain milling methods by a small mill that serves a rural community. Refining maize removes the germ and pericarp. After being harvested, orange maize was stored in a freezer at &#x02212;20 to &#x02212;10&#x000b0;C for &#x0223c;5 mo until 2 wk before it was ground; white maize was harvested the same year, kept dry, and stored at room temperature for &#x0223c;4&#x02013;5 mo until grinding. The ground maize meals were stored in a freezer at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until being delivered to the University of Wisconsin&#x02013;Madison (UW) for use in these studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Feed.</title><p>The feed was the same between studies and was formulated to be 50% maize by weight, with maize providing the only source of zinc and VA in the form of provitamin A carotenoids (<bold>Supplemental Table 1</bold>). Maize was referred to by its milling method and provitamin A content (white or orange): whole white (WW), refined white (RW), whole orange (WO), and refined orange (RO). All other constituents were constant. Macronutrient content consisted of &#x0223c;21.6% protein, 46.1% carbohydrates, and 6.8% fat by weight and provided 3.3 kcal/g, which met or exceeded the macronutrient proportions recommended by the NRC (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Note, however, that refining maize may affect several nutritive and nonnutritive components, and the macronutrient profile could deviate from that which was estimated. The RO meal (16.4 &#x000b1; 0.1 &#x003bc;g &#x003b2;-CEs/g) was mixed with the RW meal in a 78.4:21.6 (wt:wt) ratio to equalize it with the WO (12.9 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x003bc;g &#x003b2;-CEs/g) group for &#x003b2;-carotene concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Gerbils.</title><p>Male Mongolian gerbils aged 29&#x02013;35 d (study 1) or 31&#x02013;34 d (study 2) (Charles River Laboratories) were housed in groups (2&#x02212;3/cage) during VA depletion and treatment (2&#x02013;3/cage) in hanging wire-bottom cages to prevent coprophagy and mineral recycling. Animal handling procedures were approved by the UW College of Agricultural and Life Sciences Animal Care and Use Committee. Gerbils were weighed daily for 2.5 wk and 3 times/wk thereafter. Feed intake was measured daily by weighing the provided feed and subtracting the remaining and wasted feed. Room temperature and humidity were held constant with a 12-h light/dark cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>Study designs.</title><p>For study 1, gerbils were fed RW (<italic>n</italic> = 33) or WW (<italic>n</italic> = 34) during VA depletion (days 0&#x02013;27) and received 50 &#x003bc;L cottonseed oil 3 times/wk to acclimate them to dosing procedures. After 28 d, 7 gerbils were killed while under isoflurane. The remaining gerbils were weight-matched and allocated into groups (<italic>n</italic> = 10/group) for the treatment period (days 28&#x02013;56) such that gerbils remained on feeds with the same milling method. White maize (RW and WW) included positive and negative VA control groups: the VA-supplemented group (VA+) was given VA equimolar to &#x003b2;-carotene consumed in orange groups the previous day as retinyl acetate in &#x0223c;50 &#x003bc;L cottonseed oil, and the no-VA placebo group (VA&#x02212;) and orange groups were given the same volume of placebo oil. Daily doses were administered orally with a positive displacement pipette. All gerbils were killed after 28 d of treatment (day 56).</p><p>For study 2, gerbils were fed RW (<italic>n</italic> = 17) or WW (<italic>n</italic> = 16) during depletion (study days 0&#x02013;15). Zinc-supplemented (Zn+) groups (refined Zn+ or whole Zn+) received 152 &#x003bc;g Zn/d as aqueous ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, and no-zinc placebo (Zn&#x02212;) groups (refined Zn&#x02212; or whole Zn&#x02212;) received a placebo (both 50 &#x003bc;L orally) with added sucrose (6% wt:vol) to increase palatability. After depletion, all gerbils were switched to orange maize with the same milling method as during depletion and continued receiving either zinc or the placebo for 21 d. All gerbils were killed on day 36. The liver, pancreas, and serum were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis. Femur length was measured with the use of digital calipers. Both studies are shown in <bold>Supplemental Figure 1</bold>.</p></sec><sec><title>Carotenoid, retinol, and zinc analyses.</title><p>All samples were analyzed on a wet-weight basis, and data are reported as such.

Furthermore, a phenotypic difference in fur coat color was observed in all study 1 treatment groups based on the milling method, whereby prolonged refined maize intake resulted in gray patches of fur compared with standard brown. This observation was assessed in study 2 with the use of a colorimeter to measure changes and differences in fur color (Supplemental Figure 3). Although some milling, zinc, and time interactions significantly affected fur color, including lightening of the groups that were fed refined maize with time, the same magnitude of difference among treatment groups as subjectively observed in study 1 did not occur, likely because of the shorter duration of study 2. Thus, we were not able to definitively determine whether this was caused by reduced zinc intake alone or from other changes during the refining process.</p><p>In both studies, gerbil BW differences during the depletion period were reflected by a difference in feed intake, which lasted through week 4 of both studies (Supplemental Figure 2). In study 2, the refined Zn&#x02212; group had the lowest intakes, and a significant time-by-milling-by-zinc interaction indicated that it was the lack of zinc that caused a reduction in feed intake, a known phenomenon in numerous species, including rats, swine, guinea pigs, and humans (<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Zinc given orally to zinc-deprived rats increased feed intake through appetite-stimulating peptides coupled with the vagus nerve (<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The literature is inconsistent in regard to whether reduced growth during zinc deficiency is purely the result of reduced feed intake or whether the lack of zinc inhibits the growth process. Pair-fed zinc-adequate gerbils grew faster than zinc-deficient gerbils, but other studies found no difference between groups (<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Regardless, low zinc feeds prepared from 50% refined maize decreased both feed intake and BW in these studies.</p><p>Liver and pancreatic zinc concentrations were used as markers of zinc status (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In study 2, both outcomes were affected by zinc, and the pancreas had a milling-by-zinc interaction. The refined Zn&#x02212; group had the lowest zinc concentrations, whereas Zn+ groups were not different from one another. The whole-grain Zn&#x02212; group had higher pancreatic zinc concentrations than the refined Zn&#x02212; group at endline. Thus, gerbil pancreatic zinc concentrations reflected differences in dietary zinc intake. Although liver zinc concentrations did not differ in study 1, they did respond to dietary zinc in study 2, which is likely because of more total zinc and the higher bioavailability of the aqueous zinc supplement (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Liver zinc concentrations were similar to published values after a correction factor of 3.3 was used to account for the water weight of rodent livers (<xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) (&#x0223c;30 &#x003bc;g/g; range of different feeds: 30&#x02013;110 &#x003bc;g Zn/g) (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). One study reported higher values (&#x0223c;130 &#x003bc;g/g; dietary feeds: 95 &#x003bc;g Zn/g) (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), but the values were not explicitly stated as being on a wet or dry basis. If on a dry basis, the values are close to others based on wet weight (&#x0223c;39 &#x003bc;g Zn/g). The pancreas responded more to changes in dietary zinc intake than the liver, as seen in mice (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). These data indicate that the maize milling method can substantially alter zinc content, further affecting markers of zinc status. Although feed was iron-fortified at recommended concentrations, liver iron concentrations were affected by the milling method, which could affect iron outcomes if limited in the diet.</p><p>The primary zinc excretion route is from the intestine and reflects intake (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Fecal zinc concentration was affected by milling in study 1 and a zinc effect and milling-by-zinc interaction in study 2. Relative patterns of treatment groups at endline matched those of the pancreas: refined Zn&#x02212; &#x0003c; whole Zn&#x02212; &#x0003c; refined Zn+ = whole Zn+. Differences observed between refined Zn&#x02212; and whole Zn&#x02212; groups, despite being lower than the intake requirements suggested by the NRC (25 &#x003bc;g Zn/g) for feeds with a considerable amount of phytates (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), suggest that gerbils regulate absorption and excretion even between these marginal and deficient intake concentrations. This relation suggests that although the supplemental zinc had the greatest effect on outcomes, the milling method still affected markers of zinc intake and status.</p><p>Total absorbed zinc is a product of feed zinc concentration, feed intake, and zinc bioavailability. A positive relation was noted between zinc and phytate concentrations in the refined and whole-milled feeds; therefore, it is important to keep this interaction in mind when evaluating zinc outcomes. The phytate:zinc molar ratios in the refined feeds were higher than in whole-milled feeds; however, phytate:zinc molar ratios &#x02265;20 have demonstrated a constant inhibitory effect (<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), and therefore the inhibitory effect of phytates in this study (phytate:zinc molar ratio range: 51&#x02013;83) would be constant, with only the milling method affecting feed zinc concentration and study outcomes.</p><p>Liver VA concentrations and comparisons by VA concentrations in feeds were as expected: VA+ &#x0003e; orange &#x0003e; VA&#x02212; (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). This is in agreement with other gerbils that were fed high &#x003b2;-carotene maize with a positive control group that were fed preformed VA on an equimolar basis (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Both treatment groups that did not receive any form of VA had mean liver retinol concentrations &#x0003c;0.1 &#x003bc;mol/g [deficiency cutoff (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)], whereas all groups that received VA or orange maize were well above this cutoff. &#x003b2;-Carotene is present primarily in maize endosperm (<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), which is consistent with our initial findings of RO maize having higher &#x003b2;-carotene concentrations than WO maize. Despite equalizing orange feeds for &#x003b2;-carotene, increased hepatic &#x003b2;-carotene was observed in the refined groups in both studies, but liver retinol concentration did not differ between whole and refined groups, likely indicating that gerbils that were fed refined grains absorbed more total &#x003b2;-carotene, whereas gerbils that were fed whole grains absorbed and cleaved sufficient &#x003b2;-carotene to meet VA needs.</p><p>The effect of milling on serum retinol concentrations in study 1 (refined &#x0003e; whole-milled) for the treatment phase in the absence of a VA effect or VA-by-milling interaction is surprising because the reverse may have been expected because of the potential reduction of retinol-binding protein synthesis with inadequate zinc (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). However, during the depletion phase, a nonsignificant trend existed in the opposite direction, reflecting the homeostatic and variable nature of serum retinol to treatments (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Serum retinol concentrations in study 2 were not affected by treatment and were comparable to study 1 and other gerbil studies that used similar dietary provitamin A treatments with sufficient zinc (1.24 &#x000b1; 0.19 to 1.37 &#x000b1; 0.35 &#x003bc;mol/L) (<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Perhaps a more severe zinc deficiency is needed to affect serum retinol concentrations than achieved in these studies.</p><p>This study complements a recent study of humans in Zambia (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) that determined the total daily absorption of zinc from biofortified high-zinc maize (34 &#x003bc;g Zn/g) compared with standard maize (21 &#x003bc;g Zn/g) for a single day of test meals with the use of stable isotope methodology. A whole-grain milling method was used because much of the zinc was lost if the grain was refined in an open hammer mill (reduced to 5 and 2 &#x003bc;g Zn/g flour, respectively). The standard maize was similar in zinc concentration to our whole-milled maize, and the authors noted an 85&#x02013;90% reduction in zinc after polishing. The high-zinc variety also had a higher phytate content but lower phytate:zinc molar ratio than the standard maize, although both ratios were &#x0003e;20, likely indicating a constant inhibitory effect (<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The authors of the human study (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) concluded that high-zinc maize in humans yielded 83% more total daily zinc absorption than the standard maize (1.1 &#x000b1; 0.5 compared with 0.6 &#x000b1; 0.2 mg/d). The estimated physiologic requirement for children of this age is 0.744 mg/d (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>); thus, high-zinc and standard maize provided 148% and 81%, respectively, of the physiologic requirement. The human study (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and the current study demonstrate the importance of the milling method on the zinc concentration of ground maize and highlight the fact that whole-milled maize can supply substantial amounts of zinc when consumed as a staple food despite high phytate:zinc ratios.</p><p>This study indicates that the maize milling method used is sufficient to cause numerous adverse outcomes related to zinc status, including reduced growth, reduced feed intake, lower pancreatic zinc concentrations, and disparate fecal zinc concentrations, without affecting &#x003b2;-carotene bioefficacy. Because biofortification and other nutritional efforts continue to address the major worldwide micronutrient deficiencies of zinc, VA, and iron, it is pertinent to further investigate food processing and preparation methods because they pertain to multiple nutrients and compounds that interact with and affect the bioavailability of nutrients of interest. Nonnutritive factors must also be considered because there is evidence for an interaction between mycotoxins present in maize grain and the amount remaining in different milling fractions (<xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). In Zambia, refined milling is typically preferred for smoother consistency, purer white color, and increased shelf life in suboptimal storage conditions. Furthermore, the waste from refining maize is fed to animals and therefore serves secondary nutritive purposes. These nonnutritive factors and cultural practices must all be considered to maximize overall health outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Peter Crump for statistical consultation, Diane Amundson for analyzing feed samples, and Robert Cousins for input regarding zinc outcomes.
