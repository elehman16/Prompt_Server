Current treatment for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis includes antibiotics, such as metronidazole, which are 70&#x02013;80 % effective at one month after treatment and result in high recurrence rates and secondary candida infections. Intravaginal boric acid has been used for over a hundred years to treat vaginal infections, such as bacterial vaginosis. Boric acid is inexpensive, accessible, and has shown to be an effective treatment for other infections, such as vaginal candidiasis. To date, there has been no clinical trial evaluation of boric acid effectiveness to treat bacterial vaginosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The BASIC (Boric Acid, Alternate Solution for Intravaginal Colonization) trial is a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter study. The study will enroll a minimum of 240 women of 16&#x02013;50 years of age who are symptomatic with bacterial vaginosis. Eligible participants will have Amsel and Nugent scores confirming bacterial vaginosis. Women who are pregnant or menopausal or have other active co-infections will be excluded. Consenting participants who meet exclusion and inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: boric acid, metronidazole, or an inert placebo. Self-administration of treatment intravaginally for 10 days will be followed by clinical assessment at 7 and 30 days (days 17 and 40, respectively) after the end of the treatment phase. Primary outcome is a non-inferiority, per-protocol comparison of the effectiveness of boric acid with that of metronidazole at day 17, as measured by the Nugent score in 16&#x02013;50 year olds. Secondary outcomes include: non-inferiority, intention-to-treat comparison of effectiveness of boric acid with that of metronidazole at day 17, analysis for both per-protocol and intention-to-treat at day 40, and safety considerations, including adverse effects requiring patient discontinuation of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will be the first to determine whether intravaginal boric acid is non-inferior to metronidazole in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in symptomatic women.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT00799214">NCT00799214</ext-link>, registered online Nov 10, 2008.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>bacterial vaginosis</kwd><kwd>boric acid</kwd><kwd>double blinded</kwd><kwd>intravaginal</kwd><kwd>metronidazole</kwd><kwd>multicenter</kwd><kwd>non-inferiority</kwd><kwd>placebo</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is thought to be more common than either vulvovaginal candidiasis or trichomoniasis, and to represent 40&#x02013;50 % of all cases of vaginitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Bacterial vaginosis is associated with postpartum endometritis, increased risk of post-surgical infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, increased risk of spontaneous abortions, preterm rupture of membranes and delivery, and increased risk of sexually transmitted infection acquisition, including: human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus, <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, and <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Bacterial vaginosis is caused by a shift from the normal peroxidase-producing lactobacillus-dominant vaginal flora to a several-log increase in total bacterial colony count, which may include a mix of anaerobes, genital mycoplasmas, and <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Bacterial vaginosis is classically characterized by abnormal odor and vaginal discharge in symptomatic women, while 50 % of women with BV are asymptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It can also be painful, and is associated with dysuria or dyspareunia in symptomatic women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed in the presence of three of the four Amsel criteria: elevated pH (&#x0003e;4.5); homogenous milky or creamy discharge; amine odor; and clue cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The gold standard for BV diagnosis is by Gram staining (Nugent score &#x02265;7), demonstrating a decrease or absence of lactobacilli and the presence of other microbes that cause BV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Untreated women show a 30 % spontaneous resolution rate for BV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Metronidazole also carries a significant rate of side effects (10&#x02013;20 % of women), especially with the oral metronidazole preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], including secondary vaginal infection with candida [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

The Nugent score is found to be &#x0003e;95 % sensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] for detecting BV. We chose a non-inferiority limit of 10 %, as this will allow for a clinically relevant difference between the metronidazole treatment group and the boric acid group. Also, this is approximately 25 % of the expected difference between results obtained for the metronidazole standard treatment group and the placebo group. Accounting for a non-inferiority limit (delta) of 10 %, testing for a significance level of 0.05 and power of 80 %, we require approximately 63 subjects per group. To allow for a dropout rate of 25 %, we set a target rate of 80 subjects per treatment arm. If there is a true difference in favor of the experimental treatment of 8 %, then 126 patients (total for two groups of 63) are needed, to be 80 % sure of the upper limit of a one-sided 95 % confidence interval, using a binary outcome, non-inferiority trial power calculator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>We felt it important to include a placebo treatment arm in this study for different reasons: (1) this is the first randomized controlled trial to use intravaginal H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>; thus, comparing it to placebo for safety and effectiveness would be of clinical interest (that is, perhaps it is not comparable to metronidazole in effectiveness but it is still significantly better than placebo), (2) having a placebo group in a non-inferiority trial acts as a sensitivity assay and internal validator for this type of trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], (3) comparing metronidazole effectiveness and safety with results obtained for a placebo group in 16&#x02013;19-year-olds has not previously been done and would also be of clinical interest.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study setting</title><p>Recruitment began February 2014 for a minimum of 240 volunteers through participating family practice clinics in British Columbia, Canada. Volunteer participating clinics represent a spectrum of different types of practice across British Columbia: rural, remote, urban, First Nations and non-First Nations communities, single and multi-clinician practices, general family practice offices, women&#x02019;s health clinics, and youth clinics. Clinics were recruited to the study through province-wide medical journal advertisements, university family practice departmental email advertisements, personal emails, faxes, phone calls and in person. Eligible clinics agreed to recruit five or more participants meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria and to use the study treatments and prepared packages provided.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participants and eligibility</title><p>Women who present to their clinician at participating family practice clinics with symptoms of BV are offered an opportunity to participate in the study.

There are no visits to the clinic while the participants are administering the 10-day treatment unless there are any concerns. Women are included in the study if they are symptomatic for BV, meet three of four Amsel criteria on the initial day of the study and subsequently have a swab graded with a Nugent score &#x02265;7.

These numbers then become the new identification numbers on the treatment packs. All treatment packs are then distributed to participating clinics by the study pharmacist who sends out five sequentially numbered treatment packs to each participating site as sites are recruited to the study. The study pharmacist is the only person with access to the master code to the randomized treatments. The participants, recruiting clinicians and investigators will be blinded to the controlled and randomized 10-day treatment pack that is given to the study participant. Blinded recruiting clinicians give out the physically indistinguishable treatment package in allocated randomization order to the sequential participants on enrollment day (day 0). Subsequently the treatment pack number becomes the participants&#x02019; identification number.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention and control groups</title><p>On day 0, the enrolled participants will be blindly and randomly assigned to one of three 10-day treatments (minimum of 80 women per treatment arm): (1) placebo (emollient cream); (2) H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> (600 mg H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> compounded in emollient cream); (3) metronidazole (10 %, for a total of 37.5 mg metronidazole) intravaginal cream (Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc.

Vaginal discharge will also be tested for pH (one of the four Amsel criteria). Where facilities permit; clue cells will be examined, as the fourth Amsel criterion.

The study pharmacist will be informed by the recruiting clinician of the participant&#x02019;s full name, date of birth, and personal health number, and the study number assigned, so that the study pharmacist can enter the medication name into the British Columbia PharmaNet Database (the provincial pharmacy database). This safety measure ensures that subsequent treating physicians throughout the province will have access to details of the treatment received, in case of a safety concern and a need to unblind the participant&#x02019;s medication should the participant present with an emergency. Non-emergency access to the provincial pharmacy database is not allowed, to protect the participant&#x02019;s identification of the blinded treatment.</p><p>If at any time the participant reports intolerable side effects (vaginal discomfort, intolerable vaginal discharge, urticaria, or secondary yeast infection) during treatment, or exacerbation of symptoms at any point, she may voluntarily discontinue the treatment and leave the study without prejudice, and her doctor or another physician may provide treatment as per usual standard of care.</p><p>As neither metronidazole nor H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> treatments provided to patients are in amounts considered toxic when taken intravaginally or if accidentally ingested, should there be any occurrence of serious adverse effects (neurological, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or anaphylactic reactions) during any of the treatments, the study will be put on hold until an investigation can be held. In the case of serious adverse effects found to be caused by the treatment, the study will be stopped, and the study unblinded and decoded by the study pharmacist.

To control for multiple testing, we will use a Bonferroni-type correction. To account for both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, and two timepoint analyses, the threshold for statistical significance will be set at 0.01 (approximately 0.05 divided by 4).</p><p>The following are tertiary outcome measures and no formal sample size calculations were made. Minor adverse effects (side effects not causing the patient to discontinue treatment) will be reported and compared between the treatment arms but will not be considered as treatment failure. We will examine the adolescent population, the 16&#x02013;19 year old subgroup, for non-inferiority for effectiveness of H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, as compared with metronidazole, at the end of the study. Finally, we will test for superiority of the effectiveness and safety of H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> compared with placebo in both the 16&#x02013;50-year-olds and in the 16&#x02013;19 year old subgroup. In addition, our study is the first to be able to examine 16&#x02013;19-year-olds for the effectiveness and safety of metronidazole compared with placebo.</p><p>95 % confidence intervals will be established. Missing data (participants who fail to complete follow-up for any reason) are accounted for by an anticipated 25 % lost-to-follow-up rate. Data will be blindly collected by the outcome assessors from the participating clinics and entered into an electronic database. The study pharmacist will provide the randomization code for the data to a third-party statistician and the data will be analyzed. Self-reported participant satisfaction criteria included at the end of the daily treatment diary will use a five-point rating scale to record: effectiveness in curing BV symptoms, side effects, ease of use, likelihood they would use it again for BV treatment, likelihood they would recommend it to someone else for BV treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The BASIC (Boric Acid, Alternate Solution for Intravaginal Colonization) study will be the first prospective randomized control trial to determine the effectiveness of intravaginal H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> compared with metronidazole for the treatment of BV in symptomatic women. If intravaginal H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> is shown to be non-inferior to metronidazole in the treatment of BV, this may provide women with less costly options for treating this common vaginal infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently open to recruitment.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BASIC</term><def><p>Boric Acid, Alternate Solution for Intravaginal Colonization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BV</term><def><p>bacterial vaginosis</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MZM is the principal investigator.
