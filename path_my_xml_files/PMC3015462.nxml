The box has 15- to 20-cm widths and 10- to 20-cm depths, simulating the insufflated abdomen of infants. Two small holes drilled on the surface of the box mimic the surgical ports; thus, each trainee can realize the actual feeling of the fulcrum effect. Through repeated simple tasks, participants can gradually feel familiar with the unique action of delicate and long-handled endoscopic instruments. The remaining 3 tasks were done under 2-dimensional visualization. These tasks facilitate the fundamentals of unique perspective and spatial interface of endoscopic surgery. The participants could complete these 5 modules step by step at their own pace, being mentored by experienced endoscopic instructors.</p><p>Our MTP did improve the psychomotor skills of pediatric surgeons who had been less exposed to laparoscopic surgery. Their movement efficiency and speed were significantly improved after MTP, indicating the validity of our current curriculum. On the contrary, surgeons who had already been exposed to laparoscopic surgery could not gain further development of their skills through MTP. These results suggest that our current basic program is effective for initiating the nonlaparoscopic pediatric surgeons, but is not entirely satisfactory for laparoscopic surgeons.</p><p>It has been a commonly held assumption that younger surgeons have a natural advantage in the development of laparoscopic skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> Our present study showed, however, that age did not appear to play a dominant role in the outcome. Senior pediatric surgeons who completed MTP could maintain their initial enthusiasm by being convinced that &#x0201c;it is not too late.&#x0201d;</p><p>MTP had no effect on improving movement precision. This is partly because our MTP did not have proper modules to develop precise motion. Another explanation is that it may take more time to learn precise motion than effective and speedy motion. Further modifications are necessary to make MTP more effective in allowing surgeons to learn delicate, not merely quick motion, which seems more essential in clinical settings of pediatric laparoscopic surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our training program was effective for pediatric surgeons who have less experience in clinical laparoscopic surgery. A simple, nontime-consuming, and inexpensive training course is an attractive method for nonlaparoscopic pediatric surgeons to obtain basic endoscopic skills and to overcome their mental reservations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments:</title><p>Part of this article was presented at the IXth International Congress for Endosurgery in Children, March 28-30, 2000, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.
