All patients were randomly assigned into two groups (80 per group) using computer-generated numbers. The sample size was calculated to detect a significant difference in the postoperative drainage and laboratory change between groups with a power of 80% with an &#x003b1; value of 0.05. Group A and B were patients with subcutaneous and intraarticular indwelling closed suction drainage method, respectively. Three patients have been lost in the followup. This left 157 TKAs (78 patients for Group A and 79 patients for Group B) who form the basis of the current report [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Exclusion criteria include other diagnosis than primary osteoarthritis, preoperative valgus alignment, received a revision or bilateral TKA, hematological disease, previous open knee surgery or vascular surgery. There were 53 males and 104 females with an average age of 69.5 &#x000b1; 5.8 years (range 61-82 years), and the average body mass index was 24.9 &#x000b1; 4.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Braun Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany) under spinal anesthesia. All 160 knees underwent the same surgical approach consisting of a midline skin incision and a medial parapatellar approach under tourniquet. All patients were implanted with cemented type ultra-congruent fixed bearing design (Columbus&#x02122; UC, B. Braun Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany). None of the patients underwent lateral retinacular release or patellar resurfacing.</p><p>In the subcutaneous indwelling group (Group A), a vacuum drainage system was placed in the subcutaneous space (below the medial skin flap) after joint capsule closure [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In the intraarticular indwelling group (Group B), a vacuum drainage system was placed in the intraarticular space (the medial gutter) before joint capsule closure. All drains were kept open constantly without clamping. The amount of drained visible blood was recorded at 24 and 48 h using the measuring cylinder with total 500 mL and 1.0 mL unit. All suction drains were removed 48 h postoperatively. Using Gross's formula,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> hidden blood loss was calculated using patients&#x02019; height, weight, and preoperative and postoperative Hct. The Hb and Hct levels were determined preoperatively and 12 h (day 1), 5<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> day postoperatively. The patients received packed red blood cells if their Hb levels decreased to &#x0003c;8 g/dL and presents compromised clinical criteria (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, or symptoms of anemia that were relative to the preoperative medical condition of the patient) necessitated transfusion. The postoperative timing of transfusion and the number of units of transfused red blood cell concentrates were recorded. All patients were given low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin 40 mg) subcutaneously daily for 7 days postoperatively.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage method.

The bandage and Foley's catheter were removed on the second postoperative day. On the same day, the range motion (ROM) exercise using continuous passive motion devices, an isometric/isotonic quadriceps exercise, a straight leg rising exercise and a walking exercise were initiated under the control of a physiotherapist.</p><p>All the observations were recorded by clinical research orthopedic nurse who was unaware about the allotted groups. The possible adverse issues with subcutaneous drainage and wound problems were analyzed. Oozing persisting beyond 2 days after surgery, subcutaneous hematoma (requiring aspiration or surgical drainage), hemarthrosis (requiring aspiration or surgical drainage), ecchymosis (larger than 3 cm in diameter) and wound infection (requiring additional treatments such as antibiotics coverage or surgical debridement) were recorded. Thigh and calf circumference were checked at day 7 after TKA. The level for thigh circumference was set at 10 cm proximal from the patella upper pole and largest diameter for calf. These values were compared with the preoperative state.</p><p>Symptom severity was assessed at 24 months using the Knee Society Score (KSS)<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Passive maximum knee ROM was measured using a goniometer. At these evaluations, assessments were performed by a physician assistant not directly involved in the surgical procedures. A KSS of 90 points was considered an excellent outcome, a score between 80 and 89 points was considered a good outcome, a score between 70 and 79 points was considered a fair outcome and a score of &#x0003c;70 points was considered a poor outcome. The WOMAC system involves the completion of a 24-item questionnaire with three sections: Namely; pain, stiffness and function.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Five response options are possible (none, mild, moderate, severe and extreme), which are scored from 0 to 4 to yield subtotal scores for pain (5-item; possible total score range 0&#x02013;20), stiffness (2-item; possible score range 0&#x02013;8), and function (17-item; possible score range 0&#x02013;68).</p><p>The two study groups were compared with respect to blood volumes collected via indwelled drains, changes in Hb/Hct levels postoperatively, requirements for allogeneic blood transfusion, bleeding-related wound problems, and postoperative hospital stay.

Although the incidence of minor complications such as the bullae formation and the ecchymosis were significantly higher in the subcutaneous indwelling group, the functional outcome at postoperative 2 years did not demonstrate the difference from intraarticular drainage group.</p><p>A few studies have shown that closed negative pressure drainage is beneficial to early knee function recovery by reducing postoperative hematoma formation in the wound, relieving wound tension, preventing complications including pain and poor healing and lowering the incidence of deep infections.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, a number of other studies have not supported the advantages of closed negative pressure drainage and indicated that closed negative pressure drainage causes complications such as postoperative hemorrhage, increased blood transfusion and infection and affects the ability of postoperative functional training.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The use of vacuum drainage in TKA to manage bleeding continues to be debated. Because most of the blood loss in TKA occurs during the first few postoperative hours (37% in 2 h and 55% in 4 h), it seems reasonable to clamp the drain tube in the first few hours after TKA to temporarily create a tamponade effect for bleeding control. Several studies recommended clamping method, but with variable recommendations. Recommendations included no clamping,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> clamping for 1 h,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> 10-min clamp releases every 2 h,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and clamping for 4 h.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The effect of clamping method is also in controversy.</p><p>The method of subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage had been proposed as a potentially efficacious alternative to either intraarticular closed suction drainage or no drainage system.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This method was suggested to exploit the advantages of both methods; the subcutaneous blood drainage and the joint tamponade effect. Seo <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> have shown that subcutaneous closed suction drainage involves equivalent blood loss with comparable wound problems and functional outcomes compared with intraarticular closed suction drainage. However, only exogenous blood loss was analyzed in their study while internal blood loss (i.e., total blood loss) was calculated in this study. In addition, detailed postoperative minor complications were identified using the parameters such as the change of thigh and calf circumference.</p><p>The occurrence of bullae formation and ecchymosis were significantly higher in subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage group in this series. Although some studies have demonstrated no statistically significant difference in hematoma formation with or without postoperative drainage, TKA patients without drainage system theoretically have a higher chance of hematoma formation. While pressure dressing reduces superficial bleeding at the incision, it is less effective on bleeding in deep locations such as the marrow and periprosthesis space, which can result in invisible blood loss and hematoma formation due to blood accumulation.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> After TKA, because the capsule of the knee joint is damaged and the surrounding soft tissue has been incised, the blood infiltration can extend to the fascia and intramuscular space of the thigh and calf, which results in increase in thigh calf circumference and ecchymosis. Subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage method may not be a perfect solution to prevent soft tissue accumulation from excessive blood infiltration. Despite significantly increased minor wound problems and increased thigh-calf circumference compared to intraarticular drainage group, two groups had similar functional outcome at 2 years postoperatively. Soft tissue swelling around the knee joint in subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage group might have reduced the ROM shortly after the operation, but it did not influence the motion arc in the long run.</p><p>Limitation of this study are methods used regarding the drainage system in TKA, subcutaneous indwelling closed suction method was compared with only the intraarticular indwelling drainage method. A group without closed suction drainage system or groups of various clamping methods have not been compared. Therefore, conclusions cannot be made whether subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage method has advantages or disadvantages from other methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage method in TKA reduces total blood loss and thus lowers the rate of allogeneic blood transfusion compared to the intraarticular indwelling drainage method. Although the incidence of minor wound problems such as bullae formation and ecchymosis is higher than the intraarticular indwelling drainage method, eventual motion arc and functional outcome are similar. Based on these results, subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage method is a reasonable option after TKA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENTS</sc></title><p>The authors would like to thank Ms. Min-Jung Lee for statistical analysis of this manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gasc&#x000f3;n</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Zoumbos</surname><given-names>NC</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>NS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Immunologic abnormalities in patients receiving multiple blood transfusions</article-title><source>Ann Intern Med</source><year>1984</year><volume>100</volume><fpage>173</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6229206</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Bowers</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The clinical advantages of autologous transfusion.
