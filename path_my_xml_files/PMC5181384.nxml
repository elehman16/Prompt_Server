Subjects aged &#x02265;55 years with AAA diameter 3.0&#x02013;5.4 cm were randomized 1:1:1 to receive perindopril arginine 10 mg, or amlodipine 5 mg, or placebo and followed 3&#x02013;6 monthly over 2 years. The primary outcome was aneurysm growth rate (based on external antero-posterior ultrasound measurements in the longitudinal plane), determined by multi-level modelling to provide maximum likelihood estimates. Two hundred and twenty-four subjects were randomized (2011&#x02013;2013) to placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 79), perindopril (<italic>n</italic> = 73), or amlodipine (<italic>n</italic> = 72).

Consequently, many smaller AAAs are now being detected early. The majority (80%) of screen-detected AAAs are small, with diameters of 3.0&#x02013;4.4 cm<sup>1</sup>. If AAA growth rates can be attenuated or halted in this expanding cohort of patients, there is an opportunity to reduce the number of patients at risk of AAA repair and rupture.</p><p>Animal studies have suggested a potential role of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system (RAS) in AAA formation and growth.<sup><xref rid="ehw257C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ehw257C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> A case&#x02013;control study on a group of over 15 000 patients with an AAA, reported that patients who had previously received an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) but not other anti-hypertensive agents were 20% less likely to present with ruptured aneurysm.<sup><xref rid="ehw257C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Similarly, the Chichester small AAA surveillance study suggested an association between angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) prescription and reduced AAA progression.<sup><xref rid="ehw257C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Conversely, <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis from both the UK Small Aneurysm Trial<sup><xref rid="ehw257C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and the PHAST trial<sup><xref rid="ehw257C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> failed to show that ACE-I slow aneurysm growth. Given the, albeit inconsistent, observational evidence that RAS-blockade might restrict AAA progression or lead to a decrease in the risk of rupture, the AARDVARK (Aortic Aneurysmal Regression of Dilation: Value of ACE-Inhibition on RisK) trial was designed.</p><p>The primary objective of this trial was to investigate whether an ACE-I, perindopril, would reduce the growth rate of small AAAs compared with placebo, independent of blood pressure (BP) reduction, assessed by including a third comparator arm in which BP was lowered by amlodipine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the Fulham Research Ethical Committee (NRES 10/H0711/80) and was registered with the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number registry (ISRCTN51383267).

Randomization codes were generated using randomly permutated blocks of varying sizes (Stata Corporation, TX, USA) by an independent statistician. The trial was classified as single blind since the three tablets prescribed were not identical in appearance. Drugs were dispensed in identical opaque bottles and while technically patients could have investigated the composition of their prescribed trial drug, neither patients, ultrasonographers nor site investigators were aware of which tablets had been prescribed to each patient.</p><p>Drugs were deblistered into bottles labelled A, B, or C and dispensed at each visit. For the initial 2 weeks following randomization, patients were asked to take half doses of their trial drug, in line with standard clinical practice for the initiation of perindopril, and therefore applied to all three randomized groups.</p><p>Where in-trial cough was persistent and intolerable, patients stopped the trial drug for 2 weeks and if the cough resolved they were changed to losartan (100 mg/day). If the cough continued (and hence deemed unrelated to trial drug), the drug was restarted. All patients who were switched to losartan continued in the trial and were followed up on an intention to treat basis.</p><p>Compliance with the trial drug was evaluated using tablet counts by a designated member of the pharmacist. Compliance (expressed as a percentage) was calculated as a ratio of tablets taken (based on pill counts of tablets returned) divided by the number of tablets that should have been consumed.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Trial procedures</title><p>Each patient had a maximum of nine planned study visits. At the baseline visit, patients underwent a review of informed consent, demographic information, medical history, and current medical therapies. In addition, aortic ultrasonography and BP measurement were carried out as per study protocol. Screening blood results were checked before randomization and dispensing of study medication took place.</p><p>Following this baseline visit, patients attended every 3 or 6 months (with the 3 months and yearly visits being mandatory), as well as appointments mandated on clinical grounds, for a total of 2 years. At each visit, BP, aneurysm diameter, any adverse events (AE), and serious adverse events (SAE) were recorded.</p><p>Three sitting BPs were measured using a validated semi-automated device: Omron 705CP-II machines (Omron Healthcare, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands) or the BP Plus device (Uscom, Sydney, Australia) after at least 10 min rest. The mean of the last two readings were used in analyses. Smoking was not permitted in the 30 min before BP measurement.</p><p>At each visit, four antero-posterior AAA measurements of maximum diameter were collected by qualified vascular scientists or technicians accredited in aortic ultrasonography using a detailed protocol: ITI and OTO measurements in the transverse and longitudinal planes.</p><p>Blood creatinine and electrolyte levels were collected at screening, 3, 12, and 24 months (in keeping with recommended clinical practice for the management of hypertension with an ACE-I), reviewed by the study team and the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). Medication was discontinued if the serum creatinine rose &#x0003e;30% above baseline. Patients with lesser increases in creatinine were monitored, advised by the results of more frequent blood tests as clinically indicated.</p><p>Data were entered onto purpose built corresponding electronic forms with built-in validation rules to identify data entry errors in real time and provide a full audit trail of data entry and changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Quality assurance</title><p>The baseline images of all patients were assessed for quality by the trial Senior Clinical Vascular Ultrasonographer (SCVU). Thereafter, ultrasound images taken at subsequent 3 or 6 monthly visits were reviewed for a random sample of 10 patients per site (or all participants for sites with &#x0003c;10 patients). Based on these assessments, observers received onsite remedial training sessions as required.</p><p>Quality assurance events were organized to ensure consistency between and within observers, given the use of up to four observers at any one site. Based on outcomes of these events, OTO diameters measured from longitudinal images were used for evaluation as the primary outcome as these were the most repeatable: The mean difference for this measurement between trial observer and trial SCVU was 0.035 &#x000b1; 4 mm.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome of the trial was aneurysm growth rate over 2 years, estimated from the sequential AAA diameter measurements (external diameter measured in the longitudinal plane).</p><p>Secondary outcome measures include: changes in BP; the composite outcome of time taken for the aneurysm to reach the 5.5 cm diameter threshold, referral for elective surgery or AAA rupture; drug intolerance; and drug compliance.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Adverse event reporting, safety, and data monitoring</title><p>This trial was conducted in accordance with Medical Research Council Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004.</p><p>Safety was assessed during the trial by local recording of AEs, SAEs.

On the assumption that the effects on aneurysm progression are specific to ACE-Is rather than other anti-hypertensive drugs, the trial was powered to detect a smaller difference in growth rate (&#x0003c;20%) by comparing the ACE-I group with the other two groups combined. These calculations allowed for 10% attrition, defined as a participant having attended fewer than two study visits, hence a direct measure of growth rate was not possible. The placebo-corrected AAA growth rate in the amlodipine group could be used for evaluation of the extent to which any ACE-I effect on growth rate was attributable to BP reduction.

The estimated difference in annual growth rate between perindopril and placebo remained similar after adjustment for known factors that affect aneurysm growth rate and after sensitivity analysis excluding patients with diabetes which is associated with reduced AAA growth rate.<sup><xref rid="ehw257C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Additionally, in this trial there was no difference in the number of trial patients whose AAA grew to a maximum diameter of 5.5 cm or more and/or were referred for or received elective repair. The AARDVARK trial was designed, to study AAA growth, as a pilot trial for a larger trial of the impact of ACE-Is on AAA-related adverse clinical events including rupture and surgical repair.</p><p>Mean BP levels in the perindopril and amlodipine arms showed significant reductions between baseline and 24 months, but there were no differences in growth rates between those in the placebo group and those in the two actively treated groups. Although there is a known association between raised BP and aneurysm prevalence (particularly high diastolic readings),<sup><xref rid="ehw257C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> evidence to support increased aneurysm growth rates in hypertensive patients is lacking. This trial suggests that at least among those with baseline systolic BP &#x0003c;150 mmHg, a systolic/diastolic BP reduction using perindopril, compared with placebo, of on average &#x0223c;8/5 mmHg throughout the trial (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ehw257F2">2</xref>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>) does not have a significant impact on AAA growth rate.</p><p>This trial was designed to evaluate any BP independent effect in AAA growth rate of perindopril. Hence, the doses of perindopril and amlodipine were selected to achieve similar reductions in BP. Therefore, any BP-independent effects of ACE-I on AAA growth rates could be evaluated. However, although both treatments were effective in lowering BP, there were surprisingly greater reductions in systolic and diastolic BP in those receiving perindopril despite similar withdrawal and compliance rates in each group. This greater reduction in BP by an ACE-I in an elderly population of patients with AAA deserves further study. One possible explanation could be that patients had a high rate of unrecognized renal artery stenosis and ACE-Is are particularly effective in terms of BP lowering in this context.</p><p>The overall findings of the AARDVARK trial are at odds with several laboratory and animal-based studies<sup><xref rid="ehw257C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ehw257C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> including the findings that angiotensinogen and the angiotensin type 1 receptors (but not angiotensin type 2 receptors) are increased by a factor of 2 in the walls of AAAs compared with control tissue.<sup><xref rid="ehw257C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Similarly in hypercholesterolaemic mice, infusion of angiotensin II leads to dissection of the aorta, generating supra-renal aortic aneurysms, the formation of which can be prevented with use of an ACE-I.<sup><xref rid="ehw257C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In addition, perindopril has also been shown to inhibit aortic degeneration and AAA formation in other AAA animal models induced by elastase and calcium chloride.<sup><xref rid="ehw257C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Similarly, some<sup><xref rid="ehw257C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> but not all<sup><xref rid="ehw257C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ehw257C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> large observational studies have generated findings which are inconsistent with these AARDVARK trial findings, in suggesting that RAS-blockade may protect against the growth of AAAs. It is not clear why these inconsistencies arise but may at least in part be related to confounding due to the reduced use of ACE-Is by smokers in the observational analyses.</p><p>The AAA growth rates observed in this trial were smaller than reported in previous studies<sup><xref rid="ehw257C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ehw257C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ehw257C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ehw257C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> where growth rates ranged between 1.6 and 2.6 mm per year in aneurysms with a mean baseline diameter between 3.4 and 4.3 cm. This may be secondary to the more aggressive control of cardiovascular risk factors, which is more routinely found in current clinical practice than was the case at the time of these previous studies and to the pre-requisite of a reasonably &#x02018;controlled&#x02019; baseline systolic BP level before entry to the AARDVARK trial. The average baseline BPs in studies that have primarily measured small AAA growth rate were certainly higher than those of the participants in the AARDVARK trial (131.5/77.5 mmHg at baseline) ranging from 143 to 157 mmHg (systolic) and 81&#x02013;91 mmHg (diastolic).<sup><xref rid="ehw257C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ehw257C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ehw257C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ehw257C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Limitations of the AARDVARK trial include the potential for being under-powered to detect a small but important effect on AAA growth rate. Sample size calculations were based on an estimated annual growth rate in AAA diameter of 2.6 mm (SD 1.8) and a treatment effect of 38% (1 mm) as reported in the UKSAT trial.<sup><xref rid="ehw257C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Given the actual average growth rate observed of 1.7 mm with an SD of 3.0, 190 patients per group would have been required to detect a 1 mm difference in annual growth with a power of 90%. Given the sample size (75 per group) this trial had 51% power to detect a 1 mm difference in growth (between two groups) and 85% power to detect a difference of 1.5 mm (close to the annual growth rate). However, the estimated difference in annual growth between the perindopril and placebo groups was 0.08 mm with confidence intervals of &#x02212;0.50, 0.65. This statistically excludes a likely reduction of 1 mm per year with perindopril administration. The potential for lack of generalizability of the results must be acknowledged, since this trial was performed in a largely white male population, whose BP levels were relatively well controlled. In addition, the results may not be applicable to patients with larger aneurysms, but since 80% of screen-detected aneurysms have diameters of 3.0&#x02013;4.4 cm<sup>1</sup> it appears unlikely that ACE-I would slow the growth of most screen-detected aneurysms. Finally, there is a possibility that there may be an effect of ACE-I administration that is only evident after 2 years.</p><p>Despite these limitations, this is a unique randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of ACE-I on small aneurysm growth rates followed up for 2 years. Although a small and expected increase in creatinine levels was seen in the ACE-I group, trial withdrawals due to study drug-related AEs were similar among the three groups and compliance with therapy was excellent in all three treatment arms.</p><p>In conclusion, the AARDVARK trial, which is the first randomized trial to report the effect of ACE-Is in this setting, found no evidence that in patients with systolic BP of &#x0003c;150 mmHg, the rate of growth of small AAAs is slowed by the administration of the ACE-I perindopril compared with placebo and that modest BP lowering did not beneficially impact on the growth of small AAAs. Consequently, although perindopril was well tolerated and safe in a population of patients with AAA, the growing number of patients with small aneurysms found as a result of increased monitoring and screening appear unlikely to benefit from ACE-I administration in terms of the growth of their small AAAs.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>C.B. contributed to the design of the study, recruitment, interpretation of the trial findings, and prepared the first draft of this manuscript with G.K.
