It had 65 participants and was published in 1986. As a result of rising use of hypnosis for labour pain, and following agreement with local service users and staff that this was a research priority, we undertook a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) with the primary objective of establishing the effect of a group self-hypnosis programme undertaken in the third trimester of pregnancy on rates of epidural use in labouring nulliparous women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We originally designed the project as a feasibility study in one UK Trust, to inform the design of a future, larger RCT. In the event, with an agreed extension from the funder, we also undertook an internal pilot, then rolled out the study as a definitive trial to two more Trusts (a total of seven clinical sites). In 2013, the annual birth rates in the three participating Trusts were 10&#x000a0;300, 6900, and 4500. Sites included two alongside midwife-led birth centres (ABCs), two freestanding midwife-led birth centres (FSBCs) and three hospitals (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, <italic>Characteristics of study sites</italic>).</p><p>The study was a multi-site, pragmatic, non-blinded RCT based on intention to treat and contextualised by interviews and questionnaires. Data collected in all of the phases contributed to the final analysis. Follow up continued until 6&#x000a0;weeks after birth. We also conducted a full economic evaluation (reported elsewhere). The focus of this paper is the primary clinical cost and psychological analyses. Information from interviews with participants will be published separately.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were at 27&#x02013;32&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation at the time of randomisation, could read and understand English, were not on medication for hypertension or psychological illness, and were not planning an elective caesarean section. Birth partners were eligible to take part if they returned a consent form.</p><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Women attending antenatal clinic at 20&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation were informed about the study, and were asked to return a reply slip or notify the research team if they were interested in participating. If still eligible at 27&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation, respondents were sent further information, consent forms, and baseline questionnaires for themselves and their birth companion. Randomisation occurred when the Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) received the consent form.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation and protection against bias</title><p>We used a computer-generated sequence on a one-to-one basis, without stratification or blocking. The allocation was uploaded automatically to the participant management database, accessible by password to the research team, to allow for session allocation for the intervention group. Outcomes data were collected by staff that did not know group allocation, and returned separately to the CTU for data linkage. It was not possible to blind participants or the hypnosis trainers to group allocation. Questionnaires were sent from and returned directly to the CTU, and scanned into the outcomes database. Group allocation and outcome data were linked by confidential codes at the end of the study for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Prior to transfer of the total data set from the CTU, the Trial Management Group (TMG) agreed on the primary and secondary outcomes that would be analysed and&#x000a0;reported in the primary study report (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix S1</xref>: <italic>Clinical and psychological outcome measurements)</italic>.</p><sec><title>Primary outcome</title><p>Use of epidural analgesia for labour pain relief.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><sec><title>Clinical</title><p>Hypertension after randomisation; spontaneous onset of labour; use of opioids or epidural; caesarean section; instrumental birth or caesarean section; spontaneous vaginal birth; length of labour, length of second stage; breastfeeding at 6&#x000a0;weeks; admission to neonatal unit (NNU); stillbirth; more than 5&#x000a0;days in NNU; extra postnatal care for mother and blood transfusion for mother.</p></sec><sec><title>Psychological</title><p>Satisfaction with labour pain relief; memory of labour pain; psychological morbidity/wellbeing; satisfaction with life, and expectation and experience of anxiety and fear.</p></sec><sec><title>Economic analysis</title><p>Economic analysis used the Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), based on resource use per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), measured using the EQ-5D instrument.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This paper provides a comparison of costs by treatment group, based on three specific phases of resource utilisation the activities undertaken during the antenatal period, an inventory of the resources required during labour, and services required as part of postpartum admissions (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>, <italic>Unit costs of antenatal activities and health services</italic>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Questionnaires</title><p>As well as a baseline questionnaire, respondents were sent a follow-up postal questionnaire at 36&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation, and at 2&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;weeks postnatal. Questionnaires were designed for the study and included a mix of validated instruments and study-specific sections. Email, text, and phone reminders were automatically triggered by the CTU systems, to a maximum of three reminders each, 2&#x000a0;weeks apart, for each questionnaire distributed.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention group received self-hypnosis training in addition to usual care. Two 90-minute group sessions were offered, 3&#x000a0;weeks apart, at around 32 and 35&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix S2</xref>, <italic>Outline of intervention sessions,</italic> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix S3</xref>).</p><p>The hypnosis scripts used in a recent Australian trial of self-hypnosis for labour pain<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> were adapted, based on a methodology developed for the control of abdominal symptoms by members of the research team (P.W., V.M.)<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> in thousands of patients. They were further modified by two of the study hypnosis midwives who had prior expertise and experience in hypnosis for childbirth (M.W., M.P.B.).</p><p>Participants were invited to attend group sessions at their local Trust, with or without their intended birth companion. They were also advised to listen to a 26-minute self-hypnosis CD daily (recorded by V.M.) until the birth of the baby, and to complete logs of this practice and of other antenatal educational activities.</p><p>Fifteen midwives were trained in hypnosis techniques by the same trainers (though at different times). All hypnosis midwives were visited by a member of the research team at least once during a self-hypnosis session to ensure fidelity to the intervention protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Control group</title><p>Those randomised to this group continued with usual NHS antenatal care.</p></sec><sec><title>Usual care for both groups</title><p>Usual NHS care included antenatal clinic attendances, screening and treatment, according to NICE guidelines.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Antenatal education is not standardised across the NHS. In most of the study locations, this included four to five classroom-type sessions, covering a range of topics, such as pregnancy concerns and new baby care and feeding advice, as well as information about available labour pain relief methods. Some areas also provided additional resources, such as aqua-natal sessions. Women from both groups also had access to a wide range of privately provided sessions, including those offered by private hypnotherapists.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection and handling</title><p>The SHIP database was updated once or twice a week, with the date of birth of all study neonates born in that period. The CTU were informed by phone and email of any untoward outcomes to stop postnatal questionnaires being sent inappropriately. In the early feasibility stages of the study, a co-investigator not involved in data collection (HS) regularly reviewed a convenience sample of questionnaires for completeness and to identify any questions that respondents appeared to find problematic.</p><p>Questionnaire returns were scanned into the study database by the CTU. Intervention group logs were returned to the research team and entered onto an EXCEL file, then transferred to the CTU for data linkage.</p><p>Clinical birth outcomes, including use of epidural analgesia, were collected from electronic hospital systems and health records by the on-site research teams blind to study allocation, on scannable data collection forms, and were&#x000a0;sent to the CTU to be scanned into the primary trial database.</p><p>For the cost analysis, resource use data was collected from the birth outcomes form, and from questionnaire returns at 36 weeks gestation and 2 and 6 weeks postnatal.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculations</title><p>It was agreed with clinical and service user representatives and the research team that a reduction in epidural usage from 25% (the local rate at the time of the study design) to 15% would be clinically significant. With an 80% power (beta) and two-tailed alpha of 5%, 550 participants were required in the study. Over-recruitment was planned, to preserve the sensitivity of the analysis of the 6-week follow-up data while allowing for dropout. Based on a pre-study survey of women's agreement to take part in principle, it was anticipated that up to 800 women might be recruited.</p></sec><sec><title>Analytic strategy</title><p>Quantitative clinical and psychosocial outcomes were analysed using a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, with results reported as the estimated mean difference, 95% confidence interval for the mean difference, and <italic>P</italic>-value for a two-sided test of the null hypothesis that the true mean difference is zero. Binary outcomes were analysed as a two-by-two contingency table, with results reported as the estimated odds ratio, 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio and <italic>P</italic>-value for a two-sided test of the null hypothesis that the true odds ratio is one. No sub-group analyses were planned for the ITT data for the primary outcome.</p><p>The cost analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK NHS and Personal Social Services (PSSRU).<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Costs of antenatal classes were considered potential substitutes of hypnotherapy classes. The time horizon was 28&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation to 6&#x000a0;weeks postnatal. Costs were estimated using resource use for each woman and applying unit costs obtained from the PSSRU database and the NHS Resource use database for the year 2012.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Data monitoring</title><p>Data monitoring was the remit of The Trial Steering Group (TSG).

Recruitment ended in April 2013 and follow up continued until July 2013 (once the final 6&#x000a0;week postnatal questionnaires were returned).</p><p>During the feasibility and pilot phases of the project, seven substantial amendments were submitted to ethics and governance scrutiny, and were approved. None of the amendments affected the central design of the study, so data from all phases were included in the final analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Response rates and data completeness</title><p>In all, 680 women were randomised, three in error.

Twenty-seven of the 29 pre-specified outcomes did not demonstrate significant differences between the two groups. At 2&#x000a0;weeks postnatal, there was a significantly lower score for actual experiences of anxiety and fear associated with childbirth for those randomised to the intervention group versus the control group, when compared with the baseline scores given for their expectations in this area. The response rate at 2&#x000a0;weeks postnatal limits the generalisibility of this result. However, there was a similar finding in a recent Danish study of self-hypnosis for labour pain,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> so this outcome should be considered in any future trials of self-hypnosis for labour pain.</p><p>As far as we are aware, this cost analysis is the first to be planned in relation to self-hypnosis training in pregnancy. Results of the cost analysis suggest that the extra cost of the self-hypnosis sessions was very low for the participants in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>The SHIP trial is the largest RCT on self-hypnosis for labour undertaken in the UK to date. Except for a study carried out in the US in 2004 where one practitioner visited three sites to provide intra-partum hypnosis, over 10&#x000a0;years,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> the SHIP trial is also the only trial located in more than one centre, and and the only one that has included a range of types of place of birth. It is also the only trial involving a large group of hypnosis practitioners, increasing the external generalisibility of the findings. In addition, the study included birth companions, which does not seem to be the case in other trials in this area.</p><p>However, the ability of the study to address the study objectives is limited by the fact that approximately 10% of the control group reported using self-hypnosis in labour. This illustrates both the current popularity of hypnosis-based antenatal education sessions and the general methodological difficulty of undertaking a controlled study to evaluate a technique that is popular and relatively widely available privately. The two other recent trials in this area report access to antenatal education, including hypnosis, outside of the trial protocol, but neither report rates of use of hypnosis in labour for each of the randomised groups.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>We took the pragmatic decision to test a form of self-hypnosis training that was delivered earlier in pregnancy than with most other trials in this area, and with fewer sessions&#x02014;two versus three for most other trials. The earlier start was on the advice of the hypnosis experts involved, as, in their anecdotal experience, patients with chronically painful medical conditions benefited more the earlier hypnosis was instituted and the more it was practised. We reduced the number of face-to-face taught sessions to two as there were a large number of drop outs for the third session in the Cyna study that was completing at the same time as we were designing our protocol,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> but we strongly encouraged women to keep listening to the CD daily from the time they attended the first session until the birth of their baby. However, the SHIP trial does not answer the question as to whether longer courses of hypnosis training starting even earlier in pregnancy, might have an impact. We did not have a &#x02018;sham&#x02019; group, as it was agreed by the team that the positive effect of being in a group is an intrinsic part of this kind of therapy. We also did not assess the degree to which attending labour ward staff were blinded to group allocation. Lower than optimal return rates of the postnatal questionnaires, and of the intervention group antenatal logs reduces the generalisability of some of the findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Interpretation</title><p>Our findings support those of the recent Australian and Danish studies in this area.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Adding prenatal self-hypnosis training to usual care in a UK setting does not seem to affect the rates of epidural analgesia or of most of the intra-partum and psychosocial variables tested in this study. It is therefore unlikely that a short course of hypnosis will change rates of epidural use in high resource settings where such analgesia is widely available.</p><p>There was a significant impact on postnatal maternal assessment of childbirth anxiety and fear when compared with antenatal expectation. The generalisibility of this is limited by the low response rate at 2&#x000a0;weeks postnatal. However, a recent Danish study<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> also noted an effect on childbirth fear, and this might be an area for examination in future.</p><p>Our cost analysis suggests that providing a short programme of self-hypnosis training in pregnancy is likely to incur relatively low costs.</p><p>Before doing further similar trials, it would be prudent to pool all the data currently available across all published trials, to establish the impact, if any, on sub-groups, so that future studies can be tailored more precisely. Studies of self-hypnosis training via different routes might also be useful. Because of the known effect of labour ward context, organisational ethos, and practitioner preference on women's decision-making about interventions in childbirth, future studies should include more in-depth qualitative work. The cost-effectiveness of different methods of providing hypnosis, including on-line apps or packages, and schemes starting earlier in pregnancy, could also be assessed. Consideration should be given to the most meaningful primary outcome measure, and to ways of maximising response rates for longitudinal data collection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The SHIP trial found no statistically significant difference in the use of epidural analgesia between women receiving two NHS-funded group-based sessions of hypnosis training alongside reinforcement with a CD as well as standard care, and women receiving standard care only, in a context where both epidural analgesia and private hypnosis training for labour pain are widely available. There is no evidence of extra risk for either mother or baby, and the extra cost of providing the programme appears to be minimal. The generalisibility of the finding of reduced levels of childbirth fear and anxiety in women randomised to self-hypnosis needs to be tested in future studies with higher response rates at follow up. Such studies could include alternative means of delivering self-hypnosis training, and different programme lengths. Interviews with women and detailed economic analysis should also be considered.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to all of the women and birth companions who participated in this trial.</p><p>The following people and institutions made significant contributions to the running of the SHIP Trial:</p><p>Trial Steering Committee&#x02014;S.D., P.S., C.M., K.F., Andrew Weeks (Professor of Women's &#x00026; Children's Health, University of Liverpool), Tina Lavender (Professor of Midwifery, University of Manchester), Gill Gyte (Parents&#x02019; representative, member of committee), Steven Lane (Lecturer in Biostatistics, University of Liverpool), Pierre-Martin Hirsch (Consultant Gynaecological Oncologist, Royal Preston Hospital), Catherine Gedling (Research &#x00026; Development Manager, East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust).</p><p>Trial Working Group&#x02014;S.D., H.S., P.D., P.S., P.W., V.M., S.H., C.M., K.F., S.A., M.W., Louise Dunn (ELHT MSLC Chair) Professor David Torgerson (Director of York Trials Unit), Linda Gregson (Deputy Research &#x00026; Development Manager, East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust).</p><p>Collaborating Hospitals (*indicates Principal Investigator at collaborating site)</p><p>East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust: C.M.*, M.W., S.H., C.G., L.G., L.D., Hasan Javed, Nicola Moss, Matthew Leluga, Megan Blease, Rachael Evans, Gillian Parker Evans, Helen Carr, Sarah Jackson, Joanne Lambert, Glenys Gallagher, Mercedes Perez-Botella, Bev Hammond, Shirley Bibby, Pam Inniss, Dawn Mullin &#x00026; Geraldine Geraghty [Correction added on 7 July 2015, after first online publication: Pam Inniss, Dawn Mullin &#x00026; Geraldine Geraghty have been added to the Acknowledgements.].</p><p>Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust: Katrina Rigby*, Angela Philipson, Julie Butler, Susan Burt, Janet Edwards, Deepsi Khatiwada, Gemma Whiteley, Marie Holden.</p><p>Liverpool Women's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust: Gillian Houghton*, Michelle Dower, Heather Longworth, Angela Pascall, Falak Diab, Paula Cato, Joan Ellard, Anne Hirrell, Jennifer Bright, Gillian Vernon, Louise Hardman.</p><p>York Clinical Trials Unit: David Torgerson, Andrew Foster, Val Wadsworth, Ben Cross, Maggie Gowlett, Sarah Gardner.</p><p>University of Central Lancashire: S.D., K.F., Naseerah Akooji, Laura Elizabeth Bangs-Hoskin, Fallon Dyer, Rebecca Knapp, Frank Longdon, Alexandra Scurr.</p></ack><sec><title>Disclosure of interests</title><p>Full disclosure of interests available to view online as supporting information.</p></sec><sec><title>Contribution to authorship</title><p>All authors were involved equally in the development and design of the trial, the conduct of the trial, drafting of the manuscript, revision for intellectual content and approval of the final submitted version.
