These benefits include major control of intraoperative pain, attenuation of the surgical response, minimal circulatory compromise, lesser incidence of nausea and vomit, excellent postoperative analgesia, reduced in-hospital stay and better cost-effectiveness budget, and lesser circulatory compromise.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The discomfort during the procedure to provide peripheral block occurs even after preanesthetic evaluation and the use of a comfortable medication.</p><p>To proceed any regional block, it is necessary the insertion of a needle of a variety of gauge and tip design. It may be painful. To attenuate this problem and to improve the comfort to patients, sedation is induced to provide analgesia and amnesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Infiltration of the puncture site with local anesthetic is necessary to provide pain relief and reduce the incidence of pain during peripheral block needle puncture.</p><p>Ketamine was introduced as a sole anesthetic agent with power to produce analgesia, amnesia, unconsciousness, and immobility. The isomer S(+) ketamine would provide lesser adverse effects such as nausea and vomit, as compared to the racemic mixture.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Ketamine has a rapid, smooth, and previsible effect. In low doses, it has a fast action and previsible duration and produce a dissociative anesthesia with sedation, analgesia, and amnesia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The primary objective of this prospective study was to compare the efficacy of four subanesthetic doses of dextroketamine in the reduction of pain during the placement of a brachial plexus block through the posterior approach technique with the use of a needle of 30&#x000b0; bevel. Besides that, secondary effects of dextroketamine were also observed such as incidence of nystagmus, discrete hallucination, incidence of tachycardia, and high blood pressure, and satisfaction with the technique in the Postanesthestic Care Unit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After registration of the protocol in the Plataforma Brasil (CAAE: 33373214.1.0000.5179) and approval of the Ethic Committee in Research (Register number 05787/2014) and the signature of approval to participate in the protocol, the double-blind study was applied in patients between 18 and 60 years of age, weighing between 50 and 90 kg of both sexes to undertake orthopedic surgery of the upper limb. Approved patients were of both sexes, included at random, physical status American Society of Anesthesiology I and II aged between 18 and 60 years weighing 50 and 90 kg candidates to orthopedic surgery of the upper limbs. Patients with cardiac and respiratory disease, mental illness, neurological disease, sensibility to local anesthetic, or coagulation disturbance were excluded from the study.</p><p>Utilizing the significant level of 5% and an error limit 0.10, the sample size was 62 patients. Eighteen more patients were added to totalize a sample of eighty patients in four groups of twenty patients. Patients were allocated in one of the four groups at random through a closed envelop. Group A received dextroketamine (Crist&#x000e1;lia Produtos Qu&#x000ed;micos e Farmac&#x000ea;uticos Ltda) 0.1 mg/kg, Group B received 0.15 mg/kg of dextroketamine, Group C received 0.2 mg/kg of dextroketamine, and Group D received 0.25 mg/kg of dextroketamine intravenously. After opening the envelope, the drug of the study was administered by an assistant through an insulin syringe.</p><p>No premedication was administered in the room. After venous puncture with 20 or 18G catheter was started, infusion of Ringer's lactate solution began. Monitoring in the operating room consisted of continuous electrocardiogram using the CM5 lead, blood pressure by noninvasive method, and pulse oximetry.</p><p>After administration of midazolam (1 mg), sedation was evaluated[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. After this evaluation, dextroketamine was administered according to the sorted group. Between 2 and 3 min after administration of dextroketamine, its effect was evaluated through the same sedation scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The patient is placed in the sitting position for the administration of the block through the posterior access and facility or difficulty observed was noted. Patients were seated for the block to be placed. Facility or difficulty to place the patient in position for the block was noted according to a scale of two points: (1) The patient sits in the operating table without any help, (2) the patient needed help to sit up. With aseptic condition, the plexus block was performed with a Stimuplex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> A100 needle gauge 21G with a cutting bevel of 30&#x000b0; (B. Braun Melsungen AG) without local anesthetic infiltration, coupled to a neurostimulator HNS12 (B. Braun Melsungen AG). The needle was advanced until a stimulus of the suprascapular nerve was excited with a stimulus of 0.5 mA and a response observed. After a negative aspiration for blood, 20 mL of lidocaine 2% (Crist&#x000e1;lia Produtos Qu&#x000ed;micos e Farmac&#x000ea;uticos Ltda) and 20 mL of Levobupivacaine 0.5% (Crist&#x000e1;lia Produtos Qu&#x000ed;micos e Farmac&#x000ea;uticos Ltda) were injected. A scale of four points was noted for the behavior of each patient during the introduction of the needle according to a four points scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Following that, the patient was placed recumbent for the surgery. nystagmus, hallucination, tachycardia, high blood pressure, high-frequency rate, high blood pressure, low blood O<sub>2</sub> saturation (&#x0003c;96%), apnea, airway obstruction, and any other collateral effects.

This study has also shown that sedation, the facility to position the patient, the reduction of needle pain, and the appearance of hallucinations was dose dependent. Different doses produced different results, but the time to proceed the block was the same for all four groups.</p><p>The available ketamine is a racemic balanced mixture of dextro and levo isomers. The dextro isomer is 3 times more potent as analgesic and 2&#x02013;4 times more potent as analgesic,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] causing less psychedelic effects when compared to the levorotation or racemic form. The dextroketamine utilized in this study was recently studied, resulting in less hypnosis, greater analgesia, without psychedelic effects when compared to the racemic mixture.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In this study, subanesthetic doses of dextroketamine produced satisfactory analgesia (no pain) during the insertion of the needle in 55% of patients and none of the patients presented a greater degree of sedation (score 4).</p><p>Lower doses of ketamine utilized associated with diazepam may reduce the psychiatric symptoms during the emergency of patients.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In this study, midazolam was administered in a fixed dose (1 mg) in all patients before the administration of dextroketamine, but it was not sufficient to prevent these uncomfortable effects. Many adverse effects are frequently related with the use of ketamine. These effects are described as floating sensation, vivid dreams, hallucinations, and delirium.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] They seem to be related to the dose administered.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In our study, using low doses of dextroketamine, confirmed that the appearance of these effects was dose dependent.</p><p>Ketamine differs from the majority of anesthetic agents as they seem to stimulate the cardiovascular system, increasing the cardiac rhythm, cardiac debt, and blood pressure.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Benzodiazepines are utilized to attenuate these effects.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In our study, midazolam was used in a fixed dose of 1 mg, and an increase in cardiac beats was found in three patients (Groups C and D) and an increased blood pressure in two patients of the same group.</p><p>When used in subanesthetic doses, its analgesic efficacy correlates with its inhibitor action in the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and also a reduction of the activity of cerebral structures that respond to nociceptive stimuli.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Ketamine represents, by all means, a promising modality in a variety of perioperative strategy to prevent pain. In this study, dextroketamine was utilized to reduce or abolish pain during the placing of a brachial plexus block by the posterior approach with a 21G needle, in a dose dependent effect.</p><p>With anesthetic doses of ketamine (that is, 1&#x02013;3 mg/kg), more than one-third of patients may have unpleasant dreams or psychotic symptoms that may or not be associated with hallucination.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Subanesthetic doses of ketamine (0.1 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg) may harm some areas or control of cognitive function, such as attention, free recall, memory of reconnaissance, and the process of thought, in healthy human volunteers.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In our study, utilizing four different doses, no cognitive tests were realized, but we observed cases of hallucination that were dose dependent.</p><p>In a recent study evaluating spinal anesthesia with a 25G cutting needle, three groups with doses of 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mg/kg, the authors concluded that ketamine produced dose-dependent sedation with a statistical difference between the three groups.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] These authors concluded that ketamine in the dose of 0.3 mg/kg provided sufficient sedation to dissipate the discomfort due to a minor sedation, lesser difficulty to position for the block, short time for verbal response, no hallucinations, and patient satisfaction.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In our study, utilizing four different doses of ketamine, all of them smaller than the smallest one in the other study,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] the same results were obtained.</p><p>Ketamine was used for a variety of procedures including preoperative and intraoperative sedation, anesthesia as a sole drug, balanced anesthesia, and sedation during regional anesthesia and postoperative analgesia. Another reason for the interest on this drug is the availability of the S(&#x02212;) ketamine. The majority of patients fear the pain or the possibility of pain during the insertion of the needle for a regional technique. The insertion of the needle in an adult patient is conducted with prior sedation (benzodiazepine or opioid) and infiltration with local anesthetic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>In subanesthetic doses, ketamine has analgesic effects.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Dextroketamine in doses of 0.1 mg/kg provided sufficient sedation to place the patient in a comfortable position to facilitate the administration of the block with 21G needle in 55% of patients, with no hemodynamic change.
