It is a chronic and debilitating condition that affects the physical, psychological, social and economic well-being of affected individuals and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and substantially reduces quality of life (QoL) similarly to severe chronic diseases such as stroke, arthritis and chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Prevalence estimates of urinary incontinence (UI) are disparate, ranging from 7 % to 53 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], depending on variables such as definition of UI used, survey population, methodological and cultural differences, with SUI accounting for approximately 50 % of all incontinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The current guideline advocates pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) as the first-line conservative treatment for SUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Use of other conservative therapeutic options, such as biofeedback, vaginal cones, electrical stimulation and urethral plugs, is limited because of their side effects, discomfort and invasiveness. Although surgical interventions using midurethral slings have unquestionably superior cure rates of approximately 90 %, compared with 30 % in conventional physiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], some patients may be medically unfit for surgery, especially elderly patients. Moreover, there is a risk of adverse events related to surgery, such as bladder perforation, vaginal epithelial perforation and hematoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Indeed, when given a choice, most patients opt for conservative treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Treatment options should therefore be based on the collaborative efforts between patients and doctors, taking into account both the patient&#x02019;s preferences and the surgeon&#x02019;s judgment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Given the high SUI prevalence and its overwhelming negative impact on the QoL of patients, there is a need for an acceptable therapeutic option with high efficacy. Many subsequent studies have focused on developing novel, non-invasive techniques to treat SUI, including the use of magnetic stimulation (MS). Several small studies, conducted in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], demonstrated that MS improved symptoms of SUI, with limited or no side effects. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> provides a summary of published clinical trials on MS for SUI in more detail. We recently conducted a systematic review and found that most of the previous MS studies on SUI had flaws, including lack of a placebo group, small sample size, short or no follow-up and poor reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The Fifth International Consultation on Incontinence emphasized that no recommendation is possible based on current evidence and that further research is needed to reduce the uncertainty around decision-making regarding the use of MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Many key issues remain. Is MS effective for female SUI? How many sessions are needed? How long can the effects last? Is maintenance therapy required? To answer these questions, a high-quality randomized controlled trial is imperative. Thus, we designed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial with the objective of evaluating whether patients with SUI treated with MS have a higher continence rate than sham-treated patients.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims of the study</title><p>The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of MS in female patients with SUI. Furthermore, we intend to show that MS therapy is safe and effective when provided in a community setting and to prove its overall cost-effectiveness.

This medical device uses electromagnetic pulsing technology for pelvic floor muscle stimulation, which was approved as a conservative treatment for UI by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and by the European Commission in January 2011. It generates a homogeneous magnetic field via a magnetic coil embedded beneath the surface of the seat. When applied with high electric currents, the magnetic coil generates pulsed electromagnetic fields that are able to penetrate deep into the pelvic floor to reach the relevant conductive tissues. The changing magnetic field induces a flow of ions to propagate electrical eddy currents. A voltage gradient ensues, and membrane depolarization occurs. During this consistent trajectory, a sufficiently large membrane depolarization will result in an action potential along the nerve tissues. In the pelvic floor, this leads to pelvic floor nerve stimulation (stimulation of motor end plates) and ultimately pelvic floor muscle contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>QRS-1010 PelviCenter magnetic stimulation device</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_803_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>In both groups, treatment involves two sessions of 20 minutes each per week for 8 weeks (16 sessions total). After the 8-week treatment, subjects who are not satisfied with their treatment outcome will be given the opportunity to enroll in an open-label phase, regardless of their treatment allocation. Subjects will be considered treatment defaulters if they miss treatments for more than 2 consecutive weeks.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Active magnetic stimulation</title><p>Subjects will be seated with the perineum in the middle of the seat to allow for the greatest effect of the pulsing magnetic field on the pelvic floor and sphincter muscles. Stimulation intensity will be gradually increased, beginning with 20 % simulation on the first session, followed by increments of 20 % (or maximum tolerable stimulation) until they receive stimuli at 100 % intensity using a stimulation repetition cycle of 50 Hz in an 8-s &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; 4-s &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; pulsing manner by a study nurse not involved in the assessments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sham magnetic stimulation</title><p>To ensure that sham subjects&#x02019; experiences are similar to the intervention, the sham group will undergo the same number, duration and frequency of treatments as the active group using the same MS device and stimulation frequency. However, unlike the intervention, the magnetic coil will be tilted to 22&#x000b0; down with a lower stimulation intensity, beginning with 20 % simulation intensity at the first session, followed by gradually increasing increments of 20 % intensity after every five sessions until a maximum of 60 % intensity is reached (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The combination of these methods has been shown to provide a total energy output of 136 kJ, (or 8.500 J each session) during the 8-week study period, which is far less than the energy output of one 20-minute active mode run (at 100 % intensity) of 408 kJ, thus providing a similar appearance as the active treatment.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Flux generator positions of active versus sham stimulation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_803_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study outcomes</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome measure is the improvement in the severity of involuntary urine loss.

Costs and effectiveness results are synthesized in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Safety and adverse events</title><p>MS has a good safety profile, with no reported adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, all adverse events, which include (but are not limited to) any unexpected signs and symptoms, newly diagnosed disease, unusual laboratory findings or hospitalizations, will be documented, regardless of whether the adverse event is related to MS. In cases where there is deterioration in a subject&#x02019;s preexisting disease during the course of the study, this information will also be documented as an adverse event. During every follow-up visit, subjects will be asked if they are experiencing any adverse effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Randomization</title><p>Subjects will be assigned in a 1:1 allocation to either the active or sham MS group using computer-generated, permuted block randomization, with variable block sizes of four, six and eight, by an independent pharmacist with no clinical involvement in the trial. Details of the allocated group are given in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes to an appointed nurse involved in administering the treatments to subjects. The independent pharmacist who generates the randomization list will ensure that the envelopes are opaque and impermeable when held to the light. Additionally, the sealed envelopes are stored in a locked cabinet accessible only by the appointed nurse. Enrollment of subjects (assessment of eligibility, discussion of the trial, obtaining informed consent) will be done by investigators and clinicians who are blinded to treatment allocation. Following enrollment of a subject, the investigator will assign the subject a unique identification number. In the first treatment session for each subject, the appointed study nurses will sequentially open the envelopes. The subject&#x02019;s unique identification number and date will be written on the appropriate allocated envelope.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Blinding and unblinding and control for bias</title><p>Investigators who carry out outcome measure assessments and statisticians who perform data analysis will not be informed of the allocation assignment. The same appointed study nurses who sequentially open the treatment allocation envelopes will be in charge of administering treatments for the subjects during each visit, and they will not be involved in any outcome assessments. Formal training on operating the QRS-1010 PelviCenter will be provided to the study nurses by an engineer from QRS International. Additionally, treatment appointments will be handled by the independent study nurses, and the investigators will not come into contact with the subjects at any time during the treatment sessions. All personnel involved in the study will adhere to standard operating procedures, with clear separation between investigators who conduct outcome assessments and study nurses who administer the treatments.</p><p>In the event of an unexpected medical emergency, subject allocation may be unblinded to the investigator or clinician. The investigator will report the unblinding to the sponsor, followed by submission of a detailed report to the sponsor. The events in which unblinding may occur include (but are not limited to) (1) the subject becomes pregnant while receiving the intervention; (2) an adverse event requires unblinding to provide safety information necessary to manage the subject&#x02019;s condition; and (3) a serious adverse event requires unblinding to decide whether to continue or discontinue participation. An unblinding report will be completed by the investigator, with reasons for the unblinding specified.</p><p>Various measures will be taken to control for sources of bias. For selection bias, differences between the baseline characteristics of the two treatment groups will be compared to ensure that randomization is accomplished successfully. The appointed study nurse will sequentially open the envelopes, which will be counterchecked by another study nurse to ensure correct implementation of treatment assignments. To avoid performance and detection bias, the investigators are not allowed to be present in the treatment room. The appointed nurses who administer treatment will not be involved in enrolling the patients or in any outcome measure assessments. To evaluate the effectiveness of blinding of study participants, each subject will be asked to answer the following question at the end of the 16 treatment sessions: Which treatment do you think you received? The subject will have three possible answers: &#x0201c;active treatment&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;don&#x02019;t know&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;sham treatment&#x0201d;. Patients&#x02019; ability to correctly identify treatment assignment at the end of the 8-week treatment will be analyzed and compared between the two treatment groups. Finally, to control for attrition bias, differences between the number of withdrawals from the study, including the reasons for withdrawal, will be analyzed and compared between the two treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Subject withdrawal</title><p>The subjects may choose to withdraw from the study, or they may be withdrawn from the study, at any time at the discretion of the investigator. If a subject withdraws or is withdrawn, every effort will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible.</p><p>The possible reasons for withdrawal include (but are not limited to) (1) subject&#x02019;s decision, (2) intolerable adverse events, (3) clinically significant laboratory abnormality, (4) protocol violation (e.g., incorrectly enrolled or randomized), (5) subject requires use of unacceptable concomitant medication, (6) subject not compliant with protocol procedures, (7) subject develops a condition during the study that violates the inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., pregnancy), (8) death and/or (9) any other reason, in the investigator&#x02019;s opinion, that would impede the subject&#x02019;s participation in the study.</p><p>In the event of pregnancy, the subject will be monitored until the conclusion of the pregnancy, and the outcome of the pregnancy will be reported. If a subject ends her participation in the study before randomization (before the first treatment visit), she will be replaced by another randomly selected patient. If this happens, the situation and circumstances will be documented in the case report form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical methods</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Two types of sample size calculations were performed: non-repeated measures and repeated measures. Our primary outcome of interest is the difference in proportion of responders between the active and sham groups after 8 weeks of treatment, defined as a reduction of 5 points or more from baseline to 8 weeks in the ICIQ-UI-SF total score. On the basis of outcomes derived from previously published data on MS, it is anticipated that MS will improve symptoms in 60 % (p1 = 0.6) of subjects with SUI, whereas sham MS will improve symptoms in 30 % (p2 = 0.3) of subjects with SUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, a minimum sample size of 88 (44 per arm) is powered to detect a difference of at least 30 % (&#x003b4; = 0.3), with a 95 % confidence interval (&#x003b1; = 0.05) and statistical power of 80 % (&#x003b2; = 0.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Allowing for a 25 % dropout rate, the enrollment goal is 120 subjects.</p><p>We also calculated our sample size using PASS<sup>13</sup> Sample Size Software (NCSS Statistical Software, Kaysville, UT, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The tests for two proportions in a repeated-measures design, which can be used to calculate sample size in a mixed-model analysis of repeated measures data, was selected from among the PASS<sup>13</sup> statistical tools. Using the same parameters (&#x003b4; = 0.3, &#x003b1; = 0.05 and &#x003b2; = 0.2), an autoregressive AR(1) covariance pattern with autocorrelation of 1.0, and a design with six repeated measurements, a total sample size of 84 (<italic>n</italic> = 42 in each arm) was obtained. As the sample size calculated using a test of simple differences in proportion was higher, we selected the initial calculated sample size.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data entry will be performed using Excel 2007 software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 21.0 software (Armonk, NY, USA) will be used to analyze the collected data. All statistical analysis will be conducted by an independent statistician, with blinding of assessors maintained. A <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05 is considered statistically significant.</p><p>Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze baseline characteristics. To compare baseline demographic data between the treatment groups, independent <italic>t</italic>-tests (or the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test) will be used to analyze continuous data, and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> or Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests will be used for categorical data.</p><p>In the main analysis, we will compare all subjects who are randomized in this study on an intention-to-treat basis, irrespective of whether they completed the allocated treatments. Data will be analyzed by using a longitudinal method (repeated-measures design). No missing data imputation will be implemented (e.g., mean imputation, last observation carried forward, multiple imputation). Instead, a linear mixed model (LMM) and a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) that do not require formal imputation methods will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Continuous dependent variables will be analyzed with LMM, fitted with restricted maximum likelihood estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The multilevel approach (LMM and GLMM) will be used, as it accounts for the non-independence among observations in repeated-measures data and controls for the effect of individuals by including extra parameters to include any random effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, a different covariance matrix can be specified, providing enhanced flexibility for longitudinal data analysis, as opposed to the traditional repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), which assumes compound symmetry (i.e., equal variances and covariances over time) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Compound symmetry means that the pattern of covariances or correlations is constant across trials, which can be an unrealistic assumption. Mauchly&#x02019;s test of sphericity in repeated-measures ANOVA is used to test whether sphericity (a less stringent form of compound symmetry) is met. Repeated-measures ANOVA must meet various assumptions, including compound symmetry, balanced data and complete dataset to ensure robust use.</p><p>The main outcome measure (responder analysis of ICIQ-UI-SF, dichotomous variable) and other dichotomous variables will be analyzed using GLMM (binomial logistic regression). We will estimate the marginal means of proportions, odds ratios comparing treatments and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals. The fixed effects include time, code and interactions between code and time. Code comprises two binary coded variables, with the sham group set as the reference group. We are primarily interested in the code and time interaction, which represents the difference in outcome variables between groups.</p><p>For responder analysis of outcome measures, subjects who withdraw after randomization (missing data) will be considered as treatment failures and will be included in the denominator. The responder analysis between treatment groups will be compared using GLMM (binary logistic regression).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Quality control and monitoring</title><p>Before commencing the trial, the protocol will be reviewed and revised by all parties involved in the study, including urologists, gynecologists and academicians. All investigators and nurses involved in the clinical trial will be trained on the study procedures and will attend the Good Clinical Practice workshop before the start of the trial. The current curriculum vitae and training records of all investigators will be forwarded to the sponsor and the ethics committee.</p><p>To maximize subject retention, timely reminders for appointments via telephone calls or text messages will be sent by study investigators. Subjects who discontinue treatments will be encouraged to return for follow-up. Nevertheless, in the event of dropout or subject refusal of follow-up, the subject&#x02019;s decision will be acknowledged.</p><p>In accordance with the requirements of International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice, regular monitoring of the study will be carried out throughout the study. The investigator accepts a monitoring representative from the sponsor to visit the clinical trial centers regularly to ensure that the key requirements of the study are met. The monitoring representative will ascertain that the correct course of clinical trial study is conducted and the case report forms are accurate, reliable and complete.</p><p>To ensure patient confidentiality, all case report forms and relevant documents will be kept in locked cabinets. Each subject will be identified by a unique subject number. All files will be kept separately from identifying information used for subject tracking and follow-up contacts. The results of the research will not become part of the subject&#x02019;s medical history and will be used only for study purposes. The data published in reports, publications or presentations will not disclose any identifying information.</p><p>Any adverse events that are encountered will be recorded in the case report form. Any serious adverse events that occur during the course of the clinical trial will be documented in the case report form and reported within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event to the sponsor and the ethics committee.</p><p>In the event of any injury resulting from the research procedures, the sponsor assumes liability by law on behalf of the investigators to compensate the cost of medical treatment provided to the subjects. Financial compensation is not available from the sponsor. The cost of medical care of any illness or injury not directly related to subjects&#x02019; participation in the study will not be compensated. An insurance policy is provided by the sponsor of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Committee of Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki, and it has been approved by the Joint Ethics Committee of the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, USM-Hospital Lam Wah Ee on Clinical Studies [USM-HLWE/IEC/2013(0006)]. Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject by the investigators before the subject enters the trial.</p><p>During the course of the study, if important protocol modifications are planned, amendments will be submitted to the ethics committee for reapproval. A new written consent form will be given to the subjects if the changes concern them (such as changes in the duration of treatment, changes in inclusion or exclusion criteria).</p><p>Only the investigators will have access to the final trial dataset. The sponsor will have access to the final trial dataset after all statistical analyses have been performed. To disseminate our findings, the clinical trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial of SUI using pulsed MS. The trial is adequately powered and will use validated outcomes. Previous studies conducted with MS had inherent flaws, resulting in inconclusive evidence on this treatment modality. A search of trial registers indicates that there are currently no ongoing, prospective clinical trials investigating our research question of interest (last search done on 5 December 2014).</p><p>There is a need for a high-quality randomized clinical trial on this topic with a sham group, adequate sample size, appropriate methodology and validated outcome measures, as well as long-term follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We intend to address the shortcomings of previous studies in our trial and to obtain convincing evidence on the efficacy of MS. We acknowledge the importance of applying a sham MS as a control. We will use a specially designed MS device for the purposes of this trial. The appearance and noise are identical to the active treatment. The sum of energy output of the 8-week sham treatment is lower than the sum of energy output of one 20-minute active mode run (K Dobler, personal communication). Furthermore, we will recruit only subjects who are naive to MS. All subjects will be told that they may experience a tingling sensation. Subjects will also be assessed for effectiveness of blinding at the end of the 8-week treatments. To further allow for double-blinding, all assessors involved in the study will be deliberately prohibited from entering the treatment room, and treatment will be coordinated by independent study nurses. Collectively, these measures allow better blinding of subjects with the aim to diminish the placebo effects.</p><p>Next, we determined our sample size based on a priori calculation to ensure that our study is adequately powered to answer our primary outcome of interest. To evaluate the effects of MS on SUI, we selected various subjective and objective outcome measures as recommended by international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Further, we chose a patient-reported outcome, the ICIQ-UI-SF questionnaire, as our primary outcome measure because we recognize the importance of judging treatment benefit from a patient&#x02019;s perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We hope that use of standardized, internationally accepted tools will ease data pooling in meta-analyses, limiting the number of high-quality clinical trials required to draw concrete conclusion on this treatment option.</p><p>MS is a non-invasive procedure and has been shown to be effective in SUI in various open-label studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Further advantages are no reported adverse events, unnecessary to undress, automatic contractions and no pain. If the efficacy of MS is better than PFMT, which has a success rate of approximately 30 %, it may be a reasonable option for patients with SUI who are not keen to undergo surgery. The results of our trial are expected to add essential confirmatory data regarding whether MS is effective for women with SUI.</p><p>Our protocol has some limitations. To maximally exclude any placebo effects, various considerations were taken when designing the sham MS. We used the same MS device, designed a coil that can be tilted to adjust the strength of contractions, and included only subjects who are naive to MS. Nevertheless, we think that our blinding methods may be unsuccessful in some patients. Selective refusal by participants in the present study may limit the generalizability of the study results to the wider public. Furthermore, when we first designed the trial, we specified a follow-up period of 6 months for logistical reasons. However, we intend to prolong our follow-up period to a minimum of 1 year, as recommended by guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Amendments have been made and submitted to our local ethics committee. Finally, we selected our sample size based on our primary outcome data analysis method (responder analysis: percentage of subjects who meet primary criterion of response). Our study may be underpowered for determination of statistical significance for the secondary outcome measures.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial has completed its recruitment but is continuing to follow-up patients.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2015_803_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
