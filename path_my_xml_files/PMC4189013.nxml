In the first study, 19 subjects consumed 35 g lipids from LOO or yoghurt in a breakfast meal. In a follow-up study, 15 women consumed 14 or 1.8 g lipids from LOO mixed in yoghurt. Blood samples were analyzed for plasma lipids, insulin, glucose, and intestinal hormones CCK, PYY, GLP-1, and GLP-2 before and four times after the meal. Subjective analysis of satiety was measured using a visual analog scale questionnaire.

This coincided with a prolonged elevation of triglycerides and large cholesterol-containing particles. Non-esterified fatty acids decreased after intake of 14 and 1.8 g lipids from LOO. The subjective sensation of satiety in women was increased 7 h after intake of 35 g lipids from LOO without any difference in food intake.

The presence of fat in the distal small intestine stimulates release of gastric hormones, slows down gastric emptying and pancreatic secretion, and induces satiety (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Dietary fat is normally emulsified by the action of bile salts and polar lipids, and the core lipids of micelles and emulsion particles are accessible to the battery of pancreatic lipolytic enzymes. Polar lipids in general are very surface-active compounds (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Changes in the surface structure of dietary lipids, caused by changes in the composition of the polar lipids around the core lipids, may affect the rate by which the core lipids are being hydrolyzed (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Consequently, hormone-induced satiety and postprandial plasma lipid output can be affected by modification of the polar lipids around the core lipids.</p><p>The gut hormones cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and peptide YY (PYY) are released after a meal and influence the appetite center in hypothalamus. CCK induces satiety in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). GLP-1 is released as response to intake of macronutrients and reduces gastric emptying (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Dietary fat was reported to be the most powerful stimulant of PYY secretion when investigating single nutrients (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). PYY is also a key mediator of ileal brake (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>
The glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) is not a satiety hormone, but it is co-expressed with GLP-1, and acts locally as a growth factor for the intestinal cells. Factors stimulating the increase in postprandial GLP-2 are not fully identified, but undigested or partly digested lipids in the terminal ileum are suggested factors (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Polar lipids, comprising glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and in plants also galactolipids, are major lipid constituents in cell membranes. They represent a minor component in our diet with an average intake of 3&#x02013;5 g/day (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Oats contain more lipids than other cereals, and extracted oat oil has a high concentration of polar lipids, about 15 wt%. The main component of polar lipids in oats is the galactolipid digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), and 50% of the DGDG in oats contain a hydroxyl fatty acid, 15(R)-hydroxy linoleic acid, mainly in <italic>sn</italic>-2 position on the glycerol. The hydroxyl group is completely esterified with another fatty acid. This acyl-digalactosyl diacylglycerol is a natural estolide, which is unique for oats (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)
.</p><p>Galactolipids are mainly hydrolyzed by the pancreatic lipase related protein 2 (PLRP2), an enzyme from the pancreatic lipase family which has been shown to be a galactolipase (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). When surface lipids contain not only phospholipids but also galactolipids, the lipolysis of the core triglycerides (TGs) can be affected (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, the digestion of oat estolides is unknown.</p><p>We propose that after ingestion of galactolipid-rich oils dispersed into very small liposomes, the amount of lipids in distal parts of the small intestine will increase. The mechanism for this may be that the very small liposomes may cause hindrance of the lipolytic enzymes to hydrolyze the lipids; that is, a film rich in galactolipids will cover the active sites of the lipases which may hamper the rate of lipid hydrolysis. Another suggested mechanism is that particles with a galactolipid-rich surface will be hydrolyzed at a slower rate and leave partly undigested and unabsorbed lipid products in distal part of the intestine. An increasing amount of lipids in the ileum will thereby stimulate hormonal signals of satiety and affect postprandial lipemia at a relative low energy intake.</p><p>In order to investigate the hypothesis that galactolipid-rich small particles will affect gastrointestinal satiety hormones and postprandial lipemia, we have developed processes to produce very small, stable, and uniform liposomes from fractionated oat oil (LOO) (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Different concentrations of LOO were given to healthy volunteers in a breakfast meal and we investigated: plasma levels of gastrointestinal hormones, metabolic parameters, perceived satiety, and total energy intake during the experimental day. We used milk fat as dairy yoghurt as control for two reasons: because it represents a commonly used food item in a Nordic breakfast, and because in the few numbers of studies similar to this one (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), dairy products were used as control.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Production of LOO</title><p>The oat oil fraction used in these experiments was high in polar lipids and obtained by controlling the concentration of ethanol, water, and sugar in different fractionation steps after ethanol extraction of oats.

The final liposome preparation contained 10 wt% lipids and 90 wt% water.

It was not possible to detect any changes in structure after 4 months in water. The stability decreased at decreasing pH. Using 1 M citric acid, it lasted 4 days before any changes could be seen. Thus, it is very reasonable that these liposomes were sufficiently stable to survive the low pH in the stomach and that they could enter the duodenum intact.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20002"><title>Human studies</title><p>In the first part, 19 healthy men and women (10 women, 9 men) of mean age 42, BMI 25, were recruited through announcements on the local intranet and advertisements.

The LOO was given in a breakfast meal after an overnight fast and compared to milk fat in dairy yoghurt.</p><p>The main finding was that intake of LOO significantly increased the appetite regulating hormones PYY, GLP-1, and CCK as well as the intestinal growth promoting hormone GLP-2, when the dose of LOO contained 14 and 35 g of lipids.</p><p>The proportions of TG, polar lipids, and sterols, as well as the proportion of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the meals were most different with the highest dose of LOO, and we can see how this reflects the postprandial plasma lipids accordingly. With the highest dose of LOO, we found prolonged elevated postprandial concentrations of plasma TG accompanied with decreased plasma glucose concentration. The peak concentration of TG is significantly lower than with dairy yoghurt, which reflects both the lower concentration of TG in LOO and also the lower concentration of saturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0002">2</xref>).</p><p>The concentration of NEFAs was lower after LOO than with milk fat. This can be indications of medium- and short chain fatty acids from the milk migrating as free fatty acids and also a smaller pool of TG-rich lipoproteins from LOO available for hydrolysis by lipoprotein lipase, but also indicate an effect of a hampered lipid digestion. A lowering of NEFAs is an important and desirable effect since elevated p-NEFA concentrations can increase the production of VLDLs and subsequently raise LDL-C levels (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>The prolonged TG elevation after intake of 35 g LOO was accompanied with an increase in large cholesterol-containing particles without any peak and a delayed return to baseline. The nature of these cholesterol particles was not investigated, but remnant particles from chylomicron and VLDL are expected to dominate at the later time intervals (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>In general we saw very little influence of LOO and placebo yoghurt on the plasma cholesterol levels. The acute intake of a meal containing 35 g fat or less has a low impact on postprandial cholesterol-rich particles, which has been shown in similar postprandial experiments (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, surface material from LOO and milk fat globule membrane might influence the formation of lipoprotein particles both in number and size and composition differently and thereby their degradation and uptake. In this case, the polar lipids from milk fat seem more accessible for the degrading enzymes and for the adsorbing surfaces than the polar lipids from LOO.</p><p>In healthy humans, the main glucose lowering effect following a meal is the inhibition of gastric emptying and increased insulin secretion both mediated by GLP-1. In the first study, intake of LOO with 35 g lipids might indicate a slower gastric emptying due to the hampered but prolonged lipemia. However, neither the postprandial glucose peak nor insulin appearing within the first hour was investigated.</p><p>The prolonged lipemia is in line with a significant increase of the intestinal hormones PYY, CCK, and GLP-1 and sensation of fullness at later time points.</p><p>We hypothesized to find a reversed correlation between postprandial gut hormone levels and total energy intake during the experimental day. The levels of PYY, GLP-1, and CCK were surprisingly high 5 h after consumption of LOO containing more than 14 g lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">7</xref>). The trend we found between PYY concentration and total energy intake during the rest of the day, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Eq. 1</xref>, indicates a reduction of energy intake during the rest of the day after a breakfast with LOO. Therefore we believe that we confirm other studies that show that higher plasma concentrations of PYY between meals are indicative of a reduction in energy intake in following meals (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, more investigations are required to find out if lower doses of LOO can achieve similar effects and if these effects remain after a long period of time.</p><p>We found significant differences in satiety hormones (PYY, GLP-1, and CCK) but also for other parameters like glucose, NEFAs, and GLP-2 compared to control for the two highest LOO doses (35 and 14 g lipids). However, for the lowest dose of LOO (1.8 g lipids), we could not detect any significant differences from placebo in this study. The responses were rather similar for the two highest doses, indicating a stepwise response rather than a linear response. Therefore, it is of interest to perform further studies with doses of LOO in the interval between 1.8 and 14 g lipids.</p><p>Maintaining a normal body weight is getting more and more difficult around the world due to constant access to energy dense food and less physical activity.</p><p>
In order to reduce obesity and overweight and to regain health, energy intake must be cut down and regular physical activity must be performed. It is often difficult to treat obesity efficiently due to physiological and psychological aspects. The most efficient means available today are by performing surgical gastric bypass and guidance by professional nutritionists. Pharmacological drugs and intake of functional food can offer a significant additive effect to a weight loss regime.</p><p>There are several studies addressing the issue of increased and prolonged satiety as a means to better control food intake (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). To add food components like soluble fiber or protein to beverages or liquid meal to reduce consecutive food intake has had some success (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Also, recently concentrated thylakoid membranes from spinach leafs was suggested to promote appetite control and weight loss (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Intake of different fatty acids PUFA may have effects on obesity but there is no consensus (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>Earlier intervention studies with Fabuless/Olibra, an emulsion containing 40 wt% fractionated palm oil, 2.5 wt% fractionated oat oil and 57.5 wt% water, showed a significant dose-dependent decrease in energy intake 4 h and the following day after intake of Fabuless/Olibra in a dairy yoghurt (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). These early results have been regarded as inconclusive since positive findings regarding reduced energy intake could not be repeated (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The difficulties in obtaining conclusive results are believed to be derived from factors such as eating behavior, study design, and processing of the Fabuless-yoghurt mixture.</p><p>The lipids used in the present study do not contain palm oil, only fractionated oat oil. The concentration of polar lipids in LOO was considerably higher than in Fabuless (56 vs. 2.5 lipid %). A consequence of this is that the structure of the particles is different; the core of liposomes (LOO) is water, while the core of the particles in an emulsion (Fabuless) is oil (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p><p>LOO can only be prepared when the concentration of polar lipids are above 50 lipid %. We have invented new procedures to prepare such liposomes (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The resulting LOOs are very stable and can pass the stomach without any substantial changes in the structure of the LOO caused by the low pH. The particle size of the used LOO was much smaller than milk fat globules, 100 vs. 1,000 nm. The positive postprandial effects are more obvious with LOO than with Fabuless, but the long-term effects from ingestion of LOO are not known.</p><p>We believe that due to the unique composition of the fractionated oat oil and the structure of the LOO used in this study, that LOO was digested differently than the dairy emulsion. The main factors that may influence the digestion of LOO compared to milk fat here is a physically changed surface structure affecting the hydrolysis of the lipids, or a different hydrolysis pattern of the galactolipids compared to the phospholipids by pancreatic lipases, and the influence of the size of the particles. The unique structure of the oat galactolipids, the estolides, may also contribute to the observed delayed digestion. The outcome of the delayed/hampered digestion of LOO is an increased exposure of the distal ileum to digested or partly digested LOO compared to milk fat.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that intake of LOO significantly affected postprandial TG, LC particles, glucose and the appetite regulating hormones CCK, PYY, GLP-1 as well as the sensation of satiety. Intake of LOO also significantly stimulated the growth promoting gut hormone GLP-2. These postprandial consentaneous results on healthy individuals argue for possible long-term effects from intake of LOO on satiety and food intake and possible also on gut health. A well-controlled long-term study aiming at satiety, weight control, and gut health on suitable subjects is therefore warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to acknowledge the excellent technical assistance by Yajun Cheng, Department of Clinical sciences in Lund, Sweden.
