on the balance ability and muscle function of elderly women. [Subjects] The subjects were
randomly divided into a control group (n=10) and an exercise group (n=10). [Methods] The
subjects participated in an elastic band exercise program lasting for 8 weeks, exercising
for 40 minutes, four days a week with resting terms of 60 sec. Subjects used a band
corresponding to 60% of the strength of the color band with which repetitive exercise was
possible up to twelve times. The subjects performed elastic band exercises, with
variations to the number of band exercises according to the improvement of their physical
fitness levels. When fifteen repetitive elastic band exercises could be performed with no
damage of the body, we changed the band for one which was one level up from the former one
and subjects used the same band for the upper body and lower body. [Results] Leg muscular
strength measured as sit-stand repetitions in 30&#x02005;s significantly increased in the exercise
group after the intervention compared to before the intervention. Leg muscular endurance
measured as the number of knee ups in 2 minutes significantly increased in the exercise
group after the intervention compared to before the intervention. Balance measured by
one-leg standing time with the eyes open significantly improved in the exercise group
after the intervention compared to before the intervention. [Conclusion] Balance ability
and muscle function significantly improved in the exercise group and showing that the
intervention is effective at improving balance, muscle strength, and muscle endurance of
elderly women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Balance ability</kwd><kwd>Muscle function</kwd><kwd>Exercise therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Since 1970, the proportion of the elderly population in Korea aged 65 and over has been on
the increase, rising from 3.1%, and account for 12.2% of the population in 2013. It is
anticipated that this proportion will account for 24.3% by 2030, and increase to 37.4% of
the population in 2050. Importantly, it is expected that the proportion of the super elderly
population over 85 will increase to 2.5% in 2030, and 7.7% in 2050, from 0.9% in 2013<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In Korea, compared with major advanced countries, the aging rate and dependency ratio of
old age were low in 2010, but they will eventually reach high levels, comparable to
Japan.</p><p>While it is expected that period of transition of elderly population ratio from 7% to 14%
will take 18&#x02005;years, this is a shorter time than the 115&#x02005;years for France, 75&#x02005;years for the
United States, 75&#x02005;years for the United Kingdom, and 24&#x02005;years for Japan<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Sarcopenia occurs with the progress of aging<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although sarcopenia seems not to be directly related to medical
expenses, it reduces independent living and causes declines in fitness and activity, and
increases the risk of injury from falls, because it is directly related to muscular
strength. It is also related to physical disability and it is associated with chronic
degenerative diseases such as diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension. Finally,
sarcopenia is a factor affecting the mortality rate<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Preventing sarcopenia is important for maintaining vibrant aging
through independent living. Various kinds of intervention should be tried, even though they
are not directly reflected in medical expenses, because preventing sarcopenia is an
objective for preventing chronic degenerative and adult diseases<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The elderly population has a higher risk of injury during
exercise than younger age groups. Although resistance exercise is recommended for the
prevention and treatment of sarcopenia, the potential for injury should always be
considered<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Flexibility is an important function which is related to the daily life of the elderly
population being a factor of health-related and active fitness. Although women tend to be
fatter and have less muscular strength, muscular endurance, and cardiovascular endurance
than men, women are generally more flexible. Because activities of daily living vary with
health-related fitness<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, a fitness
improvement exercise program is needed. Also, loss of equilibrium sense due to decline in
lower leg proprioception, slowdown in information delivery between the central and
peripheral nervous systems due to myoatrophy, and weakness of muscular strength lead to
injuries from falls<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies of elderly women have reported that exercise with Thera-bands improves
fitness and body composition<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and that
aerobic exercise is an effective fitness improvement method for the elderly population<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shin et al. proved that there was improved
effectiveness of leg muscular endurance, equilibrium, and gait function<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Hwang reported significant results, showing that
elastic band exercise improves dynamic balance, dexterity, muscular strength, and muscular
endurance<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Accordingly, exercises with elastic bands are considered important exercises because they
can improve gait function and to reinforce muscle function.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effect of elastic band exercise on an elderly population
who had problems with mobility and functional disorder, the purpose of this study was to
examine the effect of elastic band exercise on the subjects gait function and muscular
strength.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study conducted a band exercise program for elderly women volunteers aged 60 and over,

in detail and they participated in the exercise after signing a consent form. The inclusion
criteria were: independent gait, absence of surgical symptoms, and voluntary consent to
participation in the study. All experiments were reviewed and approved by a committee of
Honam University.</p><p>Subjects participated in the elastic band exercise program for 8 weeks, exercising for 40
minutes, four days a week with resting terms of 60sec. Subjects used a band corresponding to
60% of the strength of the color band with which repetitive exercise was possible up to
twelve times. This study used elastic bands of 6 inch width, which were developed by the
American Physical Therapy Association<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>,
whose extension percentage is designated by color. This study conducted elastic band
exercises, using various band exercises according to the improvement of the physical fitness
levels of the subjects.</p><p>When the elastic band exercise could be repeated 15 times without exceeding physiological
limits, we changed the band for one which had an extension percentage one level from the
former one, and we used the same band for the upper body and lower body exercises.</p><p>During the first six weeks, the exercises were conducted using band strengths corresponding
to 50&#x02013;60% of HRmax and a rate of perceived exertion (RPE) of 11&#x02013;12. During the last two
weeks, the exercises were conducted using bands corresponding to 60&#x02013;70% of HRmax and an PRE
of 12&#x02013;13.</p><p>The exercise program was began with warm up and ended with cooling down program designed
for the weak elderly population, which were modified and supplemented with static stretching
exercise. The subjects stood still and slowly and smoothly stretched in one posture for
30&#x02013;60 seconds, the stretches were conducted in a range that did not cause pain.</p><p>The main exercise consisted of a revised elastic band core exercise designed for elderly
women<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The initial exercise level was
an RPE 11&#x02013;13 in consideration of the fitness characteristics of the subjects, and before
exercise we measured the stable heart rate and calculated individual target heart rates
using Karvonen&#x02019;s formula. Heart rate was monitored by checking the exercise heart rate
frequently in order to prevent the heart rate exceeding 50&#x02013;70% of the maximal heart
rate.</p><p>The exercises were implemented using a range of motion (ROM) within which the subjects
didn&#x02019;t feel pain. The standard of main exercise with the band was 3 sets, without demanding
immoderate postures causing injury. A rest of a minute and half was instituted between each
set, and two assistants other than the leader of the exercises helped the elderly subjects.
During the 8-weeks, intervention physical activities other than the program were restricted,
but restriction of diet was not implemented. Warm up consisted of stretching and breathing
for 3&#x02013;5 minutes.</p><p>The main exercise was elastic band exercise for 30 minutes. Details of the exercise program
were: pair-gymnastics, upper-extremity and elbow flexion/extension, upright row, side band,
leg press, knee extension, ankle plantar-flexion, rhythmical gymnastics, movement learning,
and repeated practice. Cool down consisted of stretching and breathing for 3&#x02013;5 minutes.</p><p>Sit to stand is a method of measuring leg muscular strength. The subjects sat on a chair
with their arms crossed over their chests. After the start signal, the subjects stood from
the sitting position and sat down again repeatedly for 30 seconds and the number of times
they could stand from the sitting position was measured<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Knees-up for 2 minutes is a method of evaluating leg muscular endurance. Subjects bend and
raise their knees until the knee and the iliac crest are in line</p><p>The Subjects raised their knees alternately, except when they didn&#x02019;t raise the knee to the
iliac crest, which was not counted. Subjects were asked to rate the degree of difficulty to
prevent excessive effort during measurement and measurement was ended when subjects were
unable to raise their knees. The total number of knee raises the iliac crest were recorded
for each individual<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Standing on one leg with the eyes open was used to evaluate balance. The subjects selected
the most comfortable leg, after experimentally standing on one leg with the eyes open with
both legs. The times for which subjects could stand with their hands on their waists with
one leg raised and the sole of that foot placed on the inside of the knee was measured. If
the hands fell from the waist or the leg or the body moved, measurement was stopped.
Measurement was implemented twice. The smallest unit of record was 0.1 seconds and the
highest record was 60 seconds<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All data was analyzed using SPSS/PC. Ver. 18.0 for Windows program t-test which uses the
preliminary value as the covariate was used to test the significance of the differences
between the measured values after the exercise program. Statistical significance in all
analyses was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Leg muscular strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle measured as the number of

easy and safe to use by anyone without restriction of space. Especially, elastic band
exercise has received attention because it reduces the risk of injury in the elderly
population which has a relatively high risk of injury and it is effective at maximizing body
function and improving of health-related-fitness<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of elastic band exercise on leg
muscular strength and balance, and the usefulness of elastic band exercise for the
effectiveness and durability of factors related to fitness reinforcement and prevention of
disease.</p><p>The results of this study confirmed that elastic band exercise is a good exercise for
improving muscular strength and fitness and their effective maintenance.</p><p>The aim of this study was the improvement of muscular strength. However, elastic band
exercise positively influences whole body function factors such as cardiovascular endurance,
flexibility of the upper body and waist, dexterity, dynamic balance. It suggests that
elastic band exercise leads to improvement of whole body function (fitness) as shown by the
effects of aerobic exercise to elderly people. Through the study of elastic band exercise
applied with further variations, we should conduct a study that shows elastic band exercise
can be a method that improves aerobic exercise ability.</p><p>It was reported that continuous activity for a long time keeps and improves changes in body
composition<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because the exercise
program of this study involved physical activity moving the whole body with a band for 40
minutes or more, continuous movement would have led to a reduction of percentage of body
fat, reducing fat free percentage, and maintenance of fat free percentage.</p><p>Basic physical fitness is necessary for the free activity of the elderly population, and
regular exercise is effective at improving physical fitness. Lee suggested regular exercise
and physical activity as a method for the improvement and enhancement of fitness related to
the health of the elderly population, improving their resistance to disease, and preventing
disease.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> Chang et al. reported that
leg muscular strength and gait ability is improved and knee pain was relieved after 8 weeks
of moderate intensity lower body exercise using an elastic band performed by elderly women
with arthritis<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stretching and resistance exercises have been shown to improve the balance ability of
elderly adults<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Resistance exercises using the Thera-band are simple and economical, and have safety
advantages. They are generally used for rehabilitation purposes<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> because training can be selected case by case with control
over the loading intensity.</p><p>Several studies have reported that strengthening exercise using the Thera-band for the
lower extremities improves balance ability<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, strengthening exercise with a Thera-band is a suitable
home-based exercise program for improving the balance needed for activities of daily living
of elderly adults.</p><p>This study used sit-to-stand, knees up, and balancing on one leg with the eyes open to
evaluate fitness. Sit-to-stand and knees up are items used to evaluate leg muscular strength
and muscular endurance, which are abilities closely connected with self reliance of physical
activity such as whole body movement, and change of direction. Enhancing leg muscular
strength through regular exercise is very important for the maintenance and improvement of
movement ability because leg muscular strength declines during the process of aging.</p><p>Elastic band exercise over an 8-week exercise period improved and maintained fitness,
unlike in a study of young adults which found only just maintenance of strength after an 8
week exercise period, and we expect that further study will be carried out.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">National Statistical
