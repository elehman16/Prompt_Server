In the present study, we determined the relative potency of oral 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> compared with D<sub>3</sub> for increasing vitamin D status in dogs with low serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Four male and three female, 4-year-old, intact, lean, genetically related, Chinese-crested/beagle dogs were studied in a randomised, single cross-over trial. After feeding a low-vitamin D diet (&#x0003c;4&#x000a0;IU/100&#x000a0;g) for 30&#x000a0;d, four dogs received daily D<sub>3</sub> supplementation at 2&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg body weight<sup>0&#x000b7;75</sup>, while three dogs received a molar equivalency as 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>. The supplements, dissolved in ethanol, were applied to a commercial treat for consumption. Serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 24<italic>R</italic>,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (24<italic>R</italic>,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>) were analysed weekly using a validated HPLC method. Both supplementations increased (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;01) serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentrations. However, oral 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> resulted in greater (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;0001) concentrations than D<sub>3</sub> by week 1, with a difference of 173&#x000a0;% (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;0001) by week 2.

Vitamin D status, as indicated by serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 24<italic>R</italic>,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> concentrations, is more rapidly and efficiently increased in adult dogs by oral supplementation of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> than D<sub>3</sub>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cholecalciferol</kwd><kwd>25-Hydroxycholecalciferol</kwd><kwd>24<italic>R</italic>,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol</kwd><kwd>Supplementation in dogs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbreviations"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>24<italic>R</italic>,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, 24<italic>R</italic>,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub></kwd><kwd>25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub></kwd><kwd>BW, body weight</kwd><kwd>D<sub>3</sub>, vitamin D<sub>3</sub></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><ref-count count="22"/><page-count count="4"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>In recent years, several reports in the veterinary literature have associated low vitamin D status with many different disease processes in dogs, including chronic kidney disease<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, congestive heart failure<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, inflammatory bowel disease<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, mast cell tumour<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> and cancer<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Whether low vitamin D status is causative or a consequence of disease has not been established. Nonetheless, studies such as these have brought attention to vitamin D status and health in adult dogs.</p><p>Dogs are unable to adequately synthesise vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (D<sub>3</sub>) in their skin in response to UV light<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> and, therefore, are reliant upon their diet to supply their vitamin D needs. The dietary vitamin D requirement for adult dogs is not clearly established. The current adequate intake of vitamin D recommended by the National Research Council (NRC) for dogs in all life stages is based on findings of studies for the prevention of skeletal abnormalities in puppies<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. This vitamin D recommendation, though supporting of normal bone growth and maintenance in a puppy, may not be sufficient for other health outcomes in adult dogs.</p><p>It is widely accepted that the best indicator of vitamin D status is serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), as it is the most abundant circulating metabolite of vitamin D, and its concentration is determined by vitamin D intake<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Reports of serum 25(OH)D concentrations amongst apparently healthy dogs are quite varied<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. One study attempted to define vitamin D sufficiency in healthy, adult dogs by comparing the relationship between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH)<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Investigators found that the median and variance in iPTH observations among dogs declined to a plateau when 25(OH)D concentrations were at 100&#x000a0;ng/ml. They also found a significant drop in variability of serum mean C-reactive protein concentrations, a marker of chronic inflammation, when 25(OH)D concentrations were 100&#x02013;120&#x000a0;ng/ml. The authors concluded that vitamin D sufficiency is indicated when serum 25(OH)D is 100&#x02013;120&#x000a0;ng/ml, and that many apparently healthy dogs are vitamin D insufficient.</p><p>The present authors found in a previous cohort survey of forty-six adult, healthy dogs<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> that 71&#x000b7;7&#x000a0;% had serum 25(OH)D concentrations below 100&#x000a0;ng/ml. A subsequent D<sub>3</sub> supplementation trial was conducted in thirteen of the dogs deemed vitamin D insufficient. Seven dogs received D<sub>3</sub> in an olive oil solution on their food at 2&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg body weight (BW)<sup>0&#x000b7;75</sup> per d, an amount that was 5&#x000b7;1 times the NRC recommended allowance but not in excess of the safe upper limit for maintenance of adult dogs (2&#x000b7;6&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg BW<sup>0&#x000b7;75</sup>)<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Six dogs received an olive oil placebo. Unexpectedly, we found that D<sub>3</sub> supplementation, at an oral dosage that we believed to be substantial, did not significantly increase serum 25(OH)D concentrations above baseline. At the end of 9 to 10 weeks of supplementation, only a modest difference (12&#x000a0;%) in vitamin D status resulted between the treated and control dogs.</p><p>The cause of the poor response to vitamin D supplementation was not apparent, but it prompted us to investigate the use of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> as a supplement in dogs. The objective of this study was to determine the relative potency of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> as compared with D<sub>3</sub> for increasing vitamin D status in dogs deemed vitamin D insufficient. Based on a previous report in dogs<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, we hypothesised that vitamin D status, as measured by serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 24<italic>R</italic>,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (24<italic>R</italic>,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>) concentrations, would be significantly more responsive to 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> than D<sub>3</sub>.</p><sec sec-type="materialsandmethods" id="sec1"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All procedures were reviewed and approved by our institution's animal care and use committee. Four male and three female institution-owned, 4-year-old, intact, Chinese crested/beagle dogs were studied in a randomised, single cross-over trial.

By the second week of supplementation with 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, mean 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentration reached 112 (<sc>sd</sc> 14)&#x000a0;ng/ml, which was significantly greater (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;0001) than concentrations with D<sub>3</sub> supplementation (41 (<sc>sd</sc> 13)&#x000a0;ng/ml).

The use of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> supplementation as a means to improve vitamin D status in the dog has not been evaluated, as it has in people. Earlier work has demonstrated that 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> is absorbed in the human intestine similar to D<sub>3</sub><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, yet peak concentrations in serum 25(OH)D after oral administration in humans are reached much more rapidly, as compared with the slow rise in concentrations that are typically observed after D<sub>3</sub> administration<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently published oral 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> supplementation studies have shown that 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> is much more efficient and rapid at increasing vitamin D status in humans than D<sub>3</sub><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In accordance with this, we have also found that at equivalent doses in dogs, oral supplementation with 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> is much more effective and rapid than D<sub>3</sub> in raising serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentrations above a previously reported minimum indicative of vitamin D sufficiency<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). While both supplementations significantly increased serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentrations above baseline, oral 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> was at least 5&#x000b7;2 times as potent as D<sub>3</sub> after just 2 weeks of supplementation. Due to an unacceptably high trajectory of serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentrations following supplementation with 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, the trial was discontinued after 2 weeks, before equilibrium could be safely established. Therefore, it is possible that this is an underestimation of the true potency of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> relative to D<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Our present finding of a significant increase in serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentrations following supplementation with D<sub>3</sub> is in contrast to our previous study results<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Although the D<sub>3</sub> doses were the same (2&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg BW<sup>0&#x000b7;75</sup> per d), the vehicle of D<sub>3</sub> supplement delivery differed. Bioavailability of D<sub>3</sub> may be greater with the treat application presently used compared with our previous top-dressing of food with an olive oil solution of D<sub>3</sub>. However, dogs in each study willingly accepted both methods of supplement delivery. Studies on factors affecting vitamin D absorption, distribution and metabolism in dogs are lacking. Additionally, the present study should be considered to be much more controlled than our previous work, in which privately owned dogs were studied and D<sub>3</sub> supplementation depended on owner compliance.</p><p>Concentration of 24<italic>R</italic>,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D in serum is well established to positively correlate with serum 25(OH)D concentration in the dog<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Serum 24<italic>R</italic>,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> concentrations were significantly increased by supplementation of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> but not with D<sub>3</sub>. However, this does not occur until 3 and 5 weeks following initiation of supplementation. The variation in production of this metabolite amongst the dogs probably resulted in the insignificant difference in concentrations between the supplementations at the second week of the washout period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). This probably indicates a lag time in the 24-hydroxylase activity in the kidney necessary to convert 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> to 24<italic>R</italic>,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, as has been demonstrated in humans<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A noteworthy limitation of this study is the small number of dogs and lacking of investigation of factors evidenced to influence serum 25(OH)D concentrations in dogs, such as sex (males&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;females), reproductive status (intact&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;neutered) and breed<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. In conclusion, our findings indicated that oral supplementation of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> is at least 5&#x000b7;2 times as potent as D<sub>3</sub> for increasing vitamin D status in dogs with low serum 25(OH)D concentrations. While this work is supportive of the use of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> as a supplement means to improve vitamin D status in the dog, a safe dosage was not identified and will require further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Nestl&#x000e9; Purina Endowed Program in Small Animal Nutrition, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211.
