The methods of this large, international 2&#x000d7;2 factorial randomised placebo controlled trial are described elsewhere (available from the authors on request).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In brief, adults at moderate and high risk for postoperative cardiac events are randomly allocated to receive either aspirin or matching placebo, and clonidine or matching placebo. Eligible surgeries are those where a patient is expected to stay for at least one night in the hospital after surgery. The aspirin intervention is 100&#x02005;mg tablets of aspirin or matching placebo, where patients take two tablets orally 2&#x02013;4&#x02005;h prior to surgery, and then take one tablet daily for either 7 or 30&#x02005;days (depending on whether they were taking aspirin chronically prior to surgery or not, respectively). The clonidine intervention consists of 0.2&#x02005;mg of oral clonidine or matching placebo given 2&#x02013;4&#x02005;h prior to surgery, and at the same time a transdermal clonidine or placebo patch is applied for 72&#x02005;h, providing clonidine at 0.2&#x02005;mg/day. Allocation is performed by a central randomisation service and is stratified by the centre. Patients, healthcare providers, data collectors and outcome adjudicators are blinded to treatment allocation. This trial is primarily funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. With respect to the study schedule, the last of 10&#x02005;000 patients from 140 centres in 23 countries was randomised in December 2013. The primary outcome is a composite of 30&#x02005;day all-cause mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction. The secondary outcome is a composite of 30&#x02005;day all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke.</p><p>In addition to the primary outcome, POISE-2 is uniquely positioned to determine the effects of perioperative aspirin (and clonidine) on AKI, to consider whether treatment effects on AKI differ in those with preoperative chronic kidney disease (CKD) and preoperative chronic aspirin use, and to investigate the treatment effects on longer term kidney function, based on a single measurement taken 3&#x02005;months to 1&#x02005;year after surgery. We were awarded an additional grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to examine these issues in a POISE-2 AKI substudy.

To refine the analytic plan, we reviewed POISE-2 data as of April 2013 (when data reconciliation was ongoing and without any knowledge of patient allocation to the assigned treatments).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>POISE-2 AKI substudy data collection</title><p>A preoperative serum creatinine value is measured within 6&#x02005;weeks of surgery. The date of surgery (and not the date of randomisation) is used to identify the start of follow-up in this protocol; the median (IQR) number of days between the date of randomisation and the date of surgery is 0 (0&#x02013;0; 95th percentile 1&#x02005;day). After receipt of grant funding to support this substudy, serial perioperative serum creatinine data began to be recorded in consecutive patients enrolled at AKI substudy participating centres (earliest centre to start this process began in January 2011). All centres were encouraged to record a serum creatinine value postoperative days 1, 2 and 3 in consecutively enrolled patients (provided the patient was not discharged from hospital). This will help reduce concerns about an ascertainment bias related to AKI (ie, where aspirin vs placebo alters the incidence of another event such as myocardial infarction or bleeding, which in turn influences the likelihood of serum creatinine measurement). We also record all other serum creatinine measurements performed as a part of routine care (and their dates) during the hospital stay. At the time of final analysis, we will examine the number of measurements by treatment group (and the postoperative days of these measurements) to confirm that there is no differential ascertainment of AKI in the two treatment groups.</p><p>The median hospital length of stay in POISE-2 is 4&#x02005;days (IQR 3&#x02013;7&#x02005;days). The proportion of patients who die in the operating room or in 48&#x02005;h after surgery, which may result in no serum creatinine measurement, is expected to be &#x0003c;1% of patients. Less than 10% of patients are expected to have a missing peak serum creatinine value during the hospital stay, and in such cases, in the absence of receipt of acute dialysis, we will carry forward the prerandomisation serum creatinine value for all analyses (which means the patient will not have developed AKI; see analysis section). Urine output data are, however, not collected in POISE-2 given the difficulties with accurate measurement in the setting of international data collection (and thus a low urine output is not used to define AKI in POISE-2).

We will also adjust for the random allocation of clonidine (clonidine versus placebo). In patients who underwent surgery but are missing a postoperative serum creatinine value (expected &#x0003c;10% of patients), we will impute in its place the prerandomisation serum creatinine value which should provide a more conservative estimate of the intervention effect than the alternative of removing such patients.

We will report the 95% CI of our estimates, and a two-tailed p value of &#x02264;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. With a sample of at least 6500 patients, we will have over 80% power to detect at least a 20% relative risk reduction in AKI with aspirin versus placebo should it exist (anticipated incidence of AKI of &#x0223c;12% in the placebo group, two-tailed &#x003b1;=0.05, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test; <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014004886TB1">table 1</xref>).

Similar to techniques used for the CKD subgroup, we will examine subgroups defined by the presence of preoperative chronic aspirin use (which was a stratification factor used in the randomisation&#x02014;aspirin initiation and aspirin continuation strata). Similarly, we will have over 80% power to detect a 40% lower OR of AKI with treatment for patients in the continuation stratum compared to the initiation stratum.

For our main analysis, we will use linear regression adjusting for prior listed covariates to compare the absolute change in eGFR between the aspirin and placebo groups, reporting the mean and 95% CI (assuming model assumptions are not violated, online supplementary appendix 2). We will carry forward the prerandomisation serum creatinine value for patients with a missing longer term value after surgery (for reasons of death or missing measurement) and impute an eGFR value of 5&#x02005;mL/min/1.73&#x02005;m<sup>2</sup> for the long-term measurement for any patient who developed end-stage renal disease (&#x02265;3&#x02005;months of continuous dialysis), or who died shortly after receipt of acute dialysis for severe AKI. A sample of 3000 patients will allow a 5&#x02005;mL/min/1.73&#x02005;m<sup>2</sup> or more difference to be detected between the two groups with over 80% statistical power (two-tailed &#x003b1;=0.05, independent samples t test, expected SD=40). As observed in the setting of another international trial of coronary artery bypass surgery performed with and without a cardiopulmonary bypass pump, we do not expect to demonstrate that perioperative aspirin versus placebo alters this outcome, even in the situation where we demonstrate aspirin versus placebo reduces the risk of postoperative AKI (which may relate to our study methods or the limited impact of any observed AKI risk reduction on longer term kidney function).</p></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Postoperative cardiac events</title><p>Acute cardiac events are inextricably linked to AKI events and both events often occur together in the nonoperative setting.

Although nephrotoxicity from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents is well appreciated (through the inhibition of intrarenal prostaglandin), aspirin doses of 100&#x02005;mg/day, as used in POISE-2, are unlikely to be nephrotoxic.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> However, bleeding with aspirin is an important concern which can cause hypotension and AKI.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Similarly, blood transfusions may directly predispose to AKI, possibly through some haemolysis.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> If we observe that aspirin versus placebo increases the risk of AKI, then we will examine bleeding events and AKI and report how frequently they both co-occur.</p></sec><sec id="s2g4"><title>Exclusion of major urological surgeries</title><p>POISE-2 records surgical types in categories, and one of these categories is major urological or gynaecological surgery (about 13% of patients enrolled in POISE-2). This category includes the procedure of nephrectomy. Because postoperative changes in serum creatinine in the context of partial or complete nephrectomy can occur for reasons other than AKI, in an additional analysis we will exclude this category of surgery to confirm that the results on the remaining sample are no different than the primary results.</p></sec><sec id="s2g5"><title>Effects of clonidine on AKI</title><p>While our prespecified hypotheses focus on aspirin, it is conceivable that clonidine may reduce the risk of AKI as supported by prior animal and human studies.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;24</xref> The analytic techniques for the assessment of clonidine on AKI are as specified for aspirin, with only minor adjustments (ie, adjustment for the random allocation to aspirin and no prespecified subgroup analysis for chronic aspirin use). If a greater risk of AKI is observed with clonidine versus placebo, then the blood pressure data collected in POISE-2 will be reviewed to determine if this potentially explains the observed effect.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Recognised limitations</title><p>There are some limitations to our protocol.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Errors with serum creatinine as a measure of kidney function</title><p>In POISE-2, the preoperative serum creatinine is recorded only once in the 6&#x02005;weeks prior to surgery (where patients may be undergoing elective, urgent or emergent surgery). It would be preferable to have at least two baseline serum creatinine values on all POISE-2 patients, separated by at least 3&#x02005;months, to more accurately define the presence of CKD. Also, in POISE-2, there is no knowledge of potential serum creatinine changes close to the time of surgery (particularly in the case of urgent/emergent surgery; 8% of POISE-2 patients), which may mean that the preoperative serum creatinine value is not in a steady state. All of these considerations increase &#x02018;noise&#x02019; related to the baseline serum creatinine measurement, and reduce the ability to detect postoperative changes in the serum creatinine&#x02014;to partly address this, we are adjusting for a definition of urgent/emergent surgery in the primary analysis of covariance models. Also, in an additional analysis, we will exclude patients undergoing urgent/elective surgery to confirm that the findings are robust in the remaining patients undergoing elective surgery.</p><p>Worldwide, over the last decade, there have been efforts to better standardise the serum creatinine assay. It seems likely (although not documented in POISE-2) that most preoperative and postoperative serum creatinine measurements prior to hospital discharge would be performed in the same laboratory, and most measurements are performed within 2&#x02005;months of each other. This reduces concerns about interlaboratory and intralaboratory variability (drift) in the serum creatinine measurement. However, the same cannot be said for the longer term serum creatinine measurement. As with the preoperative value, multiple serial measures of serum creatinine over the year (and longer) were desired, but not possible to obtain in POISE-2. Also, POISE-2 has no measures of baseline or follow-up proteinuria, which are now featured in recent CKD staging systems.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> However, the randomisation and analysis of this substudy is stratified by centre, which should result in similar measurement errors within a centre for the aspirin and placebo groups.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Limited statistical power for the most clinically important kidney outcomes</title><p>Stage 3 AKI with receipt of acute dialysis, and long-term end-stage renal disease are the most clinically important kidney outcomes. However, there will be too few events for adequate statistical power to detect these outcomes in POISE-2. We focus on mild to moderate AKI (defined by thresholds of changes in serum creatinine). While mild-to-moderate AKI is the outcome used in virtually all prior AKI prevention trials, we recognise that it is a surrogate outcome that may not directly impact how a patient feels, functions or survives. Similarly, the longer term outcome of between-group difference in change in eGFR is also a surrogate outcome, and concerns about its validity as a measure of kidney disease progression have been raised.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> For this reason, the overall POISE-2 trial results (which focus on non-kidney outcomes), rather than the results of this AKI protocol, should be the primary information used to inform decisions about whether the tested interventions should be adopted as a standard in surgical care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Strengths of this POISE-2 AKI protocol and the overall POISE-2 trial are generalisable estimates derived from patients recruited in an international context using rigorous randomised trial methodology (eg, concealed allocation, placebo-controlled trial, blinded central adjudication of outcomes). In this report, we have judiciously prespecified the main questions and analytic protocol that will be used to test relevant AKI hypotheses in the POISE-2 AKI substudy. This protocol will help minimise the chance of spurious post hoc assertions of effect, so that the AKI results from this large international are robust and believable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e761" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-004886.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr Mitesh Shah for his contributions when submitting the associated Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant, which included a background literature review.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All the authors contributed to the conception and design, as well as the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of the data; drafting of the protocol or revising it critically for important intellectual content and final approval of the version to be published.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The POISE-2 trial and the AKI substudy are funded by two grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (application number of the AKI substudy: 259720).
