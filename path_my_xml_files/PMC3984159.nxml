Coffee consumption also increases energy expenditure and leads to positive metabolic effects, but whether these effects are mediated by irisin remains unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the association between baseline irisin levels and the metabolic profile in humans and to investigate whether consumption of caffeinated coffee alters irisin levels. To this end, a secondary analysis was performed investigating irisin levels at baseline and after eight weeks in 32 healthy, overweight coffee drinkers who were randomized to consumption of 5 cups per day of instant caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, or water. Spearman correlation and analysis of covariance analyses were performed to identify possible associations. Irisin levels were positively correlated with waist circumference (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.41, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02), fat mass (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.44, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01) and CRP (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.47, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.007). Though there was a trend towards increased levels of irisin over time in the caffeinated coffee group (+1.8%) when compared to the placebo group (&#x02212;4%) this did not reach statistical significance (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.75 for the trend). This first randomized trial failed to reveal any effects of coffee consumption on irisin levels, but a larger trial, appropriately sized on the basis of data provided by this study, is needed to conclusively investigate such a relationship.</p><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00305097">NCT00305097</ext-link>

As the browning of adipose tissue is hypothesized to improve insulin sensitivity and decrease weight gain, irisin has become an attractive target for potential anti-obesity therapy <xref rid="pone.0094463-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Though higher irisin levels are associated with lower body weight and improved glucose tolerance in mice, the role of irisin in human metabolism remains unclear <xref rid="pone.0094463-Bostrom1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094463-Polyzos1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Thus far, three cross-sectional studies in humans have demonstrated that irisin levels are lower in patients with type II diabetes, suggesting irisin could play a protective role in glucose homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0094463-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094463-MorenoNavarrete1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094463-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The association between irisin and body mass index (BMI) is more controversial with two studies showing a negative relationship <xref rid="pone.0094463-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094463-MorenoNavarrete1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and three others showing a positive association <xref rid="pone.0094463-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094463-Stengel1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. While some of this discrepancy could be attributed to the different and better validated assay used in the latter three studies, it is also possible that irisin regulation is more complex than first suspected <xref rid="pone.0094463-Bostrom2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Having reported the latter relationship between BMI and irisin in our prior study <xref rid="pone.0094463-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, we proposed that irisin could be secreted in an effort to counteract insulin resistance in the obese but that once metabolic disease occurs, irisin resistance develops, similar to several known hormone resistance syndromes <xref rid="pone.0094463-HeePark1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A recent paper by Polyzos et al supports this hypothesis, noting that irisin appears to exhibit a positive relationship with BMI in healthy subjects but an inverse relationship in diseased states <xref rid="pone.0094463-Polyzos2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Irisin&#x02019;s relationships to other important hormones including leptin and adiponectin have been inconsistent across studies as well but are potentially mediated by an underlying association between irisin and obesity <xref rid="pone.0094463-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094463-Stengel1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Ultimately, associations between irisin and metabolic factors need to be further clarified, not only via simple association studies but also using models that adjust for potential confounders such as obesity.</p><p>Coffee consumption increases energy expenditure and is thought to decrease the incidence of diabetes <xref rid="pone.0094463-Doo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094463-Takami1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. One proposed mechanism to explain this association is that coffee may facilitate glucose uptake by skeletal muscle via increased translocation of the GLUT4 transporter to the plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0094463-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094463-Tsuda1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Also, coffee consumption has been associated with increased levels of adiponectin, a hormone thought to have insulin-sensitizing properties <xref rid="pone.0094463-Wedick1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094463-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Thus, there is some evidence that caffeine increases energy expenditure and positively affects metabolism potentially via interaction with the skeletal muscle and whether irisin is a potential mediator in this process is as yet unknown.</p><p>The purpose of this study is twofold: to identify associations between irisin and markers of metabolism in humans and to determine whether coffee consumption affects irisin levels. As caffeine increases energy expenditure and irisin levels appear to rise with increased energy expenditure, we hypothesize that irisin levels will increase with coffee consumption. To this end, we have performed a secondary analysis of the serum levels of irisin in overweight coffee drinkers who were randomly assigned to consumption of caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, or water for eight weeks. This study aims to shed further light on the possible mechanisms by which irisin and coffee consumption can lead to improved health outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Forty-one overweight (BMI 25&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) but otherwise healthy adults who were regular coffee drinkers (&#x02265;2 cups/day) were recruited between 2006 and 2008 with inclusion and exclusion criteria that have previously been described <xref rid="pone.0094463-Wedick1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

A recent study found that irisin is secreted by adipose tissue in addition to skeletal muscle providing a mechanism that could explain the association between rising BMI and irisin levels <xref rid="pone.0094463-RocaRivada1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In further support of this theory, though these associations failed to reach significance likely due to our small sample size, irisin tended to be positively associated with markers of inflammation and HOMA-IR and inversely related to the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin. These findings add to the small but growing body of literature which suggests that irisin is associated with obesity-linked insulin resistance in humans. This continues to be an active area of research and more studies in humans are necessary to better understand the complex role of irisin in human metabolism.</p><p>Coffee intake increases energy expenditure and has been associated with a decreased incidence of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome in multiple studies <xref rid="pone.0094463-Acheson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094463-Takami1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094463-Wedick1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094463-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

Though irisin is secreted in response to exercise, another state of increased energy expenditure, we did not detect a statistically significant change in irisin levels after eight weeks of coffee consumption <xref rid="pone.0094463-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Using these initial data, power calculations were performed using GPower 3.1.6 (Franz Faul, Universit&#x000e4;t Kiel, Germany) which showed that 53 samples would be required in each group to investigate this relationship, approximately five times the number analyzed in this cohort. Prior to this study there was no data with which to perform such a power analysis. Thus ultimately, a larger scale clinical trial would be needed to conclusively demonstrate whether the trend towards increased irisin levels in those who consume caffeine is indeed significant.</p><p>The key limitation of this study is the small and fixed sample size, limiting the power of the study to identify significant relationships and increasing the likelihood of extreme values affecting the results; however, prior to this study no data were available to determine the appropriate sample size. In terms of anthropometric data, the association between irisin and BMI might have been attenuated by the small range of BMI in this study given that all participants were overweight at baseline. The small size and relative homogeneity of this study population also limits generalizability of our findings.</p><p>Strengths of the study include that it is the first randomized controlled trial that has investigated the effects of coffee intake on irisin levels. We found positive associations between irisin and several markers of obesity, lending credence to the hypothesis that irisin may be secreted by fat in addition to muscle in response to obesity-linked insulin resistance. The data reported in this rather small study can be used to perform power calculations for larger clinical trials and mechanistic studies which are needed to more firmly establish the role of irisin in metabolism and to better understand its potential association with coffee.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0094463.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
