Residual effects of inhalational anesthetics can contribute to delay in emergence from anesthesia and thereby preclude an early assessment of postoperative neurological functions. Both desflurane and sevoflurane has favorable recovery profile, but postoperative recovery is reported to be faster with desflurane than sevoflurane anesthesia due to the difference in blood: Gas (desflurane 0.45 vs. sevoflurane 0.65) and fat: Blood (desflurane 27 vs. sevoflurane 48) partition coefficients of the two agents.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The use of desflurane is often criticized in neurosurgery due to its cerebral vasodilating property. Cerebral vasodilatation and increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) by desflurane has been reported in various animal and human studies.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, it has been found to have little clinical significance.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In spite of the widespread use of desflurane and sevoflurane, studies directly comparing desflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia in patients undergoing supratentorial craniotomy are scarce. Therefore, we planned to conduct this study to compare postoperative recovery after desflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia in patients undergoing supratentorial surgeries. The intraoperative brain conditions, intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamics, postoperative complications, the duration of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and hospital stay and the neurological outcome between the two agents were also compared.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>Prospective randomized study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Ethics</title><p>After institutional ethics committee approval and written informed consent 107 patients undergoing nonemergent craniotomy for supratentorial lesions were enrolled in this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Patient selection</title><p>Patients of American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status I&#x02013;III, aged 18-60 years having Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15, undergoing elective craniotomy for supratentorial lesions were included in this study. Patients with intracranial hypertension, gross cerebral edema on computed tomography scan, GCS &#x0003c;15, intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation, obesity, severe systemic disease, anemia (hematocrit &#x0003c;25%), history of craniotomy in past 30 days, pregnancy, history of psychiatric disorders/alcohol or substance abuse, allergy to any of the study drugs and patients who were planned for postoperative mechanical ventilation were excluded from the study. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups (group S; received sevoflurane + nitrous oxide [N<sub>2</sub>O] and oxygen [60%:40%]) or (group D; received desflurane + N<sub>2</sub>O and oxygen [60%:40%]). During the pre-anesthetic checkup the cognitive function was assessed with Short Orientation Memory Concentration Test (SOMCT).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In SOMCT patients were asked to recall the current year, month, time, a sentence (previously told to them), the sequence of months through the year and some numbers in reverse order.</p><p>All patients were premedicated with glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg) intramuscularly, before shifting to operating room. Standard monitors including electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, and pulse oximeter (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were attached. General anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 mcg/kg and thiopentone till loss of eye lash reflex. Rocuronium 1 mg/kg was used to facilitate tracheal intubation. Central venous and arterial cannulation was performed following tracheal intubation. Mechanical ventilation was adjusted to achieve a PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 30 &#x000b1; 2 mm Hg and the inhaled anesthetic concentration was adjusted to obtain a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) between 0.8 and 1.2. After achieving a steady anesthetic state, fresh gas flow rate was maintained at 2 L/min. Intermittent blouses of vecuronium were given as and when required. Skull pin sites were infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine solution. Starting with skin incision, mannitol (1 g/kg) was administered over a period of 30 min. After dural exposure, a 20 gauge venous cannula was inserted into the subdural space along the surface of the brain and was connected to a calibrated pressure transducer via a length of polyethylene high pressure tubing filled with normal saline. The transducer was zeroed at the level of mastoid process. The cannula was positioned so that respiratory and arterial blood pressure fluctuations could be identified. After stabilization of reading, value of subdural pressure obtained was considered as ICP.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] After dural opening the attending neurosurgeon, who was blinded to the study groups assessed the brain condition on a 4-point scale[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]:</p><p>

</p><p>Intervention like change in position, further reduction of PaCO<sub>2</sub>, additional mannitol or furosemide was undertaken when brain condition was of grade 4.</p><p>Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressures were recorded as baseline (before anesthesia induction), after induction, at or immediately after intubation and subsequently at 1 min interval till 5 min of intubation, at the skull pin application and thereafter at 15 min interval till the time of tapering the inhalational agents. Thereafter, vitals were recorded at every 1 min interval till 10 min after tracheal extubation. Vitals were recorded at 15 min interval thereafter till 3 h following surgery. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) &#x0003e;20% above baseline and/or HR &#x0003e;100 or &#x0003e;20% above baseline was treated with increasing the inspired concentration of sevoflurane or desflurane upto 1.2 MAC, followed by fentanyl 0.5-1 mcg/kg bolus, propofol 0.5 mg/kg slow intravenous (IV) bolus and then labetalol (5 mg increments) if required. Decrease of MAP to &#x0003c;20% below the baseline value was treated by decreasing the inhaled anesthetic agents up to the level of 0.8 MAC and bolus of IV fluids. Failure of blood pressure response to those agents was managed with administration of mephentermine (5 mg increments). Bradycardia (as defined by HR &#x0003c;40 for &#x0003e;1 min) was managed with atropine. All patients received ondansetron (0.1 mg/kg) and paracetamol (15 mg/kg) intravenously 30 min, before the end of surgery. Sevoflurane and desflurane were tapered at the beginning of skin suturing and stopped after skin dressing. The residual neuromusclular blockade was reversed with neostigmine and glycopyrollate. MAP &#x0003e;20% above baseline during emergence were treated with injection labetalol (5 mg increments). All patients were shifted to ICU after tracheal extubation.</p><p>Emergence time was defined as the time interval between discontinuation of anesthetics and eyes opening spontaneously or on verbal prompting. Tracheal extubation time was defined as the time between discontinuation of anesthetics and tracheal extubation (after fulfilling standard extubation criteria). Recovery time was defined as the time between discontinuation of anesthetics and the time when patients were able to recall their names and dates of birth.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The SOMCT was evaluated at ICU admission and at every 15 min interval thereafter, for the 1<sup>st</sup> h and then every half hourly for the following 2 h. Patients were observed for 3 h for monitoring of postoperative complications. Neurological outcome at the time of discharge from hospital was assessed using Glasgow outcome score (GOS).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We intended to include minimum 50 patients in our study as per study by Heavner <italic>et al</italic>. to have a statistical power of &#x0003e;80%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The statistical analysis was carried out using stata 11.0 (College Stations, Texas, USA).

Our study results have shown that the ICP and hemodynamic parameters in both the groups were comparable.</p><p>Ornstein and associates studied the cerebral blood flow and CO<sub>2</sub> reactivity in hypocapneic patients undergoing craniotomy using desflurane and isoflurane at 1 and 1.5 MAC.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The degree of cerebral vasodilatation was comparable at different MAC of both the agents. Sponheim <italic>et al</italic>. reported a dose-dependent and clinically similar increase ICP and reduced MAP and CPP at 0.5 and 1.0 MAC of isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane in N<sub>2</sub>O (60%) in hypocapneic children.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Magni <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] compared the intraoperative brain condition between 1.2 MAC sevoflurane and desflurane in patients undergoing supratentorial craniotomy and reported identical brain condition between the two agents. They measured the brain condition subjectively, but we in addition to subjective brain condition grading measured the ICP also, both of which together reflect the brain condition better than subjective brain grading alone. They reported faster tracheal extubation, recovery and better early cognitive function (SOMCT score only at 15 min of tracheal extubation) with desflurane as compared to sevoflurane in neurosurgical patients.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] But the emergence time and late cognitive function between the two groups were similar. The MAC hour in sevoflurane group was significantly higher than desflurane, which could have resulted in delayed tracheal extubation and recovery in sevoflurane group in their study.</p><p>In spite of theoretical concern of cerebral stimulation, use of N<sub>2</sub>O is common in in many neurosurgical centers. In spite of use of N<sub>2</sub>O in our study, we did not find high incidence of raised ICP or severe intraoperative brain bulge and the intraoperative brain condition/ICP between the two groups were similar.</p><p>We measured the hemodynamic parameters in the perioperative period. Considerable hemodynamic fluctuations can occur at various stages of surgery and in the postoperative period. The effect of anesthetic agents on hemodynamic parameters is important, because different agents can influence the morbidity and mortality of the patients by affecting the hemodynamic parameters. We did not find any difference in the length of hospital and ICU stay and also the GOS at hospital discharge between the two groups.</p><p>The present study is not without limitations. We included patients without evidence of intracranial hypertension and our results cannot be extrapolated to patients with evidence of intracranial hypertension. Our study was not blinded. But the brain condition was assessed by the attending neurosurgeons who were blinded to the groups and we measured the ICP which did not show any difference.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"
