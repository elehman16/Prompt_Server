Peanut OIT was performed using a previously published protocol. Ketotifen was up-titrated to 2&#x000a0;mg twice daily over two weeks (week -2 to 0), followed by a peanut OIT initial escalation day (day 1). Ketotifen was administered from week 0&#x02013;4 of peanut OIT; reactions to peanut OIT doses were recorded by clinic staff and subject diary.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Six subjects (median age 10&#x000a0;years, peanut IgE &#x0003e;100kU<sub>A</sub>/L) were enrolled, 4 randomized to Ketotifen, 2 to placebo. The most common side effect of Ketotifen was fatigue (9% during up-titration). The rate of reaction per peanut OIT dose was lower for subjects on ketotifen (K) compared to placebo (P) during initial escalation on day 1 (K: 22% (8/36) vs. P: 67% (12/18)); week 0&#x02013;4 build-up doses (K: 75% (3/4) vs. P: 100% (2/2)); and week 0&#x02013;4 home doses (K: 50% (54/108) vs. P: 82% (27/33)).

Peanut allergy generally presents in childhood, is persistent in approximately 80% of cases, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and is the most commonly implicated food allergy in fatal anaphylactic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There is currently no cure for peanut allergy. Management of peanut allergy involves strict avoidance of peanut and carriage of self-injectable epinephrine for emergency treatment, should an accidental ingestion occur. The ongoing need for diligent avoidance and the fear of accidental ingestion has a significant impact on patients&#x02019; quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The development of active approaches to treatment of peanut allergy is underway. Early study of subcutaneous immunotherapy in food allergy was stopped due to frequent systemic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Oral immunotherapy for food allergy is now being evaluated. Early studies of oral immunotherapy (OIT) for peanut allergy have shown promise in inducing desensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, further investigation into the safety and efficacy profile is needed before peanut OIT can be recommended for clinical use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Frequent and sometimes severe adverse allergic reactions have been observed during peanut OIT. In a recent systematic review, adverse reactions were reported in all six studies examined, with the highest frequency of reactions during periods of rapid dose escalation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A study of the safety profile of peanut OIT reported that 93% of patients experienced adverse reactions during the initial peanut dose escalation day, involving predominantly gastrointestinal, upper respiratory, and cutaneous symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The issue of adverse reactions during immunotherapy is not limited to peanut OIT. Immunotherapy for hymenoptera venom allergy is highly effective, but associated with frequent and occasionally severe adverse allergic reactions, particularly during the dose escalation phase. Use of antihistamine premedication has been demonstrated to reduce local and systemic reactions during venom immunotherapy, without affecting the efficacy of venom immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The mechanism is thought to involve alteration in histamine receptor expression on allergen-specific T cells and altered cytokine profiles observed in patients receiving premedication with antihistamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Ketotifen is a benzocycloheptathiophene derivative with histamine receptor antagonist and mast cell stabilizing properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Clinically, ketotifen has been previously used for conditions ranging from childhood asthma to eosinophilic gastroenteritis, urticaria pigmentosa, and cold urticaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Ketotifen has demonstrated efficacy in treatment of allergic conjunctivitis, although is less effective and comfortable compared to ophthalmic olopatadine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Ketotifen was also investigated for use in pediatric systemic mastocytosis, but in comparison to hydroxyzine, offered no symptomatic benefit or change in plasma or 24-hour urine histamine levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. At present, ketotifen is indicated for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis, and is available in ophthalmic formulation only in the USA. Oral ketotifen is available in Canada, and is considered a safe medication, the dose of which is limited by the sedating side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of premedication in the setting of oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy. Ketotifen was selected as the premedication agent for its dual antihistamine and mast cell stabilizing properties; established safety record; and, to examine whether it may mitigate gastrointestinal symptoms frequently observed during food oral immunotherapy given its previously documented benefit in eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Using a previously published protocol for peanut OIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] we conducted a small randomized, single-blind, placebo controlled pilot study examining the rate and severity of adverse reactions during peanut OIT with ketotifen premedication during the initial four weeks of peanut dose escalation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subject recruitment and selection</title><p>Forty subjects were screened from this Allergy &#x00026; Immunology clinic.

After randomization subjects underwent a 2&#x000a0;week up-titration of ketotifen dosing or placebo, up to a maximum dose of 2&#x000a0;mg ketotifen twice daily. This dose was approved by Health Canada and chosen to maximize efficacy of the premedication protocol. This was followed by an initial day escalation phase for peanut OIT, long term build-up phase over 44&#x000a0;weeks, and maintenance phase for 4&#x000a0;weeks at the highest tolerated dose, using a previously described protocol modified for use in the outpatient clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

The highest reported rates of adverse allergic reactions in peanut OIT have typically been during periods of rapid dose escalation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In this small proof of concept study, we examined the use of ketotifen premedication during the initial 4&#x000a0;weeks of peanut OIT.</p><p>The present study was limited by the small number of patients and short duration. Statistical analysis was not feasible given the small numbers, which prevents us from drawing firm conclusions. However, this work was performed as a pilot study, and requires confirmation in a larger scale study of ketotifen premedication used throughout OIT.</p><p>All subjects experienced clinically relevant adverse symptoms at some point during peanut OIT, in keeping with other reports of peanut OIT using similar protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Subjects receiving ketotifen premedication had a lower frequency and severity of reactions on the initial escalation day and during the first four weeks of peanut OIT than subjects receiving placebo. This was in large part due to a reduction in gastrointestinal reactions. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were the most frequently reported clinically relevant symptoms on the initial escalation day and, in fact, throughout the duration of peanut OIT. In contrast, in a previous safety study of a similar peanut OIT regimen, upper respiratory symptoms were the most common, and gastrointestinal symptoms were considerably less frequent during home doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A lower overall frequency of GI symptoms and, in particular, a lower frequency of moderate to severe GI symptoms was observed in subjects receiving ketotifen premedication. In eosinophilic gastroenteritis, which may not be analogous to food OIT, ketotifen treatment has been associated with symptomatic and histologic improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The postulated mechanisms behind its efficacy include H1-antihistamine activity, stabilization of mast cells, and possibly impairment of eosinophil migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In our study, the trend of reduced GI symptoms appeared to persist in the ketotifen subjects after ketotifen was discontinued. There is one case report describing prolonged remission of eosinophilic gastroenteritis after one month of ketotifen treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, given the small number of study subjects, individual variation in susceptibility to GI symptoms, viral gastroenteritis and other causes of transient GI upset are likely to have influenced our results.</p><p>Lower respiratory symptoms were experienced at similar frequency between both groups during the initial escalation day, home doses and build-up doses. Asthmatic subjects were included in both groups, and moderate to severe lower respiratory symptoms were rare. Ketotifen is known to have a delayed onset of action in asthma, taking up to 6&#x02013;12 weeks to achieve maximal response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore our six week trial of ketotifen may have been insufficient to detect any effect on lower respiratory reactions, particularly during the initial dose escalation day which was performed after two weeks of ketotifen premedication. In addition, the small number of subjects and the relative infrequency of lower respiratory reactions would make it difficult to detect a difference.</p><p>Upper respiratory symptoms were predominantly reported with home doses after ketotifen was discontinued, and therefore may have initially been suppressed by the H1-antihistamine activity of ketotifen. However, these results were also likely influenced by other common causes of transient upper respiratory symptoms such as viral infection and sinusitis. One ketotifen subject had allergic rhinitis prior to starting peanut OIT and required treatment with Cetirizine for approximately seven weeks after ketotifen was discontinued which likely influenced the adverse effects reported by this patient. Oropharyngeal symptoms were relatively uncommon in both groups, and no cardiovascular symptoms were reported.</p><p>Cutaneous symptoms were rarely reported while on ketotifen premedication, again suggesting suppression by the H1 antihistamine activity of ketotifen. This raises the issue of potential &#x0201c;masking&#x0201d; or partial treatment of a reaction by ketotifen premedication leading to under-recognition of a reaction by patients or their parents. This is concerning as many patients recognize cutaneous symptoms as key initial symptoms of reaction. Additional safety studies are required before premedication can be recommended during oral immunotherapy for food allergy. However, if premedication is used in future OIT research, patients should be educated on recognition of atypical presentations of anaphylaxis.</p><p>Eight episodes of anaphylaxis occurred, all involving cutaneous symptoms, and the majority occurring after home doses taken in the context of known cofactors of anaphylaxis. As a result of anaphylactic reactions, one subject from each of the ketotifen and placebo groups withdrew from the study. Accidental peanut ingestion and accidental overdose of peanut OIT were not observed but remain relevant concerns. Despite education, epinephrine was used in only two cases of anaphylaxis. The ongoing risk of anaphylaxis with home doses of peanut OIT should be emphasized to patients, particularly in the setting of cofactors of anaphylaxis, and patients should be prepared to treat reactions should they occur.</p><p>As ketotifen was continued for only the first four weeks of OIT, we cannot predict whether ongoing ketotifen premedication would have reduced frequency and severity of adverse reactions experienced during the remainder of peanut OIT. For the same reason, we cannot predict whether the use of ketotifen premedication would have influenced the efficacy of peanut OIT. At the end of the study, the remaining placebo and ketotifen patient(s) tolerated equivalent median doses of peanut protein.</p><p>Oral immunotherapy is a promising area of investigation for treatment of peanut and other food allergy. However, safety concerns remain regarding the frequency and severity of adverse reactions during peanut OIT, particularly during periods of rapid dose escalation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our findings suggest that ketotifen premedication is well tolerated and reduces frequency and severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions during peanut OIT. Larger randomized studies of the safety and efficacy of premedication during oral immunotherapy for food allergy are warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>OIT: Oral immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AJ wrote the manuscript.
