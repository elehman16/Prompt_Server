Today, the Home Guards Organization (HGO) shares the above duty with security and police personnel. The HGO is an independent, disciplined, and uniformed body of personnel constituted under Karnataka Home Guards (HGs) Act, 1962, under the Karnataka Home Department. HGs' services have become indispensable during fairs, festivals, sports, elections, and for daily traffic control.</p><p>Normally, HGs work in stressful situations; hence, facing the realities of life is tough for them. All categories of field working HGs, experience varied emotions and have to cope with various tough situations in their day to day duties.</p><p>Yoga has been gaining popularity as a tool for developing both physical and mental faculties and reducing stress. People around the globe recognize yoga's efficacy as a tool to develop body and mind during the last century; people in India have been practicing yoga for several centuries to promote positive health and well-being <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Yoga pacifies the restless mind and offers relief to the sick <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It can also be used to develop physical fitness for which even common folks hanker <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Many use yoga for developing memory, intelligence, and creativity <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. With its manifold benefits, yoga is becoming a part of school education <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Specialists use it to unfold deeper layers of consciousness to attain spiritual perfection <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Growing scientific evidence, demonstrates that yoga is an important promoter of physical and mental health and a behavior-modifying practice. Several studies have demonstrated its beneficial effects on health behavior for many lifestyle-related somatic (body-related) problems such as hypertension <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, bronchial asthma <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, diabetes <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and few psychiatric conditions such as anxiety neurosis <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and depressive illness <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>The philosophy of yoga holds that somatic problems are manifestations of imbalance between the three <italic>Gunas</italic> (<italic>Sattva</italic>, <italic>Rajas</italic>, and <italic>Tamas</italic>) that manifest in the body-mind complex of an individual <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Further, the famous scriptural text, the <italic>Bhagavad Gita</italic> tells that <italic>Gunas</italic> indicate specific behavioral styles. Purity, wisdom, bliss, love of knowledge, spiritual excellence, and other noble and sublime qualities and serenity associated with <italic>Sattva</italic>. Egoism, activity, restlessness, and hankering after mundane things, such as wealth, power, valor, and comforts, symbolize <italic>Rajas</italic>. <italic>Tamas</italic> relates to qualities such as bias, heedlessness and inertia, perversion in taste, thought, and action <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Ill health occurs when <italic>Rajas</italic> or <italic>Tamas</italic> dominate <italic>Sattva</italic> and the individual habitually responds to them. Furthermore, after a detailed mind analysis, the <italic>Bhagavad Gita</italic> says that when the set of two <italic>Gunas</italic> dominate, the person loses mastery over the internal dialog and its speeded-up loops of sentences, which show up as upsurges of emotions and impulsive behavior. Humans in perfect health are completely free to respond to <italic>Sattva</italic>, <italic>Rajas</italic>, or <italic>Tamas</italic>. Hence, a tool that can grade the set three patterns of behavioral some a sures the degree of positive health <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The Vedic Personality Inventory (VPI) is a valid and reliable inventory that can measure the three patterns of behavior <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Many studies have been carried out on the role of integrated yoga module (IYM), but this study on personality and coping strategies in HGs is completely original.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>The participants were selected from 500 fields working HGs from Bangalore rural district who attended motivational lectures given by deputed instructors.

Both groups participated in weekly mandatory parades as per HG schedules.</p><p>In addition to normal routine work, the YG also did 1&#x000a0;h of IYM practices, 6 days a week for 8 weeks.

VPI developed by Wolf VPI in 1998 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> assesses the <italic>Vedic</italic> concept of the three personality types or <italic>Gun&#x00101;s</italic>. It is a &#x0201c;psychological construct&#x0201d; to assess three personality patterns expounded in the <italic>Vedas</italic>-the ancient Indian scriptures; hence, the name VPI. It measures levels of the three <italic>Gun&#x00101;s</italic> viz., <italic>Sattva</italic>, <italic>Rajas</italic>, and <italic>Tamas</italic> using acceptable psychometric properties. The original 90 criteria were shortened to 56 in 1999 after a reliability and validity analysis <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. It now contains 15 <italic>Sattva</italic>, 19 <italic>Rajas</italic>, and 22 <italic>Tamas</italic> (total 56) questions.</p><p>The 56 item VPI is adequate for group research and perhaps also for individual assessment. With regards to reliability, each item of the VPI contributes positively to the reliability of its subscale and also has a corrected item-total correlation with its subscale &#x0003e;0.50. These statistics suggest strong subscales, meaning that the elements of the subscales correlate strongly with each other <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>The questionnaire was self-administered with a time of 30&#x000a0;min for answering. A7-point Likert-type scale was chosen as a balance between convenience for the participant and researcher, and statistical power; also to minimize the chances of spurious out comes, especially in factor analysis. <italic>Gun&#x00101;'</italic> scores were obtained by totaling scores of items' responses for each <italic>Guna</italic> and dividing it by the number of items for that <italic>Guna</italic>. For each subscale, a higher score indicated a greater predominance of that <italic>Guna</italic>. Minimum and maximum scores for each thus range from 1 to 7. The VPI has been used extensively during the past 15 years and is accepted as a valid and reliable tool.

There were significant decreases in <italic>Rajas</italic> and <italic>Tamas</italic> in YG and increases in CG. When data analysis was sub divided by gender, educational qualification, and age all categories showed similar trends as expected according to the yogic literature.</p><p>A study by Das <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> conducted using the <italic>Mahamantra</italic> in a three-armed, randomized prospective, control study on 62 volunteers showed that the <italic>Mahamantra</italic> group increased <italic>Sattva</italic> and decreased <italic>Tamas</italic> with no significant change in <italic>Rajas</italic> scores on the VPI questionnaire after chanting of <italic>Mahamantra</italic>, 20&#x000a0;min daily for 4 weeks. However, in addition to increase in <italic>Sattva</italic> and decrease in <italic>Tamas</italic>, the present study observed a significant decrease in <italic>Rajas</italic> not observed after <italic>Mahamantra</italic>. This difference could be because of the addition of A<italic>sanas</italic> and <italic>Pranayama</italic> to the meditation technique used in this present study as compared to the <italic>Mahamantra</italic>.</p><p>The behavior of a human being is an expression of a combination of different <italic>Gun&#x00101;s</italic>. <italic>Tamas</italic> (meaning darkness) is the grossest aspect of our personality characterized by excessive sleep, laziness, depression, procrastination, a feeling of helplessness, impulsivity, anger, and arrogance (packed up with vital energy). When we reduce <italic>Tamas</italic> through mastery over the mind, we become dynamic, sensitive, and sharp to move toward <italic>Rajas</italic> (the shining one) characterized by intense activity, ambitiousness, competitiveness, high sense of self-importance, desire for sense gratification, little interest in spiritual elevation, dissatisfaction with one's position, envy of others, and a materialistic cleverness <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. With further growth and mastery, one moves into <italic>Sattva</italic> dominance which includes the qualities of truthfulness, stability, discipline, sense of control, sharp intelligence, preference for vegetarianism, truthfulness, gravity, dutifulness, detachment, respect for superiors and staunch determination, and stability in the face of adversity and also conscious action. Thus, we can see that although both <italic>Rajas</italic> and <italic>Tamas</italic> have both positive and negative qualities; they are the manifestation of a violent state of mind in which a person lacks mastery over personality or the ability to improve components of general health. The IYM increased <italic>Sattva</italic>. Hence, IYM which is more related to traditional practices in India and is cost effective can be recommended for its additional benefits of promoting personality development.</p><p>Another study conducted by Deshpande et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> compared the effects yoga and physical exercise (PE) on <italic>Gunas</italic> and general health. Yoga was observed to give better effects on the <italic>Sattva</italic> than PE, with a larger effective size, the main difference seemed to be in the effect on <italic>Rajo guna</italic>. Reduction in this <italic>Guna</italic> was significantly higher in PE group than Y group. Thus, it was concluded that both physical activity (to reduce <italic>Rajas</italic> and <italic>Tamas</italic>) and yoga (to improve <italic>Sattva</italic>) may be recommended for harmonious development of personality. However, the present study observed that giving IYM decreased <italic>Rajas</italic> significantly in YG as compared to CG.</p><p>The yogic techniques such as breathing practices, <italic>Asanas</italic>, <italic>pranayama</italic>, meditation, and lecture have helped the HGs to increase their level of confidence, and hence it has become easy for them to overcome <italic>Tamas</italic> and increase <italic>Sattva</italic>.</p><p>The other aspect of yoga is relaxation which might have given the ability to the HGs to face the situation in the field in a relaxed state of mind and perform duty in relaxed and effectiveness way, that means relaxation in action and efficiency in outcome.</p><p>Further studies can be done with various populations such as police, military, and other security-related agencies for increasing the level of confidence with yoga intervention.</p><p>The strength of our design is IYM for HGs. The HGs work in very stressful situations during elections, when managing traffic and in other crowded places. It is essential in the present day circumstances that they can manage their personalities (<italic>Gun&#x00101;s</italic>) and cope with stressful situations. Most of them succumb to smoking and drinking to overcome their stress. Hence, training them to calm their minds is an immediate need and to enable them to increase <italic>Sattva</italic> and decrease <italic>Rajas</italic> and <italic>Tamas</italic>. An interesting observation was that HGs in YG who were graduates showed increase in <italic>Rajas</italic>, where as all others in YG showed reductions. This may possibly be because only six people were in that category, and should be further studied with a larger number of HGs.</p><p>This study demonstrates the utility of the VPI as a tool for measuring the subtle dimensions of <italic>Gun&#x00101;s</italic> described in traditional texts of yoga as a measure of steps of individual growth.</p><p>Limitation of this study: we have taken only subjective parameter such as questionnaire, objective parameter such as blood pressure and electro cardiogram would have given more information.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results have shown that IYM has improved the personality of HGs by increasing their <italic>Sattva Guna</italic> and reducing their <italic>Rajas</italic> and <italic>Tamas</italic>. Further, yoga is cost-effective and recommended to HGs. Hence, this study suggests a solution to train HGs to calm their mind and help them to increase their <italic>Sattva Guna</italic>. By this, their service to public will improve and in turn the image of the department will also go up.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Source of support</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Conflict&#x000a0;of interest</title><p>No.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The health benefits of yoga and exercise: a review of comparison studies</article-title><source>J&#x000a0;Altern Complement Med</source><volume>16</volume><year>2010</year><fpage>3</fpage><lpage>12</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20105062</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ganpat</surname><given-names>T.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagendra</surname><given-names>H.R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Integrated yoga therapy for improving mental health in managers</article-title><source>Ind Psychiatry J</source><volume>20</volume><year>2011</year><fpage>45</fpage><lpage>48</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22969180</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kejriwal</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Krishnana</surname><given-names>V.R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Impact of Vedic worldview and gunas on transformational leadership</article-title><source>Vikalpa</source><volume>29</volume><year>2004</year><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>31</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rangan</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagendra</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhat</surname><given-names>G.R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of yogic education system and modern education system on memory</article-title><source>Int J Yoga</source><volume>2</volume><year>2009</year><fpage>55</fpage><lpage>61</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20842265</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kauts</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of yoga on academic performance in relation to stress</article-title><source>Int J Yoga</source><volume>2</volume><year>2009</year><fpage>39</fpage><lpage>43</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21234215</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref6"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>R.G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Patient centred medicine: reason, emotion, and human spirit?
