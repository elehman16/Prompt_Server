A second catheter was placed into the same arm for obtaining blood samples for analysis of insulin and blood glucose. The hand of the subject was heated with a warming device to maintain a temperature of approximately 55&#x000b0;C throughout the clamp procedure, resulting in an arterialization of the venous blood due to a reflexive opening of arteriovenous shunts.

</p><p id="dom12759-para-0029">Because the previous LY IGlar PK/PD studies designed to meet bioequivalence criteria were conducted in healthy subjects, it has not been possible to compare the PD duration of action of LY IGlar and that of IGlar because of the presence of endogenous insulin. A higher dose of 0.5 U/kg and a clamp duration limited to 24 hours also contributed to preventing determination of the duration of action.</p><p id="dom12759-para-0030">Regulatory guidelines recommend clamp durations of at least 24 hours for determining the duration of action of intermediate or long&#x02010;acting insulins.<xref rid="dom12759-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> A clamp duration of 42 hours was used in the present study in an effort to allow a higher percentage of subjects to reach the end of action compared to shorter clamp durations. To our knowledge, this is the first euglycaemic clamp study reporting the duration of action for an insulin glargine using a clamp duration as long as 42 hours; although a clamp duration of 42 hours was also used in a study comparing IGlar and insulin degludec in subjects with T1DM, only data to 24 hours was reported.<xref rid="dom12759-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> While extending clamp duration further would allow for more subjects to reach end of action and potentially eliminate the need for right&#x02010;censoring, practical considerations and safety concerns related to the length of fasting and the relatively high blood loss make it problematic to extend glucose clamps beyond 42 hours.</p><p id="dom12759-para-0031">The 0.3&#x02010;U/kg dose used here was similar to doses used in the previously reported Phase 3 trial in T1DM patients, in which the mean dose at 52 weeks was 0.36 U/kg/day for IGlar and 0.38 U/kg/day for LY IGlar.<xref rid="dom12759-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> The dose of 0.3 U/kg was chosen so that the entire duration of action could be captured for the majority of subjects while maintaining a reasonable clamp duration. At the same time, the selected dose should, ideally, be high enough to allow for detection of the study drug by the bioanalytical assay. However, serum insulin levels were BQL (50 pM) following administration of the 0.3&#x02010;U/kg dose of insulin glargine in many instances. Because less than half of the subjects had evaluable insulin PK profiles during both treatment periods and because there was considerable variability in the available data, definitive conclusions regarding insulin PK could not be made. The sample preparation method used included extraction of all insulin glargine&#x02010;antibody complexes, and thus antidrug antibody interference could not have been a confounding factor in this study. Comparing the PK parameters of IGlar and LY IGlar was a secondary endpoint of the current study; however, the pivotal Phase 1 studies designed to meet bioequivalence criteria were statistically powered to demonstrate that the area under the concentration&#x02010;time curve from time 0&#x02010;24 hours [AUC (0&#x02010;24)], maximum observed drug concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and time of C<sub>max</sub> (t<sub>max</sub>) were similar after doses of 0.5 U/kg IGlar and LY IGlar [6].</p><p id="dom12759-para-0032">A blood glucose cut&#x02010;off of 8.3 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) was used for determining the end of action.

The prolonged fasting that occurs in euglycaemic clamp procedures contributes to an extended duration of action. Blood glucose cut&#x02010;offs as low as 105 mg/dL have been introduced recently to reach the end of action earlier in glucose clamp studies, but data on end of action was still right&#x02010;censored (i.e. did not reach the blood glucose cut&#x02010;off) at this endpoint in some clamps,<xref rid="dom12759-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> demonstrating the difficulties in designing euglycaemic clamp studies using long&#x02010;acting insulins. Despite the relatively low dose of 0.3 U/kg and the 42&#x02010;hour clamp duration, the end of action cut&#x02010;off was not reached in 14 of 40 clamps in this study, also demonstrating limitations in studies of this type.</p><p id="dom12759-para-0033">Confirmation of clamp quality is an important consideration to ensure confidence in the results obtained in euglycaemic clamp studies.<xref rid="dom12759-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> In the current study, the mean difference between measured and target blood glucose levels was similarly low for both study insulins. The mean coefficient of variation of blood glucose levels was also similar between study insulins, with mean values of 6.3% and 6.5% for IGlar and LY IGlar, respectively.</p><p id="dom12759-para-0034">Careful consideration was given to whether to conduct the study after a single dose or at steady state. Single&#x02010;dose studies are more sensitive than steady&#x02010;state studies for assessing PK and PD properties and can detect early differences in PD parameters that may not be apparent at steady state. Regulatory guidance<xref rid="dom12759-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="dom12759-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> recommends single&#x02010;dose studies as the default when comparing the PKs and PDs of a biosimilar and a reference product. Furthermore, data suggest that the PK of insulin glargine is linear in terms of time; therefore, PK/PD after a single dose should predict PK/PD after multiple doses.</p><p id="dom12759-para-0035">The ratios for the geometric LS means for G<sub>tot</sub> and R<sub>max</sub> were comparable between LY IGlar and IGlar. Other PD parameters characterizing the time profile for GIR (TR<sub>max</sub>, early TR<sub>max50%,</sub> late TR<sub>max50%</sub>) were also comparable between LY IGlar and IGlar. While the current study was designed to compare the duration of action of LY IGlar and IGlar, the PD results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that LY IGlar and IGlar met bioequivalence criteria with regard to the PD parameters G<sub>tot</sub> and R<sub>max</sub> at a dose of 0.5 U/kg.<xref rid="dom12759-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>
</p><p id="dom12759-para-0036">In the present study, no safety concerns were noted in subjects with T1DM following administration of either LY IGlar or IGlar.</p><p id="dom12759-para-0037">In summary, the results presented here demonstrate a similar duration of action for LY IGlar and IGlar in subjects with T1DM and also showed comparable PD parameters. In conjunction with previous studies demonstrating that LY IGlar PK/PD parameters met bioequivalence criteria in healthy subjects and clinical trials showing similar safety and efficacy in T1DM and T2DM subjects, the current study adds to the totality of evidence supporting the similarity of LY IGlar and IGlar.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="dom12759-supitem-0001"><caption><p>
