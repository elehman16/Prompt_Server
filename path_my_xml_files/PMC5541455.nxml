Online information and support may offer a solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This single-blind, parallel, online randomised controlled trial will determine clinical and cost-effectiveness of the Relatives Education And Coping Toolkit (REACT) (including an online resource directory (RD)), compared with RD only, for relatives of people with psychosis or bipolar disorder. Both groups continue to receive treatment as usual. Independent, web-based variable, block, individual randomisation will be used across 666 relatives. Primary outcome is distress at 24 weeks (measured by General Health Questionnaire; GHQ-28) compared between groups using analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline score. Secondary clinical outcomes are carer well-being and support. Cost-effectiveness analysis will determine cost of a significant unit change (three-point reduction) in the GHQ-28. Costs include offering and supporting the intervention in the REACT arm, relevant healthcare care costs including health professional contacts, medications prescribed and time off (or ability to) work for the relative. Cost utility analysis will be calculated as the marginal cost of changes in quality-adjusted life years, based on EuroQol. We will explore relatives&#x02019; beliefs, perceived coping and amount of REACT toolkit use as possible outcome mediators. We have embedded two methodological substudies in the protocol to determine the relative effectiveness of a low-value (&#x000a3;10) versus higher value (&#x000a3;20) incentive, and an unconditional versus conditional incentive, on improving follow-up rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The trial has ethical approval from Lancaster National Research Ethics Service (NRES)Committee (15/NW/0732) and is overseen by an independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee and Trial Steering Committee. Protocol version 1.5 was approved on 9 January 2017. All updates to protocols are uploaded to the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Journals Library.

</p><p>Reasons for poor implementation are likely to be multifaceted but likely include limited time and resources within teams and among relatives. An online intervention to provide the necessary information and support to relatives may improve implementation. Online interventions are well established for many mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and are being rapidly developed for psychosis<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and BD.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Such interventions are particularly suited to delivering standardised information and a platform to share ideas through online forums, but cannot replace structured family interventions. Online support is also being developed for relatives of people with other chronic health conditions,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and may be particularly useful for these groups due to the flexibility of use, and empathy and support from being linked to other carers.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</p><p>We have developed the Relatives Education And Coping Toolkit (REACT) to provide high-quality information and support in an easy and free-to-access online form to relatives of people with psychosis or BD. If effective, it could help National Health Service&#x000a0;(NHS) Trusts meet the national access and waiting times target for early intervention services to offer carer information and support to all.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</p><p>Online interventions may be best evaluated using online trial methodology to enhance the external validity of the trial.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Advantages of online trial design include the potential to reach a greater number and range of participants more representative of the population likely to use an online intervention, to recruit more people over a shorter timeframe, to offer secure randomisation and data entry simpler protocols, and for a much cheaper trial due to fewer staff required.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, retention rates can be low,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> compromising internal validity of the trial. Offering incentives can improve retention rates,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;23</xref> but there is considerable uncertainty as to the&#x000a0;level of incentive required and whether the incentive should be conditional or unconditional on completion.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Study aims and objectives</title><p>This randomised controlled trial aims to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the REACT toolkit (which includes an online resource directory (RD)) and treatment as usual (TAU), compared with the RD only and TAU.

We will develop a social media strategy using Twitter, Facebook, Google Ads and blogging, and engage with local and national news media. We will recruit through national carer networks, MIND, Carers Trust, Rethink Mental Illness, Carers UK, SANE, Bipolar UK and NHS Choices. These organisations will all be listed in the RD in our trial. We will work closely with the Clinical Research Network to ensure information about the study is made widely available for recruitment through NHS Trusts and general practitioner (GP) practices. We will monitor the success of these strategies by asking all potential participants at registration (postconsent) to indicate how they heard about the trial and explore differences in demographics for those entering the study via different routes.</p><p>Based on previous studies our strategies to improve recruitment include a&#x000a0;&#x02018;lead-in&#x02019; period during which people can register interest in the trial during the set-up phase and be contacted directly when the trial starts,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> using online recruitment strategies to target those already using the internet to seek help,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and paying participants.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p><p>Potential participants will be directed to the study home&#x000a0;page (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.reacttoolkit.co.uk">www.reacttoolkit.co.uk</ext-link>), which provides study information. People visiting the site will provide the postcode of the person they care for to check they live in the UK, and not in one of the implementation study (IMPART) areas. Those in an IMPART area will be directed to the IMPART study site. Potential participants are directed to an online participant information sheet that details the study. Relatives are then asked to complete a short checklist to indicate whether they meet the inclusion criteria listed above.</p><p>Non-eligible relatives are invited to leave their contact details if they would like to be sent content of the REACT modules at the end of the study.</p><p>Eligible participants complete an online consent form and provide a valid email address. A copy of the consent form and a link to the registration process is sent by email (email validation step).</p><p>The registration process requires multiple contact details including mobile phone number, and checks for overlap with other participant details. A code is sent by text message to invite the relative to access the site. The data collection system requires email address and the registration name from the user. If any of the 7% of the UK population without a mobile phone take part, or there are any concerns identified through matching registration details, we will ask for a landline and verify identity using a code delivered by telephone. We will use postcodes to check all participants are living in the UK. We will request age and gender at baseline and also at 12-week and 24-week follow-up, as a final identity check. Similar strategies have been used successfully in previous trials.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 26</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Interventions</title><p>Participants can access the intervention site (REACT or RD) whenever they wish throughout the period of the trial (minimum of 24 weeks to last follow-up for final participant). They are advised to use the intervention according to the&#x000a0;level of need. No changes are made to current treatment.</p><sec id="s2f1"><title>Development of REACT</title><p>REACT was developed with extensive input from clinicians and relatives through focus groups<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and the&#x000a0;RAG. The content was first made available in paper/online pdf form, and feasibility and effectiveness in reducing relatives&#x02019; distress were demonstrated in a randomised controlled trial.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Based on further qualitative feedback from participants in the feasibility trial, focus groups with relatives exploring their views of online interventions and RAG input, the content has been updated and expanded to offer a comprehensive online recovery&#x000a0;focused toolkit for relatives of people with psychosis and/or BD. It includes online support from trained relatives (REACT supporters) via confidential direct messaging, and from other relatives through a restricted access forum moderated by the REACT supporters. Support offered by peers with a shared lived mental health experience is highly valued and can be as effective as support from health professionals,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> but there is no evidence on the effectiveness of relatives&#x02019; peer support. A key advantage of this design is that relatives of people who refuse to engage with services can be supported.</p><p>Each of the 12 key modules contains high-quality standardised written information, videos of clinical experts or experts by experience sharing their knowledge and experiences to illustrate key points, and self-reflection tasks to ensure content is personalised to the user.

At 24 weeks, the email content will vary depending on whether participants have been randomised to either &#x000a3;10 or &#x000a3;20 reward and to the reward being conditional (ie, dependent on completion of follow-up questionnaires) or unconditional (ie, offered with the initial request for follow-up data).</p><p>To maximise follow-up at the primary outcome point we will:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>only randomise participants once baseline assessment measures are completed</p></list-item><list-item><p>include detailed explanations in our recruitment materials to explain to participants why data completion at follow-up is so important</p></list-item><list-item><p>require email, telephone and postal contact details at registration so we have multiple methods of contact for follow-up</p></list-item><list-item><p>send participants up to three automated email reminders at 5-day intervals, followed by text, telephone and/or postal requests</p></list-item><list-item><p>incentivise completion of follow-up measures by paying participants shopping voucher(s) at each time point.</p></list-item></list>

Our feasibility trial<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> showed a mean difference in GHQ scores between groups at 6 months (controlling for baseline) of 6.59 units (SD 16.6 units) in favour of the REACT arm. To build a degree of protection against pilot results proving optimistic, and to accommodate adaptations to the design of the study and the intervention, we reduce our estimate of the mean difference in this trial from 6.59 to 5.0 units. We retain our estimate of SD of 16.60 from the feasibility study, consistent with other studies using this measure with relatives in EI services<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and somewhat higher than those from other mental health or dementia services.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 47</xref> Four hundred and sixty-six participants provides 90% power to reject the null hypothesis (p&#x0003c;0.05), with effect size of&#x000a0;5.0 units assuming 30% dropout by 24 weeks.

</p><p>If the SD of GHQ-28 scores at 24-week follow-up at the end of the internal pilot is higher than the estimated 16.6 units, the sample size will be recalculated and recruitment targets increased accordingly. If SD is lower, sample size will remain unchanged. If GHQ-28 retention at 24 weeks is less than 70%, recruitment target will increase to ensure 466 patients will provide sufficient 24-week primary outcome data to test the primary hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Eligible participants will be randomised using a 1:1 ratio to &#x02018;REACT (including RD)+TAU&#x02019; versus &#x02018;RD+TAU&#x02019; by the CTRC.

If normally distributed, scores on the primary and secondary outcomes will be summarised using means and SDs for each arm separately, and will be compared between groups using analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline score, and including all participations according to the randomisation scheme. If the scores are not normally distributed, the median and IQR will be presented for each randomised group and will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U&#x000a0;test. An appropriate transformation (eg, log) will be applied, and analysis of covariance will be applied to data, adjusting for baseline score.</p><p>To investigate the relationship between website use and outcome, data will be recorded on baseline covariates (correlated with both website use and outcome) and relevant website use (from participants in both arms). Instrumental variable regression will be implemented to estimate impact of website use on the primary outcome (GHQ-28 at 24&#x02009;weeks), as well as to test whether the mediator variables actually predict change in outcome. Mediating variables will be examined individually in this exploratory analysis.</p><p>To assess the impact of the second randomisation, the number (proportion) of participants providing 24-week follow-up data will be presented and compared using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test (or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, if expected counts are&#x000a0;&#x0003c;5). The independent impact of intervention group on retention rates will be explored by including intervention group along with value of the reward (or un/conditional nature of the reward) as an explanatory variable in logistic regression.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Cost-effectiveness</title><p>Cost utility with a fully incremental analysis using an NHS perspective at 24&#x02009;weeks will be done. Effectiveness will be assessed by changes on GHQ-28. EQ-5D-5L will be used to generate QALYs. Uncertainty around cost-effectiveness estimates will be explored using cost-effectiveness planes (through generating a large number of cost&#x02013;outcome combinations using bootstrapping) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (showing the probability of the intervention being cost-effective at various levels of willingness to pay). This allows any uncertainty in the costs or outcomes to be reflected in the results presented. The&#x000a0;NICE Health Technology Assessment&#x000a0;(HTA) guidance will be followed. However, costs of informal support can impact on cost-effectiveness when it constitutes a substantial part of the support provided, so we will account for this by also providing results from the wider societal perspective including estimates of carers&#x02019; productivity losses.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Missing data analyses</title><p>To minimise missing data, participants are required to complete the primary outcome measure (GHQ-28) before completing any other measures. Participants are unable to submit any questionnaire with missing fields, thus avoiding missing data within questionnaires. As much data as possible will be collected about the reasons for missing data, and these&#x000a0;will be used to inform the handling of missing data. Participants will be invited to give reasons for not responding to the email reminders.</p><p>The baseline characteristics of those who do/do not provide data will be compared to demonstrate whether missing data can be assumed to be missing at random (at least with respect to recorded baseline characteristics). A joint modelling approach (using baseline, 12-week and 24-week&#x000a0;outcome data) will be used to assess the impact of missing data at 24&#x02009;weeks on the conclusions drawn from analysis on primary and secondary efficacy outcomes.</p><p>Participants are free to withdraw consent from the trial at any time without providing a reason, although we invite them to tell us why they have withdrawn so that we can take this into consideration in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Monitoring</title><p>The trial is overseen by an independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) including Professor of Trials and Professor of Clinical Psychology, and the&#x000a0;TSC Chaired by Professor of Clinical Psychology and including a trials statistician, trial methodologist and expert relative, both funder-appointed (National Institute for Health Research&#x000a0;(NIHR)).

Risk can be identified through online questionnaire red flag items, posts on the REACT group, direct messages to REACT supporters and by the trial manager during email or telephone participant contact. Low-risk events will be discussed in supervision, documented and trigger a standardised email expressing concern and providing details of how to seek crisis support. If an immediate high risk is identified, either the police (immediate risk to life) or social services (risk to child) will be contacted as appropriate. Risk will be reported to the supervising clinician and documented. The supervising clinician will discuss the risk event with the TSC Chair, who will decide if the event is related or unrelated to the study. If related, Chief&#x000a0;Investigator and Trial&#x000a0;Manager will be unblinded, and the sponsor, ethics committee and funding body will be notified.
