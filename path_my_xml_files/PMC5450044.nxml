This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a theoretically informed multifaceted strategy to de-implement these low-value blood management techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty-one Dutch hospitals participated in this pragmatic cluster-randomized trial. At baseline, data were gathered for 924 patients from 10 intervention and 1040 patients from 11 control hospitals undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty. The intervention included a multifaceted de-implementation strategy which consisted of interactive education, feedback on blood management performance, and a comparison with benchmark hospitals, aimed at orthopedic surgeons and anesthesiologists. After the intervention, data were gathered for 997 patients from the intervention and 1096 patients from the control hospitals. The randomization outcome was revealed after the baseline measurement. Primary outcomes were use of blood salvage and erythropoietin. Secondary outcomes included postoperative hemoglobin, length of stay, allogeneic transfusions, and use of local infiltration analgesia (LIA) and tranexamic acid (TXA).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The use of blood salvage (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.30) and erythropoietin (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.97) reduced significantly over time, but did not differ between intervention and control hospitals (blood salvage OR 1.74 95% CI 0.27 to 11.39, erythropoietin OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.26 to 6.84). Postoperative hemoglobin levels were significantly higher (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> 0.21, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.34) and length of stay shorter (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> &#x02212;0.36, 95% CI &#x02212;0.64 to &#x02212;0.09) in hospitals receiving the multifaceted strategy, compared with control hospitals and after adjustment for baseline. Transfusions did not differ between the intervention and control hospitals (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.78). Both LIA (OR 0.0, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.0) and TXA (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.5) were significantly associated with the reduction in blood salvage over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Blood salvage and erythropoietin use reduced over time, but not differently between intervention and control hospitals. The reduction in blood salvage was associated with increased use of local infiltration analgesia and tranexamic acid, suggesting that de-implementation is assisted by the substitution of techniques.

Evidence shows that, e.g., in the USA, an estimated 30% of all medical spending is unnecessary and does not add value in care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Elimination or reduction of this low-value care (de-implementation) may lead to improved quality of care while reducing expenditures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The importance of abandoning low-value care is underscored by the Choosing Wisely campaign which was launched in the USA in 2012 to encourage physicians and patients to engage in conversations about unnecessary tests, treatments, and procedures; the campaign is now being adopted in many other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A key element of Choosing Wisely is that medical societies create &#x0201c;better not to do&#x0201d; lists of tests, treatments, and procedures in their discipline for which there is strong evidence of overuse, potential harm, or significant and unjustifiable costs.</p><p>The next step is to translate these &#x0201c;better not to do&#x0201d; lists into action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, although there is extensive literature on how to adopt new practices (implementation) and change human behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the understanding of the abandonment of long-established existing techniques or practices that might have become redundant or cause overtreatment is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is suggested that there are fundamental differences between de-implementation and implementation, as it is harder to give up low-value care, particularly when not substituted with something else, than to adopt new and promising techniques. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] But theory or empirical evidence on how to effectively de-implement is sparse, and only limited knowledge is available about the specific agents involved in de-implementation, the relevant barriers and facilitators, and the effective interventions for successful de-implementation of low-value care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>An example of low-value care can be found in perioperative blood management. Perioperative blood loss may necessitate allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Therefore, to prevent allogeneic transfusions, various blood-saving techniques are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), blood salvage and erythropoietin (EPO) are frequently used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Blood salvage includes the collection of shed blood during and after surgery and the reinfusion of this blood intravenously. EPO is given in the preoperative stage to patients with anemia to increase the hemoglobin (Hb) level. Both techniques are used to avoid the postoperative hemoglobin level to drop below the threshold for allogeneic transfusion. The indication to use the technique is determined by an orthopedic surgeon or anesthesiologist. However, a recent meta-analysis showed that, based on RCTs published between 2010 and 2012, blood salvage did not lead to a reduction in transfused patients or in the volume of transfused blood in THA and TKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Other literature showed that EPO was effective to reduce the number of transfused patients and the volume of transfused blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], but the costs of EPO were so high that it was considered not cost-effective in THA and TKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Despite this evidence, both techniques are still used in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Additional effort is needed to reduce the use of this low-value care in patients in which the use of blood salvage and EPO is not cost-effective, taking into account the existing barriers and facilitators for de-implementation as recommended by Lorencatto et al. who calls for more theoretically informed behavior change research in transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study therefore was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted strategy to de-implement blood salvage and EPO in patients undergoing primary THA and TKA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>A pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial was performed to assess the effectiveness of a multifaceted de-implementation strategy. The Medical Ethical Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center declared that ethical approval was not required (CME 13/132) and waived the need for written consent from patients.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention</title><p>In intervention hospitals, the participants were exposed to a multifaceted de-implementation strategy during a 9-month intervention period. The strategy was tailored to address barriers identified in our problem analysis study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was used to identify relevant barriers. This framework includes 12 different domains derived from a large number of health psychology theories and their theoretical constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Barriers were identified on four domains and were targeted by the four components of the de-implementation strategy (see also Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1 for the linkage with the theoretical background):<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Information letter/email aimed at professionals involved in blood management, other than the study participants (orthopedic surgeons and anesthesiologists), e.g., blood transfusion committee members, operating room personnel, pharmacists.

Thereafter, data on the current use of blood salvage and EPO, postoperative Hb levels, transfusion rates, and length of stay (LoS) within the visited hospital were presented to specify where improvement could be achieved. During the visit, there was opportunity to openly discuss the presented information. Additionally pocket cards summarizing the literature and criteria for the use of blood salvage and EPO were handed to the participants</p></list-item><list-item><p>An educational outreach visit (second visit to each intervention hospital) for participants to give feedback on the use of blood salvage and EPO planned halfway the intervention period (month 5/6).

</p><p>Control hospitals were not contacted during the 9-month intervention period and only received evidence by, e.g., publication of evidence in scientific journals. Likewise, there were no data gathered during the intervention period as this might create awareness and contamination of the control group. After completion of data collection for the effect measurement, the control hospitals were offered a modified intervention including the interactive education, feedback, and benchmark.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Effect evaluation</title><p>The effect of the de-implementation strategy in intervention hospitals was compared with the usual care strategy in control hospitals. Individual patient data were gathered using a medical record review; in each hospital, two measurements took place: a baseline measurement prior to the intervention period and an effect measurement afterwards to compare the use of blood management techniques and patient outcomes between the intervention and control group, corrected for baseline. A sample size calculation was performed based on the use of blood salvage and EPO estimated in our preceding survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We assumed that if hospitals answered to frequently use these techniques, it is applied in 50% of patients. To detect a difference of 20% (from 50 to 30%) with an alpha of 0.05, a two-sided testing and power of 80%, and an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.08, 50 patients per hospital and 20 hospitals were needed. Per measurement, a sample of 50&#x02013;100 patients was retrospectively taken from the preceding 5&#x000a0;months by selecting the first 10&#x02013;20 eligible patients of each month. Patients undergoing primary elective THA or TKA and aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years were eligible. Exclusion criteria are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

From the patient data, it appeared that the proportion of patients treated with LIA (a drug locally injected to reduce postoperative pain and to accelerate recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]) increased in control hospitals from 21.3 to 40.8% and in intervention hospitals from 20.1 to 32.9%. Several physicians in the intervention hospitals mentioned during the interactive education and educational outreach visit that they hesitate to use both LIA and postoperative blood salvage to avoid drainage of the LIA and to avoid systemic effects by reinfusion of the LIA. The proportion of patients treated with TXA (a drug given to reduce perioperative blood loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]) increased in the control hospitals from 18.3 to 41.5% and even more in the intervention hospitals from 24.3 to 69.2%. Both techniques are frequently used as elements within multimodal rehabilitation programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Eight out of ten intervention and eight out of eleven control hospitals used such a program.</p><p>Whether the observed reduction in blood salvage and EPO might be explained by the increased use of LIA and TXA was tested by adding these two variables to the previously specified models. The results are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3a and b. Both LIA (OR 0.0, 95% C 0.0 to 0.0) and TXA (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.5) were significantly associated with the reduction in blood salvage over time, and adding these to the statistical models rendered the reduction of blood salvage over time as non-significant (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.0). The addition of LIA and TXA to the EPO model did not change the results. Increased use of LIA and TXA was also significantly associated with all secondary outcomes (data not shown).</p><p>No other changes in perioperative management of THA and TKA patients are observed as potential explanatory factors for the effect of the de-implementation strategy.</p><p>Further, exposure of participants in the intervention hospitals to the de-implementation strategy components was assessed and the different components were evaluated. One component was not executed: &#x0201c;information provision by mail to other involved professionals&#x0201d; was deemed unnecessary by the participants. Exposure to the other components is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4. Evaluation of the executed components by participants in the intervention hospitals showed that all components had contributed to a large extent (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p>The use of blood salvage and EPO significantly reduced over time in patients undergoing THA and TKA, but similarly in the intervention and control hospitals, without an effect of the de-implementation strategy. Reduction in blood salvage was associated with increased use of LIA and TXA. A significant effect of the strategy on secondary outcomes was seen: a higher postoperative hemoglobin and a reduced length of stay in the intervention group, suggesting improved quality of care; although, the clinical relevance of these findings can be questioned.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Findings in context of existing research</title><p>In this study, a theoretically informed de-implementation strategy to change blood management practice, tailored to previously identified barriers was tested. The rationale behind this study was that this de-implementation strategy would lead to a reduction in the use of blood salvage and EPO. We expected that the control group would continue their current practice. However, the results showed that there was a reduction in the use of blood salvage and EPO in both intervention and control groups over time. Additionally, we observed an interaction of the use of LIA and TXA with the outcomes. In a recently published review of Niven et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], all studies on the de-implementation of low-value care (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38) except for one were studies without a control group. In our study, the lack of a control group would have resulted in the conclusion that use of blood salvage and EPO was reduced due to the de-implementation strategy and the observed trend in increased LIA and TXA use could have been seen as an intervention effect. This underlines the importance of including a control group in (de-)implementation studies and is thus a strength of the present study.</p><p>This study is the first study that promotes the de-implementation of blood salvage and EPO in patients undergoing THA or TKA in daily practice. It is therefore a pioneering study in a new field. Previously, studies on the implementation of transfusion guidelines, and its associated difficulties, have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, this study focuses on a new phenomenon within the field of transfusion medicine, the de-implementation of low-value practices. The reduction in blood salvage over time in this study could be explained by the increased use of LIA and TXA, while the decreased use of EPO remains unclear. When considering blood salvage, this substitution of one practice by something else seemed to be an important factor. From the literature, it is known that, once established, it can be very difficult to abandon low-value clinical practices. De-implementation is not the opposite of implementation of new clinical practices and may need a different approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This study is the first to suggest that substitution of low-value care may encourage de-implementation. In this study the substitutes were TXA, a simple, safe, and inexpensive blood-sparing technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and LIA, a technique aimed at pain relief, which is found difficult to combine with blood salvage, as the blood salvage drain directly drains the analgesic fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>Although the de-implementation strategy was not effective, the result of the study is a reduction in blood salvage and EPO without deterioration of secondary outcomes related to quality of care. This substantiates that blood salvage and EPO are low-value care. Regarding blood salvage, this is in line with the literature, on which the current study is based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Regarding the use of EPO it is striking to see that, although effective (but not cost-effective), the EPO reduction did not lead to more transfusions, lower postoperative Hb, or increased LoS. The ongoing trend that allogeneic transfusions occur less frequent in the past years, as is shown for instance in the meta-analysis of van Bodegom et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], might be an explanation for this, as the benefit of EPO becomes smaller if the number of transfusions decreases.</p><p>In addition, the results of this study showed that in the intervention group the LoS of patients was significantly reduced and the postoperative Hb significantly improved as compared with that in the control hospitals. Both outcomes were used in the de-implementation strategy components to give feedback on hospitals&#x02019; performance and for benchmarking. Insight into this information may have caused awareness among participants leading to improvement on these outcomes or, for example, triggered participants to introduce LIA or TXA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title><p>A study limitation is that participants in both the intervention and control hospitals were aware of their participation in a study about blood management. We tried to avoid this by informing a single person per hospital. However, contact-persons wanted or needed to discuss participation with their colleagues. This potentially resulted in two problems: participants with intrinsic motivation to change are more willing to participate in a study that stimulates change and awareness of the study goal could be the reason that participants changed their behavior. We could not objectify this as we do not have data about non-participating hospitals.</p><p>A second limitation of the study is the data gathering. Retrospective data gathering from patient records is dependent on the availability and quality of data. The reporting of adverse events and transfusion reactions varied too much to produce reliable outcomes. On the other hand, prospective data collection would have increased the awareness among participants.</p><p>A strength of this study is that it was preceded by a problem analysis study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In this preceding study, we identified the extent of the problem (frequency of use of blood salvage and EPO) and which barriers play a role in this specific situation of low-value care. Hence, the TDF was used to identify relevant barriers and to develop a strategy which tailored the relevant barriers.</p><p>Another strength is the addition of a process evaluation. Instead of retrospectively looking at possible explanations for results, changes in hospital policies were observed. We observed an increased use of LIA and TXA and found associations with the reduction in blood salvage. The use of LIA and TXA in a multimodal rehabilitation program may have contributed to the observed reduction in LoS (both LIA and TXA) and the increased postoperative Hb (TXA).</p><p>In addition, we could not objectify whether other factors played a role in the observed time trends in the primary outcomes and the lack of influence of the intervention, e.g., that a decrease in the waiting time for surgery makes it undesirable to treat patients with EPO or the publication of several (Dutch) studies about blood salvage convinced the control group to abandon it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. These unforeseen changes were possibly stronger facilitators than the strategy components and thereby explain the lack of effect of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Unanswered questions and future research</title><p>In the process evaluation, we tried to identify factors that explain the observed time effect in the reduction of blood salvage and EPO and the lack of influence of the de-implementation strategy. However, we could not objectify whether other processes played a role to the findings in this study. For instance, it is a possibility that a decrease in waiting time for surgery makes it undesirable to treat patients with EPO as this normally starts 4&#x000a0;weeks in advance of the surgery, or the publication of several (Dutch) studies concluding that blood salvage does not decrease allogeneic transfusion may have convinced the control group hospitals to stop the use of blood salvage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. These developments over time were possibly far stronger facilitators than any of the strategy components and thereby explain the lack of effect of the de-implementation strategy, which could not have been foreseen in the earlier problem analysis study.</p><p>Finally, a room for improvement remains, as a considerable number of patients was still treated with blood salvage and EPO. Future research should be aimed at the identification of (more) effective strategies to de-implement the use of low-value care practices to eventually improve the quality of care and lower health care costs. In this identification, a comprehensive analysis of psychological phenomena such as sticking to routines, resistance to change, peer pressure, the influence of marketing strategies of companies that supply products, and possible financial incentives should be included.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study is the first study that actively promoted to stop blood salvage and EPO in patients undergoing THA or TKA in daily practice. Although the de-implementation strategy was not effective, the result of the study is a reduction in blood salvage and EPO without deterioration of secondary outcomes related to quality of care. This substantiates that blood salvage and EPO are low-value care. Another important finding from the study is that the reduction in blood salvage was associated with the increased use of local infiltration analgesia and tranexamic acid. This suggests that that de-implementation is assisted by the substitution of techniques. Future research must reveal whether substitution is indeed an effective strategy to de-implement low-value care.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec20"><title>Additional file</title><p>
