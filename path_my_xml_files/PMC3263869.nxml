Unless there was statistical evidence of gene x treatment interactions, data were pooled from the three study arms and models were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, treatment, and baseline value for the dependent variable.

We found that three SNPs (<italic>NEGR1</italic> rs2815752, <italic>BDNF</italic> rs6265, <italic>PPARG</italic> rs1801282) predicted WR, irrespective of type of WL therapy, two of which (<italic>BDNF</italic> rs6265, <italic>PPARG</italic> Pro12Ala) were robust to correction for multiple hypothesis testing. Two other variants (<italic>TMEM18</italic> rs6548238, <italic>KTCD15</italic> rs29941) interacted with treatment modality to influence WR. We also replicated several associations reported previously with baseline obesity metrics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1328/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 4</ext-link>).</p><p>Our WR findings are perhaps most clinically relevant, since these might help target susceptible individuals and thus improve long-term effects of WL interventions. One of few published genetic association studies on WR found that the minor allele at the Pro12Ala locus associated with greater regain 1 year after a 6-month hypocaloric diet intervention ended, also noting reductions in the rate of fat oxidation in Ala12 allele carriers but not in Pro12 homozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), findings supporting those reported here. A second small study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) found a similar association between the Pro12Ala genotype and WR, whereas a third small study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) reported no effect.</p><p>Despite plausible mechanisms by which the genetic effects reported here are expressed, we were unable to detect statistically significant mediators. Although the genetic variants we studied may act independently of the selected mediators, it is also possible some of our findings are false-negative, owing to the relatively small sample and indirect measures. Our study is also limited by the absence of information on lifestyle behaviors after 12 months of intervention, which may have hampered the detection of mediators. Finally, the hyperglycemic nature of the DPP cohort may limit generalizability of our findings.</p><p>In summary, our findings offer novel insights into the mechanisms influencing the propensity for WR after intentional WL. This information may help target individuals who require additional support to maintain reduced weight in intervention settings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
