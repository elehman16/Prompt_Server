Triplicate intraocular pressure measurement of a randomly selected eye was obtained by a noncontact tonometer in a handheld and slit lamp-mounted position in a randomized order, with the Goldmann applanation tonometer always performed last.

There were no significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) between the techniques in the intraocular pressure measurements returned (Goldmann applanation tonometer vs handheld and Goldmann applanation tonometer vs slit lamp-mounted). The Goldmann applanation tonometer measured intraocular pressure 0.34 mmHg higher than handheld and 0.85 mmHg higher than slit lamp-mounted in session 1, and in session 2 Goldmann applanation tonometer intraocular pressure measurement was the same as with the slit lamp-mounted method but lower than with the handheld method by 0.11 mmHg. In PT100 handheld vs slit lamp-mounted comparisons, there were no significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) between intraocular pressure measurements returned by both techniques in sessions 1 and 2.

The results showed a high level of agreement between the AT550 and Goldmann applanation tonometer. Therefore, the investigators concluded that intraocular pressure readings obtained by AT550 are comparable clinically with those obtained by the Goldmann applanation tonometer in a population having intraocular pressure within the normal range.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-opth-5-1227">13</xref> However, very few studies have compared readings obtained by the PT100 and Goldmann applanation tonometer.

However, neither the Salim et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-5-1227">11</xref> nor Murase et al study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-opth-5-1227">14</xref> was able to demonstrate the repeatability of intraocular pressure measurements in normotensive subjects obtained by the PT100 NCT when compared with the Goldmann applanation tonometer. The only study to demonstrate the repeatability of Goldmann applanation tonometry in comparison with the PT100 observed that the intrasession repeatability of both techniques for test-retest differences was within &#x000b1;5 mmHg.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-opth-5-1227">15</xref> It is important to note that the intraocular pressure measurements in the three studies cited above were obtained by the PT100 noncontact tonometer in a handheld position.</p><p>The portable noncontact tonometer, Reichert PT100 ( Buffalo, Depew, NY) is increasingly used in optometry practices due to its rapidity and convenience in obtaining intraocular pressure measurements. It is also the first truly handheld noncontact tonometer (this increases its versatility), making it a useful screening instrument in preference to the Goldmann applanation tonometer. The readings obtained by noncontact tonometers are largely independent of the operator.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-opth-5-1227">16</xref> While one study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-opth-5-1227">15</xref> noted no statistically significant difference in mean intraocular pressures measured by Goldmann applanation tonometer and the PT100, another study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-5-1227">11</xref> observed a significant difference in intraocular pressure measurements returned by the Goldmann applanation tonometer and the PT100 when handheld. They further suggested that instability of the PT100 instrument was a possible reason for the variation in intraocular pressure readings between the Goldmann applanation tonometer and the PT100. Hence, this study was conducted to assess any possible differences in the precision of intraocular pressure measurements obtained when the PT100 noncontact tonometer was used in different positions (handheld and slit lamp-mounted) in comparison with the Goldmann applanation tonometer intraocular pressure measurements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data</title><p>Data for this study were obtained from 69 subjects recruited from students of various colleges at King Saud University.

For inclusion in this study, subjects were required to be oculovisually healthy during the study period, and should not have participated in any of our similar studies. Patients with any corneal disease, previous history of corneal surgery, glaucoma or a family history of glaucoma, recent use of steroids, or a high refractive error were excluded. Nine subjects were excluded because of recent completion of systemic steroid therapy (n = 3), and family history of glaucoma (n = 6).

Although the slit lamp-mounted intraocular pressure measurements varied significantly between sessions by 1.15 mmHg, the difference was not clinically important because intraocular pressure obtained by noncontact tonometer can vary between consecutive measurements by as much as 7 mmHg. This suggests that the three techniques used in this study have a similar consistency in measurements of intraocular pressure within a session.</p><p>In agreement with the suggestion of Salim et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-5-1227">11</xref> the stability introduced to the PT100 intraocular pressure measurements (by mounting it on a slit lamp) improved its precision because the intrasession (&#x000b1;2.08 mmHg, &#x000b1;1.77 mmHg, session 1 and 2) and intersession repeatability coefficients (&#x000b1;4.80 mmHg) were superior to those of the handheld PT100 (intrasession &#x000b1;2.64 mmHg, &#x000b1;2.49 mmHg, session 1 and 2; intersession &#x000b1;5.68 mmHg) and slightly better than that of Goldmann applanation tonometer (intrasession &#x000b1;2.03 mmHg, &#x000b1;2.28 mmHg, session 1 and 2; intersession &#x000b1;4.75 mmHg).

The study is limited by the lack of patients with increased intraocular pressure, and the narrow age group of subjects recruited, because the noncontact tonometer has been shown to be less accurate with higher pressures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-5-1227">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-5-1227">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-opth-5-1227">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-opth-5-1227">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-opth-5-1227">22</xref> There is also a possibility that central corneal thickness and curvature of the cornea may have influenced the intraocular pressure results obtained in this study. Studies have continuously shown that, while corneal curvature radius,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-opth-5-1227">23</xref> the elastic properties of the cornea, ie, rigidity and stiffness,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-opth-5-1227">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-opth-5-1227">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-opth-5-1227">26</xref> can influence intraocular pressure accuracy obtained by the Goldmann applanation tonometer and the noncontact tonometer, the noncontact tonometer is more affected by central corneal thickness than the Goldmann applanation tonometer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-opth-5-1227">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-opth-5-1227">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-opth-5-1227">26</xref> Therefore, the data in the current study are limited by the lack of central corneal thickness and cornea curvature measurements for adequate comparison. Studies comparing the two position measurements of intraocular pressure obtained by the PT100 with the Goldmann applanation tonometer in subjects with higher intraocular pressure ranges should consider recruiting subjects of various age groups, and determining central corneal thickness measurements in those subjects. This is to verify if similar findings occur for higher intraocular pressure ranges, and determine the effects of the cornea biomechanical properties on intraocular pressure obtained with the PT100.</p><p>Nevertheless, this study suggests that the lack of head and chin rests may have an influence on the precision of PT100 intraocular pressure measurements obtained in a handheld position with respect to the Goldmann applanation tonometer, but does not result in any significant variation in intraocular pressure measurements obtained on repositioning the instrument.</p><p>Generally, a repositioning of the PT100 from the conventional hand-held position to a slit lamp-mounted position not only improved its precision but also reduced the variation in intraocular pressure measurements reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-5-1227">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-opth-5-1227">14</xref> when the Goldmann applanation tonometer was compared with the PT100. There was no difference in the variation between the two positions of the PT100 with respect to the Goldmann applanation tonometer in session 1 (11.39 mmHg/11.82 mmHg, slit lamp-mounted/handheld) and in session 2 (8.56 mmHg/8.25 mmHg, slit lamp-mounted/ handheld). Therefore, in a clinic setting, and for research purposes, incorporation of a head-rest or stabilizing the PT100 on a slit lamp will enhance the precision of the instrument. However, outside a clinic setting where intraocular pressure measurements might be obtained by medical personnel or nonmedical personnel, handheld positioning of the PT100 is still the preferred technique because its portability is beneficial.</p><p>The PT100, like other portable tonometers, makes noncontact glaucoma screening a possibility, given that the use of tonometry in glaucoma screening has been an ongoing debate, and appearing to be of limited diagnostic value as a solitary test.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-opth-5-1227">29</xref> However, it is commonly performed in glaucoma screenings in and out of clinic in conjunction with other diagnostic modalities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-opth-5-1227">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-opth-5-1227">31</xref> Screenings may be done by nonmedical and unlicensed personnel. Because noncontact tonometry does not require topical anesthetic or staining drops and the readings are infrequently affected by the operator, it allows screenings to be implemented without the direct supervision of medical doctors, allowing screening staff relative independence in operation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-opth-5-1227">22</xref></p><p>In conclusion, the three techniques are consistent in their measurement of intraocular pressure in the same session and between sessions. The difference in intraocular pressure measurements between techniques did not differ significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) in both sessions, and therefore the three techniques can be used interchangeably for measurement of intraocular pressure in normal young adults.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-opth-5-1227"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>VanVeldhuisen</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name><name><surname>Ederer</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Douglas</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS): 7.
