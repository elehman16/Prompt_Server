At 3-month follow-up, methotrexate monotherapy-inadequate responders were randomised to add-on therapy with sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine or infliximab. In these patients, anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) were also assessed at 12 and 24&#x02005;months. The proportion of antibody-positive patients and relative changes in antibody levels were compared across ACPA specificities and related to therapeutic response and radiographic progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During the 2-year follow-up, the proportion of patients testing positive declined significantly regarding antibodies to cVim, cFib and CEP-1, while anti-CCP antibody occurrence remained stable over time. Turning anti-cVim antibody negative was most common, and anti-cVim antibody seroreversion during the first three&#x02005;months associated with significantly less 2-year radiographic progression compared with patients who remained positive. Median antibody levels of all tested ACPAs declined uniformly during initial methotrexate therapy and following response to add-on therapy, with no significant relation to treatment regimen or radiographic progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The influence of early antirheumatic therapy on ACPA seroreversions was markedly different across specificities, and early disappearance of anti-cVim antibodies associated with better radiological outcome. Thus, these data suggest that the disappearance of particular ACPA reactivities may be beneficial in early RA.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>WHO database at the Karolinska institute: CT20080004; and clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00764725.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ant-CCP</kwd><kwd>Autoantibodies</kwd><kwd>DMARDs (biologic)</kwd><kwd>DMARDs (synthetic)</kwd><kwd>Early Rheumatoid Arthritis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The discovery of autoantibodies recognising citrullinated proteins (ACPA) and the development of serological tests for their detection (most notably the cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) ELISA tests) have improved the ability to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at an early stage and to identify patients at increased risk of a severe disease course.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These clinically very useful tests do not, however, formally address the question of which specific citrullinated autoantigens are targeted.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> More recently, it has been demonstrated by several groups that antibodies towards immunodominant citrullinated epitopes of different candidate autoantigens can be detected by assays using citrullinated peptides derived from these different autoantigens, and that such antibodies have only a limited cross-reactivity with each other<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and are subject to different genetic regulations.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> It has also been demonstrated that antibodies to different citrullinated peptides emerge at different stages and with different dynamics prior to the clinical onset of RA.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The increased knowledge concerning ACPAs has encouraged a number of studies addressing changes in ACPA levels in relation to therapeutic response (reviewed by Modi <italic>et al</italic>).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This topic is relevant not only because of direct clinical applications but because it may also provide indirect evidence for the pathogenicity of different ACPAs. Findings so far, however, have been quite disappointing in both respects. Still, the majority of published studies concern either longstanding disease or observational cohorts, and to our knowledge, longitudinal data regarding different ACPA fine specificities in patients with early RA receiving standardised therapy are still lacking. Hence, we set out to analyse the antibody response to immunodominant citrullinated peptides from three candidate autoantigens, in addition to anti-CCP IgG, in the Swedish Farmacotherapy (SWEFOT) trial, a Swedish randomised 2-year clinical trial in early RA, where patients were treated with methotrexate (MTX) for 3&#x02005;months followed by randomisation of inadequate responders to add-on therapy with either sulfasalazine (SSZ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or infliximab (IFX).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The aims of the study were (i) to characterise changes in the ACPA response during standardised therapy in early RA, both in terms of levels and occurrence, and (ii) to relate changes in ACPA levels and occurrence to clinical outcomes, such as therapeutic response and radiographic joint damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Serum samples from baseline and 3-month follow-up were available from 316 out of the 487 patients (64.9%) enrolled in the SWEFOT trial, a randomised non-blinded study described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In brief, disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-naive patients with RA with symptom duration &#x0003c;1&#x02005;year were treated with MTX for 3&#x02005;months, followed by randomisation to add-on therapy with either SSZ and HCQ or IFX in patients with a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) &#x0003e;3.2 at the 3-month evaluation.

Median SHS progression differed significantly according to number of ACPAs present (p=0.010), but not when analysing patients with &#x02265;1 ACPA only. As anti-CCP IgG was present in 98% of the patients with &#x02265;1 ACPA, we expected anti-CCP antibodies to be the strongest baseline predictor of radiographic progression. Indeed, patients with anti-CCP antibodies at baseline had a larger median 2-year increase in SHS (p=0.001) than anti-CCP antibody-negative patients. This was also seen regarding antibodies to cFib (p=0.022), while the differences did not reach statistical significance regarding anti-CEP-1 and anti-cVim antibodies (p=0.079 and 0.13, respectively). In a multivariate model including all ACPAs and the adjustments described above, only anti-CCP antibody occurrence remained significantly associated with SHS progression &#x0003e;1 (p=0.024), while the ACPA fine specificities did not (p&#x0003e;0.28 for all). The latter was not altered by removing anti-CCP antibody status from the model. No significant correlations were found between relative changes in ACPA levels of any specificity and the 2-year SHS, or 2-year radiographic progression (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this longitudinal investigation of multiple ACPA specificities in early RA, we found substantial heterogeneity in how different ACPAs disappear from the circulation upon antirheumatic therapy. In contrast to anti-CCP IgG, all tested ACPA fine specificities showed declining occurrence over time. Anti-cVim antibodies were the most common to revert from positive to negative, and their early disappearance associated with less radiological progression. Thus, the current study suggests that the disappearance of particular ACPA reactivities may be beneficial in early RA.</p><p>With regards to changes in ACPA levels, we found that levels of all ACPAs declined independent of therapeutic response during the first three&#x02005;months of MTX treatment. Whether this phenomenon is specific for MTX monotherapy, or a result of initial antirheumatic therapy per se<italic>,</italic> or even a consequence of the longitudinal course of disease, cannot be determined as no control group to MTX monotherapy was included. In line with our data, Mikuls <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> found that anti-CCP antibody reduction was associated with early disease, but not with therapeutic response to oral DMARDs. Also, R&#x000f6;nnelid <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> reported significant anti-CCP antibody declines during the first year of early RA, without association to therapeutic response to oral DMARDs.

In a Canadian early arthritis cohort, anti-CCP antibody fluctuations did not relate to clinical outcome.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Differences in study populations and follow-up strategies might underlie these somewhat discrepant results.</p><p>Our finding that anti-cVim antibodies were the most frequent ACPA specificity to disappear from the circulation is in line with previously published data concerning the related anti-Sa antibody in a North American early polyarthritis cohort.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In contrast, two smaller studies found stable occurrence of autoantibodies to vimentin-derived citrullinated antigens over 3 and 7&#x02005;years of early RA, respectively.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>

With regards to prediction of radiological outcome, baseline testing for different ACPA specificities has previously shown little value if the anti-CCP antibody status was known.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> However, there are a number of reports suggesting a more pronounced association between antibodies to vimentin-derived citrullinated antigens and radiological progression.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;27</xref> In addition, anti-MCV antibodies were recently shown to directly mediate bone resorption.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Against this background, it is intriguing to see that our study clearly demonstrates an association between the early disappearance of specific anti-cVim antibodies and less radiological progression, also after adjustments for other known predictors such as baseline joint damage and current smoking.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Interestingly, we observed a trend towards greater decline in ACPA levels among responders to add-on therapy compared with non-responders, regardless of whether therapeutic response was achieved by DMARD combination therapy or addition of a TNF inhibitor. We have no apparent explanation as to why non-responders demonstrate declining ACPA levels during the first three&#x02005;months of MTX monotherapy, but not during non-response to add-on triple therapy or TNF inhibitor. One very speculative explanation to the disparate response associations between therapy regimens (and time points) could be that there are qualitative differences in ACPAs affected by the initial therapy, compared with ACPAs declining later, or in response to intensified therapy. Such qualitative differences could include, for instance, antibody isotype/subclass, glycosylation pattern or avidity,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> which in turn may influence the pathogenic potential of the autoantibodies. The fact that non-responders to MTX, in contrast to add-on therapy non-responders, experienced slight improvements in ESR, CRP and DAS28 may have also influenced these findings.</p><p>We found that the propensity of the different ACPAs to revert from positive to negative was anti-cVim&#x0003e;anti-CEP-1=anti-cFib&#x0003e;anti-CCP despite similar relative changes in antibody levels. Thus, one could argue that differences in cut-off procedures underlie these findings, but the in-house citrullinated peptide ELISA assays used for detecting anti-cVim, anti-cFib and anti-CEP-1 antibodies have the same reference sample and cut-off limit (98th centile among 150 non-RA controls). Moreover, since the commercial anti-CCP ELISA kit uses an even more stringent cut-off, corresponding to the 99th centile among 260 blood donors and the 98th centile among 521 disease controls, this actually strengthens the differences observed between anti-CCP antibodies and the ACPA fine specificities. Thus, anti-CCP antibodies likely act as surrogate markers not only for antibodies against CEP-1, cVim and cFib but also for ACPAs targeting other citrullinated antigens, not investigated here, and that may remain unaltered during pharmacotherapy. At the same time, one cannot rule out the possibility that other ACPA specificities, not investigated by us, would demonstrate even more decrease and seroreversion, in response to therapy, than we could observe for anti-cVim antibodies.</p><p>A weakness of the current study is that a substantial proportion of patients did not have serum samples available from all follow-up visits. There are, however, no differences in clinical characteristics, response patterns or radiological progression between those who had available serum samples and those who had not. Therefore, we believe that this fact is unlikely to have a major influence on the results.</p><p>We conclude that the effect of early antirheumatic therapy on circulating ACPAs is markedly different across different antibody specificities with regards to seroreversion. The association between the disappearance of anti-cVim antibodies after 3&#x02005;months and less radiological progression at 24&#x02005;months should encourage further work to explore the prognostic potential of repeated measurements of different ACPA specificities in early RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web figure</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2014-205698-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e898" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web table</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2014-205698-s2.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e903" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Lena Israelsson for expert technical assistance, and all the participating clinicians, nurses and patients who made the original SWEFOT trial possible.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors made substantial contributions to conception and design, or interpretation of data, drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content and final approval of the version to be published.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was financed by grants from the EU-funded FP7 projects Gums &#x00026; Joints (FP7-Health-2010-261460) and TRIGGER (FP7-Health-2013-306029), the County Council of &#x000d6;sterg&#x000f6;tland, the Reinhold Sund Foundation, the Swedish Society of Medicine, the Swedish Rheumatism Association, the Thelma Zo&#x000e9;gas foundation in Helsingborg and &#x0201c;Stiftelsen f&#x000f6;r R&#x000f6;relsehindrade i Sk&#x000e5;ne&#x0201d;, as well as the Swedish Research Council and the Strategic Foundations of Sweden (SSF).</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> IFP participates in speaker's bureau for UCB Pharma, AbbVie and Pfizer.
