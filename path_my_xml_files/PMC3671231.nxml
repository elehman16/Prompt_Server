We evaluated the effect of micronutrient-fortified yoghurt on the biochemical status of important micronutrients (iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin A) as well as growth indicators among school children in Bogra district of Bangladesh.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a double-masked randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in 4 primary schools, 1010 children from classes 1&#x02013;4 (age 6&#x02013;9 years) were randomly allocated to receive either micronutrient fortified yoghurt (FY, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;501) or non-fortified yoghurt (NFY, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;509). For one year, children were fed with 60 g yoghurt everyday providing 30% RDA for iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A. Anthropometric measurements and blood/urine samples were collected at base-, mid- and end-line. All children (FY, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;278, NFY, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;293) consenting for the end-line blood sample were included in the present analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both groups were comparable at baseline for socio-economic status variables, micronutrient status markers and anthropometry measures. Compliance was similar in both the groups. At baseline 53.4% of the population was anemic; 2.1% was iron deficient (ferritin &#x0003c;15.0 &#x003bc;g/L and TfR&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;8.3 mg/L). Children in the FY group showed improvement in Hb (mean difference: 1.5; 95% CI: 0.4-2.5; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006) as compared to NFY group. Retinol binding protein (mean diff: 0.05; 95% CI: 0.002-0.09; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04) and iodine levels (mean difference: 39.87; 95% CI: 20.39-59.35; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) decreased between base and end-line but the decrease was significantly less in the FY group. Compared to NFY, the FY group had better height gain velocity (mean diff: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.05-0.60; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02) and height-for-age z-scores (mean diff: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.02-0.33; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03). There was no difference in weight gain velocity, weight-for-age z-scores or Body Mass Index z-scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the absence of iron deficiency at baseline the impact on iron status would not be expected to be observed and hence cannot be evaluated. Improved Hb concentrations in the absence of a change in iron status suggest improved utilization of iron possibly due to vitamin A and zinc availability. Fortification improved height gain without affecting weight gain.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrial.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00980733?term=NCT0980733&#x00026;rank=1">NCT00980733</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Micronutrient fortification</kwd><kwd>Retinol binding protein</kwd><kwd>Iodine</kwd><kwd>Bangladesh</kwd><kwd>Zinc</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Micronutrient malnutrition especially of iron, zinc, vitamin A and iodine is recognized as an important public health problem affecting more than 2 billion people worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Left untreated, even sub-clinical micronutrient malnutrition has significant negative consequences on health and economic development. As many as a third of the world&#x02019;s population do not meet their physical and intellectual potential because of clinical and sub-clinical vitamin and mineral deficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Concern for micronutrient deficiency is particularly high among children as there is an increased nutritional demand among them due to growth spurts and high physical activity. The full genetic potential of the child for physical growth and mental development may be compromised due to sub clinical deficiencies of micronutrients, making them more vulnerable to develop frequent and more severe common day-to-day infections thus triggering a vicious cycle of under nutrition and recurrent infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Almost two-thirds of the deaths of children around the world are directly or indirectly associated with nutritional deficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Rural Bangladeshi populations, particularly children, are also at high risk of micronutrient deficiencies particularly vitamin A, iron, iodine and zinc, due to the consumption of a predominantly rice-based diet with few animal-source foods, iodine/zinc deficient soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], lack of access to safe drinking water, inadequate or nonexistent sanitation facilities and presence of infectious diseases and/or parasitic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In Bangladesh, approximately 40 percent of children (6&#x02013;15 years aged) have anemia with 6.9 percent of them having iron deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thirty four percent of Bangladeshi children are iodine deficient with another 21.7 percent suffer from vitamin A deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A survey conducted in 2004&#x02013;2005 showed that the prevalence of goiter among children 6 to 12 years old was 6.2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Supplementation based programs had limited success for iron deficiency, therefore in order to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies, WHO has recognized that future strategies should focus on identifying methods to deliver essential micronutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin A, and iodine using suitable food vehicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There is increasing body of evidence suggesting micronutrient interventions might benefit the health and development of school age children and that multiple micronutrients might be more effective than single micronutrient. Fortifying foods with essential micronutrients is, thus a practical and cost effective strategy to improve nutrition status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This has also been shown by a systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] for impact of fortification on improvement in micronutrient status and reduction in anemia among school children.</p><p>It is well recognized that given varied food preferences and consumption, multiple vehicles will need to be used in a practical community setup. Typically, locally produced and commonly consumed foods are the best candidates. In Bangladesh, yoghurt is a readily available and consumed food. Based on this premise, Grameen in Bangladesh in collaboration with social responsibility division of Dannon established non-profit social sector factory to produce yoghurt at low cost for local consumption in Bogra, Bangladesh. Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) used this opportunity to utilize locally produced yoghurt as a vehicle for delivery of 4 important micronutrients and thus the test intervention of this trial with 30% RDA of iron, zinc, vitamin A and iodine was developed.</p><p>In order to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention, we undertook a community-based, doubled-masked randomized trial in Bogra district, wherein children (aged 6&#x02013;9 years) fed with micronutrient fortified yoghurt (30% RDA of iron, zinc, vitamin A and iodine) were compared to children fed with non-fortified yoghurt for one year on micronutrient status indicators (iron, zinc, vitamin A and iodine) and physical growth. This was based on the hypothesis that consumption of micronutrient fortified yoghurt by the school children over a period of one year would have a positive impact on their micronutrient status markers and physical growth indicators.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population and setting</title><p>The study was conducted between June 2008 and March 2010 in primary schools of Gabtali town of Bogra district in the Rajshahi Division, Northern Bangladesh. We selected schools in Gabtali town because of its close proximity to a yoghurt factory. Six primary schools from Bogra district were selected for the study. Of these 2 schools were assigned as pure control (no yoghurt was provided to the children and data from these two schools have not been used in the present analysis). The remaining four primary schools were randomly selected as yoghurt schools (fortified yoghurt and non fortified yoghurt). The study area had similar geographical characteristics to the rest of the plain lands in Bangladesh, including high population density, fertile agricultural land, low risk of malaria and minimal hookworm infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The human research and ethical review committees at the Johns Hopkins University, USA, Shaheed Zia-ur Rahman Medical College, Bangladesh and National Research Council of Bangladesh approved the study protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Pretrial sample size estimation (based on assumptions from previous data), 400 children were planned to be enrolled and this sample size was estimated to, with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 90%, provide ability to detect a change in height by 2.56 cm and weight by 930 g over the baseline weight and height measurements; detect a change in mean hemoglobin (Hb) level by 2.6 g/L over the baseline Hb; detect reduction in iron deficiency anemia by 38% and zinc deficiency by 37%. The sample size was provided for 5% attrition. However, due to practical reasons we had to enroll every child in class in yoghurt groups, for which we amended the protocol and thereby enrolled 500 children per group. This worked well as the attrition due to refusal for blood sampling was also higher than anticipated 5%.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent and enrollment</title><p>Before the start of the study, the purpose and details of the study was explained in a meeting to all concerned parents and school officials. The possible risks and benefits associated were read out and explained to the parents in their local language, and informed written consent sought from the parents of each of the selected children prior to the enrollment in the study. For practical reasons, all the children of the class 1&#x02013;4 were invited to take part in the study. The inclusion criteria for enrollment into the study was children aged 6 to 9 years attending selected schools, who were likely to remain in the same school and parents providing consent. Children with severe malnutrition needing nutritional rehabilitation or chronic/severe illness requiring hospitalization or special treatment were excluded and referred for treatment. After obtaining consent from parents and assent from children, children were enrolled and scheduled to visit clinics for baseline assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Masking and randomization</title><p>Children were randomized by their enrollment serial number into either the micronutrient fortified yoghurt (FY) group or non-fortified yoghurt (NFY) group that would receive identical yoghurt with no added micronutrients. Using in-house computer software, a random sequence of group codes with a permuted block length of 6 was generated to randomly allocate the individual child to one of the two yoghurt groups (NFY group or FY group). Group codes from 1 to 6 were used to identify the fortified and non-fortified yoghurt. The codes of the groups were not known to the investigators, field team, teachers, children or anyone involved in the study during the field implementation. Cups were prepared and labeled with group codes a day in advance at a factory in Bogra. The yoghurt for the two intervention groups was identical in packaging, appearance, taste and smell. Children in both the groups were followed up for 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Yoghurt distribution and follow-up</title><p>Every day in the morning, the yoghurt cups were collected from the factory and the delivery containers were insulated with ice packs to maintain the temperature and quality of the yoghurt during transportation and delivery. The yoghurt delivery team distributed the yoghurt in the class by code allocated to the child during randomization. The assistant verified the child&#x02019;s identity (e.g. child&#x02019;s name, name of father and mother). Children allocated to the yoghurt groups received one cup of the yoghurt (60 g) daily during the lunch break of the school for one year. The feeding session was strictly monitored and supervised by the field workers and class teachers and the compliance to the intervention was recorded in compliance record forms. A separate list was prepared for children who were absent from school and their respective yoghurt cups were delivered at home in the afternoon. In case of absenteeism due to sickness, morbidity information of the child was recorded in a data record sheet. During holidays, yoghurt was distributed at pre-scheduled points near the child&#x02019;s home.</p><p>Children were informed beforehand about their respective delivery points. For children who did not turn up at these locations, yoghurt was taken to their homes.

A non-fasting venous blood sample (~5 mL) was drawn by a trained technician using trace element-free syringes. From this sample, 2 mL of blood was immediately transferred into an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vial to obtain a detailed hemogram and the rest was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes. Plasma was separated within 15 minutes of blood collection, and aliquots were transferred into 2 trace element-free micro-centrifuge tubes and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for further micronutrient analysis. For all blood sample collection procedures, trace element-free tubes and pipettes were used and samples were protected against sunlight. Casual urine samples were collected in 10 mL capped polypropylene tubes and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for later urinary iodine analysis.

Both the fortified and non-fortified groups were comparable for socio-economic variables (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), micronutrient status and anthropometry (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) at baseline. The mean age of the participants was 7.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5 years and 52.4% were girls. The mean Hb level was 114.7 g/L while mean red cell distribution width was 14.4% (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The total prevalence of anemia was 53.4% (Hb&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;=115.0 g/L) and was not significantly different between boys and girls (Chi-square test, P&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). At baseline 2.1% children were iron deficient (ferritin &#x0003c;15.0 &#x003bc;g/L and TfR&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;8.3 mg/L) and this was not affected, even if the children with infection were removed from the analysis. The mean concentration of serum retinol binding protein (RBP) was 1.24&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.29 &#x003bc;mol/L. Children with RBP concentration &#x0003c;0.7 &#x003bc;mol/L (vitamin A deficiency) and between 0.7-1.05 &#x003bc;mol/L (marginal vitamin A deficiency) was 1.1% and 23.6%, respectively. The mean urinary iodine level was 171.6 &#x003bc;g/dL and the proportion of children &#x0003c;100 &#x003bc;g/dL was 27.6%. The zinc status was less than optimal; the mean plasma zinc concentration was 9.17 &#x003bc;mol/L and 70% children had zinc levels &#x0003c;9.945 &#x003bc;mol<bold>/</bold>L. The concentrations of plasma ferritin and RBP of those school children with elevated acute phase proteins (CRP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5 mg/L and/or AGP &#x0003e;1 g/L) compared to those with normal concentrations at the time of the baseline blood sampling were different. Those in the fortified yoghurt and non-fortified yoghurt group had significantly higher ferritin concentrations (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006 and 0.02 respectively) and significantly lower RBP concentrations (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.13 and p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00, respectively) when the acute phase proteins were elevated (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S5). Other blood parameters were not affected by the presence of elevated acute phase proteins. However the results in the subgroup with no inflammation (89.1% of the sample) were not different from overall results. The prevalence of stunting, underweight and BMIZ scores -&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2 Z were 22.2%, 42.2% and 31.4% respectively. None of these prevalence were significantly different between boys and girls (Chi-square test, P&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table

The compliance of the children for intervention in both the groups was ~97.0 percent and was similar in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect on micronutrient status and micronutrient deficiency prevalence</title><p>Consumption of fortified yoghurt did not affect the iron status indicators and body iron stores. However, children in the FY-group showed improvement in Hb levels (0.8 g/L; mean difference: 1.5; 95% CI: 0.4-2.5; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006) compared to NFY-group (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Although concentrations of both RBP and iodine went down from baseline, compared to the NFY group, the RBP and iodine concentrations were significantly better in the children receiving fortified yoghurt, with estimated effect sizes of 0.05 &#x003bc;mol/L (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04) and 39.87 &#x003bc;g/dL (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.001) respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Severe-iodine deficiency was present in only 5.1 percent of children. Zinc status improved in the fortified group but the difference in mean zinc levels between the two groups was not statistically significant. Although mean zinc concentrations improved, they were still below the accepted cutoff for the age group at end-line (9.94 &#x003bc;mol/L). Furthermore, consumption of micronutrient fortified yoghurt reduced the worsening of vitamin A and iodine status that was observed in control group there by showing a significant difference in RBP levels and urinary iodine excretion. The concentrations of plasma ferritin and RBP of those school children with elevated acute phase proteins (CRP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5 mg/L and/or AGP &#x0003e;1 g/L) compared to those with normal concentrations at the time of the end-line blood sampling were different (Fortified Yoghurt p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001 Non Fortified Yoghurt p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S6). Other blood parameters were not affected by the presence of elevated acute phase proteins.

fortified yoghurt (delivering 30% RDA of zinc, iron, iodine and vitamin A) over a period of 1 year could improve the micronutrient status and physical growth of school children. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of a study that used yoghurt as a vehicle for delivery of micronutrients and evaluated the impact among school children in a double-blind RCT. Although consumption of fortified yoghurt did not result in improvement in iron status indicators, it did show a significant improvement in Hb, and an impact of iodine status indicated by significantly lower decline urinary iodine levels when compared to the NFY group. One year of fortification resulted in an improvement in linear growth with a statistically significant change in height velocity and HAZ. A systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], evaluated the effect of the multi-micronutrient (MMN) fortification of foods compared to unfortified foods on the micronutrient status of school children and measured a statistically significant improvement in micronutrient status in the intervention group compared to the control group, taking baseline values into account. Some studies have reported positive effects on growth but the overall effects on these outcomes are equivocal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The response to fortification in the present study showed an improvement in Hb concentrations, even though no iron deficiency was present at baseline, and although RBP and iodine concentrations fell in both groups, they were significantly higher in the FY groups. A decline in the intervention group may be suggesting 30% RDA of selected micronutrients in the fortified yoghurt may not have been adequate to reverse decline in vitamin A and iodine concentrations in this population of school children.</p><p>In the present study, iron deficiency was not observed i.e. ferritin, TfR and estimated body iron stores were in normal range. Consistent with our finding, Winichagoon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] did not find an effect on iron status indicators after adding 5 g of elemental iron via multi-micronutrient (MMN) powder to the school lunches of Thai children. It has been demonstrated that the maximal inhibitory effect of calcium on iron absorption is reached at a level of ~300 mg of calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The possibility of the calcium content having been responsible for lack of effect on iron status markers is very unlikely as the calcium content of yoghurt was less than 100 mg. However cannot be totally ruled out given the study design and fairly adequate iron status of the population and therefore a possibility of reduced absorption and potential for minor impact.</p><p>In this study, the prevalence of elevated plasma CRP and AGP was low; indicating the presence of ongoing or recent acute inflammation in the study population was low, however that may not rule out some chronic infections but then their presence would have caused anemia rather than contrary. Prevalence of hemoglobinopathy, another possible cause for high ferritin concentrations in the presence of anemia, needs consideration. Anemia was present in a little more than half of the children in both the groups at baseline with a mean Hb concentration of 114.7 g/L. But levels of Hb in this population and distribution of Hb do not favor hemoglobinopathy as a cause of high ferritin. In fact in population with much higher levels of anemia in Delhi contribution of hemoglobinopathy to levels of ferritin has not been demonstrated (Unpublished-data). There was a significant difference in Hb levels of 1.5 g/L between FY and NFY groups after one year of fortification. A similar effect on Hb status was recently reported among Kenyan subjects with HIV infection in whom MMN supplementation resulted in increased Hb concentrations only among those without signs of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although there are studies which found significant effects of multiple micronutrient fortification on concentrations of Hb, TfR, ferritin and on body iron stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], in the present study, the difference in Hb between the FY and NFY groups, despite the lack of difference in the iron status markers suggest better utilization of iron, which may have been caused by bio-available zinc and vitamin A. Vitamin A supplementation has been shown to increase erythropoietin (EPO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, has been reported to regulate the EPO gene, which, in turn enhances EPO production <italic>in vitro</italic> in an animal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Providing vitamin A in the fortified yoghurt may have increased the mobilization of iron from storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], resulting in an improvement in Hb concentration, although the mechanism of this phenomenon is still to be verified.</p><p>At baseline, some of the children were mild to moderately deficient in iodine. The population where the study was conducted were found to consume plain salt more than the iodized salt, although, the national salt iodization program of 1989 in Bangladesh is ongoing on. In our study, iodine and RBP decreased in both the groups between base- and end-line, but the decrease was significantly less in FY group, suggesting compliance to and success of intervention in delivering nutrients. Similarly, all five studies included in the systematic review also found a beneficial effect of MMN fortification on urinary iodine excretion levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Zinc status was less than the optimum at the baseline. Zinc status improved but the differences in mean zinc levels were not statistically significant and concentrations were still below the accepted cutoff for the age group at end-line (9.94 &#x003bc;mol/L). A review of six studies investigated the effect of MMNs (including zinc) in fortified food compared to unfortified food on zinc status, only two studies found a significant beneficial effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. While other studies, did not find any effect on biochemical zinc status or deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Although dairy products have shown to increase zinc absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], the sub-optimum effect of the zinc in the fortified yoghurt on zinc status could be due to the level of zinc added being too low, to a possible negative interaction between iron and zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] or because plasma zinc may not be a good marker of zinc status. Indeed, recent studies have shown that iron inhibits zinc absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and vice versa. However, iron has little effect on zinc absorption when zinc-iron ratios are 1:1, which is similar to the ratio in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Therefore, the interaction of iron and zinc from the fortified yoghurt should be further investigated and the dosage of zinc should be re-evaluated. Further, the beneficial effects on observed height gain, which are commonly attributable to zinc intake rather than iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] would argue for an improvement in zinc status which plasma zinc was not able to reflect.</p><p>One year of fortification resulted in an improvement in linear growth with a statistically significant change in height velocity and height for age Z- scores, but not on weight and BMIZ which was likely attributed to the synergetic effects of the micronutrients including the presence of zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. A meta-analysis on the effects of micronutrients on growth in children up to 18 years of age found that interventions with iron or vitamin A alone did not have an effect on either height or weight gain, whereas MMN interventions, 80% of which included vitamin A, iron, and zinc, significantly improved linear growth and also had a small (not statistically significant) positive effect on weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. These findings would suggest that providing specific micronutrients results in a better height gain, and reversal of growth faltering over and above of macronutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A systematic review that tested the impact of multiple micronutrients provided via fortification on the micronutrient status, growth, health, and cognitive development of school children showed mixed results i.e. no effect to a positive effect on growth. Two of seven studies found a significant beneficial effect on height gain, with mean differences of about 0.6 to 1.0 cm in height increments between the groups after 6 or 14 months of intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Finally, improvement in Hb levels, and decline in the excretion of urinary iodine levels and improvement in growth points towards a global improvement in child&#x02019;s health - a functional endpoint of multiple metabolic processes. This global improvement could be due to a combination of effects of individual constituents of the intervention and/or synergistic effects among the components.</p><sec><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>The results of the study need to be interpreted with consideration to the initial micronutrient status of the population. The children in this study did not have severe anemia or iron deficiency at baseline. Given the design of the study we cannot attribute effects to a specific component but only describe the collective impact of the specific micronutrients tested as the experimental intervention in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>At baseline although 50% children had mild anemia, but there was no iron deficiency in the children. The children had normal mean RBP and iodine concentrations; however mean zinc concentrations were just below the accepted cutoff for the age group. Following 12 months of supplementation fortification, there was no improvement in iron status indicators; however, a significant improvement in hemoglobin levels was observed. Although plasma concentrations of iodine and RBP in both yoghurt groups fell over the 12 month period, concentrations of these in the FY decreased significantly less. One year of fortification resulted in an improvement in linear growth with a statistically significant change in height gain among the children of the FY group.</p><p>Future studies need to investigate a number of operational issues including the feasibility of distributing the product through different channels such as schools (as used in this study), and also through the private sector, using a social marketing approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>RBP: Retinol binding protein; CRP: C-reactive protein; IDA: Iron deficiency anemia; MMN: Multi micronutrient; TfR: Transferrin receptor; NFY: Non fortified yoghurt; FY: fortified yoghurt; SES: Socio economic Status; Hb: Hemoglobin; WAZ: Weight for age z-scores; BMIZ: Body mass index z-scores; HAZ: Height for age Z-scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>GAIN- Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition funded the study and Grameen Danone Foods Ltd.
