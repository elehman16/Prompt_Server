Subjects were administered a single dose of etamicastat 200mg following either a standard high-fat and high-calorie content meal (test) or 10 hours of fasting (reference). The statistical method for testing the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic parameters of interest was based upon the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the test/reference geometric mean ratio (GMR). The parameters of interest were maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC<sub>last</sub>), and AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>). Bioequivalence was assumed when the 90% CI fell within the recommended acceptance interval (80, 125).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Etamicastat C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub>, and AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub> were 229 ng/mL, 1856 &#x02022; h/mL, and 2238 ng &#x02022; h/mL, respectively, following etamicastat in the fasting, and 166 ng/mL, 1737 ng &#x02022; h/mL, and 2119 ng &#x02022; h/mL, respectively, following etamicastat in the fed condition. Etamicastat test/reference GMR was 72.27% (90% CI 64.98, 80.38) for C<sub>max</sub>, 93.59% (90% CI 89.28, 98.11) for AUC<sub>last</sub>, and 96.47% (90% CI 91.67, 101.53) for AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>. Time to C<sub>max</sub> was prolonged by the presence of food (p &#x0003c; 0.001). The C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub>, and AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub> values of the inactive metabolite BIA 5-961 were 275 ng/mL, 1827 ng &#x02022; h/mL, and 2009 ng &#x02022; h/mL, respectively, in the fasting, and 172 ng/mL, 1450 ng &#x02022; h/mL, and 1677 ng &#x02022; h/mL, respectively, in the fed condition. BIA 5-961 test/reference GMR was 62.42% (90% CI 56.77, 68.63) for C<sub>max</sub>, 79.41% (90% CI 56.77, 68.63) for AUC<sub>last</sub>, and 83.47% (90% CI 76.62, 90.93) for AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>. A total of six mild to moderate unspecific adverse events were reported by four subjects. There was no clinically significant abnormality in laboratory assessments.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Etamicastat was well tolerated. The C<sub>max</sub> of etamicastat decreased 28% following oral administration of etamicastat in the presence of food, while AUC remained within the pre-defined acceptance interval. The delay in absorption and decrease in peak exposure of etamicastat is not clinically significant, and therefore etamicastat could be administered without regard to meals.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Adis Data Information BV 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Activation of the sympathetic nervous system is an important feature in hypertension and congestive heart failure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] Inhibition of sympathetic nerve function with adrenoceptor antagonists appeared to be a promising approach, but a significant proportion of patients do not tolerate the immediate hemodynamic deterioration that accompanies &#x003b2;-adrenoceptor antagonist (&#x003b2;-blocker) treatment, particularly in heart failure patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] An alternative approach for directly modulating sympathetic nerve function is to reduce the biosynthesis of noradrenaline via inhibition of dopamine-&#x003b2;-hydroxylase (D&#x003b2;H).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] D&#x003b2;H is a copper II ascorbate-dependent mono-oxygenase that catalyses the conversion of dopamine into noradrenaline in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway. The inhibition of D&#x003b2;H has several putative advantages over adrenoceptor blockade by conventional adrenoceptor antagonists (pure &#x003b2;-blockers or mixed &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-blockers), such as gradual sympathetic modulation as opposed to abrupt inhibition, and causing increased availability of dopamine, which can improve renal function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]</p><p>Several D&#x003b2;H inhibitors have been described. Early first- and second-generation examples, such as disulfiram[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and diethyldithiocarbamate[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or fusaric acid[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and aromatic or alkyl thioureas,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] were found to be of low potency, exhibited poor selectivity for D&#x003b2;H, and caused toxic side effects. A third-generation D&#x003b2;H inhibitor (nepicastat [RS-25560-197])[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] was found to have much greater potency and was developed to early clinical trials. Although devoid of some of the problems associated with first- and second-generation D&#x003b2;H inhibitors, nepicastat was found to cross the blood-brain barrier, and was thereby able to cause undesired and potentially significant CNS-related adverse events. Therefore, to date, there remains an unmet clinical need for a potent, safe, and peripherally selective D&#x003b2;H inhibitor, which could be used for the treatment of certain cardiovascular disorders without significant adverse events.</p><p>Etamicastat [BIA 5-453; (R)-5-(2-aminoethyl)-1-(6,8-difluorochroman-3-yl)-1,3-dihydroimidazole-2-thione hydrochloride; molecular formula C14H16ClF2N3OS] was designed by BIAL-Portela &#x00026; Co., S. Mamede do Coronado, Portugal, to act as a reversible inhibitor of peripheral D&#x003b2;H.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] In contrast to that found in the peripheral tissues, etamicastat does not affect dopamine or noradrenaline levels in the brain,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] which is unique among D&#x003b2;H inhibitors previously tested for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.</p><p>Etamicastat was tested in animal models predictive of efficacy in cardiovascular disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] Etamicastat reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats with no changes in normotensive Wistar-Kyotos rats.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] Etamicastat did not affect heart rate in spontaneously hypertensive or Wistar-Kyotos rats. Etamicastat increased survival rates in male cardiomyopathic hamsters (Bio TO-2 dilated strain) with advanced congestive heart failure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] In toxicologic studies, the no observed adverse effect level was 5 mg/kg/day in dogs, 20 mg/kg/day in Cynomolgus monkeys, and 30 mg/kg/day in rats and mice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]</p><p>The metabolism of etamicastat appears to be species dependent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] In the rat, N-acetylation appears to be the major metabolic pathway leading to the formation of BIA 5-961, which is inactive. All other metabolites were found to occur in minor amounts and correspond to oxidative deaminated (BIA 5-965), C-oxidated (BIA 5-998), and N-oxidated (BIA 5-1016) derivatives of etamicastat. In an entry-into-man study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] in healthy subjects administered with single oral doses of etamicastat ranging from 2 to 1200 mg, maximum plasma etamicastat concentrations occurred at 1&#x02013;3 hours post-dose. Elimination was biphasic, characterized by a first short early elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>), followed by a longer elimination phase of 16&#x02013;20 hours for etamicastat doses of &#x02265;100 mg. Etamicastat underwent N-acetylation to its inactive metabolite BIA 5-961. The other putative metabolites did not appear in plasma or urine. In a subsequent study in healthy subjects,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] participants received once-daily doses of placebo or etamicastat 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 600 mg for 10 days. Etamicastat and BIA 5-961 maximum concentrations were achieved at 1&#x02013;3 and 2&#x02013;4 hours, respectively, after dosing. The t<sub>1/2</sub> values ranged from 18.1 to 25.7 hours for etamicastat and from 6.7 to 22.5 hours for BIA 5-961. Both etamicastat and BIA 5-961 showed linear pharmacokinetics. The extent of systemic exposure to etamicastat and BIA 5-961 increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner, and steady-state plasma concentrations were attained up to 9 days of dosing. Approximately 40% of the etamicastat dose was recovered in urine in the form of etamicastat and BIA 5-961.</p><p>N-Acetyltransferase (NAT) is one of the major hepatic phase II enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Humans express two functional NAT isoforms &#x02014; NAT1 and NAT2.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] Results from previous entry-into-man studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] showed that the NAT2 phenotype (rapid or slow N-acetylating ability) is a major source of interindividual variability in etamicastat pharmacokinetics. For NAT1, eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed (190 c &#x0003e; t, 445 g &#x0003e; a, 459 g &#x0003e; a, 559 c &#x0003e; t, 560 g &#x0003e; a, 640 t &#x0003e; g, 1088 t &#x0003e; a, and 1095 c &#x0003e; a) and the corresponding genotypes were defined according to the literature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] Subjects were classified NAT1 rapid (fast) acetylators if they carried the NAT1*;10 (except NAT1*;10/*;14) or NAT1*;11 alleles, normal acetylators if they carried the NAT1*;4 or NAT1*;3 alleles or the NAT1*;10/*;14 genotype, and poor (slow) acetylators if they carried the NAT1*;14 (except NAT1*;10/*;14) or NAT1*;17 alleles. For NAT2, four coding SNPs were analyzed (191 g &#x0003e; a, 341 t &#x0003e; c, 590 g &#x0003e; a, and 857 g &#x0003e; a) and the corresponding genotypes were defined according to the literature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] Subjects were classified NAT2 rapid acetylators if they carried the NAT2*;4/*;4 allele, or the NAT2*;4/*;5, NAT2*;4/*;6 or NAT2*;4/*;7 genotype, and poor acetylators if they carried the NAT2*;5/*;5, NAT2*;6/*;6 or NAT2*;7/*;7 alleles, or the NAT2*;5/*;6, NAT2*;5/*;7 or NAT2*;6/*;7 genotype. The NAT2*;4 allele encodes for a fully active enzyme and is considered the wild-type (rapid acetylator) allele. Although the NAT1 phenotype showed no relevant effect on etamicastat pharmacokinetics, the results of previous entry-into-man studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] clearly demonstrated that the NAT2 phenotype had a marked effect on systemic exposure to etamicastat and BIA 5-961. The extent of systemic exposure to etamicastat in NAT2 poor acetylators was approximately twice that observed in rapid acetylators. Consistent with this finding, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of the acetylated metabolite BIA 5-961 was markedly higher in NAT2 rapid acetylators compared with poor acetylators, confirming the involvement of NAT2 in the biotransformation of etamicastat into BIA 5-961.</p><p>Here, the results of an exploratory study aiming to investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of a single 200 mg oral dose of etamicastat in healthy subjects are described.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a single-center (Biotrial SA, Rennes, France), open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study in 12 healthy male subjects.

During each study period, the volunteers randomly received a single 200 mg oral dose of etamicastat following either a standard high-fat and high-calorie content breakfast or 10 hours of fasting.</p><p>During each treatment period, eligible subjects were admitted to the research facilities on the day (day 0) prior to receiving the dose of study medication for assessment of vital signs, medical history, and physical examination, in addition to screen tests for hematology, plasma biochemistry, and drug and alcohol abuse. At the beginning of the first treatment period, the subjects had a review of the selection criteria and a randomization number was assigned. The randomization number defined the treatment sequence to which each subject was allocated. On the morning of day 1, etamicastat was administered following a standard high-fat and high-calorie meal in one treatment period, or following at least 10 hours of fasting in another treatment period. Participants remained confined in the research facilities from admission (day 0) until at least 72 hours (day 4, discharge) after dosing. Following the 72 hours post-dose procedures, participants were discharged, and returned for the next treatment period or a follow-up visit. Following administration of etamicastat (four capsules, 50 mg) with 240 mL of water, in fasting or fed conditions, a lunch, a snack, and a dinner were provided at respectively 4, 8, and 12 hours post-dose.

For such purpose, the etamicastat pharmacokinetic parameters of interest (AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub>) were compared using ANOVA. The test procedure was analogous to equivalence testing. ANOVA was used to test for differences between test (fed condition) and reference (fasting condition) for AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> of etamicastat.

Two TEAEs (headache and vagal reaction) were reported during the fasting period, and four TEAEs during the fed period (abdominal pain, asthenia, headache, and intercostal pain). All TEAEs were mild to moderate in intensity. There were no serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events. No clinically relevant abnormalities were observed in vital signs, ECG, or laboratory safety tests during the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The primary objective of the study was to investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of etamicastat. C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub>, and AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub> of etamicastat were defined as the main parameters for the assessment of bioavailability and bioequivalence of etamicastat administered in fasting and fed conditions, which is in agreement with current regulatory guidelines.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] The 90% CI for the fed/fasting etamicastat C<sub>max</sub> GMR are not contained within the acceptance interval (80, 125)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and, therefore, it can be concluded that the rate of systemic exposure to etamicastat does not fit the claim of bioequivalence between administration in fasting and fed conditions. Etamicastat C<sub>max</sub> significantly decreased by 28% and t<sub>max</sub> significantly increased, but AUC<sub>last</sub> and AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub> remained within the acceptance interval, showing that the extent of systemic exposure to etamicastat was not affected by the delay in absorption of etamicastat in the presence of food. Although a significant decrease in C<sub>max</sub> is not expected to have an impact on the tolerability of a drug, it could have a hypothetical impact on efficacy. However, the inhibition of D&#x003b2;H by D&#x003b2;H blockers provides gradual sympathetic modulation as opposed to abrupt inhibition;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] therefore, a delay in absorption and corresponding decrease in peak exposure without a relevant change in the extent of exposure (AUC) is not expected to be clinically significant.</p><p>Etamicastat appeared to be metabolized to its acetylated metabolite BIA 5-961, which is in agreement with other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] Systemic exposure to the metabolite BIA 5-961 decreased as a result of food. However, this effect is not expected to have an impact on etamicastat tolerability or efficacy since the metabolite is inactive.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic results of the current study are consistent with those of the 200 mg dose group of an entry-into-man study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] in healthy subjects administered with single oral doses of etamicastat ranging from 2 to 1200 mg in fasting conditions. In the earlier study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] arithmetic mean etamicastat C<sub>max</sub> was 202 ng/mL, AUC<sub>last</sub> was 2026 ng &#x000b7; h/mL, AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub> was 2230 ng &#x000b7; h/mL, and t<sub>1/2</sub> was 19.8 hours following a 200 mg single dose in a fasting condition; these results are close to those reported in the fasting period of the current study (229 ng/mL, 1856 ng &#x000b7; h/mL, 2238 ng &#x000b7; h/mL, and 19.9 hours, respectively).</p><p>The results of the current study show a large interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters of interest in both analytes (etamicastat and its metabolite) and in both study periods. This interindividual variability is consistent with that reported in previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and is likely to be as a result of differences in NAT2 genotype, leading to different acetylating profiles. The clinical consequence is that NAT2 genotyping may be required for an adequate dosage definition of etamicastat in patients. Etamicastat was well tolerated in both study periods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This exploratory study involving administration of etamicastat to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that etamicastat C<sub>max</sub> was decreased 28%, while AUC remained unchanged. This decrease in peak exposure is not clinically significant, and therefore etamicastat can be taken with or without meals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was financially supported by BIAL-Portela &#x00026; Co., SA, S.
