The use of small individual doses reduces late morbidity. Continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiation therapy (CHART), which reduces overall treatment from 6-7 weeks to 12 days and gives 36 small fractions, has now been tested in multicentre randomised controlled clinical trials. The trial in non-small-cell lung cancer included 563 patients and showed improvement in survival; 30% of the CHART patients were alive at 2 years compared with 20% in the control group (P = 0.006). In the 918 head and neck cases, there was only a small, non-significant improvement in the disease-free interval. In this interim analysis there was a trend for those with more advanced disease (T3 and T4) to show advantage; this will be subject to further analysis when the data are more mature. The early mucosal reactions appeared sooner and were more troublesome with CHART, however they quickly settled; so far no difference in long-term morbidity has emerged. These results support the hypothesis that tumour cell repopulation can occur during a conventional course of radiotherapy and be a cause of treatment failure.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00040-0005.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1455" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00040-0006.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1456" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00040-0007.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1457" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00040-0008.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1458" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00040-0009.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1459" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00040-0010.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1460" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00040-0011.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1461" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00040-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1462" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
