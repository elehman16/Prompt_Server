Under all aseptic precautions, L3&#x02013;L4 space was pierced with 25-gauge Quincke spinal needle by midline approach, and the study drug was deposited intrathecally.

Hypotension defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure by more than 30% from baseline or &#x0003c;80 mmHg was treated with incremental intravenous doses of ephedrine 6 mg and further intravenous fluid as required. Bradycardia defined as heart rate &#x0003c;50 beats/min was treated with intravenous atropine 0.6 mg. Sensory testing was assessed by loss of temperature discrimination to alcohol solution for onset and dermatomal levels tested every 2 min until the highest level had stabilized for four consecutive tests. Data regarding the time to reach highest dermatomal level of sensory blockade from the time of injection were collected.</p><p>After the surgery, patients will be shifted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where they remained until there is complete recovery of sensory and motor blockade.
