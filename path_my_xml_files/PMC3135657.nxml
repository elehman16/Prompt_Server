This study intends to evaluate the effects of Li-Fu formula on cardiac hypertrophy induced by hypercholesterolemia diet. Twenty-four male Golden Syrian hamsters were randomly divided into control, cholesterol and Li-Fu formula groups and fed with different experimental diets for 2 months. Histopathological analysis and western blotting were performed to measure the myocardial architecture, and various cardiac hypertrophy-associated molecules in the excised left ventricle from hamsters. The ratios of whole heart weight/body weight (BW) and left ventricle weight/BW were significantly higher in the cholesterol group but significantly lower in the Li-Fu formula group. The protein levels of both atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide were significantly increased in the cholesterol group but significantly reduced in the Li-Fu formula group. Additionally, significantly increased interleukin-6, STAT3, MEK5, p-ERK5 and non-cardiomyocyte proliferate signal molecules such as p-MEK and p-ERK, were detected in the cholesterol group but significantly reduced in the Li-Fu formula group. Notably, no significant variations of inflammatory signaling molecules, including p-P38 and p-JNK, were detected in all groups. Our experimental results demonstrated the significant reductions of cardiac hypertrophy and related eccentric hypertrophy signaling, non-cardiomyocyte proliferate signaling in the excised left ventricle of hamsters from the Li-Fu formula. We suggested the protective effects of Li-Fu formula on cardiac hypertrophy that may be useful in prevention or treatment of hypertrophy-associated cardiovascular diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Hypercholesterol diets are the major cause of cardiac hypertrophy [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cardiac hypertrophy is recognized as a cardiac adaptive response to any stress that can exist in a state of compensation or progress to a decompensated state over time [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Prolonged hypertrophy of the cardiomyocytes is demonstrated as the main cause of sudden cardiac death [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A number of studies indicated that various diseases have been associated with cardiac hypertrophy including occlusive atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD), associated myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure hypertension, endocrine disorders, toxicants and bacterial endocarditis [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are known as the cardiac hormones in normal adults that were secreted by the atria and ventricles. Higher levels of ANP and BNP expression are expressed in the fetal ventricles than adult ventricles [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cardiac ANP and BNP levels are increased in MI of animal models [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], heart failure [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], hypertrophy [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and also in human cardiac diseases [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Increased expressions of ANP and BNP are observed in ventricular during the molecular process of cardiac hypertrophy, which are recognized as markers of the induction of the embryonic gene program in ventricular hypertrophy [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Interleukin (IL)-6 is known as a potent hypertrophic factor of cardiomyocytes [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The IL-6 receptor system consists of various signaling pathways including inflammatory-related p38 MAPK, hypertrophy involved STAT1-STAT3 heterodimer pathway, STAT3 homodimer pathway and non-cardiomyocyte proliferative related MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)s pathway that are activated by the dimerization of gp130 [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The activation of STAT3-dependent signaling pathway by gp130 was reported to promote cardiac myocyte hypertrophy [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], herein the STAT1 and the STAT3 were shown to be chronically phosphorylated in the failing heart [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, the ERK5 molecule plays a critical role in post-natal eccentric hypertrophy of the heart [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. ERK5 and its upstream MAPK-kinase 5 (MEK5) reveals a specific role in transduction of cytokine signals that regulate serial sarcomere assembly and in the induction of eccentric cardiac hypertrophy resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy and sudden death [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the pathologic role of IL-6-MEK5-ERK5 signaling pathway under cardiac hypertrophy. Additionally, various molecules have been elucidated responsible for the development of cardiac hypertrophy, including mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and calcineurin pathway [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and the p38 MAPK cascades (p38) enrolled in the MAPK pathway also play crucial roles in the development of cardiac hypertrophy [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>To avoid the side effects by administration of western drugs, growing studies were performed to investigate the natural products for cardiac protection that have been used as drugs or diet supplements for a long history in many medical experiences. Recent studies reported the cardioprotective effect of various oriental herb extracts or dietary supplements including <italic>Fructus crataegi, Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> and <italic>Astragali radix</italic>. The quercetin is the main ingredient in <italic>Fructus crataegi</italic> that has been demonstrated as an anti-inflammatory substance by inhibiting TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> release from macrophages and recognized to have cardiac protective effect [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> is mainly composed of sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS), a derivative of tanshinone IIA that can reduce myocardial infarct size and prolong the survival cardiac cell in rabbit and human [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. <italic>Astragali radix</italic> contains many isoflavones, isoflavonoids and many saponins, which have been demonstrated to have protective effects on heart by reducing inflammation, oxidant and cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] In our recent publication, we also demonstrated the protective effect of Li-Fu formula composing of celery, black fungus, mushroom, <italic>Saliva miltior rhiza, Crataegi cuneata</italic> and <italic>Astragali radix</italic> on cardiac apoptosis [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>To further understand the effects and possible mechanisms of Li-Fu formula on cardiac hypertrophy, we examined the expression of hyper-trophic associated molecules in the cardiac tissues from hamsters that were fed with hypercholesterol diets and suggested the cardiac protective effects of Li-Fu formula by reducing the cardiac hypertrophy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Our experimental results indicate the significant reduction of the WHW/BW and LVW/BW ratios in hamsters from Li-Fu formula group compared with those from cholesterol group. Moreover, the hypertrophic marker protein such as ANP, BNP, eccentric hypertrophic-related factors such as IL-6, STAT3, MEK5, p-ERK5, p-MEK and p-ERK were significantly increased in cholesterol group, whereas significant reduction of all these proteins were observed in Li-Fu formula group.</p><p>The interleukin (IL)-6 is known as a pleiotypic factor that has been associated with various cardiac diseases [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Elevated IL-6 mRNA is observed in patients of cardiac hypertrophy with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, STAT3 and MAPK (ERK)s pathway were induced by IL-6 receptor signaling systems and contributed to the cardiac hypertrophy [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Accordingly, our experimental results revealed significant elevation of IL-6 expression in the excised ventricle of hamsters from Cholesterol group as well as those hypertrophic related signaling molecules including STAT3, MEK5, p-ERK5. Notably, the significant reduction of these hypertrophic factors and signaling molecules were detected in the excised ventricle of hamsters from Li-Fu formula group. To further clarify the involved signaling pathway, we further examined the MAPK pathway that consists three major cascades including the non-cardiomyocyte proliferative ERK, and the inflammatory related c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and the p38 MAPK cascades (p38) [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As revealed in current study, significant increase of p-ERK was observed in the excised ventricle of hamster from Cholesterol group and the p-ERK level was significantly reduced in the excised ventricle of hamster from Li-Fu formula group. Moreover, higher increase of p-MEK, the upstream kinase activator of EKR, was also detected in hamsters from Li-Fu group compared to cholesterol group. However, no significant differences in protein levels of p-P38 and p-JNK were detected between hamsters from cholesterol and Li-Fu formula groups. Although the precise mechanisms of Li-Fu formula on reducing IL-6 expression merit further investigations, these findings indeed demonstrated that Li-Fu formula has the effect against cardiac hypertrophy by attenuating non-cardiomyocyte proliferation related p-ERK cascade but not P38 or JNK cascade. </p><p>Because of the moderated side effects than Western drugs, more than half of the population in the world relies on traditional medicine for therapeutic needs.

Although the precise mechanism of most herbal medicine or dietary supplement has not been fully understood, the experience of the traditional use over the years cannot be neglected. Altogether, our experimental results revealed that Li-Fu formula, the traditional oriental herbs and diet supplements formula have significant protective effects against cardiac hypertrophy. Besides the attenuated expression of ANP and BNP, the effect against cardiac hypertrophy of Li-Fu formula is probably via the reduction of eccentric hypertrophy related IL-6 receptor pathway and non-cardiomyocyte proliferation involved ERK signaling cascade but not JNK and P38 cascades.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Funding</title><p>Grant CMU96-100 from the China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>C.-Y.
