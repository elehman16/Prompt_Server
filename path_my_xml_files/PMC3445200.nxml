Although still debated, the mechanism by which ultrasound facilitates absorption of drugs is thought to occur via an alteration of the stratum corneum of the skin. This alteration is postulated to occur as a result of denaturing the structural keratin proteins in the stratum corneum, stripping or delaminating of the cornified layers or the stratum corneum, changing the cell permeability, or altering the lipid-enriched intracellular structure between corneocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941738111405970">5</xref></sup> The ability of ultrasound to facilitate the absorption of hydrocortisone acetate (HA) into tendon, nerve, and muscle has been shown in porcine and rat models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941738111405970">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941738111405970">24</xref></sup> However, studies in canines and humans have questioned the ability of ultrasound to enhance the absorption of HA into muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941738111405970">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941738111405970">25</xref></sup></p><p>Phonophoresis has been commonly used in physical therapy practices for many years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941738111405970">3</xref></sup> The most common drug used in phonophoresis is HA in either a 1% or 10% concentration.

Preoperatively, they were randomly assigned to either a sham (n = 9) or true (n = 12) phonophoresis treatment group. Both patients and their surgeons were blinded to the treatment method. In the preoperative holding area, patients in the true phonophoresis group were treated with 6 minutes of continuous ultrasound at 1 MHz, 1 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, using 5 g of pharmaceutically prepared 10% HA in a gel mixture. The treatment site was centered over an area 8 cm proximal to the semitendinosus tendon tibial insertion as determined by measuring the distance with a tape measure from the pes anserine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941738111405970">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1941738111405970">2</xref>). The treatment area was 5 cm<sup>2</sup>, consistent with the effective radiating area of the ultrasound unit. This point is consistent with the location of an accessory slip from the semitendinosus to the medial gastrocnemius that must be released during surgical harvest of the semitendinosus tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1941738111405970">Figure 3</xref>, red arrow).

The insertion was sharply divided off the tibia, and a sample of the distal tendon was removed as a control sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1941738111405970">Figure 3</xref>, green arrow). A whip stitch of No. 2 Ethibond suture was then placed in the distal end of the tendon. Blunt dissection was then performed to mobilize the semitendinosus tendon until the accessory slip to the gastrocnemius could be identified. This accessory slip was sharply divided 6 to 8 mm from the main tendon. The semitendinosus tendon was then harvested using a tendon stripper. Finally, the accessory slip was removed as a treatment sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1941738111405970">Figure 3</xref>, red arrow). The difference in time between the treatment and tissue extraction was noted, and the samples were then stored at &#x02013;47&#x000b0;C until testing was performed.</p><p>Both samples for each patient were then analyzed for HA levels using high-performance liquid chromatography (Agilent, Santa Clara, California) coupled to a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). An assay was developed for the measurement of HA and hydrocortisone. During the development, the method performance was shown to be 8 to 200 parts per billion (ppb) for the linearity range, and the lower limit of quantitation was defined at 8 ppb. The recovery of HA from human connective tissue was approximately 100%. The laboratory was blinded to the group assignment. Levels of HA in the control site (resting levels) were then subtracted from levels in the treatment site to yield a net HA level for each patient. This was done because cortisol is naturally found throughout the body, including connective tissue. By subtracting the level of cortisone in the control site from that of the treatment site, we could more confidently say that the difference in the cortisone levels between the 2 sites (net HA levels) would be attributed to the phonophoresis.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1941738111405970"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare HA concentrations for treatment and control sites for the 21 patients.

A comparison of the sham and experimental groups showed the median differences in HA between the treatment and control sites to be 5.4 ppb (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1941738111405970">Table 1</xref>). This means that the application of ultrasound netted a median increase of only 0.0054 mg/kg of hydrocortisone in the connective tissue when compared with the sham treatment.

Only those tubes treated with hydrocortisone injection showed a reduction in collagen deposition. A canine model found that absorption of 5% and 10% HA was enhanced with phonophoresis through the stratum corneum into the epidermis, but no HA was found in the knee joint or muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941738111405970">8</xref></sup> In a human model, Bare et al investigated the phonophoretic delivery of 10% HA through the epidermis by measuring serum cortisol concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941738111405970">1</xref></sup> One week apart, each patient received both phonophoresis (10% HA gel coupling medium over an area of 50 cm<sup>2</sup> for 5 minutes at 1.0 W/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1 MHz) and a control treatment with only ultrasound to the volar forearm. Serum HA levels were measured from an antecubital vein at 0, 5, and 15 minutes posttreatment. No rise in serum cortisol concentration was detected following HA phonophoresis. Finally, Kuntz performed a randomized controlled study with an ultrasound (sham) group and a 10% HA phonophoresis (treatment) group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941738111405970">25</xref></sup> Ultrasound at 1 MHz, 1.0 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, continuous for 7 minutes, was administered over the vastus lateralis muscle.

Our study used methods similar to Kuntz&#x02019;s and found no benefit to ultrasound increasing HA absorption; however, we did find a slight increase in HA levels over the control connective tissue in both groups. We conclude that a small amount of HA is able to diffuse through the skin but that there is no additional benefit from concomitant ultrasound treatment.</p><p>Other authors have shown an ability of phonophoresis to facilitate absorption of corticosteroids.

Using serum HA concentration levels as an outcome measure, Saliba et al found that phonophoresis delivered significantly higher concentrations of dexamethasone than did occlusive dressings in humans. They used serum concentration levels of dexamethasone as their outcome measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1941738111405970">33</xref></sup> Koeke et al found that ultrasound stimulated the acceleration of tissue repair processes and induced the transdermal delivery of hydrocortisone in a therapeutic concentration on the rat tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941738111405970">24</xref></sup></p><p>Possible explanations for differences in findings among these studies include (1) differences in the transmissivity of the delivered drug (HA vs dexamethasone), (2) differences in absorption of the target tissue (tendon vs nerve, muscle, or serum), and (3) differences in the dermal properties of the species (human vs swine or mouse). Transmissivity in ultrasound is defined as the percentage of the ultrasound energy that the coupling medium is able to transmit. For ultrasound to have its purported desired effects on the skin, the conducting medium needs to transmit ultrasound energy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941738111405970">7</xref></sup> According to Cameron and Monroe, 1% hydrocortisone powder in ultrasound gel had poor transmission (29%) compared with ultrasound gel alone (96%) or ultrasound lotion (90%). Specifically, 1% and 10% hydrocortisone cream were found to have no transmission (0%). Byl et al also found HA to have poor transmissivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941738111405970">6</xref></sup> Because differences may exist in the ability of different target tissues to absorb HA, our study examined connective tissue, which is a frequent target tissue for HA phonophoresis treatments. Likewise, while there are known differences in the properties of different animal skin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941738111405970">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941738111405970">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941738111405970">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941738111405970">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941738111405970">30</xref></sup> our model looked at the clinically important human skin.</p><p>There are several potential criticisms of our in vivo human model. First, there was a relatively long period between treatment and tissue harvest. It is possible that HA did penetrate the connective tissue but diffused away during the interval before tissue harvest. However, for HA to exert the desired anti-inflammatory effects, we would expect that detectable levels would need to remain in the tissue for hours or days. Second, the stress of surgery could have initiated a native HA release that would have masked any effect from the phonophoresis. Our patients all had peripheral nerve blocks and general anesthesia, which should diminish the &#x0201c;stress response&#x0201d; to surgery. In fact, we found very low control tissue HA levels in most of our patients. Third, we had a statistically significant difference between the true and sham phonophoresis groups in time between treatment and tissue harvest. It is possible that the differences in time could have affected the concentrations of HA. However, the correlation of HA concentration and time was &#x02212;0.17 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.69) in the sham group and &#x02212;0.13 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.70) in the true phonophoresis group, with an overall correlation of &#x02212;0.20 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.41). It appears that time had no effect on HA concentrations in either group so that the differences in time between the groups were not a factor. Fourth, the lack of difference in HA levels between the control and treatment sites could have occurred by cross-contamination of the control site from the treatment site or by simple diffusion of the HA from the treatment site to the control site. However, all tissues were extracted in a manner that pulled the control site out of the surgical portal first so that the control site never touched the treatment site. Furthermore, the distance between the control site and the treatment site was 8 cm, rendering the possibility of diffusion unlikely. A final limitation is that our model looked only at the ability of phonophoresis to promote absorption into human connective tissue. It is possible that there may be a benefit of phonophoresis in other target tissues.</p><p>Clinical studies also differ to whether or not phonophoresis is effective. Several older studies have shown a benefit of HA phonophoresis at reducing pain in inflamed tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941738111405970">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941738111405970">23</xref></sup> A 1992 review by Newman concluded that phonophoresis with HA is effective in the treatment of a variety of musculoskeletal injuries by accelerating healing, increasing flexibility, and decreasing pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1941738111405970">29</xref></sup> Conversely, more recent studies have not shown a benefit for HA phonophoresis in treating carpal tunnel syndrome lateral epicondylitis, or adhesive capsulitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941738111405970">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941738111405970">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941738111405970">22</xref></sup> In a 2007 review, Goraj-Szczypiorowska et al concluded that the lack of objective research methods and reliable scientific verification does not allow unambiguous determination of the efficacy of phonophoresis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941738111405970">15</xref></sup></p><p>In summary, our model demonstrates that HA is absorbed through human skin to underlying connective tissue. However, treatment using phonophoresis with a 10% hydrocortisone gel did not facilitate the absorption of HA over topical hydrocortisone alone (sham). Ultrasound did not improve the absorption of the hydrocortisone into the targeted connective tissue. Given the results of this study, we cannot recommend HA phonophoresis for treatment of inflammatory conditions of connective tissues.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge Betty Skipper, PhD, for her contributions in the statistics of this paper, and to Sam VanBlarcom for his edits and his omnipresent dedication to grammatical correctness</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1941738111405970"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
