Female Large White pigs (approximately 25 Kg) received 3 ml/day orally of either an 'active' oil [So-1100, containing 9% gamma-linolenic acid (GLA)] or a 'placebo' oil (So-1129) for just 4 weeks before or for 4 weeks before and for 16 weeks after irradiation; localised irradiation of skin was with single doses of beta-rays from 22.5 mm diameter 90Sr/90Y plaques. The severity of the acute reaction, assessed in terms of erythema or moist desquamation, was significantly less in those pigs that received So-1100 both before and after irradiation, as compared with those receiving that oil only prior to irradiation and the 'placebo' groups. Dose modification factors (DMFs) of between 1.13-1.24 were obtained. A similar reduction in the severity of acute skin injury was seen in pigs receiving So-1100 for only 10 weeks after irradiation. Late skin damage, assessed in terms of late erythema or dermal necrosis, was also reduced with So-1100, with DMFs of 1.14-1.51. No such modification was observed if So-1100 was only administered for 4 weeks prior to irradiation. No adverse side-effects were apparent as a result of EFA administration. So-1100 may represent a safe and valuable method of increasing the therapeutic gain in radiotherapy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0011.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
