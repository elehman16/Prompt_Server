and trunk stability exercise on static and dynamic balance in normal adults. [Subjects and
Methods] Twenty-two normal adults residing in communities were randomly divided into a
horseback riding exercise group and a trunk stability exercise group, and they conducted
exercise for eight weeks. [Results] Sway times of the COG (center of gravity) decreased
significantly, and the A-P (anterior-posterior) and M-L (medial-lateral) velocities
significantly decreased in both groups. A comparison of sway times of the COG after the
intervention between the two groups revealed that the horseback riding exercise group
showed larger decreases than the trunk stability exercise group. [Conclusion] In terms of
the musculoskeletal factor, horseback riding may result in functional improvement and
increased stability, and it may stimulate proprioceptive sense input in neurological
terms. It is therefore considered a composite exercise method that may strengthen the two
factors simultaneously.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Static balance</kwd><kwd>Dynamic balance</kwd><kwd>Horseback riding exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Balance is a complex function in which the neurological system and the musculoskeletal
system, in combination, maintain posture through diverse functional elements<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Adjustment of balance is a composite
process that requires the integration of sensory information and the execution of
appropriate postural response. In order to maintain an erect posture, visual information and
sensory information of joints and muscles are integrated by the visual and somatic senses
and vestibular system through the central nervous system. This information differs according
to task performance functions<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, balance adjustment demands well-adjusted voluntary movements and reflex muscle
responses<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, interaction
among different sensory motor nerves actively adjusts physical stability and tension against
gravity (the base of support), vision, and the external environment, enabling stabilization
of the center of the body<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Various programs to improve balance have been developed, and these programs in the clinical
field include exercises to enhance muscle strength of the lower extremities and
proprioceptive sense exercises using biofeedback training<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Studies have verified the usefulness of trunk stability exercises in improving balance.
Hodges and Richardson<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that trunk
muscle strength was related to balance and functional activities. Tyson<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that balance in a standing or sitting posture was an
essential element in performing all physical functions and that balance and functional
activities were closely related. Hsieh<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>
asserted that trunk muscles played an important role in enhancing balance and functions, and
Verheyden<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that trunk muscle
activities maintained balance against gravity, adjusting posture and preparing for movements
of the extremities for activities of daily living.</p><p>Recently, horseback riding exercises have been studied with the aim of improving balance. A
horseback riding exercise is an exercise to prevent falls and develops vestibular and
proprioceptive senses, balance ability in which visual feedback senses the center of
gravity, and motor functions<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study compares the effects of trunk stabilization and horseback riding exercises that
increase stability of the trunk on improvement of static and dynamic balance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 24 undergraduates at K University located in

All the participants understood the purpose of this study and provided

standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Subjects were equally divided into a horseback riding exercise group and a trunk stability
exercise group. Exercise was conducted three times per week, 40 minutes per time, for six
weeks. The horseback riding exercise comprised riding while the horse walked (10 minutes),
riding while the horse trotted (20 minutes), and then while the horse walked again (10
minutes). The trunk stability exercise consisted of bridge exercise (20 minutes) and crunch
exercise (20 minutes).</p><p>In order to test the balance ability of the subjects, a Good Balance System (Metitur Ltd.,
Finland, AP1135) (GBS), a balance measurement and training system, was used. For measurement
of static balance, the subjects stood on a foothold and looked straight ahead with their
eyes open. Forward and backward average movement velocity and left and right average
movement velocity from the center of pressure were measured for 30 seconds. For measurement
of dynamic balance ability, the time from when the subjects moved along the zigzag route
displayed on the computer screen without lifting their feet off the ground to when they
returned after reaching the target was measured. All measurement results were expressed as
means &#x000b1; standard deviation.</p><p>SPSS for Windows (version 18.0) was used to analyze the data. Paired t-tests were used to
examine pre- and post-intervention differences, and were analyzed using independent t-tests
to examine differences between the groups. The statistical significance level was set to &#x003b1; =

support in a straight posture and to adjust a posture without falling while moving<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Inappropriate postural adjustment related
to such balance triggers problems, such as decreased ability to adjust balance, and reduced
stability limits increased postural sway in a standing position. Therefore, balance is
essential in all functional actions and an indispensable element in sitting, standing, and
walking<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Trunk stability exercise is known to be effective in improving balance by increasing
balance and stability of the body; as an exercise for the pelvis, it activates the abdominal
muscle and multifidus muscle, a small muscle of the vertebrae, concurrently and in
harmony<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the current study, a one leg bridging exercise introduced by Stevens et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> was employed along with a crunch exercise
introduced by Marshall and Murphy<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
results showed that in a static balance test, forward and backward average movement velocity
and left and right average movement velocity of the center of the body significantly
increased after the trunk stability exercise, and there was also a significant decrease in
time during the dynamic balance test.</p><p>However, the regular and active assistive movements of the trunk and pelvis made during
horseback riding to obtain stability resulted in more positive outcomes compared with the
static trunk stability exercise.</p><p>During horseback riding, a horse rider&#x02019;s pelvic movements while the horse walks are similar
to a non-riding person&#x02019;s pelvic movements during the gait cycle. Therefore, when an
individual rides a horse, his or her balance and postural adjustment are stimulated.
Basically, the horse rider&#x02019;s pelvic movements caused by the horse trigger automatic physical
responses involving static and dynamic movements of the trunk and pelvis, movement of the
center of gravity, and rotational movements<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, which is consistent with the present study&#x02019;s results.</p><p>Encheff<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> asserted that horseback riding
exercise improved postural adjustment of the proximal area, thus bringing about functional
improvement of the extremities. Enhanced balance of the trunk leads to stabilization and
effective movements of the extremities, evidence that horseback riding is an exercise method
applicable to patients with neurological system disorders.</p><p>Together with a trunk stability exercise, which is an existing method to improve balance,
horseback riding was found to be effective in enhancing balance. In fact, horseback riding
is considered more effective in improving balance than other exercises in that it leads to a
more significant increase in movement velocity and decrease in time taken.</p><p>Horseback riding is an exercise that may enhance both static and dynamic balance but has
the disadvantages of high cost and a lack of accessibility. Nonetheless, the exercise may
simultaneously strengthen musculoskeletal and neurological factors, two factors that improve
balance. In terms of the musculoskeletal factor, horseback riding may result in functional
improvement and increased stability, and it may stimulate proprioceptive sense input in
neurological terms. It is therefore considered a composite exercise method that may
strengthen the two factors simultaneously.</p><p>This study has some limitations. Because the subjects were healthy individuals, not
patients, and the study period was short, results cannot be generalized across different
populations. Nevertheless, the balance ability of healthy people converted into numerical
values can be utilized as reliable data for research on patients. Clinical experimental
research using horseback riding exercises on patients who have problems with balance is
warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Carr</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name></person-group>: Stroke rehabilitation.
