To investigate its effectiveness, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted. In addition, the content of the chat and participants&#x02019; goals were studied to identify underlying processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">An RCT with a six-month follow up period was conducted among 72 young adults with JIA, aged between 16 and 25&#x000a0;years old, randomly assigned to the intervention or to the usual care control group. After 24&#x000a0;weeks, in both groups 24 participants completed all measurements. Intentions to treat analyses were carried out by means of linear mixed models for longitudinal measurements. With self-efficacy as primary outcome, self-management, disease activity, quality of life, absenteeism of school/work, health care medication use and adherence to the intervention were studied. The participants&#x02019; goals, personal achievements, interactions on the chat, and their appreciation of the intervention were analyzed using thematic analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">No significant differences were found on self-efficacy, quality of life, and self-management between the participants of the control group and the intervention group. In the intervention group, modeling and sharing experiences were the most recognized themes. Fifty-five goals were formulated and divided into the following categories: <italic>improvement and maintaining balance</italic>, <italic>setting and recognizing boundaries</italic>, <italic>communicating</italic> and <italic>coping with incomprehension</italic>. Adherence, appreciation of the own learning experience, and personal achievements were rated positively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">The web-based intervention did not lead to an improvement of self-efficacy. However, additional qualitative analyses showed that the intervention was appreciated and valuable for the participants. More research is needed on how to measure the added value of this intervention compared to the usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">Trial registration number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl">NTR4679</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Young adults</kwd><kwd>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis</kwd><kwd>Peer-guided</kwd><kwd>Self-management</kwd><kwd>Web-based intervention</kwd><kwd>Effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Short-term</kwd><kwd>Experiences</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par17">eHealth interventions are developed and offered more and more to patients with chronic diseases in order to improve their self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Since young adults are one of the most active groups of internet users, eHealth interventions like portals and self-management support programs may also be promising options for patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, traditional health care services do not always suit the needs and problems of young adults, aged between 16 and 25&#x000a0;years, with JIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the Western world, the reported incident of JIA varies between 1 to 22 cases per 100.000 children, with a prevalence of 8 to 150 cases per 100.000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The disease and its treatment put extensive demands on children and young adults as well as on their parents, due to precisely-scheduled daily medication requirements, regular physical exercise regimes and regular visits to the pediatrician or rheumatologist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Most of these young adults still experience problems well into their adult years with on-going medical treatment and significant disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Like other young adults, young adults with JIA have to develop their own identity and independence, but for them, the path towards adulthood is a lot bumpier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. As they become more independent, they will gradually become more responsible for their own illness and its treatment; they will become self-managers. Enhanced self-management may prevent disease exacerbation and facilitate a successful transition into adult care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and can be best described as &#x02018;the individual&#x02019;s ability to manage the symptoms, treatment, physical and psychological consequences and life style changes, inherent to living with a chronic illness as JIA&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. At the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMC Utrecht), a web-based self-management intervention was developed in close cooperation with young adults, the Dutch Youth Network for young people with arthritis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://youthrwell.com">YouthRwell.com</ext-link>), and both multidisciplinary teams of the child and adult rheumatology department [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The web-based intervention, which is called &#x0201c;Challenge your arthritis&#x0201d;, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reumauitgedaagd.nl/jongeren">www.reumauitgedaagd.nl/jongeren</ext-link> (URL in Dutch) is based on the self-efficacy theory of Bandura [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] where self-efficacy stands for the confidence in one&#x02019;s own ability to achieve indented results, such as self-management. Self-management may be enhanced by increasing self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] through practicing, observing others (modeling), meeting beliefs of others and by interpretation of physiological and emotional status. All these elements are embedded in the web-based intervention.In order to display pro-active behavior one needs to set personal goals prior to starting the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, goal-setting is a crucial element of the intervention. The intervention is led by young peer trainers in the age range of 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;years who suffer from arthritis themselves. They are recruited and selected through assessments and interviews conducted by the Dutch Rheumatism Patient League (DRPL). Finally, the peer leader was trained through a train-the-trainer educational program by the UMC Utrecht and a professional coaching organization (Work21.nl). This program consisted of following the training as a participant, learning about the different themes, and studying training skills.</p><p id="Par19">The first draft of the intervention was evaluated on items of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, user acceptance and adherence in 12 young adults and 4 peer trainers, and appeared to be feasible, especially in dealing with problems in daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although the intervention is thought to be a practical aid in health practices, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to investigate its effectiveness on self-efficacy, self-management, and quality of life. In addition, thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] within the intervention group was carried out to explore the interaction in the Chat, the goals the participants set, and the appreciation of the intervention itself.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par20">A RCT, with a six-month follow up period was conducted among young adults with JIA, who were being treated at the transition outpatient clinics of the UMC Utrecht and the Erasmus Hospital Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Participants of the intervention group were given access to the web-based self-management intervention. Qualitative thematic content analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] were then used to explore the interactions in the Chat, the content of the formulated goals, participants&#x02019; personal achievements regarding their goals, and the appreciation of the intervention itself.

Furthermore, the transition nurse also focused on problems and questions on dealing with the consequences of having JIA and coordinated the process of transition. Both control and intervention group were allowed to use information presented on the website jong-en-reuma.nl (in Dutch). This website contains information about medical issues and themes such as dealing with the consequences of having a rheumatic disease, feeling depressed, exercise, work and study, relationships and intimacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>The intervention group</title><p id="Par24">In addition to the usual care, the intervention group started within 1&#x000a0;month, after randomization, with the web-based self-management intervention. Challenge your arthritis consists of password-protected, interactive web-based self-management instruction with three components: a Chat section, home exercises and a discussion board. Once a week, the group (six participants, two trainers) had a planned group Chat for a maximum of 90&#x000a0;min. Within the Chat, the weekly theme was clarified, goals were set and the participants were allowed to practice, ask questions, give and receive feedback, play a game or watch a real life story video based on the weekly theme. The weekly themes were based on the six themes of the intervention and outlined in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The home exercises were also discussed and evaluated. After the Chat, participants were allowed to work through the intervention at any time at home and do the exercises (1 hour per week). The home exercises consisted, for example, of reading information, watching a video, or practicing communication skills at school or work. The content of the home exercises was related to the weekly theme or their personal goals. The Chat and exercises, both created with input of young adults themselves, were supported by short videos in which young adults with a rheumatic diseases or a member of the multidisciplinary team spoke about their experiences with JIA. In addition, a discussion board was used by trainers and participants to offer encouragement and share tips.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Themes and content of the web-based self-management intervention Challenge your arthritis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Themes</th><th>Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Are you a self-manager?</td><td>&#x02022; introducing yourself, get in touch with the group<break/>&#x02022; what do you (want to) know about your disease?<break/>&#x02022; capacities and talents<break/>&#x02022; goal setting and action planning</td></tr><tr><td>Friends, family and communication</td><td>&#x02022; communication strategies<break/>&#x02022; communication with school, friends, work, parents, health care providers<break/>&#x02022; giving and receiving feedback<break/>&#x02022; setting boundaries</td></tr><tr><td>Feeling blue</td><td>&#x02022; receiving therapies (treatment, medication)<break/>&#x02022; pain, fatigue, feeling blue<break/>&#x02022; asking and giving help<break/>&#x02022; relaxation</td></tr><tr><td>Sport and exercises</td><td>&#x02022; being active<break/>&#x02022; motion and physical activity<break/>&#x02022; maintain your plans</td></tr><tr><td>Relations and Intimacy</td><td>&#x02022; body images and thoughts<break/>&#x02022; having a relationship<break/>&#x02022; having sex<break/>&#x02022; thinking about kids, pregnancy, heredity</td></tr><tr><td>Having control over your life and arthritis</td><td>&#x02022; evaluation of your personal goals; how to move on?<break/>&#x02022; being responsible and making choices<break/>&#x02022; celebration and saying goodbye</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

In addition, support and encouragement were also given. In total, 55 individual goals were formulated by the 32 participants at the start. However, a further 112 personal goals were added during the intervention due to personal reflection or increased awareness. Most formulated goals were related to &#x02018;improve and maintain balance during the day&#x02019;, &#x02018;setting and recognizing boundaries&#x02019;, &#x02018;improving communication with others&#x02019;, and &#x02018;coping with incomprehension&#x02019;. Additionally, goals like &#x02018;increasing knowledge about the disease&#x02019;, &#x02018;coping with emotional (fear, uncertainly) and psychical consequences (pain, fatigue)&#x02019; and &#x02018;fitting treatment advice for daily life&#x02019; were formulated.</p><p id="Par44">A total of 145 personal achievements were categorized into: <italic>&#x02018;gaining insight and awareness&#x02019;</italic>, <italic>&#x02018;making determined, informed choices&#x02019;, &#x02018;personal influence&#x02019;</italic> &#x02018;<italic>understanding&#x02019;</italic> and <italic>&#x02018;new goals for the future&#x02019;.</italic>

Two participants stopped due to medical reasons and school activities. All participants appreciated the intervention, especially the input of the trainers. Some remarks were made about the time of the weekly Chats (start time, duration) and the initial pace of the Chat (too slow). Due to technical problems (slow download speed), not every video led to the outcome that was hoped for.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par47">In this RCT on the effectiveness of the web-based self-management intervention Challenge your arthritis&#x000a0;among young adults with JIA, no significant differences were found between the intervention group and the control group on self-efficacy, quality of life (QoL), and self-management. On the other hand, participants of the intervention group rated their personal achievements within the intervention positively, and adherence and appreciation of their own learning experience was high.</p><p id="Par48">There are some possible explanations for not identifying significant improvements on the patient reported quantitative measurements. Firstly, both control and intervention groups registered relatively high baseline scores on the domains of self-efficacy, self-management and QoL, so there was little room for improvement. This could have been influenced by the setting of the hospitals were the participants of this study were recruited. Both university hospitals have a special transition outpatient clinic and a multidisciplinary team and are known as large, tertiary care centers in the Netherlands where the focus already lies on guidance towards self-management. Also, both groups were under treatment by a pediatrician, rheumatologist, or transition nurse, receiving medical treatment, and rated themselves relatively low on disease-activity. Secondly, although we chose as outcome measure &#x02018;self-efficacy&#x02019;, based on the theoretical fundament of the web-based intervention, one might question if this outcome is acceptable to measure the concept of self-management, considering the age and needs of the young adult. To measure self-efficacy, we used the Dutch-ASES, a questionnaire, developed for adult patients, suffering from a rheumatic disease. As we know from studies on transitional care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] but also from studies on &#x02018;growing up with a chronic disease&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], young adults experience other difficulties in managing arthritis in daily life and have other needs compared to the adult group. So it is possible that not only the concept but also the language and aim of the adult self-efficacy scale did not fit with this age group and was therefore not sensitive to change. Clearly, interchangeability of a child and adult questionnaire, measuring the same concept, can be problematic. The absence of questionnaires measuring the concept of self-management from the perspective of young adult&#x02019;s group was also recognized in the study of van Pelt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. More research is needed on how to measure the concept of self-management and the meaning of the concept, based on the views of young adults.</p><p id="Par49">Finally, a response shift could have influenced the outcomes of this study. A response shift is defined as &#x02018;a change in the meaning of one&#x02019;s self evaluation of a target construct as a result of recalibration&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and is recognized as an influencing factor to the outcomes of educational and behavioral interventions. Relatively high scores at baseline could be explained by unawareness of already existing self-management related behavior, since analyses of Chats revealed that participants gained awareness, increased influence on their own situation, and made more informed decisions. It is unknown to what extent the process of awareness had also taken place as a consequence of the usual care both groups received.</p><p id="Par50">The personal goals, set by the participants of the intervention group, reflected the aim of the intervention, and the needs and real-life issues of young adults with JIA, which are known from literature on these subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. During the intervention, personal goals were added which can be seen as a result of increased awareness of needs. In a study on health care transition in rheumatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], awareness is recognized as an important factor towards autonomy. Obtaining and increasing autonomy is, in this study, seen as an important psycho-social developmental task of adolescence. Analyses of the interactions in the Chat revealed that many experiences and strategies were shared, and support and encouragement were mutually exchanged. Sharing experiences and strategies to solve problems, and exchanging support and encouragement are recognized as active coping styles and predictors for psychological adjustment in young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Stimulating the use of these styles may prevent developmental problems in psycho-social functioning.</p><p id="Par51">The aim of the intervention was to enhance the young adults&#x02019; self-management in coping with JIA. The qualitative results expose that the intervention &#x02018;delivers what it has to deliver&#x02019; and suggest that the intervention fits the needs of this group. These qualitative results, as well as other studies on needs assessments among young adults with JIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], point out the importance of paying attention to the complexity of managing medical needs, together with developmental aspects and the drive towards independence. The web-based intervention is appreciated by young adults and can be a valuable aid for both young adults and health care professionals in order to support and improve self-management. The intervention could be valuable in delivering eHealth instead of face-to-face self-management support for young patients who live far from the hospital. Further research is needed to determine which patient benefits most from online self-management support. Furthermore, some adjustments have to be made. Future participants should be better informed about the aim and the structure of the intervention. Additionally, support should be provided to identify the personal needs and goals they want to achieve. This can prevent potential dropout and provide an early indication of those patients who will benefit the most. Contact with the peer trainer before registering for the intervention can be helpful in this process and can improve the effectiveness of the intervention.</p><p id="Par52">There are some limitations to our study that should be mentioned. Firstly, we recruited participants from two large tertiary centres in the Netherlands. Some participants expressed that they participated because they had a good relationship with their doctor. This could have affected their results positively and therefore generalizing the results may not be entirely possible. Secondly, we chose patient reported outcomes (PROs) to capture the young patients&#x02019; perspectives on the effectiveness of the intervention. Measuring and describing clinical outcomes with, for example, the JADAS (for patients &#x0003c;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years old) or the DAS (for patients &#x0003e;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years old) could have been a valuable contribution, but as discussed before, interchangeability of a child and adult questionnaire is problematic, Thirdly, the qualitative results are only representative of the young adults who participated in the intervention group; we did not study these outcomes in the control group. Finally, although the predetermined calculated number of patients was included, there was some drop-out in the follow-up leading to a small sample size at the end of the study. However, mixed-method analyses were used in which drop-outs were taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par53">In our study on the effectiveness of the web-based intervention Challenge your arthritis&#x000a0;for young adults with JIA, we did not find improvement of self-efficacy, self-management, and quality of life. However the intervention was regarded to be a valuable and appreciated aid to influence an active coping style by sharing experiences, enhancing social support, and increasing autonomy and goal-setting behavior. More research is needed on how to measure the added value of this intervention/self-management in this group, and on what meaning young adults themselves give to the concept of self-management.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p id="Par6">The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMARD</term><def><p id="Par7">Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drug</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Dutch-ASES</term><def><p id="Par8">Dutch-Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAQ-DI</term><def><p id="Par9">Dutch Consensus Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HeiQ</term><def><p id="Par10">Health Education Impact Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>JIA</term><def><p id="Par11">Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRS</term><def><p id="Par12">Numerical Rating Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAID</term><def><p id="Par13">Non Steroid Anti Inflammatory Drug</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p id="Par14">Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par15">Randomized Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p id="Par16">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thank you to all the patients who participated in this study.
