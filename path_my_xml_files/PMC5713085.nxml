Scalpel incisions can be delivered with precision and result in favorable wound-healing characteristics; however, they are associated with drawbacks such as excessive blood flow in the operative field leading to inadequate visibility.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Injuries to dental personnel occurring during placement, transfer, use, and disposal of the blade is also a realistic possibility.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The term electrosurgery refers to the passage of high-frequency alternating current through the tissue to achieve a predetermined surgical effect.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Electrosurgery offers many unique advantages over scalpel such as hemostasis, precise tissue cutting with minimal pressure, and sterilization of the surgical field.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] While this hemostatic capability represents a major advance, there are a number of disadvantages associated with electrosurgery including thermal injury and delayed wound healing.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Consequently, emerging electrosurgical technologies such as insulated cutting electrodes, ultrasonic blades, and feedback-controlled radiofrequency generators have been introduced and developed primarily to reduce thermal damage while preserving the hemostatic ability.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Studies have shown that heat generated by electrosurgical devices is influenced by factors such as duration of contact between tissue and electrode, current intensity, electrosection waveform, and the electrode tip size. A larger tip causes more tissue damage, increased operating power, and more amount of lateral heat production.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This led to the concept of microdissection needle with fine electrode tips and efficient power usage.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Evidence from nondental studies seems to suggest that the use of microdissection needles does not have any significant difference in wound healing or pain over scalpel blades.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>One such microdissection needle system is the Colorado<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> microdissection needle (Stryker-Leibinger, Freiburg-im-Breisgau, Germany) which combines the advantages of scalpel and electrosurgery[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] resulting in a wide array of applications in the field of ophthalmology, neurosurgery, and others.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The primary feature of the Colorado<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> microdissection needle is an ultrasharp tungsten tip that concentrates the waveform from the electrosurgery generator to a very small spot. This allows for the use of extremely low wattages, resulting in less tissue necrosis, precision cutting, cauterization, and less postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The instrument tip is a delicately machined, insulated tungsten diathermy needle that is compatible with any standard cautery handpiece and system. Tungsten, with its extremely high melting point (&#x0003e;3400&#x000b0;C), provides a heat resistant tip that maintains sharpness compared to stainless steel tips that dull rapidly.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Till date, there is a paucity in studies on the use of Colorado<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> microdissection needle in periodontal surgery.

BL during surgery was estimated by using swab weighing technique,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in which using sterile gauze pieces was divided into small lots and preweighed before surgery. The lots once used were then reweighed immediately after surgery before discarding them from the operative field (b). From their variance in weight (lot wise) between the two (b-a), BL was calculated using the formula: Volume (ml) = Weight (gm)/Density (gm/ml). Saliva is considered negligible since the patients served as his or her own control, and surgeries were performed at the same time of the day to avoid any change in the salivary flow due to circadian rhythm. VAS was assessed by using VAS[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] on days 1, 7, and 15 after surgery. Early healing index (EHI) was recorded using the early wound healing index[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] graded as (1) Complete flap closure &#x02013; no fibrin line in interproximal area, (2) Complete flap closure &#x02013; fine fibrin line in interproximal area, (3) Complete flap closure &#x02013; fibrin clot in interproximal area, (4) Incomplete flap closure &#x02013; partial necrosis of interproximal tissue, and (5) Incomplete flap closure &#x02013; complete necrosis of interproximal tissue. PH was calculated as the distance from the top of the papilla to the base of a line connecting the midfacial soft tissue margin of the two adjacent teeth.

The values are comparable to the following studies: Moore <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported 54.9 &#x000b1; 36.0&#x02013;70.2 &#x000b1; 53.0 ml BL with conventional periodontal flap surgery with scalpel, whereas Braganza <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported 17.8 &#x000b1; 9.6&#x02013;31.9 &#x000b1; 15.7 ml BL based on preoperative NSAIDs intake. McIvor and Wengraf[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported 12&#x02013;62 ml BL when periodontal flap procedures were limited to one or two teeth. Zigdon <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported that BL during periodontal flap surgery ranged from 6.0 to 145.1 mL with an overall mean loss of 59.47 &#x000b1; 38.2 ml. Both CMD and EC resulted in lesser BL with CMD resulting in least amount of BL. One of the advantages with electrosurgery is the minimal amount of BL following its use. In the present study, BP showed higher volumes of BL; this finding was in agreement with the studies conducted by Kearn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Shamin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] who reported that BL in electrosurgical incisions is lesser when compared to scalpel. Sheikh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported approximately four times more BL with a scalpel when compared to the Colorado microdissection needle for scalp incisions in neurosurgical procedures. No significant difference in BL between CMD and EC has been observed in the present study. However, the fine insulated tip of CMD can simultaneously perform cutting and coagulation without compromising the precision of tactile feedback when compared with electrosurgery.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>A significant reduction in papilla height was seen from baseline to 1 week in all three treatment groups. All groups received modified Widman flap surgery which involves splitting of the papilla just below the contact point.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Electrosurgical procedures also have a deeper penetration to about 300&#x02013;500 cell layers and vaporize water in the underlying soft tissue creating a &#x0201c;shrinking&#x0201d; effect.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] During healing, the development of interdental soft tissue craters or clefts is frequently observed resulting in a loss of PH as well.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] However, significant changes in papilla height were found between BP and EC groups at 30 and 180 days with BP group showing more increase in papilla height. The lack of thermal stresses in the tissue and the ability to precisely split the papilla in the BP group may have resulted in better papillary healing over CMD and EC.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] CMD has a fine ultrasharp tungsten tip which can be used to place thinner and precise incisions as well in the interdental regions. At 180 days, CMD showed better papilla height gain over EC when compared to BP (0.14 mm vs. 0.28 mm). This different however was not significant.</p><p>The reduction in PPD and CAL from baseline to the end of study period was highly significant in all the three treatment groups. No significant intergroup differences at different time frames however were observed among all the groups. CMD and EC have been used as an adjunct to flap surgeries leading to reduction in PD and improvement in CAL.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The use of cautery has the potential to cause delayed periodontal healing because of secondary wound contamination.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This does not seem to be the case in this study as no significant differences were observed among the three groups for PPD and CAL at different time intervals.</p><p>Less postoperative pain was observed with CMD at 1<sup>st</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> postoperative days. These results correlate with the previous studies[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] which have shown that by reducing the surface area of cautery device, microdissection needles can maintain high power densities at relatively low wattages. The net result allows for lower dissipation of heat into surrounding tissues which results in lower thermal injury and postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] However, no significant differences have been observed among all groups at the end of 15 days.</p><p>Assessment of healing after 7 and 15 days revealed that healing of the quadrant treated by BP was best among all. Delayed healing in case of EC can be attributed to damage produced by lateral heat.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Lateral heat damage is the area of coagulation necrosis produced around the incision line due to unwanted heat production; histologically, it is 0.12&#x02013;0.31 mm wide.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] When compared with EC, CMD showed improved healing at 7<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> postoperative days. Our clinical results are supported by previous studies,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] in which the histological appearance of tissue that was subjected to the microdissection needle tip was compared with standard electrosurgery. These studies showed that decrease in thermal injury by the needle tip is attributable to the decreased power requirement and a more focused needle.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>The overall mean PI and MGI scores for all the individuals were assessed from baseline to 6 months to assess the overall oral hygiene status of the patient during the study period to avoid any confounders in the study. Although PI and MGI reduced significantly from base line to 6 months, no significant differences were observed among the three groups at different time intervals. This can be attributed to continuous standard and reinforced oral hygiene instructions given to the patients during every visit.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</p><p>This study has some limitations that need to be acknowledged. There is limited literature on the use and evaluation of CMD in periodontal surgery, and a direct comparison of the results in this study with similar studies was not possible. Literature was also scant on the ideal settings of CMD for intraoral use. The authors decided to use CMD at a power setting of 3 in cutting and coagulation mode from the results obtained by running a pilot study. However, the results seem to suggest that Colorado<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> microdissection needle can be used as a better alternative for electrosurgery and scalpel in performing periodontal surgeries. Further studies, taking into consideration the power settings and different types of CMD tips, are required to produce a general consensus on the use of microdissection needles in periodontics.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors thank the individuals whose participation made this study possible.
