Postnatal depression (PND) is associated with persistent depression, and even, in a few cases each year, death from suicide (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">PMMRC, 2014</xref>). This disorder may affect a mother's ability to care for and bond with her new infant, as well as her quality of life and daily functioning (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Da Costa et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, maternal depression can produce long-lasting effects on children's cognitive, social-emotional and health outcomes (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Tronick and Reck, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Grace et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to depressed mood, PND is associated with hopelessness, excessive fatigue, psychomotor agitation, appetite and sleep disturbances, guilt, or feelings of inadequacy, particularly regarding one's ability to care for the newborn and co-morbid anxiety. Anxiety often coexists with depression and like PND, the prevalence varies widely depending on the timing and the type of disorder (generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) vs obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)) and the way it is measured (self-report vs structured interview). Despite this, most women with PND are either not recognised as being depressed, are unable to access psychological therapy or are reluctant to take antidepressant medication in pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Furthermore it takes several weeks for the therapeutic effect of antidepressants to appear and there is a 15&#x02013;30% discontinuation rate (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Gartlehner et al., 2005</xref>). Safe and effective therapies to prevent and treat PND are needed (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Battle et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>A &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; diet comprising higher intakes of fruit and vegetables, whole grains and lean meat and fish is associated with a reduced likelihood of depression (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2013</xref>). These observational studies are supported by a recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) showing that a dietary improvement intervention was effective as an adjuvant therapy in patients with moderate to severe depression who were being treated with psychotherapy or antidepressants (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Jacka et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, it has been suggested that fermented foods alter dietary items before they are ingested, resulting in phytochemical transformation into bioactive chemicals which reduce oxidative stress and inflammation (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Selhub et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>There is a growing literature linking the gut microbiota to brain chemistry and behaviour via multiple bi-directional pathways (the microbiome-gut-brain axis), including the immune system, neuroendocrine, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA axis), short chain fatty acids or tryptophan and sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system including the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve, and the gut microbiota (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Kasper, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Dinan and Cryan, 2015</xref>). Microbial dysbiosis is associated with many health problems including neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, depression and anxiety, and are associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased oxidative stress, altered gastrointestinal (GI) function, and lowered micronutrient and omega-3 fatty acid status (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Dawson et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, alterations in the pattern of gut microbial composition in healthy adults influences mood (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Probiotics are live microorganisms that when consumed in adequate amounts provide health benefits to the host (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 2014</xref>). In 2005 it was first suggested that probiotics might be an adjuvant therapy for major depression (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Logan and Katzman, 2005</xref>) and others have also suggested that probiotic enhancement of gut microbiota may improve mood outcomes (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Dinan and Cryan, 2016</xref>). Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the anxiety phenotype of mice can be changed with fecal transplantation and that the changes in microbiota are accompanied by changes in brain chemistry (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, probiotic treatment has also been shown to have a positive effect on anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviour in animal studies (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Desbonnet et al., 2010</xref>), with mediating mechanisms including GABA receptor expression in specific locations of the central nervous system (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al., 2011</xref>), the HPA axis (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Desbonnet et al., 2010</xref>) and the vagus nerve which transmits information from the gut luminal environment to the CNS (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Carabotti et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, probiotic supplementation in adults has not been found to substantially alter their gut microbiota as sampled by fecal samples (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Kristensen et al., 2016</xref>), although this does not exclude their potential effect higher up in the small intestine or on the adherent mucosal gut microbiome.</p><p>Clinical trials of probiotic treatment have yielded mixed results, and systematic reviews of human trials concluded that the evidence for beneficial effects of probiotics on mood may not be as strong as some recent narrative studies purport (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Romijn and Rucklidge, 2015</xref>). A recent systematic review identified 10 clinical trials of the effect of probiotics on symptoms of depression (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Wallace and Milev, 2017</xref>). Seven studies were in healthy subjects, 2 in chronic fatigue syndrome and one in depression. Three of 5 studies reported improved mood with probiotics, and 5 of 7 studies reported improvements in stress and anxiety. A recent study that was published after these reviews reported that obese women treated with a weight-reduction programme and probiotic had reduced symptoms of depression compared with the comparison group, but this effect was not seen in men (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez et al., 2017</xref>). There was no effect on anxiety. Both reviews suggested further RCTs were needed. To date probiotic effects on postnatal depression have not been studied in a clinical trial.</p><p>Our aim was to evaluate whether probiotic supplementation with <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> HN001 (HN001) had a beneficial effect on postnatal symptoms of depression and anxiety in a group of healthy women.

Furthermore, the number of women reporting clinically significant levels of anxiety on screening was significantly lower in the probiotic group. To our knowledge this is the first double-blind RCT of probiotics that has evaluated symptoms of depression and anxiety in the postpartum period. In addition, our sample size was substantially larger than many previously reported RCTs of probiotics on mood and behaviour.</p><p>The finding that women supplemented with probiotics had fewer symptoms of postnatal anxiety and depression is consistent with two previous clinical studies of the effect of probiotics on mood in different populations. A RCT of 40 people with major depressive disorder treated with a combination of three probiotics (<italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic>, and <italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic>) or placebo also found a significant reduction in symptoms of depression on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) in the treatment group (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Akkasheh et al., 2016</xref>). A reduction in anxiety symptoms in a sample of 39 chronic fatigue patients randomised to receive <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> or placebo has also been reported, but the same study did not find a reduction in symptoms of depression on the BDI in the treatment group (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2009</xref>). However, not all studies have demonstrated a significant positive effect of probiotic treatment on mood outcomes (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Romijn and Rucklidge, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Romijn et al., 2017</xref>). A recent study involving 69 subjects who successfully completed the study found no evidence that a probiotic preparation (containing <italic>Lactobacillus helveticus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic>) for 8&#x000a0;weeks was effective in treating adults with moderate scores on self-reported symptoms of depression, stress and anxiety (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2009</xref>). The diversity of study populations, including those with schizophrenia (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson et al., 2014</xref>) smokers(<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Reale et al., 2012</xref>), and irritable bowel syndrome patients (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Dapoigny et al., 2012</xref>), the range of probiotic strains used, varying length of treatment, small sample sizes and varying measures of mood make it difficult, if not impossible, to undertake any meta-analysis of these studies. It is clear that more large studies of probiotic treatment are needed including those that measure psychological outcomes.</p><p>In our study infant colic was associated with higher depression and anxiety scores. There has been a suggestion in the literature that probiotic supplementation may benefit maternal mood by reducing infant colic. One study reported that direct probiotic supplementation of infants reduced infant colic and this in turn was associated with lower rates of maternal depression (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Mi et al., 2015</xref>). While infants in our study are likely to have been exposed to a small amount of probiotic indirectly, either in utero or via breastmilk, they were not administered the probiotic directly; furthermore, we found that prevalence of infant colic did not differ between the probiotic and placebo groups and hence there was little difference in the effect size when adjusted for infant colic. Multivariable analysis showed that probiotic supplementation and absence of infant colic were independently associated with lower postnatal depression and anxiety scores.</p><p>The prevalence of scores for depression and anxiety above the cut-off at 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;months post-partum in this study was higher than the 10% to 15% usually reported. In part, this may be due to the mothers and or fathers having a history of asthma, hayfever or eczema requiring medication, as it is known that those with allergies are at higher risk of mental health problems (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2007</xref>). It may also be due to mothers in our study completing the questionnaire retrospectively. Possibly when mothers reflect back to how they felt 1 to 2&#x000a0;months after delivery, they realise how tiring caring for a newborn infant can be. In studies that survey prevalence of PND at an early time point, women may be less likely to rate themselves as depressed or anxious because they are expecting to feel exhausted.</p><p>Despite the prevalence of high symptom scores, the number of women who had medication for psychological problems in pregnancy was low (3.4% of total study population). Our study did not explore the reasons for this; however, it does support the contention that depression and anxiety during pregnancy is unrecognised and not treated.</p><p>Mechanisms by which probiotic supplementation influence the physiology of the brain, and thereby anxiety and depression, have been proposed using animal models. Changes in the expression of the neurotransmitter GABA receptors in regions of the mouse brain have been demonstrated along with changes in anxiety-related behaviour with <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> treatment (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al., 2011</xref>). However, this relationship was not evident in mice that had had their vagus nerve removed, indicating that the vagus nerve might be the link between events in the gut and altered GABA receptor expression. However, in another study <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> was not superior to placebo in modifying stress-related measures in healthy adult human males highlighting the challenge of extrapolating from animal to human studies (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Kelly et al., 2017</xref>). Biochemical changes have been demonstrated in the HPA axis in rats when exposed to maternal separation, which in turn were associated with anxiety-related behaviours in the Forced Swim Test; these behaviours were reversed when the animals were treated with <italic>Bifidobacterium infantis</italic> (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Postnatal depression occurs more frequently in socio-economically disadvantaged populations. In a previous study we found that PND was more likely to occur in women who were single, &#x0003c;&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;years of age, Maori, were unhappy with their relationship with their partner, or had a history of previous psychiatric hospitalisation (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Webster et al., 1994</xref>). National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was an observational study and found that probiotic foods or supplements were associated with a reduced risk of depression, but this was attenuated and non-significant when adjusted for factors that were associated with depression and probiotic exposure (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Cepeda et al., 2017</xref>). This may be a consequence of misclassification, as probiotic food and supplement use over the 24&#x000a0;h period preceding data collection was used to define exposure and may not reflect usual intake. Our study was a RCT and therefore the socioeconomic and other factors are randomly distributed between the intervention and placebo group.</p><p>There are many different species and strains of probiotics. <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> HN001 was chosen for the beneficial effect on the primary outcome, namely eczema (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Wickens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Wickens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Wickens et al., 2013</xref>). Many <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> strains have been studied with respect to mental health and these genera seem to show the most beneficial effects (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Limitations of the study need to be considered. Firstly, the EPDS and STAI6 are screening tools for PND and anxiety, but are not diagnostic. In this report we have studied symptoms of PND and anxiety, as clinical assessment and diagnosis of depression and anxiety were not undertaken. However, when the scores were categorised into higher risk of PND and indicators of clinically significant levels of anxiety, similar findings were seen. Secondly, the information regarding symptoms of PND and anxiety was collected retrospectively, and neither the EPDS nor the STAI6 has been validated using the questions phrased in the past tense. While this may have resulted in an increase in measurement error, it would not be expected to have introduced a differential bias in responses. Furthermore, measurement error, if introduced, would be more likely to move the results towards the null hypothesis of there being no effect of probiotic on mood outcomes. The strength of the study is the design (double-blind placebo-controlled study) with substantial group size. It is a simple, cost effective and easily implemented treatment. Furthermore, we have shown that this probiotic is safe and well tolerated in pregnancy and infants (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Dekker et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>This study provides evidence that probiotic supplementation with <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> HN001 in pregnancy and postpartum reduces the prevalence of symptoms of PND and anxiety postpartum. Not all probiotic strains have the same effect on health and it is possible that the results found using HN001 are not generalisable to other probiotic strains, or at lower doses than those used in this study. Furthermore, in a recent study higher levels of anxiety-like behaviour and stress, as measured by plasma corticosterone levels, were seen in young rats treated with <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> or inulin (a prebiotic) compared with controls (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Barrera-Bugue&#x000f1;o et al., 2017</xref>). Those treated with a <italic>L. casei</italic> and inulin combination (synbiotic) had no anxiety-like behaviours. There are many unanswered questions, including the choice of probiotic, the dose and the duration of treatment. Can probiotics prevent the onset of symptoms? Could probiotics be used as the primary treatment for maternal mental health problems or should it be used as an adjuvant treatment to standard therapy? Such studies might incorporate inflammatory markers, cortisol, or other objective markers,</p><p>If replicated by other studies, this probiotic may be useful for the prevention or treatment of symptoms of depression and anxiety postpartum.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by grants and support from the: <funding-source id="gts0015">Health Research Council of New Zealand</funding-source> (HRC 11/318); <funding-source id="gts0020">Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd.</funding-source>, New Zealand; <funding-source id="gts0025">University of Otago</funding-source>, Wellington, New Zealand.
