The Incredible Years (IY) parenting programmes reduce both conduct disorder in children and depression in their parents. Recent U.K. and Ireland trials of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of IY parenting programmes have assessed children&#x02019;s health and social care service use, but little is known about the programme&#x02019;s impact on parental service use. This paper explores whether an above clinical cut-off score on the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI II) is associated with high or low parental health and social care service use in high-risk families receiving the IY Basic Programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a secondary analysis of a subsample (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;119) from the first U.K. community-based randomised controlled trial of the 12-week IY Basic Programme (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;153). Parents with children at risk of developing conduct disorder were randomised to receive the programme or to a waiting-list control group. BDI II total and BDI II clinical depression cut-off scores were compared to frequencies and costs of parents&#x02019; service use, at baseline, six, twelve and eighteen months post-baseline for the intervention group and at baseline and six months post-baseline for the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intervention group parents who scored above the clinical cut-off on the BDI II at baseline used more health and social care services than those who scored below at baseline, six and eighteen months. Significant reductions in service use frequencies were found for the intervention group only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Parents with higher levels or depression used more health and social care service and parenting programmes have been shown to reduce parental depression and also health and social service use. However, further exploration of depressed parents&#x02019; service use and the cost implications for publically funded health and social care services is needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Registration of the original RCT of the IY Basic Parenting Programme - Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN46984318">ISRCTN46984318</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Parenting</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Service use</kwd><kwd>Health economics</kwd><kwd>Child conduct problems</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Conduct disorder (CD) is defined as a persistent pattern of aggressive and destructive behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is the most common psychiatric disorder in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Unipolar depression in adults, the most commonly occurring type of depression, is characterised by; enduring depressed mood, a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, disrupted sleep and/or appetite, feelings of guilt and/or low self-worth, and poor concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Unipolar depressive disorder is expected to become the leading cause of global disease burden to services by 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>There is a high rate of co-morbidity between depression in parents and CD in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. There is also a link between low socio-economic status, depression, and conduct problems. Parents in socially-disadvantaged areas have higher prevalence of parental depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and children in those areas have higher levels of CD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Parenting interventions are the most effective method for improving negative or challenging child behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These interventions are typically delivered in a group format, one 2-hour session per week for 4&#x02013;18&#x000a0;weeks, by trained leaders with the focus on improving parenting skills to manage child behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Effective parenting interventions tend to be multi-faceted, comprising of group discussion, role-play, video-modelling, and homework tasks and some have shown psychologically beneficial outcomes for parents (such as reductions in depression and stress levels) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and positive behavioural changes in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The following two sections present evidence for parenting programmes reducing parental depression. The third section presents associated costs of adult mental health issues and related child conduct problems.</p><sec><title>Parents attending a parent programme primarily for their improving child&#x02019;s behaviour and their depression improved</title><p>Barlow, Coren and Stewart-Brown&#x02019;s Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] identified four studies that assessed the impact of group based parenting programmes upon parental depression. DeGarmo, Patterson and Forgatch; Sheeber and Johnson; Scott and Stradling; Taylor et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] all showed significant improvements in parental depression following participation in parenting programmes. The studies measured the effect of different parenting programmes delivered over a range of time-periods, using different depression sub-scales and child behaviour sub-scales to measure outcomes. Barlow, Coren and Stewart-Brown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] concluded that, in the short-term, parenting programmes are effective in improving parental psychosocial outcomes. The DeGarmo, Patterson and Forgatch study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] was the only one to assess longer-term outcomes, demonstrating that a change in child behaviour led to reductions in maternal depressive symptoms over 2.5&#x000a0;years. Four other more recent studies not included in the Barlow, Coren and Stewart-Brown review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] also found improvements in parental depression as a secondary outcome from parenting programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Furlong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] conducted a Cochrane review of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural group-based parenting programmes for early-onset conduct problems in children aged three to 12&#x000a0;years. Eight of the thirteen studies identified included self-reported parental mental health measures. Meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant small improvement in parent mental health, favouring the parent training group with confidence intervals indicating a range of small to moderate effect sizes. Hutchings et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] have argued that since the reduction in depression co-occurs with the reduction in child behaviour problems for the intervention group only it is likely that the skills taught in the parent programme also contribute to the improvements in depression. They argue that the specific components that produce this change are training in accurate observation, behavioural rehearsal and problem solving skills all of which are known to be skill deficits in people experiencing depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Mediator/moderator analyses conducted to demonstrate the effects of depression on child behaviour outcomes</title><p>The Hutchings et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] dataset has been used in mediator and moderator analyses. Findings showed maternal depression to be a significant positive moderator of child behaviour. Children whose mothers were depressed, as assessed by self-report on the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] showed greater improvements in conduct problems post-intervention, compared with parents of control group children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This contrasts with other studies that have shown depression to be a significant moderator for poorer child behaviour outcomes using parenting programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Hutchings et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] using the same Hutchings et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] dataset found that parental depression partially mediated improvements in child behaviour. They argue that it is the collaborative nature of the IY programme, with its focus on empowering parents that makes it more effective in reducing both depression and child behavioural problems.</p></sec><sec><title>Costs of child CD and adult depression</title><p>Previous research has shown the costs and frequencies of health, social and education service use of childhood CD and behavioural problems to be high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. There is research reporting the service use of children displaying problem behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In the Hutchings et al. sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], children&#x02019;s service use was shown to increase at six and twelve months post-intervention, compared with service use at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, long-term follow up of the same sample showed that children&#x02019;s service use had decreased by eighteen months post-baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Little investigation has been conducted to assess parental service use following participation in a parenting programme. Though Bywater et al. assessed the effects of foster carers&#x02019; service use in Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Findings showed the majority of health and social care service use costs for the 42 foster carers in the study came from contacts with social workers with a total cost of &#x000a3;8,470 (mean cost of &#x000a3;202 (SD 207) per carer) over six months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The costs of treating/alleviating depression in the NHS are high. Department of Health figures for the U.K. show that the total investment in adult mental health services is &#x000a3;5,892 billion a year (cost year 2008/09) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thomas and Morris estimated that the direct cost of treating depression, (predominately National Health Service costs) were around &#x000a3;370 million, including; in- and out-patient care, GP consultations and medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Previous research has also found individuals with high levels of depression use more services than those with lower levels of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Based on previous findings this paper aims to;</p><p>1. Explore whether parents who score above the clinical cut-off on the BDI II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] use more health and social services than parents who score below the cut-off.</p><p>2. Explore whether parental depression and frequencies of service use reduce following participation in a parent programme through secondary sub-sample analysis of a previously studied community sample of parents of children with conduct problems who participated in a 12-week IY parenting programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a secondary analysis of data gathered in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the IY Basic Parenting Programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><sec><title>Sample</title><p>The original RCT sample consisted of 153 (Intervention N&#x02009;=&#x02009;104, Control N&#x02009;=&#x02009;49) parents of children aged 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;years old (at baseline) living in 11 disadvantaged Sure Start Areas in north and mid Wales who consented to take part (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] for further details of the original trial). Ethical approval for the original RCT was granted by the North West Wales research ethics committee (ref No 02/12) in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. This was a targeted sample; parents were eligible to take part in the research if their child was &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; of developing CD, as defined by scoring above the clinical cut off on either the Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory (ECBI) Problem or Intensity Scale (11 or 127 respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Parents were randomly assigned, on a 2:1 ratio, to an intervention or a six-month waiting list control group. Randomisation was stratified by gender, and age of index child. The sample size for the sub-sample analysis used in this paper is smaller than the sample in the original trial. Complete service use and depression data was available for 119 parents (Intervention N&#x02009;=&#x02009;75, Control N&#x02009;=&#x02009;44) at baseline and six-month post-baseline follow-up, 75 intervention participants at twelve months and 56 intervention participants at eighteen months post-baseline (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Control families (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;44) were offered the intervention after the six month follow up; therefore, are not included in the analyses past the six-month follow-up. Participants were all included irrespective of uptake of the intervention. Hutchings et al. reported an uptake rate of 9.2 mean sessions attended (SD 3.2) out of 12 sessions offered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

Therefore, non-parametric tests have been used through the analysis; except in the case of the ANOVA, where a logarithmic transformation was performed on service use data using a small shift in the data to eliminate zero frequency counts. This method was used because non-parametric tests did not allow for comparisons of service use between participants who scored above clinical cut-off on the BDI II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and those intervention participants who scored below across all four time-points.

However, these differences were not significant for the control group, though this may be attributed to the small sample size of the control group, which was less than half the size of the intervention group.

These findings suggest that reducing clinical levels of depression as early as possible could result in decreased service use.</p></sec><sec><title>Wider benefits of parenting programmes</title><p>Often, when evaluating interventions the wider impacts such as familial benefits are unexplored by researchers. In previous studies of parenting programmes, the literature has presented outcomes directly linked to children (e.g., child behaviour and/or children&#x02019;s service use) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Relatively little attention has been given to other potential benefactors of parenting programmes such as parents, siblings and extended family. Many public health interventions have more than one primary outcome; some may even have a range of equally important outcomes. Health economists should explore multiple intervention outcomes; unusually in the case of IY studies, UK and Irish health economists have explored child behaviour, parental depression and the use of public sector health and social care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Weatherly et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] advocate using a cost-benefit approach for economic evaluations of public health interventions, such as parenting programmes, in order to consider all costs and benefits. This would enable researchers to assign a primary outcome measure such as child behaviour or service use, but also assign secondary outcomes, such as parental depression, parental service use, sibling behaviour or sibling service use. Hutchings et al. and Bywater et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] explored the impact of the IY Basic parenting programme on siblings of the referred child. Intervention group parents reported significantly less severe intensity of problems in siblings measured by the ECBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] at follow-up, compared with siblings in the control group. Although clinical outcomes were measured for siblings, no assessment of sibling service use benefit was undertaken.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations and future research</title><p>The study was limited by a smaller sample size than available in the main RCT. This was due to lack of both complete clinical and economic data which was required for the analysis. The control group was less than half the size of the intervention group, due to 2:1 randomisation in the main RCT; however, it should be noted the main RCT was powered sufficiently. Comparisons could not be made between intervention and control groups long-term as the control families were offered the intervention after the six-month follow-up. Though it is unethical to deny families an effective intervention, the wait-list control condition presents a limitation of lack of long-term control group data, which would be useful to conduct long-term comparisons 12, 18&#x000a0;months post-baseline. This is a limitation across the field; the Barlow, Coren and Stewart-Brown and Furlong et al. reviews both concluded that, in the short-term, parenting programmes are effective in improving parental psychosocial outcomes and parental mental health, but neither review found many long-term studies with a comparator control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. One long-term study identified in Barlow, Coren and Stewart-Brown&#x02019;s (2009) review, found that reductions in children&#x02019;s behaviour problems led to reductions in mothers&#x02019; depressive symptoms over 2.5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Bywater et al. and Hutchings, Lane and Kelly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] found maintained improvements in parental depression over four years for intervention versus standard treatment families. However, the general lack of long-term studies needs to be addressed in order to build effective interventions that continue to prove beneficial to families as the child grows.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Parents are beneficiaries of parenting programmes. The skills that parents learn at the programme help them to interact more effectively with their children, and provide additional benefits such as reduced depression and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Evaluations of the IY programmes have demonstrated reduced parental depression and are effective and cost-effective in improving child behaviour and decreasing the frequency of child service use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge this paper is the first to explore the service cost implications that a parent programme can have on the health and social care service use of biological parents. Results demonstrate that parents who scored above clinical cut-off on the BDI II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] accessed more health and social services than those who scored below the cut-off. Thus reducing clinical levels of depression as early as possible could result in decreased service use, which could in turn reduce the financial burden upon publically funded national health and social care services. This paper also highlights the need for further exploration of the wider benefits of the IY parenting programme to benefactors other than the target child.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x025cf;&#x02003;A co-morbid link exists between parental depression and child behavioural problems.
