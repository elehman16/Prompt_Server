However, its usefulness for treating dental phobia is unexplored. The aims of the present study are to determine: (a) the efficacy of VRET versus informational pamphlet (IP) control group in terms of dental trait and state anxiety reductions at 1&#x000a0;week, 3&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;months follow-up (b) the real-time physiological arousal [heart rate (HR)] of VRET group participants during and following therapy (c) the relation between subjective (presence) and objective (HR) measures during VRET.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a single blind, randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms in which participants will be allocated to VRET or IP with a ratio of 1:1.

The primary outcome measures include participants&#x02019; dental trait anxiety (Modified Dental Anxiety Scale and Dental Fear Survey) and state anxiety (Visual Analogue Scale) measured at baseline (T0), at intervention (T1), 1-week (T2), 3&#x000a0;months (T3) and 6&#x000a0;months (T4) follow-up. A behavior test will be conducted before and after the intervention.

Given that dental phobia belongs to the most common phobic conditions in our society, finding a suitable specific non-invasive strategy to reduce dental anxiety and treat dental phobia is both warranted and important.</p><p>Exposure based treatment programs are considered as the gold standard in the treatment of specific fears and phobias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], including those related to the dental treatment situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, potential drawbacks include: (a) the difficulty for patients to mentally visualize the anxiety inducing threat as in imaginal exposure therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], (b) the unwillingness of patients to face the actual threat in in vivo exposure therapy (IVET) resulting in refusal or termination of therapy accounting for 25&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], (c) the failure to achieve clinically significant symptom relief, and return of fear, following exposure therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], (d) the poor availability of psychological services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and (e) the high costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] involved with this treatment.</p><p>Recently, VRET has become a viable alternative for in vivo exposure in the treatment of fears and specific phobias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] including claustrophobia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], acrophobia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], fear of flying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and spider phobia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This involves conducting exposure therapy using computer generated Virtual Reality (VR) environments by systematic confrontations of patients with their potentially fear-provoking (i.e., &#x02018;conditioned&#x02019;) stimuli so that habituation occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Compared to IVET, VRET is safer because the patients faces the virtual representation of their threat more gradually in a controlled manner, and at their own pace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As the entire exposure process in VRET is completed under privacy of therapists&#x02019; office it may elicit less fear of social embarrassment to the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] . VRET can be repeated, whenever and, for as many times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] as necessary without incurring any additional costs. In-vivo exposure therapy requires training on the part of therapist and is usually delivered by trained psychologists. Compared to this, administration of VRET may just require a working knowledge of computer operation and basic training to operate the apparatus.</p><p>VRET is known to elicit a feeling of being &#x0201c;present&#x0201d; in the virtual environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This sense of presence is considered to be the essence for the effectiveness of VR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and has been found to be an important mediating variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] between the VR media and the level of anxiety induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Presence in VR is measured subjectively with questionnaires or objectively with physiological measures [e.g., heart rate (HR), body posture, skin conductance level] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. VRET was found to be able to elicit physiologic responses in individuals with fear of flying phobia (measured by HR and skin-conductance) when exposed to VR flights, and these responses decreased following repeated VR exposure flights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Psychophysiological arousal forms the basis for an effective exposure based therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A recent systematic review has suggested that VRET does elicit psychophysiological arousal, thereby rendering it to be a promising treatment modality for treatment of anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, the effect of VRET on HR is inconclusive because of limited well designed studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Also, there is no published research examining the role of VRET in causing psychophysiological arousal in anxious dental patients. Further, studies examining the relationship between subjective presence and physiological responses are limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>A recent meta-analysis suggests VRET to be slightly, but significantly, more effective than IVET (in vivo exposure therapy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Although, VRET provides a powerful means of modifying affect, because of its immersive nature, it has not been tested yet as a therapy for dentally related anxiety or dental phobia. In an effort to answer this question, we will use VRET simulation software for the treatment of dental phobia and test its efficacy in the present study. The primary objective of the present study is to determine the efficacy of VRET versus an informational pamphlet control group in terms of dental trait and state anxiety reductions at 1&#x000a0;week, 3&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;months follow-up among a sample of patients suffering from dental phobia. The secondary objectives are to determine (a) the real-time effect of VRET on the course of participant&#x02019;s physiological response (HR) on exposure with a series of dentally related cues during therapy and (b) the relation between subjective (i.e., presence) and more objective (i.e., HR) measures during VRET. It is hypothesized that: (a) VRET would result in a significantly reduced level of dental trait anxiety [measured by MDAS (Modified Dental Anxiety Scale) and Dental Fear Survey (DFS)] and state anxiety [indexed by VAS-A (Visual Analogue Scale-Anxiety)] at 1&#x000a0;week, 3&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;months follow-up compared to the informational pamphlet control group, (b) VRET would result in significantly higher reduced physiological arousal (i.e., HR) to dental anxious stimuli/cues relative to the baseline HR values following therapy, (c) VRET will demonstrate a positive correlation between subjective and objective measures of &#x02018;presence&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study will be conducted in compliance with local regulations and internationally established principles of the declaration of Helsinki (64<sup>th</sup> World Medical Association General Assemble, Fortaleza, Brazil, 2013).

Training will be provided by a clinical psychologist and Virtual Simulations Inc. When participants assigned for VRET visit the dental office the researcher records the unique reference number and initiates the VRET session. The Simulator PC, UI PC and video camera are turned on. Participants will be seated in a supine position comfortably in the dental chair and will be assisted in wearing the HMD (in OFF mode) and HR bracelet (left hand) by the researcher. Also, a hand held computer mouse will be given to the participants which acts as a panic button. The participants will hold the computer mouse with their right hand and will be instructed how to activate the panic button by clicking the mouse (under their control) when the presented scenario feels unbearable to them during the VRET session. The simulator PC is connected with the UI PC. On the UI window the researcher enters the patient/subject name, connects the UI with VR simulator by entering VR Internet Protocol address and presses the start button of the log record for real time HR recording continuously during the session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Phases of VRET session: The phases are depicted in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref></title><sec id="FPar3"><title>Baseline phase</title><p>During this phase, the participants will see no display (Black screen) through the HMD (In OFF mode) for 10&#x000a0;minutes.

In general, participants may show a higher physiological response when exposed to see something novel, this is referred to as orientation effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. To overcome this, the participants in this phase will first view a surrounding 3D (3 Dimensional) stereoscopic scene of simulated dental environment through the HMD and only take a passive role by watching the interactive scene for 2&#x000a0;minutes. The participants are encouraged to turn his head and look around the virtual dentist&#x02019;s office by way of the built-in motion tracking present in the HMD. Thus, the test subject will be lying on a real dentist chair while he will see its virtual counterpart inside the HMD as he looks around, turning his head. To allow the test subject to feel immersed in the virtual environment, we will include a generic 3D model of a person lying on the dentist chair such that when looking down, the subject will see what feels like his own body. The virtual environment seen by the patient will be displayed to the researcher on the computer screen and the HR will also be recorded.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Experimental phase</title><p>In this phase, participants are exposed to five different VR scenarios (Idle, Mirror, Syringe, Drill with no sound, Drill with sound). The duration of each exposure will be 35&#x000a0;seconds. The interactive part of the simulated dental environment will be controlled by the researcher using the tool selection option on the UI window of the computer. The researcher will be able to control the playback of the VR scenarios.</p><p>VRET is conducted using a pre-determined hierarchy as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Scenario #1 (Idle).

This shows the virtual dentist picking the drill.

To give the participants a gradual and optimal VRET, participants will be encouraged to rate their anxiety every 35&#x000a0;seconds following immersion with each VR scenario exposure by means of SUDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The general rule applied during exposure therapy is that the exposure is continued until the subjective score of the patient is reduced to less than 50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].The VRET which we are planning to use in the current experiment has only a limited set of stimuli. Accordingly, we have decided to have a safe cut off of &#x02264;2 SUDS scores before moving to the next VR scenario. This criterion was earlier applied in a similar study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The exposures with scenario 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are repeated p,q,r,s and t times respectively until SUDS score of &#x02264;2 is achieved. For instance, when participant reaches &#x02264;2 SUDS with VR scenario of sitting idle on the dental chair then the next VR scenario of inspecting the oral cavity with a dental mirror is introduced. In subsequent sessions, the intensity of VR experiences will be progressively increased from a less threatening scenario to a more threatening scenario to make the simulation more realistic while focusing on areas of particular stress. For example, if a dental phobic participant report a fear of drills, the exposure is progressively increased from Scenario-1 (less fear evoking &#x02013;&#x02018;Sitting in the dental chair&#x02019;) to Scenario-5 (more fear evoking &#x02013;&#x02018;Drill with sound&#x02019;). To this end, situational cues that are simulated with VR scenarios are presented by the therapist in a well-controlled manner. During the simulated dental procedure participants will be asked to keep their mouth open similar to real dental experience from Scenario #2 (Examination with mirrors) through Scenario #5 (Drill with sound) and are advised to follow the instructions of the researcher, for example &#x02018;to open their mouth really wide&#x02019;. The added stimulus such as keeping the mouth open will be standardized and applied to all the participants. Participants will receive the therapy in one long session for 150&#x000a0;minutes with a 10-min break/s to avoid simulator sickness. If the participant&#x02019;s SUDS rating has not decreased to 2 with any of the VR scenarios within 30&#x000a0;minutes of exposure the researcher will continue with the next VR scenario. The session will be video recorded for future validations and analysis of the subject&#x02019;s body response during the VRET exposure.</p><p>Only verbal guidance and exposure techniques will be used on the participants during VRET. There will be no relaxation or other CBT-based interventions during therapy. Participants will be instructed to become as involved as possible and focus on their most frightening stimuli of the particular part of the virtual environment (describing the situation, any strange sensations and their feelings). This will be done to avoid dissociation from the VR experience. During the simulated treatment, real-time recording of the psychophysiological parameters (HR) will be determined to obtain more &#x02018;objective&#x02019; measures of the physiological state of the participants during therapy. The HR responses obtained with different cues (Idle, Mirror, Syringe, Drill with no sound and Drill with sound) in this phase will be compared with the baseline phase (No display) to study the HR variations. The subjective measures of presence, realism and nausea (cybersickness) are recorded following the 1<sup>st</sup> exposure of each VR scenario as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Immediate post-therapy phase</title><p>In this phase, the HR is recorded for 10&#x000a0;minutes and the participants are asked to fill out a series of self-reported measures as displayed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and undergo the Behavioral Avoidance Test. The total number of VR exposures with each VR scenario will be summed up and recorded by the researcher. Also, the participants fill out the questionnaire on over-all presence, realism and nausea (cybersickness).

We used the difference between two independent means&#x02019; for sample estimation (independent-samples t-test). In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] the response within each subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation (MDAS) 4.22. If the true difference in the experimental and control means (MDAS) is 6, we will need to study 12 experimental subjects and 12 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.9. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. Since drop-outs are unavoidable when collecting follow-up data, the sample number needs to be adjusted for the estimated drop-out rate. We are estimating a drop-out rate of 15&#x000a0;% in this study. Adjusting the sample for 15&#x000a0;% drop-out and 10&#x000a0;% for VR crash results in sample of 30 participants (15 experimental and 15 control participants).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The analyses will be performed based on the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement regarding e-health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

All data will be analyzed using an intention-to-treat analysis. We will also conduct a per protocol analyses. Descriptive statistics will be calculated, whereas discrete variables will be summarized by frequencies or proportions. Continuous variables will be reported as means and standard deviations or medians and range (depending on the measurement level of the variables). Data will be checked for differences at T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4 between the VRET and informational pamphlet group using independent samples t-test.

Therefore, we developed (KR, ADJ and MB) a VRET device based on exposure therapy models and will be testing the efficacy of this intervention among people with dental phobia immediately after therapy, 1&#x000a0;week, 3&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;months post therapy, and will be comparing with the results of an informational pamphlet intervention.</p><p>In recent years VRET has become a viable treatment alternative for in vivo exposure therapy as evidence based treatment for specific phobias with the advantage of allowing patients to face their fears in a controlled and thus safe, environment. Patients may not feel the anticipatory fear of getting hurt as they are aware that the VRET simulation is purely virtual and that these situations can be stopped, paused, restarted as well as repeated, whenever, for as many times as deemed necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Accordingly, patients&#x02019; acceptance of VRET could be relatively high.</p><p>Another important advantage of the application of VRET for dental phobia is that it may not require specialized training and the entire exposure process can be completed by a computer in the safety and privacy of the practitioner&#x02019;s office [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To this end, the study is a feasibility study. If proved successful, the VRET device can be rendered by any dental auxiliaries in a general dental practice which could make it a cost-effective solution. For example, because VR technology has applications in telemedicine, in which diagnosis and treatment can be administered from a distant site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This may make VRET applicable in rural dental clinics, in which the therapist might not be available at long distances and the therapist views on a monitor with which the subject is interacting, and comment appropriately and therapeutically.</p><p>The strengths of our study design include randomized group allocation, use of validated standardized assessments and a long term follow-up. A limitation of the present study is the absence of IVET as gold standard control group. Yet, it is hoped that the findings of this study will provide evidence in support of the efficacy of VRET and therefore will be an important step in the treatment of dental phobia in the setting of the dental practice.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>3D</term><def><p>3 Dimensional</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>cognitive behavioural therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>consolidated standards of reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM</term><def><p>diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DFS</term><def><p>dental fear survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HMD</term><def><p>head mounted display</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HR</term><def><p>heart rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IP</term><def><p>informational pamphlet control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IVET</term><def><p>in vivo exposure therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MANOVA</term><def><p>multivariate analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDAS</term><def><p>modified dental anxiety scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PC</term><def><p>personal computer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomized controlled trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SUDS</term><def><p>subjective unit for distress/disturbance scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UI</term><def><p>user-interface</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS-A</term><def><p>visual analogue scale for anxiety</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VR</term><def><p>virtual reality</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VRET</term><def><p>virtual reality exposure therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VRS</term><def><p>verbal rating scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contribution</bold></p><p>All authors contributed to the design of the protocol article.
