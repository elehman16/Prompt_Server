In a head-to-head comparison of the effects of minodronate with alendronate in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients, daily 1&#x000a0;mg minodronate resulted in similar increases in lumbar spine (LS) and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) after 12&#x000a0;months with similar safety profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted in Japan revealed that daily 1&#x000a0;mg minodronate reduced vertebral fractures by 59% in postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Daily 1&#x000a0;mg minodronate has been approved to treat involutional osteoporosis in Japan.</p><p>Most oral bisphosphonates originally developed as a daily regimen have been shown to have equivalent efficacy with weekly and/or monthly regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Since less frequent dosing, preferred by most patients, could result in better treatment compliance with better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], we conducted a study to determine if minodronate could be administered as a monthly regimen. The present randomized, double-blind, active-controlled 1-year study was undertaken to determine whether or not once monthly oral minodronate at doses of 30 and 50&#x000a0;mg provides similar efficacy and safety as the 1-mg daily regimen in patients with involutional osteoporosis. The primary efficacy analysis was the test of the noninferiority of the mean percent change from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS-BMD) in the monthly minodronate groups compared with the daily dose group after 1&#x000a0;year. The safety profiles of the monthly 30- and 50-mg regimens and the daily 1-mg regimen were also compared.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient enrollment</title><p>We studied men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, aged 51 to 89&#x000a0;years, who had a BMD below 70% (T-score &#x02212;2.6 at the LS) of the young adult mean (YAM) or a BMD below 80% (T-score &#x02212;1.7 at the LS) of the YAM with at least one fragility fracture, as defined by the criteria of the Japanese Society for Bone and Mineral Research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Vertebral fractures were assessed by X-ray films of the vertebrae and were diagnosed in accordance with the criteria of the Japanese Society for Bone and Mineral Research. Men with a total hip BMD below 70% (T-score &#x02212;2.6 at the total hip) of the YAM were also eligible. Subjects were excluded if they had disorders such as primary hyperparathyroidism; Cushing's syndrome; premature menopause due to hypothalamic, pituitary or gonadal insufficiency, or other causes of secondary osteoporosis; or if there were any radiographic findings that might affect bone densitometry assessment. Subjects with peptic ulcer were excluded. Subjects were excluded if they had received bisphosphonate injections, strontium, or RANKL antibody at any time. Subjects were also excluded if they had taken oral bisphosphonates within the previous 1&#x000a0;year or for at least 30&#x000a0;days during the previous 2&#x000a0;years up until 1&#x000a0;year before the first dose of the study medication. Subjects were also excluded if they had taken glucocorticoids, calcitonin, vitamin K, active vitamin D compounds, or hormone replacement therapy within the previous 2&#x000a0;months; had serum calcium (Ca) levels above 10.6&#x000a0;mg/dL (2.6&#x000a0;mmol/L) or below 8.0&#x000a0;mg/dL (2.0&#x000a0;mmol/L); had serum creatinine levels above 1.5&#x000a0;mg/dL (133&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L); or had clinically significant hepatic disorders.</p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards. All subjects gave written informed consent before undergoing any examination or study procedure, all of which were conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice. Eligibility of patients for enrollment was evaluated by H. Hagino&#x02014;Rehabilitation Division, Tottori University Hospital, Yonago; M.

Subjects who met all the entry criteria were enrolled and sequentially assigned an allocation number independent of study site. Subjects were randomized to take minodronate (Astellas Pharma Inc., Tokyo, Japan) at 1&#x000a0;mg daily, 30&#x000a0;mg monthly, or 50&#x000a0;mg monthly for 12&#x000a0;months. We selected 30-mg monthly dose because it is equivalent to 30-day daily dose of 1&#x000a0;mg. The dose of 50&#x000a0;mg dose was selected based on the pharmacokinetics study (data not shown) that demonstrated monthly bone exposure comparable to daily 1&#x000a0;mg would require 42- to 56-mg single monthly doses because of lower absorption with larger single doses.</p><p>Randomization was performed using a computerized system. Subjects were instructed to take their tablet on arising and 30&#x000a0;min before food with plain water. All subjects received daily calcium (610&#x000a0;mg) and vitamin D (400&#x000a0;IU) supplementation once a day after the evening meal. Compliance with the study treatment was assessed through medication diaries and by counting residual medication supplies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>The primary endpoint of the study was the test of the noninferiority of the mean percent change from baseline in the lumbar spine (L2&#x02013;L4) BMD at 12&#x000a0;months of treatment with the study medication. Secondary endpoints of the study included mean percent change from baseline in the total hip BMD, relative changes in bone turnover markers, and the occurrence of new morphometric vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessment of BMD</title><p>The lumbar spine (L2&#x02013;L4) and the total hip were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12&#x000a0;months to determine BMD. All 31 study centers involved in this trial were equipped with a Hologic QDR series for BMD measurements. A central facility (Department of Nuclear Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan by T. Sone) performed quality assurance of the longitudinal adjustment. The DXA machines were adjusted for differences and each machine was calibrated with standardized phantoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Assessment of bone turnover</title><p>Serum and urine samples were collected at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12&#x000a0;months for measurement of bone turnover markers, including urine type I collagen N-telopeptide (NTX; Osteomark, Inverness Medical Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), urine deoxypyridinoline (DPD; Osteolinks &#x0201c;DPD&#x0201d;; Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA) after acid hydrolysis, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP; AccessR OstaseR; Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA), serum osteocalcin (BGP-IRMA; Mitsubishi Chemical Medience Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), serum Ca (Iatrofine Ca II; Mitsubishi Chemical Medience Corporation), and serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH; ECLusys &#x0201c;PTH&#x0201d;; Roche Diagnostics K.K., Tokyo, Japan). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D 125I RIA Kit; DiaSorin Inc., Saluggia, Italy) was also determined at baseline. When possible, the samples for each subject were collected around the same time of day to avoid the influence of daily fluctuations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Assessment of vertebral fractures</title><p>Lateral radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine were taken at the screening visit to determine the presence of prevalent fractures. Subjects were enrolled based on a visual assessment of prevalent fractures in T4 to L4. All the radiologic specifications and the levels of vertebra at the thoracic and lumbar spine were standardized throughout the study sites. The assessment of prevalent fractures was made if the ratio of anterior or middle vertebral body height to the posterior vertebral body height was less than 0.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Quantitative and semiquantitative techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] were used to identify incident vertebral fractures in order to determine efficacy. Lateral radiographs of the spine were performed at 12&#x000a0;months for the assessment of incident fractures. A new vertebral fracture was diagnosed if the anterior, posterior, or middle vertebral height had decreased by at least 15% and by 4&#x000a0;mm in a vertebra that was normal at baseline, or diagnosed semiquantitatively by grade progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Morphological diagnosis of fractures was made by quantitative and semiquantitative assessment of the images using the sequence of films at the central reading facilities of the University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Fukuoka, Japan by T. Nakamura.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Assessment of nonvertebral fractures</title><p>All nonvertebral fractures were identified symptomatically as clinical fractures, and only nontraumatic fractures assessed by investigators were reported. Suspected clinical fractures at six nonvertebral sites (humerus, radius/ulna, subclavia, pelvis, femur, and tibia/fibula) were adjudicated radiographically, and only radiographically confirmed fractures were listed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Assessment of adverse events</title><p>All subjects were questioned about treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) at each visit, and all adverse events reported were analyzed regardless of the investigators' assessments of causality.

The primary hypothesis was tested using an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The ITT population comprised all randomized subjects. The primary analysis used a last observation carried forward approach for missing values. A Dunnett's test was used to determine the noninferiority of each of the monthly minodronate groups compared to the daily minodronate group. Noninferiority was to be declared if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of difference did not exceed the predefined noninferiority margin of &#x02212;1.9%.</p><p>The group mean and standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE) were calculated for the baseline characteristics, the percent changes from baseline in LS-BMD, total hip BMD, and bone turnover markers and were used to assess the significance of changes between each of the monthly minodronate groups and the daily minodronate group. A Dunnett's test was used to determine whether each of the monthly minodronate groups was significantly different from the daily minodronate group. A paired <italic>t</italic> test was used to determine whether each of the measured values was significantly different from the baseline. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Drug Development (SAS Institute).

The changes in bone turnover markers were also similar between both monthly regimens and the daily regimen. Safety profiles for the monthly regimens were similar to that of the daily regimen. These results suggest that minodronate, for which a daily dose has been shown to have antivertebral fragility fracture (VFx) efficacy, can be administered monthly in the same manner as risedronate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and ibandronate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, there was a transient decrease in the serum Ca level and a transient increase in the serum PTH level. The magnitudes and time courses of these changes were slightly different among different regimens. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, although statistically nonsignificant, the magnitude of the inhibition of bone resorption markers was numerically different among groups especially at early time points. This may well be reflected to the differences in the changes of serum Ca and PTH. However, the responses in terms of BMD and bone turnover markers were not different among the three groups. Thus, the influence of subtle differences in Ca and PTH on bone was not clear. Similar transient changes in Ca and PTH were previously reported with oral alendronate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and risedronate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] without known effects on bone.</p><p>The major limitation of the present study was that it did not have the power to assess antifracture efficacy. However, BMD change has been accepted as a valid surrogate endpoint when evaluating a new dosage schedule for a bisphosphonate for which a fracture benefit has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus far, no oral bisphosphonate has demonstrated antifracture efficacy with a weekly or monthly regimen in randomized controlled trials. The magnitude of BMD change by monthly minodronate in the present study was similar to that achieved by daily minodronate in the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The changes in bone turnover markers were also comparable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These data suggest that the monthly and daily regimens of minodronate would be equally beneficial to bone. Another limitation in this study was that only a limited number of men were recruited. Thus, it was impossible to analyze whether or not minodronate would be equally effective to men as well. However, when the data from all three regimens were combined and analyzed using a per protocol set, the LS-BMD change from the baseline to the end of the study was 5.33% (95% CI 3.00&#x02013;7.66) in men (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9), which was comparable to that in women (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;605) [6.39% (6.09&#x02013;6.70)]. The change in hip BMD was 1.10% (95% CI &#x02212;0.34 to 2.53) in men (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8), which was smaller than that in women (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;591) [2.94% (2.74&#x02013;3.13)]. The changes in metabolic bone markers were numerically smaller in men compared with women: changes in serum BALP were &#x02212;37.3% (&#x02212;52.5 to &#x02212;22.1) in men vs &#x02212;54.1% (&#x02212;55.3 to &#x02212;52.9) in women; serum BGP were &#x02212;43.8% (&#x02212;50.7 to &#x02212;36.9) in men vs &#x02212;53.4% (&#x02212;54.5 to 52.4) in women; urinary NTX were &#x02212;49.3% (&#x02212;65.0 to &#x02212;33.5) in men vs &#x02212;64.5% (&#x02212;66.4 to &#x02212;62.5) in women; and urinary DPD were &#x02212;19.8% (&#x02212;37.3 to &#x02212;2.8) in men vs &#x02212;26.9% (&#x02212;28.7 to &#x02212;25.0). Further studies would be needed to evaluate whether there would be sex difference in the responses to minodronate.</p><p>The present study demonstrated that oral minodronate administered monthly has comparable efficacy and safety to the daily regimen, which has been shown to have anti-VFx efficacy. This new monthly regimen will give patients with osteoporosis a new dosage option for minodronate, which may lead to better medication compliance for this bisphosphonate.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Astellas Pharma Inc. for their scientific and technical support, Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. for providing supportive data and the following investigators and clinical sites in Japan which participated in this study: M.
