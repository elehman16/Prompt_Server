The incidence and prevalence rates of HF are increasing annually due to an aging populations, along with an increase in the prevalence rate of chronic systemic disorders, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> The average age of patients with HF is also decreasing. The therapeutic goal of HF is to avoid any aggravating symptoms, improve health-related quality of life (QOL), and decrease the costs of health care.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup></p><p>Although several reports have suggested that the mortality rate of patients with HF is improving, the overall mortality rate still remains high. It has been estimated that more than 23% of rehospitalizations for HF<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> occur within 60 to 90 days, while less than 50% of patients with HF will survive for more than 5 years.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> According to the registry data of the American Heart Association (AHA) for Projections, the prevalence of HF will increase by<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> 46% between 2012 and 2030, where patients with HF who are younger than 65 years old will have a 6 to 9 times greater risk of experiencing sudden cardiac death when compared with that of the general population.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> The huge medical expense of HF leads to a heavy economic burden on both the patient's family and the health care system. Previous studies have shown that some symptoms of HF, including fatigue and dyspnea on exertion, make the daily activities of patients with HF intolerable.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Additionally, the aggravated symptoms of HF may cause depression, anxiety, and a compromised QOL for the patient.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>Several studies have shown that cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs are both safe and effective for improving functional capacity and QOL, as well as for reducing the readmission rates and all-cause mortality of patients with HF.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> The results of many clinical trials have established the benefits of hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation for patients with HF.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Home-based cardiac rehabilitation may be more accessible and acceptable when compared with hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation.

We explained in detail the purpose and methods of the study to all staff, including cardiologists, physical therapists, and nurses. HF patients with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) from the general ward, the intensive care unit, along with outpatients from the department of cardiology, all taken from a single medical center in central Taiwan were included in this study. The chosen patients were well informed of the content of the study and were required to sign a consent form before joining the study. Patients were eligible to withdraw from the study at any time. We randomly assigned patients into the control group and interventional group. Data were scrambled before being made available to researchers in order to ensure that individual identifying information at any level could not be obtained from the database. Clinical data of patients in the study were collected by both nurses and case managers within the cardiology department. The study then proceeded after obtaining permission from the hospital's Institutional Review Board (IRB).</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Study subjects</title><p>HF patients in either the ward or outpatient department with a left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 50% were included in this study.

HF patients with a preserved ejection fraction (LVEF &#x0003e;50%) were excluded from this study due to a difficulty with performing a dedicated evaluation.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Measurements</title><p>All patients had to sign a consent form before joining this study. We recorded each patient's general data, including body height, body weight, and laboratory data during their admission and outpatient visits. We then evaluated each patients&#x02019; QOL using the Minnesota Living With HF Questionnaire (<italic>MLHFQ</italic>) during the study period. We also monitored several parameters including <inline-graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e9629-i005.jpg"/> peak, anaerobic threshold (AT) through use of the Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPET) and the 6 Minutes Walking Test (6MWT) in order to evaluate the change exercise tolerance during the study period. According to the data obtained from both the CPET and 6MWT, we designed an individualized home-based cardiac rehabailitation program according to each patient's willingness. In addition, we monitored the parameters of their hemodynamics status, including stroke volume (SV), LVEF, and thoracic fluid index (TFI), by using a noninvasive cardiac output monitor (Aesculon [Osypka Medical, Berlin, Germany]) during the study period. We measured the patients&#x02019; general data and physiologic parameters in both groups at the beginning of the study and also 3 months later. Finally, we compared all collected data from both groups to evaluate both the change of exercise tolerance and QOL in the patients. Medications were not changed in any patient during the course of the study.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Exercise training protocol</title><p>In the interventional group, we collected general data and parameters using the same methods as we did for the control group. In addition, patients in the interventional group received outpatient cardiac rehabilitation for 1 week, before starting home-based cardiac rehabilitation. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation was conducted by requesting the interventional group to carry out aerobic exercise at least 3 times per week, for a duration of at least 30 minutes each time. Each patient was required to perform cardiac rehabilitation with an intensity measuring 60% to 80% of peak heart rate, based on the results of his or her initial CPET. The required exercise intensity was measured subjectively using a Borg score of 12 to 13.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> The types of exercises prescribed were based upon individual interests and abilities, and included walking (47.3%), jogging (5.4%), and stationary cycling (47.3%). The control group was instructed to maintain both their standard medical care and previous activity levels.</p><p>Regular home-based cardiac rehabilitation was to be performed for at least 3 months in the interventional group, and all data including CPET and 6MWD were collected after completion of the home-based cardiac rehabilitation. Medical education regarding HF was also provided by the nursing staff during admission and the case manager in the outpatient department both groups.

In the control group, 3 patients died during the study period, 8 were lost during follow-up, while 11 had incomplete data at the end of the study. As a result, this total of 22 patients in the control group were excluded from the study. In the interventional group, 3 patients could not complete the cardiac rehabilitation course, 4 patients refused to receive the final test, and 9 were lost to follow-up. Therefore, a total of 16 patients in this group were excluded from the study. In the end, there were 18 HF cases in the control group and 19 HF cases in the interventional group. Within the interventional group, 6 of the 19 patients experienced ischemic cardiomyopathy, 2 patients had received coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, while 9 of the 19 patients had received cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) before the start of the cardiac rehabilitation program. Within the control group, 3 of the 18 patients experienced ischemic cardiomyopathy, no patient had undergone CABG surgery, while 8 of 18 patients had received CRT.

At the 3-month follow-up period, the interventional group showed a significant reduction in the readmission rate within 90 days, decreasing from the average rate of 14% to 5%.

Nevertheless, previous studies have shown that approximately 20% to 50% of patients with HF are unable to comply with hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation programs in the first 3 to 6 months.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> As a result, home-based cardiac rehabilitation programs are shown to be more convenient, and may be an acceptable alternative option for patients with chronic HF.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Such home-based programs may therefore be a more practical strategy for motivating patients to continue exercise.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Several published studies have shown that home-based exercise training could improve both <inline-graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e9629-i013.jpg"/> peak and 6MWD.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> This is similar to our results, which showed an improved <inline-graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e9629-i014.jpg"/> peak of 2.7&#x0200a;mL/kg/min, an improved AT of 1.2&#x0200a;mL/kg/min, along with an improvement in 6MWD of 41&#x0200a;m.</p></sec><sec><label>4.3</label><title>Improvement in QOL</title><p>Several previous studies have shown that rehabilitation programs can lead to a statistically significant improvement in QOL for patients with HF.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> However, it remains controversial whether home-based cardiac rehabilitation benefits QOL or not. According to the results of our study, we observed that patients in the interventional group showed a significantly improved QOL after 3 months&#x02019; follow-up, compared with the control group. The improvement in QOL is also related to the improvement in exercise tolerance. In addition to the benefits that cardiac rehabilitation provides, a further advantage it has is the easy integration of a home-based cardiac rehabilitation into a patient's life. A home-based rehabilitation program has a lower impact on a patient's daily life. In contrast, there was a decrease in <inline-graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e9629-i015.jpg"/> peak and AT in the control group, which did not show any improvement in QOL.

The results of this study were thus similar to the findings of previous research. Short-term, home-based cardiac rehabilitation no significant benefits to cardiac physiologic function. However, more long-term research is still required in order to evaluate the effects of such exercise programs on cardiac physiologic function. In our study, both groups experienced a lower TFI at 3 months, compared with that at the beginning of the study. Traditional treatment for HF, including medical therapy, diet education, and lifestyle modification, still provided benefits toward the control of fluid status in patients with HF. Although short-term rehabilitation had no effect on heart function, the improvement in both <inline-graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e9629-i017.jpg"/> peak and AT may play an important role in functional capacity and QOL.</p></sec><sec><label>4.6</label><title>Limitations</title><p>A limited number of subjects, high rate of loss follow-up, and a predominantly male subject pool are the limitations within this study. In addition, the study period may have been too short to see the full benefits of cardiac rehabilitation on the improvement of heart function.
