Propofol has been reported to protect several organs from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) induced injury. We performed a randomized clinical trial to compare propofol and sevoflurane for their effects on renal I/R injury in patients undergoing elective AAA repair.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Fifty patients scheduled for elective AAA repair were randomized to receive propofol anesthesia in group I or sevoflurane anesthesia in group II. Urinary specific kidney proteins (N-acetyl-beta-glucosamidase, alpha-1-microglobulin, glutathione transferase [GST]-pi, GST-alpha) were measured within 5 min of starting anesthesia as a base line (T<sub>0</sub>), at the end of surgery (T<sub>1</sub>), 8 h after surgery (T<sub>2</sub>), 16 h after surgery (T<sub>3</sub>), and 24 h postoperatively (T<sub>4</sub>). Serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and interleukin 1-&#x003b2;) were measured at the same time points. In addition, serum creatinine and cystatin C were measured before starting surgery as a baseline and at days 1, 3, and 6 after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Postoperative urinary concentrations of all measured kidney specific proteins and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly lower in the propofol group.

Aortic cross-clamping below the kidney triggers renal vasoconstriction that is associated with a redistribution of blood flow from the medullary to the cortical compartment.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This renal vasoconstriction may be due to changes in the humoral and neurogenic factors that regulate renal blood flow or may be triggered by aortic cross-clamping induced turbulence in blood flow inside the aorta at the level of the kidney. In addition, increase in renin activity may have been induced by aortic cross-clamping.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The subsequent reduction in renal blood flow may expose the cells of the renal tubules to ischemic injury.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Furthermore, the renal tubular cells suffer I/R injury after release of the clamping that is accompanied with a neutrophil-mediated systemic response.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The pathophysiology of renal I/R injury is complex.

The study was carried out between February, 2012 and April, 2014. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients and Institutional Review Board of Minoufiya Faculty of Medicine has approved the study (Ref: 11/A213/352). The study was registered with PACTR201505001095139.</p><p>All the operations were performed by the same surgical team through a mini-laparotomy approach. Thorough clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and laboratory investigations were performed as a routine diagnostic check-up.</p><p>Patients were excluded from the study if they needed concomitant procedures other than AAA repair, had experienced an acute coronary syndrome within 3 months, or were &#x0003e;85 years of age.</p><p>Bisoprolol was prescribed preoperatively in a dose of 5 mg daily in the absence of contra-indications (heart rate below 60 bpm or systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;100 mm Hg). Cardiac medications were continued up to the day of surgery.</p><p>The patients were randomly allocated to receive propofol (<italic>n</italic> = 25) or sevoflurane (<italic>n</italic> = 25) anesthesia using a random number table generated by Microsoft Excel. An independent statistician was assigned to perform central randomization to ensure proper concealment of the study management from the patients and investigators until the release of the final statistical results.</p><p>In the propofol group, general anesthesia was induced with propofol 1.5-2 mg/kg and fentanyl 3 &#x003bc;g/kg. Tracheal intubation was facilitated by administration of cis-atracurium 0.1 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with a continuous infusion of propofol 4-6 mg/kg/h, and cis-atracurium 2 &#x003bc;g/kg/min. In the sevoflurane group, anesthesia was induced as above but maintained with sevoflurane 1 MAC and cis-atracurium 2 &#x003bc;g/kg/min. The bispectral index electrode (BIS-Sensor, Aspect Medical Systems, USA) was positioned on the patient's forehead to monitor depth of anesthesia where BIS value was kept between 45 and 55 in both groups through modulating propofol infusion rate or sevoflurane concentration. In the operating room, a radial arterial catheter and multiple peripheral IV catheters were inserted. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure and oxygen saturation were continuously monitored during the whole procedure. Fluid loading was performed with 1.0 L of 6% 130/0.4 hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) infusion. Fluid and blood replacements were adjusted to maintain patient hematocrit value above 30%. Norepinephrine and nicardipine were used if required (if mean arterial blood pressure changed by more than 20%) to maintain hemodynamic stability. Normothermia was maintained with fluid warming and forced air warming (Bair-Hugger). Blood glucose level was kept normoglycemic (3.9-8.3 mmol/L). One analyst was blinded in respect to the drug under study during the procedure by covering the lines, infusion pump, gas analyzer, and by numeric codes during the whole process of data evaluation. Furthermore, physicians who were charged for postoperative care of patients and for their discharges from intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital were effectively blinded to the study design. The patients stayed in the ICU till return to their preoperative physiological homeostasis including stable hemodynamics, adequate ventilation, normothermia, and satisfactory pain control. Hospital discharge was guided by the ability to ambulate independently and to tolerate oral feeding.</p><p>Epidural analgesia was performed before starting anesthesia at the T8-T10 level by inserting an epidural catheter (Braun perifix 18 ba and a microporous filter).</p><p>A test dose of 4 ml 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 5 &#x003bc;g/ml was used for testing intrathecal or intravascular injection, respectively. Epidural block activation was performed by injecting 12 ml of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.25%. Furthermore, 4 ml was injected 2 h later as a maintenance dose and every hour thereafter for postoperative epidural analgesia. Acetaminophen IV was also used postoperatively if needed.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Assessment of kidney function</title><p>All patients had a bladder catheter. The following assays were performed on urine specimens, taken within 5 min of starting anesthesia as a base line (T<sub>0</sub>), at the end of surgery (T<sub>1</sub>), 8h after surgery (T<sub>2</sub>), 16h after surgery (T<sub>3</sub>), and 24 h postoperatively (T<sub>4</sub>): N-acetyl-beta-dglucosamidase (beta-NAG) analyzed by a spectrophotometric method, normal value 0-7 U/L, intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation 3.9%; alpha-1-microglobulin (alpha-1-M) assessed by immunonephelometry, normal value &#x0003c;14 mg/L, intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation 3.7%; glutathione transferase-pi (GST-pi) measured by enzyme immunoassay, normal value 12-15 &#x003bc;g/L, intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation 4.6%; and GST-alpha measured by enzyme immunoassay, normal value 3.5-11 &#x003bc;g/L, intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation 3.5%.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In addition, the plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines, (tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; [TNF-&#x003b1;] and interleukin-1&#x003b2; [IL-1&#x003b2;]) were measured at the same time points. Blood samples were immediately centrifuged and the serum separated, divided into aliquots, and placed in Eppendorf tubes and frozen at -80&#x000b0;C until assay. Commercial kits were used for the determination of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] Kit; Biomed, Diepenbeek, Belgium) based on ELISA. Recordings were carried out on a plate reader (GEST, General ELISA System Technology, Menarini Labs, Badalona, Spain) for the automatic ELISA technique in triplicate. The lower limit of detection of the assay for TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; were 10.7 and 4.2 pg/ml, respectively.

Wang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] demonstrated a protective effect of propofol in renal I/R injury in rats and suggested that this was due to the induction of the heme oxygenase-1 expression. In a study comparing propofol against sevoflurane for their effects on the systemic inflammatory response during aortic surgery in pigs, propofol anesthesia was associated with less neutrophil infiltration, lower plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, lower production of oxygen free radicals, less lipid peroxidation, and reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase activity.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Another mechanism for renal protective effect of propofol was reported by a study by Feng <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] where pretreatment with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml propofol protected human proximal renal tubular epithelial cells against anoxia-reoxygenation injury at clinically relevant concentrations by regulating the expression of apoptosis related genes. Assad <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported that protection by propofol was probably due to a preconditioning effect and was at least in part mediated by KATP channels.

In another study, Lee <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] approved sevoflurane protection against renal I/R injury in cultured human proximal tubular cells and reported that this protection was through activation of the TGF-&#x003b2;1signaling pathways.

However, these markers are not specific to the kidney.</p><p>Some studies have reported that hyrdroxy ethyl starch infusion may have negative impact on kidney function.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In our study, both groups were comparable regarding volume of hyrdroxy ethyl starch infused and this fact can eliminate its effect on our results.</p><p>One limitation of the present study is the use of urinary alpha-1-M as a marker of renal tubular dysfunction (since its increase suggests impaired reabsorption by the tubules and hence tubular dysfunction). It should be emphasized that increased tubular dysfunction is not necessarily a bad thing as it suggests temporary dysfunction of the tubules, less renal tubular work, and less tubular oxygen consumption. In fact increased alpha-1-M can be argued as being renoprotective through reducing renal workload and hence oxygen demand at a time of reduced oxygen delivery.</p><p>Our study suffers from an additional number of limitations. With the exception of serum creatinine, the renal function measures used are at best subclinical markers of renal dysfunction and injury and the clinical application of this work would require clinically used measures of renal function with greater patient numbers in the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have demonstrated that the use of propofol significantly reduced renal injury after elective open AAA repair and this could have clinical implications in situations of expected renal I/R injury as patients suffering from hemorrhagic, traumatic, or septic shock, and certain surgical procedures including renal transplantation or abdominal aortic surgery.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Minoufiya University is funding the research.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the operating room and ICU staff in Minoufiya University Hospital for their support in conducting the study procedures.
