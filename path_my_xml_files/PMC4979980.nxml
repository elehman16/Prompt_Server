On one hand, many were reluctant to withhold a vaccine that might prevent a fatal disease from study participants randomized to a control arm. On the other, regulatory bodies called for rigorous placebo-controlled trials to permit direct measurement of vaccine efficacy prior to approval of the products. A stepped-wedge cluster study (SWCT) was proposed as an alternative to a more traditional randomized controlled vaccine trial to address these concerns. Here, we propose novel &#x0201c;ordered stepped-wedge cluster trial&#x0201d; (OSWCT) designs to further mitigate tradeoffs between ethical concerns, logistics, and statistical rigor.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We constructed a spatially structured mathematical model of the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone. We used the output of this model to simulate and compare a series of stepped-wedge cluster vaccine studies. Our model reproduced the observed order of first case occurrence within districts of Sierra Leone. Depending on the infection risk within the trial population and the trial start dates, the statistical power to detect a vaccine efficacy of 90% varied from 14% to 32% for standard SWCT, and from 67% to 91% for OSWCTs for an alpha error of 5%. The model&#x02019;s projection of first case occurrence was robust to changes in disease natural history parameters.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Ordering clusters in a step-wedge trial based on the cluster&#x02019;s underlying risk of infection as predicted by a spatial model can increase the statistical power of a SWCT. In the event of another hemorrhagic fever outbreak, implementation of our proposed OSWCT designs could improve statistical power when a step-wedge study is desirable based on either ethical concerns or logistical constraints.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>When a vaccine is developed, it undergoes a series of tests to assess its safety and effectiveness. The last of these is called a Phase III clinical trial, in which the vaccine is tested on a subset of the population before it is approved for general use. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which individuals are randomized to receive vaccine or placebo is the most direct and efficient trial design to assess the efficacy of a vaccine. However, in circumstances where a disease has a very high mortality rate (such as Ebola virus disease), the use of placebo is ethically questionable, especially when there is strong evidence that a vaccine will be safe and efficacious. Vaccine trials often must also address logistical constraints that prevent the introduction of the vaccine to the entire trial population in certain resource-poor settings. These issues were front and center in discussions about vaccine trials during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. The medical community faced questions on the clinical trial design that best balanced tradeoffs between ethical concerns, logistics, and statistical rigor. In this study, we propose and assess novel &#x0201c;ordered stepped-wedge cluster trial&#x0201d; designs as an alternative to mitigate these tradeoffs.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19 AI109755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diakite</surname><given-names>Ibrahim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AI007535</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mooring</surname><given-names>Eric Q.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AI007433</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vel&#x000e1;squez</surname><given-names>Gustavo E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>L30 AI120170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vel&#x000e1;squez</surname><given-names>Gustavo E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19 AI109755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Megan B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Abundance Foundation (Stephan Kahn)</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Megan B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The project described was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH/NIAID grants U19 AI109755 to ID and MBM; T32 AI007535 to EQM.; T32 AI007433 to GEV; and L30 AI120170 to GEV) and MBM also acknowledges funding provided by a gift from the Abundance Foundation (Stephen Kahn).

The three countries combined had a total of 15,901 cases (confirmed, probable and suspected) and 5,674 deaths as of November 26, 2014, when the epidemic peaked in the affected regions [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. At that time, many candidate vaccines were proposed for Phase III trials in the affected countries, with different vaccine trial designs suggested for each region. Between April 1, 2015, and July 20, 2015, a Phase III trial in Guinea assessed the efficacy of a Zaire Ebolavirus vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The design was a ring vaccination cluster-randomized trial, where the trial population was made up of clusters of all contacts and contacts of contacts of laboratory-confirmed Ebola cases. Thus, a robust contact tracing system was an essential component of the trial. Unfortunately, the 2014 Ebola outbreak has demonstrated that it requires valuable time to establish a reliable contact tracing system in the setting of damaged public health infrastructure, a severe shortage of health care workers, and community resistance, amongst other reasons [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The stepped-wedge cluster trial (SWCT) was another trial design proposed to test a candidate vaccine in Sierra Leone (SL) during the outbreak. In contrast with ring vaccination, the SWCT does not rely on a contact tracing system [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The trial population is made of geographically distinct clusters that are randomly and sequentially assigned to vaccination. This design is desirable when vaccination cannot be introduced to all clusters at once due to logistical or financial reasons, and has the ethical advantage of not intentionally withholding vaccines from unvaccinated clusters while they serve as control groups. However, when the vaccine is expected to be efficacious, the risk of infection is predicted to vary between clusters over time, and these different risks can be predicted, randomly choosing a cluster to be treated fails to prioritize those at highest risk (which undermines the ethical advantage of the SWCT). Furthermore, Bellan et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have shown that spatiotemporal variation in infection risk undermines the statistical power of the SWCT. Here, we propose novel &#x0201c;ordered stepped-wedge cluster trial&#x0201d; (OSWCT) designs to address these limitations of the standard SWCT.</p><p>OSWCT designs differ from SWCT when clusters are predicted to have different infection risks. Specifically, OSWCT designs use conditional randomization to assign clusters to vaccination. The cluster to vaccinate at a given time point is randomly selected from a subset of clusters that are likely to have a higher infection risk. We considered three strategies to identify the highest risk clusters: based on the order of first EVD case occurrence in each cluster as projected by a spatial model, based on the observed highest incident cases two weeks previously, or the highest projected weekly incidence. By prioritizing clusters, OSWCT mitigates the ethical dilemma of randomly assigning treatment to clusters when they are predicted to have low infection risk.</p><p>In this study we assessed the statistical power of these novel trial designs. We simulated and estimated the statistical power of all the designs in the following steps. First, we constructed a metapopulation model that combines EVD transmission and individuals&#x02019; movements between regions in order to predict the spatiotemporal trends of the disease. Second, we used either the observed or modeled incidence data within districts of SL to assign clusters to receive vaccination for the OSWCT designs. Third, we used a stochastic model to simulate all trial designs, and finally we used a nonparametric method (permutation test) to analyze the simulated data and to estimate the statistical power of trial designs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Data sources</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Case count data</title><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) provided weekly updated data on the number of newly confirmed and probable Ebola cases for each district in Sierra Leone starting from the week of May 19, 2014, and for each county in Liberia starting the week of March 17, 2014. These were derived from two sources: a daily situation report from the Ministries of Health (MOH) [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] which contained a summary of the total number of probable and laboratory confirmed EVD cases in each country; and an individual-level patient database [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or &#x0201c;linelist&#x0201d; which contained information on the symptoms, diagnosis, and outcomes for each probable or confirmed Ebola case. WHO defined a &#x0201c;probable case&#x0201d; as a person who a clinician suspected of having Ebola, or who died from &#x0201c;suspected&#x0201d; Ebola and had an epidemiological link to a confirmed case but was not tested for the disease. A probable or suspected case was reclassified as confirmed if that person tested positive for Ebola by a PCR-based test.

Specifically, the force of infection over the course of an epidemic often varies widely between clusters and changes over time. To account for such variation between clusters, we proposed &#x0201c;ordered stepped-wedge cluster trial&#x0201d; (OSWCT) designs in which clusters are assigned to a treatment group based either on the observed incidence data or on a projection of cases derived from a spatially structured transmission model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004866.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The overarching purpose of this design is to randomly select for intervention a cluster from a more homogeneous subset of clusters.</p><fig id="pntd.0004866.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0004866.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>OSWCT designs.</title><p>A cluster contributes cluster-time (solid line) in time [t, t+1) if it is selected among the top N highest risk clusters or if it has been previously vaccinated, otherwise it does not contribute (dash line) cluster time in that time interval.

For all OSWCTs, we randomly selected the cluster to be vaccinated at each time step from among the top N (e.g., 4 or 5) unvaccinated clusters ranked by the ordering strategy, and the remaining N-1 unvaccinated clusters served as the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004866.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Once vaccinated, clusters continued to contribute cluster time until the end of the trial. When there were N or fewer unvaccinated clusters remaining, OSWCT designs became analogous to the standard SWCT design.</p><p>We chose these different ordering strategies because the first-OSWCT design does not rely on availability of epidemic data to be able to order clusters, therefore it can be used when one is planning an OSWCT early in the outbreak before all the regions have observed their first case. However, if a trial does not start until later in the outbreak after the disease has spread to all regions, then ordering based on first case occurrence is no longer an efficient strategy. Ordering strategies based on the highest observed incidence two weeks prior (data-OSWCT) or on a projection of weekly highest cases (peak-OSWCT) are applicable to trials starting early or late in the outbreak. In principle, a peak-OSWCT could be designed using a metapopulation model informed only by baseline geographic data and initial estimates of model parameters. However, a model that takes into account surveillance data up to the start of the trial as well as data on the implementation of other disease control interventions is likely to have greater predictive ability. Another advantage of the transmission model-driven ordering schemes (first-OSWCT and peak-OSWCT) is that the randomization can be undertaken before any cluster receives vaccination, compared to the data-driven ordering scheme (data-OSWCT) which relies on the availability of surveillance data and thus requires the randomization be updated as the trial progresses.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Vaccine trial simulations</title><p>Following Bellan et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], we used a stochastic model to simulate vaccine trials. We assumed that the trial would be conducted in geographically distinct clusters, with each drawn from the population of one of the 14 districts of Sierra Leone. In April 2015, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) partnered with various institutions in SL including its Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) to conduct a Phase II and Phase III clinical trial named Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine against Ebola (STRIVE) [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The study enrolled HCWs and other frontline workers to assess the safety and efficacy of an Ebola vaccine candidate. Participants were randomized to receive vaccination immediately (on the day of enrollment or within seven days) or to receive delayed vaccination (about six months later).</p><p>We consequently assumed our simulated trials to be conducted in high-risk individuals, such as HCWs and burial team members, and that all the simulated clusters would be of equal size. We assumed that without effective vaccination, a proportion (<italic>p</italic>) of the reported incident cases in the district would occur in the corresponding cluster; using proportionality constant (<italic>p</italic>), we derived the cluster-level hazard (<italic>H</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>) to be directly proportional to the incidence of cases in the corresponding district. The force of infection risk for each individual within a specific cluster and time interval is <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub> * <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>, where <italic>&#x003b5;</italic> captures expected variation in individual infection that is log-normally distributed with mean 1 and standard deviation 1.

We assumed that each of the 14 simulated clusters had 430 individuals in order to arrive at a simulated trial size of 6020 individuals, to approximately match the originally expected sample size of the STRIVE trial. In our baseline simulation, we assumed that a hypothetical study began early during the outbreak before all districts were reported to have cases (between mid-May to late August 2014). We assumed that 5.2% of the total number of cases in each district would have occurred within high-risk groups, consistent with CDC reports [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Based on the preliminary results of the rVSV ring vaccination trial in Guinea [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], we assumed that vaccine efficacy (<italic>ve</italic>) was 90% and that the time from vaccination to the onset of vaccine-induced immunity (<italic>di</italic>) was one week. In sensitivity analyses, we varied trial start dates as well as values (<italic>p</italic>), (<italic>ve</italic>) and (<italic>di</italic>). When we simulated a trial that started late during the course of the outbreak (between late November 2014 to mid-March 2016), we dropped the ordering design based on first case occurrence in districts (first-OSWCT), since all districts were predicted to have their first EVD case by late August 2014.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used a nonparametric method (permutation test) described by Bellan et al.

To our knowledge, we are the first to propose ordering clusters by timing of expected outcomes to increase the efficiency of a stepped-wedge cluster trial. Among the three ordered designs we evaluated, we found that ordering based on the highest weekly projected incidence (peak-OSWCT) was more efficient than ordering based on projected first case occurrence (first-OSWCT) or on observed highest cases in the prior two weeks (data-OSWCT) regardless of when a trial begins during the course of an Ebola outbreak. However, we also found that for trials starting within 5 weeks of the onset of an Ebola outbreak, the magnitude of the statistical power of all three ordered designs was similar. The preferred trial design may be influenced by available epidemiologic data. Both model-based approaches (first-OSWCT and peak-OSWCT) require knowing where the outbreak began. However, unlike the data-OSWCT, neither model-based approach requires surveillance in the two weeks before the trial begins. The peak-OSWCT is more dependent than the first-OSWCT on the parameterization of the model; hence without accurate estimates of model parameters from <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge, fitting to initial data on the outbreak, or both, the first-OSWCT approach is more desirable. We also found that if vaccine trials are delayed beyond the first 15 weeks of an outbreak then peak-OSWCT may be the optimal choice. Our findings support the importance of epidemiologic surveillance to inform vaccine trial design.</p><p>Our transmission model is similar to other EVD models [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] in that we distinguish transmission that occurs from live patients in the community versus that which occurs in ETUs versus transmission during funerals. However, our model distinguishes between EVD patients with dry versus wet symptoms. We have shown that our model accurately fits the observed data when it takes into account metrics of disease control interventions such as ETU bed availability. This illustrates the importance of recording not only the incidence of disease in outbreak settings, but also tracking when and to what degree interventions are implemented.</p><p>We stress that the efficacy of the first-OSWCT and peak-OSWCT depends on the accuracy with which the transmission model predicts the order of cases. We sought to address the question of model misspecification using the ordering derived from a simulation for infectious disease with different natural histories (e.g. smallpox, varicella, and measles). Using our spatially explicit transmission model, we showed that the projected order of first case occurrence in each district of SL was robust to different transmission scenarios for smallpox, varicella, and measles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004866.g013">Fig 13A</xref> shows that when we derived the ordering from a smallpox model, we lost power compared to when we used the Ebola transmission model, but the power remained higher than that of a typical SWCT. This finding suggests that when planning a stepped-wedge vaccine trial for a filovirus outbreak in a resource-limited setting, one can approximately predict the order of first case occurrence in different regions and implement a first-OSWCT design by using current EVD transmission parameters combined with geospatial data from the affected country, even if the transmission parameters of the outbreak in truth differ substantially from those observed for EVD. We did not specifically explore the choice of optimal value for N (the number of top clusters from which the cluster to vaccinate is randomly chosen), however the two extreme choices to avoid would be to set N as the total number of clusters (which will be equivalent to the typical SWCT) or set N to be 1 (in which case there will not be any control group to compare to). More generally, a high value for N loses the advantage of an OSWCT while a very low value for N would lose efficiency because of the small number of controls to which to compare. Therefore, we anticipate the relationship between N and power to be non-monotonic. The specific shape of this relationship probably depends on a number of factors, including the distribution of number of cases per cluster. This aspect of optimal OSWCT design could be the subject of further investigation.</p><p>Gravity models have been previously used to model human mobility in the context of various outbreaks. For instance, Ashleigh et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] used a gravity model to describe the 2010 cholera epidemic in Haiti and to capture the ordering of first case occurrence among the departments of Haiti, Viboud et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] used it to characterize seasonal influenza dynamics in the United States, and more recently it was used by Silva et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to capture EVD transmission dynamics within and between Guinea, Liberia, and SL. To our knowledge, our study is the first to link a gravity model to order a stepped-wedge cluster trial.</p><p>For our ordering of first case occurrence, we found that the metapopulation model predicted cases to occur in the Western Area Rural and Urban districts sooner than actually occurred. This may be because these two districts (which consist of Freetown and the surrounding area) are more densely populated than the other districts of SL and that the gravity model gives more weight to more populated regions. This weight may be disproportionately large compared to their actual influence. Other limitations of the gravity model are that it does not take into account other factors that may influence migration such as weather conditions and social networks, both of which are known to impact migration in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. An alternative to measure migration between regions, thus improving the accuracy of predicted order of first case occurrence, could be to use data that directly capture human mobility, such as mobile phone data. Buckee et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0004866.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] described the use of call data records (mobile phone calls or text messages) to infer mobile phone users&#x02019; travel. These data can be used to estimate human mobility between regions and its impact on disease transmission. However, we reiterate that even the relatively simple gravity model can capture the spatiotemporal trends of an outbreak well enough that ordering clusters accordingly in a stepped-wedge cluster trial substantially increases the statistical power of the trial.</p><p>When the vaccine being tested is expected to be efficacious and the risk of infection is predicted to differ between clusters at given time, the OSWCT design increases the probability that those at higher risk of infection will be vaccinated, and therefore we expect the OSWCT design to prevent more cases. In this way, the OSWCT is ethically advantageous, in addition to its statistical advantages. However, all types of SWCTs are ethically advantageous only to the extent the lags between implementing the intervention between clusters are due to genuine logistical constraints, not an intentional decision to increase the statistical power of the trial.</p><p>In this study we did not consider other clinical trial designs such as a randomized clinical trial or a ring vaccination cluster-randomized trial. Because we also assumed the vaccine trial to be conducted in a small subgroup of the population (healthcare workers), we did not consider the indirect effect (herd immunity) of the vaccination trial on the overall disease dynamics. Our main aim was to evaluate how ordering clusters when the risk of infection is heterogeneous among them may affect the statistical power of a SWCT design in settings where SWCT design may be desirable due to either ethical or logistical reasons. Our results support OSWCTs as more efficient designs than the standard SWCT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004866.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Novel ordered stepped-wedge cluster trial designs for detecting Ebola vaccine efficacy using a spatially structured mathematical model.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004866.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Giovanni Zambotti, GIS Specialist at the Center for Geographic Analysis of Harvard University, for his assistance with the geographic information system software ArcGIS version 10.2.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0004866.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Ebola Situation Reports.
