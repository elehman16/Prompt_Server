Subjects in two pediatric groups (children and adolescents) were randomized 1:1 to receive a single oral dose of alogliptin 12.5 or 25&#x000a0;mg, respectively; all gender- and race-matched adult subjects received alogliptin 25&#x000a0;mg. Blood and urine samples were collected at prespecified time points for PK/PD analyses. A PK/PD model was developed using data from the study for steady-state simulations. Safety was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In pediatric subjects receiving the 25-mg dose, the mean alogliptin peak plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> values were 26 and 23% lower, respectively, than in adults receiving the 25-mg dose, but maximum observed DPP-4 inhibition effect (E<sub>max</sub>) and AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> values were similar to those in adults. In pediatric subjects receiving the 12.5-mg dose, the mean alogliptin C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> values were 58 and 54% lower, respectively, than those in adults, hence E<sub>max</sub> and AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> values were also lower by 11 and 17%, respectively. The PK/PD model simulated data were consistent with study results. No safety concern was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A 25-mg dose of alogliptin in pediatric subjects achieved alogliptin exposures and DPP-4 inhibition similar to those in adult T2DM patients without safety concerns; therefore, this dose is recommended for a pediatric phase 3 trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00228-016-2175-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Alogliptin</kwd><kwd>Pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>Pharmacodynamics</kwd><kwd>Pediatric patients</kwd><kwd>DPP-4 inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007723</institution-id><institution>Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A.</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), though historically recognized as a disease of adulthood, has become increasingly common among children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. From 2001 to 2009, the prevalence of T2DM among children aged between 10 and 19 in the USA rose from 0.34 per 1000 to 0.46 per 1000, an overall increase of 30.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The prevalence is significantly higher in Native Americans and African Americans than in other races [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is the primary enzyme involved in the rapid in vivo degradation of the incretin hormones, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The incretin hormones include glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), two peptides that exert major glucoregulatory functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Released upon nutrient ingestion, these peptides stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion and promote beta-cell proliferation and cytoprotection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In patients with T2DM, GIP is produced at normal levels with impaired glucose-lowering action, while GLP-1 retains its glucoregulatory activity despite diminished secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Thus, inhibition of DPP-4 activity increases plasma GLP-1 levels, which in turn augments insulin secretion and reduces blood glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Alogliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Clinical studies have demonstrated that alogliptin produces rapid and sustained DPP-4 inhibition, improves both postprandial and fasting plasma glucose, and reduces glycated hemoglobin levels by approximately 0.5 to 1% after 12 to 26&#x000a0;weeks of treatment in adult T2DM patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Combined therapy using alogliptin with other non-DPP-4 inhibitor antidiabetic agents provides significantly better glycemic control than monotherapy with any of these agents alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The objectives of this study were to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of a single dose of alogliptin 12.5 and 25&#x000a0;mg in pediatric (ages 10&#x02013;17) subjects with T2DM, and compare the pediatric PK/PD profiles with those in adult subjects with T2DM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This phase 1, randomized, open-label, single-dose, multicenter study (NCT00957268) was conducted in compliance with the institutional review board regulations stated in the US Code of Federal Regulations, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations and guidelines; the ethical principles originated from the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization E6 GCP guidance, and all applicable local regulations. Signed informed consent forms and assent (if applicable) or certified translations of these forms (if applicable) were obtained from each subject or the subject&#x02019;s legally acceptable representative before undergoing any study procedures.</p><p>The study enrolled male and female T2DM patients who were age-stratified into group 1 (children age 10 to &#x0003c;14&#x000a0;years), group 2 (adolescents age 14 to &#x0003c;18 years), and group 3 (gender- and race-matched adults age 18&#x02013;65 years). A detailed description of subject enrollment criteria is available in <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">supplemental materials</xref>.</p><p>A total of 24 pediatric subjects and 22 gender- and race-matched adult subjects were enrolled in the study. Since T2DM is uncommon among children, there were significant enrollment challenges, particularly for subjects below 14&#x000a0;years of age. As such, the number of enrolled subjects was based on review of past PK studies of a similar nature and extensive consultation of regulatory agencies. The final sample size was a minimum number of subjects deemed sufficient to meet study objectives. Statistical analysis was not performed to determine the sample size.</p><p>The duration of the study was approximately 47&#x000a0;days, consisting of screening (days &#x02212;28 to &#x02212;2), check-in (day &#x02212;1), a treatment period (days 1&#x02013;4), and a follow-up phone call at 14&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;days after study exit. Following screening for eligibility, enrolled subjects were admitted to the clinic on day &#x02212;1. On the first day of the treatment period, subjects in each pediatric group (group 1 and group 2) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single, oral dose of alogliptin 12.5 or 25&#x000a0;mg, respectively; all adult subjects (group 3) received a single dose of alogliptin 25&#x000a0;mg. The study doses (12.5 and 25&#x000a0;mg) were selected based on the results of phase 3 studies in adults. Both dose levels were well tolerated in healthy adult subjects and adult subjects with T2DM. A single dose was used because alogliptin exhibits linear kinetic properties. The study drug was administered after an overnight fast of at least 8&#x000a0;h. Subjects were released from the clinic in the evening on day 2 after the completion of all procedures and returned to the clinic in the morning on days 3 and 4 for outpatient visits. Approximately 14&#x000a0;days (14&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;days) after the final visit (study exit), subjects received a follow-up phone call to check for adverse events (AEs)/serious AEs and concomitant medication uses that had occurred since study exit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>PK/PD bioanalytical analysis</title><p>For alogliptin concentration measurements, blood samples were collected 1&#x000a0;h before dosing and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, and 72&#x000a0;h after dosing; urine samples were collected from &#x02212;12 to 0&#x000a0;h predose, and from 0 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 12, 12 to 24, and 24 to 36&#x000a0;h postdose.

This model adequately described the PK/PD data in both pediatric and adult subjects with T2DM, as demonstrated by the goodness-of-fit test and visual predictive check (Supplemental Figs. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

Because CrCl, a measure of renal function, was higher in pediatric subjects (CrCl 75.5&#x02013;167&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>) than in adult subjects (CrCl 53.6&#x02013;140.2&#x000a0;mL/min), the slight decreases in C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> in pediatric subjects may be due to the slightly higher renal function in these subjects. The mean CL/F values of alogliptin were up to 37% higher in pediatric subjects than in adult subjects. The other plasma and urine PK parameters of alogliptin (Vz/F, T<sub>1/2</sub>, Clr, Fe) were generally similar across the pediatric and adult subject groups.</p><p>Administration of alogliptin resulted in rapid DPP-4 inhibition in both pediatric and adult subjects with T2DM. Although the extent of exposure was lower in pediatric subjects than in adult subjects as demonstrated by the mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> values, the levels of DPP-4 inhibition&#x02014;indicated by the mean E<sub>max</sub> and AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> values&#x02014;were similar between the two populations. This is particularly true for the adolescent group (age 14 to &#x0003c;18&#x000a0;years), in which the E<sub>max</sub> and AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> values were almost identical to those in the adult group. Within pediatric subjects, the mean E<sub>max</sub> values were approximately 80 and 90% for alogliptin 12.5 and 25&#x000a0;mg, respectively; the mean AUEC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> values were approximately 8 and 19% lower for the 12.5-mg dose than for the 25-mg dose in group 1 and group 2, respectively. Within each dose level, DPP-4 inhibition appeared to be generally similar in groups 1 and 2. Model-simulated alogliptin PK and PD parameters were similar to those observed in this study. Single doses of alogliptin 12.5 and 25&#x000a0;mg were well tolerated in pediatric and adult subjects. No dose relationship was observed in the percentages of pediatric subjects who had TEAEs, and the incidence of TEAEs was lower in pediatric subjects who received alogliptin 25&#x000a0;mg than in adult subjects.</p><p>The majority of the study subjects were African American; pediatric T2DM is particularly prevalent among African Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which limited the availability of subjects of other races. Since race has no clinically meaningful effect on alogliptin PK in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], our study results are likely to be applicable to pediatric patients of other races. However, this speculation needs to be confirmed in future larger pediatric trials including more non-African American subjects.</p><p>This study excluded subjects with renal impairment or hypertension, two common comorbidities of T2DM. Because alogliptin primarily relies on renal excretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], renal function is a major determinant of drug exposure. In a PK study in adults, exposure to alogliptin increased approximately 1.7-fold in patients with mild renal impairment, 2.1-fold in patients with moderate renal impairment, and 3.8-fold in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD), relative to healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, alogliptin prescribing information recommends a 50% dose reduction for adult patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl &#x02265;30 to &#x0003c;60&#x000a0;mL/min) and a further 50% dose reduction for patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl &#x02265;15 to &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;mL/min) or ESRD (CrCl &#x0003c;15&#x000a0;mL/min or requiring hemodialysis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, in clinical studies, alogliptin displayed similar efficacy and safety profiles between patients with renal impairment and normal renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, this study did not evaluate the effect of hypertension on the PD of alogliptin. In contrast to renal function, an experimentally proven determinant of drug exposure, hypertension is not expected to have a significant influence on dose setting and, therefore, has not been extensively studied. There is very little information regarding the effect of hypertension on PD of alogliptin. However, alogliptin was shown to lower blood pressure in patients with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>In addition, in an alogliptin cardiovascular safety trial in which 83% of patients had hypertension, alogliptin demonstrated a similar rate of major adverse cardiovascular events to that of placebo in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Given the minor impact of hypertension on alogliptin exposure and safety and the low incidence of this condition among children, not assessing the effect of hypertension on DPP-4 inhibition is unlikely to affect the purpose of this study. As a phase 1 study and the first study of alogliptin in pediatric patients, this study had a small sample size. The purpose of the study was to establish a basic dose for future phase 3 pediatric studies, and the inclusion criteria only allowed pediatric subjects without clinically significant disorders other than T2DM and adult subjects without clinically significant disorders other than T2DM and controlled hypertension. As such, eliminating the interferences of comorbidities on alogliptin PK profile maintains analysis sensitivity for this small study. Based on adult PK data, we speculate that renal function may have a similar impact on alogliptin PK in children. This needs to be tested in future larger pediatric studies including subjects with renal impairment.</p><p>Based on the PK and PD data and model simulations, pediatric subjects with T2DM require the 25-mg dose of alogliptin to achieve alogliptin exposures and DPP-4 inhibition similar to those in adults with T2DM. The 25-mg dose in adolescents best approximates the DPP-4 inhibition in adults following 25-mg dose administration, despite some modest differences in alogliptin PK (simulated median steady state C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-tau</sub> values in adolescents was 24 and 11% lower, respectively, relative to adults) between the two populations. The DPP-4 inhibition in adolescents receiving a 12.5-mg dose was considered suboptimal, since efficacy requires steady state trough DPP-4 inhibition of approximately 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, the 25-mg dose that has shown to be safe and efficacious in adults should be a suitable dose for evaluation in the pediatric phase 3 program. It should be noted, however, that alogliptin is not approved for use in pediatric patients with T2DM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
