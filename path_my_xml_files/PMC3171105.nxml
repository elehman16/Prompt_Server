In the absence of these features, the term &#x02018;undifferentiated SpA&#x02019; (uSpA) has been used while, for patients with IBP but without structural changes in the sacroiliac joints and the spine, the term &#x02018;non-radiographic axial SpA&#x02019; (nrSpA) is used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Not all patients with SpA will develop AS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></p><p>A significant delay in diagnosing AS has been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> The new Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) classification criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> are a step forward in making an earlier diagnosis of patients with axial SpA, but it is unclear whether they work in primary care.

A total of 143 orthopaedic surgeons in private practice and 36 rheumatologists took part in the study. The time frame was April 2007 to June 2009 for screening and May 2007 to May 2009 for validation.</p><p>The study plan was to identify 1000 patients in primary care with chronic back pain for &#x0003e;2 months and &#x0003c;10 years in whom back pain first occurred between the ages of 16 and 45 years, and to refer to rheumatologists about 400 patients after stratification and randomised selection performed by an independent institute based on four prespecified recognition criteria: (1) morning stiffness &#x0003e;30 min; (2) improvement by movement not by rest; (3) waking up in the second half of the night because of back pain; and (4) improvement with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 48 h. The answers to these questions, which were collected at the initial visit by the orthopaedic surgeons and transmitted for patient randomisation at the independent institute, were the basis for stratification into 16 cohorts. The rheumatologists, who were aware of the current classification criteria, made the final diagnosis. These data allowed validation of clinical questions and screening parameters and an analysis of the relative value of combinations of parameters.</p><p>Secondary criteria analysed were alternating buttock pain, a positive family history of SpA and extraspinal manifestations (presence or history of arthritis, enthesitis, psoriasis, IBD and HLA-B27).</p><sec id="s2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The information was centrally collected at the Institut for Statistics of Dr Schnitker in Bielefeld, Germany where blinded decisions were made randomly as to which patients to refer to rheumatologists. Clinical information was sent to the institute where the statistical analyses were performed.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were made by standard methods. Logistic regression analysis with backward elimination was performed with several parameters as independent variables. The dependent variable was the diagnosis of axial SpA, AS and nrSpA by the rheumatologist. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated. HLA B27 was excluded from the analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s4"><title>Description of patient populations studied</title><p>A total of 1074 patients were included, of whom 950 could be analysed; 670 were referred to a rheumatologist of whom 334 attended, and 322 patients with complete data were available for analysis.

In Germany, most patients with back pain will see an orthopaedic surgeon as their first contact with the health system. This does not mean that GPs and physical therapists will not also see such patients, but these healthcare professionals were not included in this study. It also needs to be stressed that we did not only include patients who visited a physician with back pain for the first time.</p><p>The results of this study show that asking single specific SpA-related questions in primary care is of no value for a diagnosis of patients with axial SpA and that specific combinations are much more useful. Furthermore, we have identified important differences between patients with established AS and those with nrSpA.</p><p>Our data confirm the results of earlier studies which also suggested that single screening parameters are of very limited value and that combinations of parameters perform better.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> It is important to stress that this dataset has been obtained in a prespecified population of relatively young patients with chronic back pain and not in the general population. This is consistent with the major aim of the study, which was to develop a good tool to facilitate an early diagnosis of axial SpA.</p><p>The best likelihood ratio for a diagnosis of axial SpA calculated (excluding HLA B27) was obtained with the following five items: age at onset &#x02264;35 years, waking up in the second half of the night, alternating buttock pain, improvement by NSAIDs within 48 h or no NSAID and improvement by movement not rest. It will be necessary to test this proposal prospectively to further determine its usefulness.</p><p>Some findings of this study deserve special comment. It is noteworthy that the age cut-off for SpA was lower in our study than earlier proposals for IBP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> This makes sense since the mean age at onset of AS is 26 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Currently used IBP criteria should be re-evaluated on this basis, having in mind that this will probably be mainly helpful in identifying patients with a high likelihood of developing AS, and that this may be different in patients with nrSpA including those with a slowly progressive course of disease (see below).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></p><p>On the other hand, the absence of the classic IBP criterion of morning stiffness was unexpected. Alternating buttock pain is often suggested as a possible contributor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> since, although not very sensitive, this item is rather specific and is now shown in a primary care setting. However, a combination with other items is necessary.</p><p>Waking up in the second half of the night was not part of the original criteria set for a definition of IBP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> but was introduced later.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> This item is also useful in primary care, again mainly when combined with other items.</p><p>A good response to NSAIDs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> has become increasingly established as part of the classification criteria for axial SpA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> as confirmed in this study. The results of a recent meta-analysis on the efficacy of NSAIDs in non-specific low back pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> support this proposal. However, as our study also shows, not all the patients had taken NSAIDs. Thus, a negative answer to the question concerning improvement by NSAIDs may simply indicate that the patient had not taken the medication. This needs to be taken into account in future studies. Improvement by movement, although not really a medical intervention, is also related to a change in patient behaviour (moving around instead of resting).</p><p>Another important finding is that the items that perform best in the prediction of axial SpA differed between established AS and nrSpA. Both enthesitis and psoriasis were found to be useful. We were surprised that enthesitis was a significant item because, although somewhat characteristic of SpA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> it is not an easy item for patients to understand. The same is true for psoriasis, which is a rather frequent disease. The difference between AS and nrSpA may be explained by observational studies suggesting that not all patients with nrSpA develop AS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Thus, axial SpA is not only a disease continuum from early (nrSpA) to advanced disease (AS), but also a covering term for patients who might never develop structural changes in the sacroiliac joints and/or the spine. This has also been suggested by recent studies on anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy in &#x02018;early&#x02019;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> and nrSpA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> where the mean age of the patients differed (28 and 38 years, respectively).</p><p>The design and methodology used in this study ensured that the patients seen by the rheumatologists were representative, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>. However, the prevalence of the prespecified recognition items was slightly higher in the referral population, which may have led to more patients with SpA being seen by the rheumatologist (see below). The selection of the entry criteria was based on published criteria for IBP and expert opinion. Because of the low sensitivity of the item &#x02018;alternating buttock pain&#x02019;, we decided to use a good response to NSAIDs as a major criterion because of the expected high sensitivity, and this was clearly confirmed by the data obtained. We were surprised by the relatively bad performance of morning stiffness for &#x0003e;30 min which was only stated by about 22% of patients. The other two items performed as expected. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>, we managed to include patients in the appropriate age groups, the planned gender ratio was met and the patient numbers planned were included. The majority of patients were seen within 3 weeks by the rheumatologists, but they appeared to have some problems with their capacity to see referral patients, which is why fewer than 400 patients were seen by the experts who were in charge of the diagnosis. These colleagues had been informed about the new ASAS criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> and the established AS criteria,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> but we did not systematically check whether they were correctly applied. This is a possible weakness of the study, but the relatively high percentage of patients with HLA B27+ axial SpA suggests that most of the diagnoses were correct. Furthermore, the gold standard for making diagnoses of axial SpA and AS is the rheumatologists' expert opinion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></p><p>On this basis, about one-third of the patients seen were diagnosed as axial SpA, somewhat more with the non-radiographic early form than with the more advanced form, fulfilling the New York criteria for AS. Interestingly, many more patients in the former group were undifferentiated.</p><p>Although the one previous study with a somewhat similar design had also reported a relatively high success rate with a screening design for IBP,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> we had not necessarily expected this result because we had chosen a sophisticated randomisation strategy. There are two possible explanations for this: (1) the prevalence of axial SpA in the population is known to be rather high<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> and the prevalence of AS in an orthopaedic setting was almost 20%,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> and (2) the doctors in primary care may have preselected patients with a higher probability of SpA (even though we asked for consecutive patients with back pain); however, due to our randomisation strategy, we think this is unlikely. For future cohort studies we believe that similar strategies should be used to identify patients with SpA in primary care. Interestingly, two new studies presented at the American College of Rheumatology 2010 showed similar results regarding the prevalence of axial SpA in primary care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></p><p>Another relevant finding of this study is that different items and different combinations of items perform differently for the different SpA subsets studied. Since we consider this an important new finding, we have presented these results in detail.</p><p>What does this mean with regard to identifying patients with suspected axial SpA as early as possible? In general one would like to have a tool with very good sensitivity to identify as many patients as possible but, on the other hand, the capacity to see patients may be limited and a high specificity may be more important. We have presented our results in relation to both points of view so the rheumatologist, in cooperation with GPs or orthopaedic surgeons, can choose which way to go. Since it seems easier and more useful to stick to the criteria for axial SpA rather than to look at AS and nrSpA differently, we propose using these criteria for calculations for the selection process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Thus, in settings with very good capacity, the preferred strategy would be to go for 2/5 criteria with a sensitivity of 96.5% and a specificity of 17%, which means that five patients with chronic back pain will have to be seen to make a diagnosis of axial SpA in one. This strategy seems to guarantee that almost all patients with axial SpA can be identified. In settings with limited capacity the strategy could be to go for 4/5 criteria, in which case almost every patient seen will have axial SpA but about half the patients will be lost. The intermediate strategy with 3/5 criteria has a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 47%, which means that only 20% of patients with axial SpA would be lost and a diagnosis is likely to be made in every second patient.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether strategies including HLA B27 testing in primary care will further improve the performance of the clinical parameters. This will be analysed in a separate paper.</p><p>Finally, it must be stressed that the results of this study are only valid in a primary care setting in Germany and therefore we are not discussing diagnostic or classification criteria but rather tools that can be used to preselect patients who need to be seen by the rheumatologist. The proposed strategies based on the results of this study should be further evaluated prospectively in other countries.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Professor D van der Heijde, Professor J Sieper, Dr J Listing and Dr M Vennemann for their useful comments.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold> The study was sponsored by an unrestricted grant from Abbott, Germany.
