The complex language and social structures of humans means that we can attribute meaning to therapeutic encounters with culturally sanctioned authority figures and we can use our attachment to such figures to generate hope for recovery. Different mechanisms may be involved in the neurobiological aspect of placebo including anxiety, learning, conditioning as well as individual genetic variation. Examination of the published work shows that while some trials do seem to indicate a specific mode of action for homeopathic remedies other trials do not and this is an issue that needs to be addressed at the trial design stage. A clinical trial that includes both a placebo group and a non-participating control arm is the most powerful design for separating the non-specific and polymorphic placebo effect from the specific effects of trial medication. The control variables in a trial of homeopathic medication should also include the process of consultation as this may assume a meaning for the individual that can also be associated with a placebo effect.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-2042533313490927"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is a commonly held belief that homeopathy is &#x02018;nothing more&#x02019; than a placebo effect, a turn of phrase which seems to dismiss as ineffective both homeopathy and the role of the placebo in healing.</p><p>The aim of this short report is to explore the relationship between homeopathy and placebo, how these are connected to self-healing and how we can design a clinical trial to measure these interconnected effects.</p><p>Recent insights into the changes associated with placebo may explain why the placebo response trait could be positively selected for during our evolutionary history:<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;It is becoming ever more apparent that &#x02018;the placebo effect&#x02019; is polymorphic in both its trigger and its expression, and that the mechanisms for placebo responses within the body are diverse.

Benedetti et&#x000a0;al. show that drugs are administered into a complex biochemical environment that varies according to the patient's cognitive/affective state and previous exposure to other pharmacological agents. The mechanisms activated by placebo are the same as those activated by drugs, which suggests a cognitive/affective interference with drug actions.</p><p>Rather than one common mechanism of action, they suggest that there is a whole &#x02018;melting pot&#x02019; of different placebo effects operate at different times and under different circumstances.

</p><p>It is important to distinguish interpersonal healing from two other forms of healing, natural healing and technological healing, because homeopathy is often described as &#x02018;natural&#x02019; and perceived as an alternative to &#x02018;technological&#x02019; healing options:<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Natural healing is the spontaneous or automatic response of the body to disease or injury, exemplified by internal mechanisms of fighting infection and wound healing.

</p></disp-quote>The homeopathic consultation process is a two-way process in which the patient narrative is received by the therapist and generates questions or reflections. This must involve a psychological transaction between patient and therapist that will be perceived through the frame of their previous experiences.

</p><p>The homeopathic clinical encounter will involve healing on many levels as there will be interpersonal transactions including psychodynamic effects, the ritual associated with consultation and perhaps lifestyle advice and education.

This is termed primary action. Although a product of the medicine and vital powers conjointly, it is principally due to the former power. To its action our vital force endeavors to oppose its own energy. This resistant action is a property, is indeed an automatic action of our life-preserving power, which goes by the name of secondary action or counteraction.&#x02019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2042533313490927">15</xref></sup>
</p></disp-quote>The capacity to self-heal is therefore seen as an innate &#x02018;energy&#x02019; which can be strengthened and stimulated by the application of the homeopathic medicine because the medicine itself has been prepared by a series of dilutions and succussions to reduce its primary effect of medication and awaken its latent dynamic power:<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;By means of this manipulation of crude drugs are produced preparations which only in this way reach the full capacity to forcibly influence the suffering parts of the sick organism.&#x02019; &#x000a7;270<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2042533313490927">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2042533313490927">4</xref></sup>
