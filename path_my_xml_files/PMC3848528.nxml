Exacerbations are characterized by an acute inflammatory reaction in the airways, with recruitment of both innate and adaptive immune cells. These cell populations as well as soluble factors are critical for initiating and controlling the inflammatory processes in allergic asthma. Detailed data on the numbers and types of cells recruited following allergen challenge is lacking. In this paper we present an extensive phenotypic analysis of the inflammatory cell infiltrate present in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid following bronchoscopically directed allergen challenge in mild atopic asthmatics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A re-analysis of pooled data obtained prior to intervention in our randomized, placebo controlled, double blinded study (costimulation inhibition in asthma trial [CIA]) was performed. Twenty-four subjects underwent bronchoscopically directed segmental allergen challenge followed by BAL collection 48 hours later. The BAL fluid was analyzed by multi-color flow cytometry for immune cell populations and multi-plex ELISA for cytokine detection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Allergen instillation induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and immune modulating cytokines (IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-10) along with an increase in lymphocytes and suppressor cells (Tregs and MDSC).

Soluble CD30 was also detected in the BAL fluid after allergen challenge in adult atopic asthmatics.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>After segmental allergen challenge of adult atopic asthmatics, cell types associated with a pro-inflammatory as well as an anti-inflammatory response are detected within the BAL fluid of the lung.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>T lymphocyte</kwd><kwd>CD30 expression</kwd><kwd>Segmental allergen challenge</kwd><kwd>Asthma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Asthma is a complex immunological disease affecting approximately 8-10% of the population of the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The pathology of asthma includes pulmonary inflammation, airway eosinophilia, mucus hypersecretion and airway hyperreactivity (AHR), induced by specific and nonspecific stimuli which lead to an inappropriate Th2 response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. T lymphocytes of a Th2 type secrete IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], cytokines which play important roles in Th2 lymphocyte survival, B cell isotype switching to IgE and mast cell, basophil and eosinophil differentiation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This complex inflammatory cascade is controlled by soluble factors as well as interactions between cell types involving surface receptors such as CD80/86 on dendritic cells (DC) and CD28/CTLA-4 on T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], ultimately resulting in the asthma phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although inflammation is critical to the pathogenesis of asthma, the exact cell types present in the lung and their differentiation state remain not well defined. In this report, we characterized the immune cell populations and cytokines present within the lungs of mild atopic asthmatics that underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) after segmental allergen challenge (SAC). We detected an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and immune modulating cytokines (IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-10) along with an increase in lymphocytes and the suppressor cells, regulatory T (Treg) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Although we did not detect expression of CD30 on eosinophils, we did detect significant membrane expression of CD30 on Tregs and the presence of sCD30 in the BAL fluid of adult atopic asthmatics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Data collected from the Costimulation Inhibition in Asthma (CIA) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00784459) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] was pooled and re-analyzed for this manuscript.

Eligible participants underwent bronchoscopy with segmental allergen challenge (SAC) with instillation of 5 ml allergen solution at a concentration 1000X the minimum skin reactive test dose, with a maximum of 1:100 dilution of the stock allergen . Repeat bronchoscopy was performed 48 hours later with BAL performed in the same sub-segment in which allergen had previously been instilled.

B cells were identified as CD19+. NK cells were identified as CD56+. Regulatory T cells were identified by staining with CD4, CD25 and FoxP3. Dendritic cells were identified via lineage cocktail negative (CD3/CD14/CD16/CD19/CD20/CD56), HLA-DR high and either CD123+ for plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), or CD11c+ for myeloid dendritic cells (mDC). Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were identified as lineage cocktail negative, CD33+ and HLA-DR low. Eosinophils were identified by light scatter properties, CD16 negative and CD11b+. Fluorescently conjugated antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA), BioLegend (San Diego, CA) or eBiosciences (San Diego, CA). In brief, 1-2x10<sup>6</sup> BAL cells were labeled with fluorescently conjugated antibodies at room temperature for 30 minutes. After labeling, RBC were lysed in 1X RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience) for 1&#x02013;2 minutes and extensively washed in FACS wash (eBioscience). For FoxP3 staining, after surface labeling, cells were labeled with anti-FoxP3 antibody according to the manufactures protocol (human FoxP3 kit, eBioscience). The labeled cells were then analyzed on a 4-color FACSCalibur flow cytometer using CellQuest software (Becton-Dickinson Corporation, Mountainview, CA). Samples were gated on a lymphocyte gate followed by a second gate relevant for the population being analyzed (i.e., CD4+) and a minimum of 10,000 gated events collected.

Data obtained prior to administration of study drug provided a comprehensive data set describing the inflammatory response to allergen. We found that allergen instillation in the airway results in the recruitment of both innate and adaptive immune cells to the lung, including populations of suppressor cells. We also detected elevated expression of CD30, predominantly on regulatory T cells. Thus, the inflammatory response to allergen is a complex mixture of cell types.</p><p>Clinical and animal studies have supported the role of T lymphocytes as controllers of the aberrant Th2 initiated response and eosinophils as predominant effectors that induce asthma symptoms. The most dominant Th2 cytokine in asthma is IL-4 which has a plethora of activity including increasing IgE production, and differentiating T cells from a Th0 to Th2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We detected an increase in eosinophil percentage yet no significant increase in IL-4 after allergen challenge. Batra et al. determined the peak level of IL-4 is reached within 24 hours after allergen challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] potentially explaining the lack of IL-4 detected in our study. In most subjects the majority of cytokines were below the limits of detection. This might reflect the extensive dilution that occurs due to the BAL procedure. Given this limitation, a meaningful biological difference is hard to conclude from these data.</p><p>Asthma is a predominate Th2 disease but there is also data for Th1 and Th17 responses. Th2 effector responses in asthma such as eosinophil recruitment, mucus production and AHR are inhibited by IFN-&#x003b3; which is produced by Th1 T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We detected a significant increase in IFN-&#x003b3; as well as neutrophils which are recruited by IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] after allergen challenge (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Thus, our data supports a role for both Th2 and IFN-&#x003b3; responses in asthma.</p><p>Allergen challenge in asthmatics induces changes in both innate and adaptive cellular populations. Although we did not detect increases in B lymphocytes, a significant increase in CD4+ T lymphocytes while a significant decrease in CD8+ T lymphocytes were observed (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Furthermore, we observed alterations in T lymphocyte differentiation including: increases in na&#x000ef;ve or effector memory (CD45RA+) percentages, increased CD25 (IL-2R) expression, and a decreased memory CD8+ pool after allergen challenge signifying a T cell response to antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This is consistent with mouse models of asthma where increased levels of IFN-&#x003b3; inhibit the generation of memory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] further contributing to the expansion of an effector T cell pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>We did not observe differences in Nk cells or myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), innate cells important in asthma pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; however, a significant increase in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) was detected after allergen challenge. The recruitment of pDC may be part of the anti-inflammatory response in asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In accordance with this anti-inflammatory response, an increase in regulatory T cells (Treg) as well as increased IL-10 secretion, a regulatory T and pDC effector cytokine, were detected after allergen challenge (Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Regulatory T cells inhibit allergic responses by 1) suppressing myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) important for T lymphocyte activation and differentiation, 2) inhibiting Th1/Th2 and Th17 differentiation, 3) inhibiting IgE production, 4) preventing T lymphocyte migration into the lung and 5) inhibiting effector cell function of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Importantly, we further identified an additional innate cell population termed myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) as being increased after allergen challenge in adult atopic asthmatics (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Our report is the first to identify MDSC in the BAL fluid of adult atopic asthmatics after allergen challenge. Interestingly in a mouse model of asthma, MDSC were shown to recruit regulatory T cells and down modulate T lymphocyte responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We also show that MDSC expressed co-stimulatory ligands, both CD80 and CD86, which have been associated with inducing Th2 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] as well as producing IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Therefore, multiple suppressor cell types are associated with the anti-inflammatory response detected in the lung after allergen challenge.</p><p>Soluble CD30 is increased in the serum of pediatric asthma patients when compared to healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] as well as after allergen challenge in our study. We also detected sCD30 in the serum prior to allergen challenge (20.3 &#x000b1; 8.0 ng/mL; data not shown) in adult atopic asthmatics. The role of soluble CD30 in asthma is not clear but is thought to block CD30-CD153 induced apoptosis and the induction of IgG class switching on B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The presence of sCD30 in the BAL after allergen challenge may play a role in either preventing apoptosis of activated lymphocytes or in their differentiation. However, the role of sCD30 in asthma is unknown and requires further study.</p><p>Contrary to reports that detected mRNA and low surface expression of CD30 on eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we did not observe any CD30 expression on eosinophils by either flow cytometry (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A) or immuno-histochemistry (data not shown). We did however detect membrane CD30 on lymphocytes, especially regulatory T cells, after allergen challenge. CD30 expression on CD4+ T cells has been associated with IL-4 secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] while CD30+ eosinophils undergo apoptosis in asthmatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Memory CD8+ T lymphocytes express CD30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], yet in our study the lowest percentage of CD30+ cells were CD8+ T lymphocytes. This may be partly explained by the decreased memory pool of CD8+ T cells after allergen challenge (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). There are no reports of CD30 expression on regulatory T cells in human asthma. In mouse model systems of allograft tolerance, a Th2 dominated response like asthma, CD30-deficient Tregs failed to reject grafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Due to the low cellularity of pre-allergen BAL sample, we were unable to measure CD30 expression on lymphocytes in most subjects. However, in a single subject, the percentage of CD30+ Tregs in the BAL after allergen challenge increased from 0.04% pre-allergen to 24.6% post-allergen challenge (data not shown). The role of CD30 expression on Tregs in asthma remains unclear; however, interaction between CD30 on the Treg and CD153 on a CD8+ T cell results in apoptosis of the CD8+ T cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, we speculate that CD30+ regulatory T cells and sCD30 play a role in controlling asthma in a CD30-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Atopic asthmatics increase innate and adaptive immune cell populations after allergen challenge.
