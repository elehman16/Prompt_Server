Increase in the release of glutamate, the major neurotransmitter both in the cochlea and in the central auditory pathways, has been suggested to be involved in the generation and maintenance of sensorineural tinnitus by causing &#x0201c;excitotoxicity&#x0201d; and thus overexpression of NMDA receptors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Therapy for tinnitus is focused on drugs that act directly on CNS neurotransmitters, like glutamate, GABA, serotonin, acetylcholine and dopamine. Glutamate receptor antagonists which block glutamate binding sites and prevent/attenuate the influx of calcium can be useful for the condition.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Acamprosate, a drug used for treating alcohol dependence, was first reported as a potential treatment for tinnitus in 2005.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The drug acts by a dual mechanism of action, acting both as a glutamate antagonist and as a GABA agonist. A recent double-blind study reported a relief of tinnitus in over 80% of patients treated with acamprosate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The promising application of the drug and multipronged action has prompted to design this study to evaluate the efficacy of acamprosate in subjects who have tinnitus of sensorineural origin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The present randomized, double blind, crossover study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of acamprosate in tinnitus of sensorineural origin.</p><p>Primary outcome measures:</p><p>

Two patients reported their conditions to be worse and they were shifted to another treatment. Three patients left in between and could not complete the study. Forty patients were able to complete the study. All of them had a varying degree of sensorineural hearing loss. The pure tone audiogram depicted a &#x02018;downward sloping curve&#x02019; in these patients. 65% of patients had bilateral hearing loss and 35% had bilateral tinnitus.</p><p>The age of patients was 18 to 84 years with an average of 53 years.</p><p>The improvement score or reduction in tinnitus score was observed in 92.5% of patients included in this study.

The subjective improvement was greater than objective improvement. The drug was well tolerated and did not show any serious drug reactions. No patient had any change in audiogram shape. Patients who obtained the best results were those who had the symptoms for shorter duration.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tinnitus is defined as a phantom auditory perception&#x02014;it is a perception of sound without corresponding acoustic or mechanical correlates in the cochlea.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Tinnitus represents one of the most common and distressing otological problems, and it causes various somatic and psychological disorders that interfere with the QOL. Tinnitus is a subjective phenomenon that is difficult to evaluate objectively, with it being measured, quantified, and described only based on the responses of patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>It has been established that 35&#x02013;40% of all adults over 17 years of age experience noises lasting longer than 5 min of various degrees of loudness at some time.A miniscule number of patients (0.5%) are in urgent need of treatment. These patients may also experience sleep disorders, poor concentration and depression from which there seems no escape. Another, 0.5-1% of adults report tinnitus of such severity so as to have a significant adverse effect on their QOL.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Current treatments of tinnitus are not cures; they are a means to reduce tinnitus perception or awareness. Well controlled trials of management strategies are few and published success rates of most treatments remain controversial. Despite this, there is sufficient evidence to advocate existing strategies to reduce tinnitus annoyance and improve QOL.</p><p>Other drugs already studied for treatment of tinnitus are lidocaine,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] antidepressants,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] baclofen,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] caroverine,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] nimodipine,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] clonazepam[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] and trimetazidine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The introduction of these drug therapies have increased the success of tinnitus treatment.</p><p>Different studies have shown that sensorineural tinnitus is caused by an imbalance of these two neurotransmitters with an excitatory predominance. There are many drugs that act on neurotransmitters, but only very few modulate the GABA-glutamate system in the afferent auditory pathway and had no major undesirable side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>Modulation of glutaminergic transmission by topical administration of the nonselective glutamate receptor antagonist caroverine to the inner ear has been proposed for tinnitus treatment. However, the systemic use of nonselective glutamate receptor blockers such as caroverine is limited by severe neurological and psychiatric side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Gabapentin, a GABA-mimetic, has shown encouraging results in the improvement of tinnitus in high doses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] But there is little evidence to support the general use of gabapentin in subjective tinnitus. Acamprosate, a drug used in the treatment of alcohol addiction, could have a similar effect in the auditory afferent pathway. Its dual mechanism of action, which reduces the glutaminergic transmission (excitatory) and increases the GABA activity (inhibitory), together with its excellent tolerability, makes it a promising drug for treatment of tinnitus. There is lack of literature on the use of acamprosate for tinnitus treatment.</p><p>The present study has been designed to evaluate the effectiveness of acamprosate in sensorineural tinnitus. This study had also proved the better results to cure the sensorineural tinnitus as compared to placebo. The subjective assessment was done by visual analogue score and QOL questionnaires. The objective improvement was compared with tinnitus matching in frequency and loudness. The improvement rate in drug group was better than placebo. The improvement score was seen in 92.5% of drug treated patients.</p><p>The improvement score or reduction in tinnitus score was observed in 92.5% of patients included in this study as compared to previous study which showed an improvement score of 86.9% in 90 days. At the end of study, only five patients (7.5%) showed no improvement as compared to 13.06% in previous study. Twenty-one patients (77.5%) reported improvement below 50%, six patients (15%) reported improvement higher than 50%. Five patients (12.5%) reported that their tinnitus had disappeared as compared to 13.04% in previous study.</p><p>Objective improvement was seen in 80% of patients reducing the severity of tinnitus loudness up to 5dB to zero</p><p>In placebo group, 12.5% reported improvement subjectively only.</p><p>The subjective improvement was greater than objective improvement. The drug was well tolerated and did not show any serious drug reactions. No patient had any change in audiogram shape. Those patients who were fully treated or obtained the best results were those who had the symptoms for less time. On the basis of the findings of this study, it may be concluded that acamprosate is superior to placebo in relieving the symptoms of sensory neural tinnitus. Its safety profile is conducive to long-term uses.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Roedel</surname><given-names>KL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The Ear Foundation of Arizona Information About Tinnitus: General Information and Prevalence [serial Online]</article-title><year>1992</year><date-in-citation>Last cited in 2008 Aug 21</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
