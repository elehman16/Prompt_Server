A number of prior educational interventions have been developed and evaluated for this purpose, but inconsistency of findings, reporting standards, and methodologies have led the majority of reviewers to conclude that the evidence for the efficacy of these programmes remains inconclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A cluster randomised controlled trial design has been employed to enable a feasibility study of 'SchoolSpace', an intervention in 7 UK secondary schools addressing stigma of mental illness, mental health literacy, and promotion of mental health. A central aspect of the intervention involves students in the experimental condition interacting with a young person with lived experience of mental illness, a stigma reducing technique designed to facilitate students' engagement in the project. The primary outcome is the level of stigma related to mental illness. Secondary outcomes include mental health literacy, resilience to mental illness, and emotional well-being. Outcomes will be measured pre and post intervention, as well as at 6 month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The proposed intervention presents the potential for increased engagement due to its combination of education and contact with a young person with lived experience of mental illness. Contact as a technique to reduce discrimination has been evaluated previously in research with adults, but has been employed in only a minority of research trials investigating the impact on youth. Prior to this study, the effect of contact on mental health literacy, resilience, and emotional well-being has not been evaluated to the authors' knowledge. If efficacious the intervention could provide a reliable and cost-effective method to reduce stigma in young people, whilst increasing mental health literacy, and emotional well-being.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN07406026">ISRCTN07406026</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Adolescence</kwd><kwd>Mental health</kwd><kwd>Stigma</kwd><kwd>Contact</kwd><kwd>School</kwd><kwd>Intervention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>There is growing pressure on schools in England to address stigma and misconceptions of mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] as well as increasing emotional well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] in addition to traditional academic curricula. Currently there is little agreement as to what approach might most successfully address these issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Over half of all lifetime mental disorders have their onset during childhood and adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] yet young people's knowledge of mental illness is often incomplete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] or influenced by sensationalised reports in the media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Developmentally, adolescence is a complex period, with the majority of young people experiencing some level of distress or emotional problems. The adolescent brain has been shown to confer higher risk for mental illness due to a difference in the maturation of the developing brain and the adolescent emotional and cognitive systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Adolescents also experience high levels of schizotypal thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], something which among adults is related to high vulnerability to mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Individuals with mental illness experience discriminatory attitudes in almost all areas of their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and stigma, alongside poor mental health literacy, can increase barriers to help-seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Prevalence rates for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia increase rapidly between the ages of 15 to 17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] with children and adolescents who experience early onset anxiety disorders such as phobias and separation anxiety disorder more likely to develop co-morbid disorders of substance use, later-onset anxiety, or mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Earlier age of onset for many mental illnesses is also correlated with greater severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and increased resistance to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Young people themselves report that they would like to receive more information regarding mental health. Both Kidger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and Woolfson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] found that students stated that they were dissatisfied with the mental health education they were receiving. Olsson and Kennedy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] found that less than 30% of students recalled any discussion of mental health during school lessons, despite the fact that mental health education was mandatory in the area their research was conducted.</p><p>There is growing evidence to suggest that early interventions designed to optimise well-being or reduce mental illness and initiated during childhood and adolescence may help reduce mental health problems in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The UK National Healthy Schools Programme attempts to address this, and advocates increasing emotional health and well-being (EHWB) support for students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Schools engaged in this programme are expected to address subjects related to social skills and emotional health to their curriculum with targets including 'combating stigma and discrimination'; and 'encouraging the participation of children and young people in activities designed to build their confidence and self esteem' to achieve National Healthy Schools Status. There is however, no obligation for schools to take part and some remain uninvolved. Additionally, with lack of monitoring and threat of further funding cuts, the current programme appears vulnerable.</p><sec><title>Previous interventions</title><p>Reducing stigma and discrimination of mental illness, improving mental health literacy, reducing a particular mental illness, or promoting resilience are all popular methods for tackling mental health issues in schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Such interventions often demonstrate significant benefits such as reducing stigma, conduct problems and increasing prosocial behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], challenging negative opinions of psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and can have a positive impact on interrelated factors such as school achievement, school climate, and reduced emotional behavioural and disciplinary problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The abundance of interventions are however, not easily comparable, and identifying which components of an intervention are successful, and which components lack utility, is often not possible. This has led to some large-scale interventions being instigated without a clear understanding of the likely efficacy of trial components. For example the <italic>BeyondBlue </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] trial in Australia included 50 schools in a five year intervention aimed at reducing and preventing depression and reported flat results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Feasibility trialling and careful evaluation is needed to capture the potential problems as well as benefits of school interventions prior to the widespread dissemination of larger scale projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Many systematic reviews now concur that whole school approaches are the most effective model and emphasise the need to promote mental health universally rather than solely targeting the reduction of mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. A greater investment in long-term approaches are also favoured by reviewers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and it has been suggested that future research should include more detailed analysis of demographic variables such as ethnicity and gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Regarding stigma and mental health literacy, fewer systematic reviews have been conducted into school-based studies. Kelly et al.'s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] review concluded that for adolescents, good mental health literacy is associated with more positive outcomes for emotional well-being but add a caveat that very few school interventions to improve mental health literacy have been evaluated and even fewer <italic>well </italic>evaluated. Pinfold et al.'s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] systematic review suggested that contact with individuals who describe personal experience of mental illness was more likely to lead to reductions in reported stigma; in contrast, a systematic review by Schachter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] failed to find any 'even remotely ideal investigation[s] whose results regarding possible benefits we can confidently accept as being reliable and valid' (p. 22). Schachter et al. criticised studies for a range of reasons including; inadequate study descriptions; poor research methodology; inadequate interventions; and failing to measure or control for relevant baseline characteristics of participants. Funding is also an issue in the present climate, with programmes designed to impact upon mental health issues in schools needing to demonstrate value for money as well as reliable and consistent effect sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In summary, further well-designed research in these fields is warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Contact and stigma</title><p>Corrigan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] identify three strategies for challenging stigmatising attitudes and prejudice towards mental illness: 'protest', 'education', and 'contact'. 'Protest' involves condemning prejudicial attitudes; if a company were employing an advertising campaign that was deemed to be stigmatising, public protest may encourage changing of the advert, thus suppressing the stigmatising attitude. 'Education' seeks to encourage an increase in knowledge and awareness regarding mental illness, thereby dispelling myths in the belief that the more individuals understand the less prejudiced they will be. 'Contact' reasons that the more contact an individual has with someone who has experienced mental illness, the less stigmatising they will be, although the relationship is correlational - it may equally be the case that those who hold less stigmatising attitudes towards mental illness are happier to have contact with individuals experiencing mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Rusch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]note that if contact is employed to facilitate attitude change then this must be carried out under a controlled set of circumstances if the best possible outcome is to be achieved, otherwise the intervention may have a negative rather than positive outcome. Allport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] who first proposed the contact hypothesis, similarly claimed that contact needed to involve individuals of equal status with the 'in' and 'out' groups working together rather than in competition with one another. Of protest, education, and contact, Corrigan et al. argue that contact is the most effective, followed by education, with protest having little significant impact on participants. Like Minds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] add that contact married to education is a powerful combination for combating stigma.</p><p>Contact has been employed as a strategy to reduce stigma and increase understanding of mental health issues in a number of studies with adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] but rarely in school interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Results have however shown promise, and contact may be a way of increasing the impact of interventions by facilitating engagement and overcoming barriers to learning. To date, contact has not been utilised to improve mental health literacy and emotional well-being in young people, but there is some evidence to suggest that it might have a favourable effect as two recent qualitative studies have indicated that young people wish to be taught about emotional well-being and mental health issues by someone who has lived experience of mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The current study</title><p>The SchoolSpace intervention programme has been designed to measure the impact of an educational intervention on three core targets: reduction in stigma related to mental illness; mental health literacy; and promotion of mental health, with reduction in stigma related to mental illness being the primary outcome. Previous research has suggested that these may be interlinked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. For example, someone who doesn't <italic>understand</italic>, or is <italic>prejudiced </italic>against mental illness, may not seek help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], leading them to be less <italic>resilient</italic>. The primary research question asks; 'is education in combination with contact better than education alone for reducing stigma?' Based on previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] it is hypothesised that participants in the contact and education condition will report significantly reduced stigma towards mental illness compared with participants in the education only (control) condition.</p><p>Secondary research questions relate to how contact in combination with education may influence participants' a) mental health literacy, and b) emotional well-being and resilience, compared to education alone. In addition to this the trial will assess any influence of contact on attitudes to help-seeking. Previous research has found that stigma is a major barrier to help-seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and that low mental health literacy can lead to a delay in help-seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It is therefore hypothesised that a reduction in stigma and increased mental health literacy will be associated with an increase in positive attitudes towards help-seeking.</p><p>Additionally, schizotypal thinking, which is linked to vulnerability to mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and is common during adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] will also be measured. This addresses whether higher rates of schizotypal thinking in adolescence are linked to adolescents' increased vulnerability to developing mental illness compared to other age groups, or if such thinking patterns are developmental in some way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. If they are a sign of an adolescents increased vulnerability to mental illness then with increased resilience and increased mental health and emotional well-being, we hypothesise that rates of schizotypal thinking should reduce in participants. However, if schizotypal thinking is developmental than we might expect to see the opposite trend, with schizotypal thinking unaffected by any changes in mental well-being or resilience.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Method/Design</title><p>SchoolSpace is a randomised controlled trial with two conditions: an experimental condition which includes contact with a young person with lived experience of mental illness as well as education, and an active control condition, which includes education but no contact. Measures will be taken 3 weeks prior to the intervention, and at both 2 weeks and 6 months post intervention. Random allocation will take place at the level of school and blocking will be used to randomly stratify classes to different conditions. Random allocation will be independent and concealed. Randomisation will be undertaken by an individual independent of the research team, and will take place after pre-test. The intervention has been designed in accordance with CONSORT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>7 schools will take part in the intervention, with students aged 12-13. Schools will be chosen to represent a cross section of demographics, including different ethnic groups and genders. The average year group within Birmingham secondary schools takes approximately 150 students enabling up to 1050 participants in this feasibility trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study was granted ethical approval by The University of Birmingham ethics committee in June 2010 (reference number ERN_10-0397), and the primary author is funded through the NIHR CLAHRC (Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care) Birmingham &#x00026; Black Country programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Development and piloting of the intervention</title><p>Original intervention materials were developed by K.C., E.T. and P.P. in collaboration with teachers and service-users with additional educational resources evolved from the work of Dr Gary O'Reilly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] and the Staffordshire Changes YP mental health programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Focus groups were also conducted with young people by K.C. to aid the development of the programme. Interventions tend to be more successful if they are delivered over time, rather than in one intensive session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], however the current intervention is a feasibility trial, and due to the constraints of resources, it was decided that a one-day intervention would be used, with the expectation that the intervention will be developed into a longer term intervention plan for evaluation in the future, should it prove to be successful.</p><p>The intervention was piloted in one school to assess the practicality; timings, level of pitch, and suitability of materials for the target age group. Classes were randomised to the Education and Contact condition and Education Only conditions. Procedure of the pilot intervention is identical to the feasibility trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Feasibility trial</title><p>The feasibility trial intervention covers three interrelated subjects; 1. Stigma of mental illness, 2. Mental health literacy, and 3. Improving our own mental health. Pupils receive four hours aimed to impact upon the former two of these subjects and two hours aimed to impact upon the latter. In the education and contact condition a young person with experience living with mental illness will work with the students as one of the teaching assistants and will lead a 10-20 minute presentation and interactive discussion about living with a mental illness.</p><p>The intervention will be delivered by NHS mental health specialist staff and service-users.

Once a school has agreed to participate, consent letters will be sent out to the parents of all participating students.</p><p>Pre-intervention questionnaires will be completed 3-4 weeks prior to the intervention day. A self-generated code will be used to match participant answers over time whilst preserving anonymity. This code has a reported 92% success rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. It must therefore be expected that a minimum of 8% of participants may be lost over time due to mistakes in the generation of this code. Teachers will have over a week to collect questionnaire data in order to minimise loss of data through student absences from school.</p><p>Class randomisation to condition will take place after pre-test, at the level of school.</p></sec><sec><title>Stage 2; the intervention</title><p>Participants are taught within their usual classes. Each class is facilitated by 2-4 staff including a lead who will be a NHS mental health specialist, and a teaching assistant. Facilitators in the education and contact condition include at least one facilitator who has lived experience of mental illness. As well as the facilitators a minimum of one teacher from the school will be present in each class. Fidelity of the intervention delivery between conditions will be assessed with a pre-developed checklist on the intervention day. One class per condition, per school will be assessed for fidelity by K.C.</p></sec><sec><title>Stage 3; post-tests</title><p>Approximately 2 weeks after the intervention day post-intervention questionnaires will be completed by participants, and then again at 6 month follow up.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome measure</title><sec><title>Stigma of mental illness</title><p>The Reported &#x00026; Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] assesses behaviour related to the stigma of mental illness.

Previous research suggests that the intervention may have some effect on stigma even at 6-month follow up, due to this influence of contact combined with education. Pinfold et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>] for example, employed contact with an individual with personal experience of living with mental illness in their intervention with 14-15 year old students. Although their intervention was brief, lasting for just two one-hour workshops, a significant positive change in stigmatising attitudes was found both immediately following the intervention and also at 6-month follow up.</p><p>Previous interventions have tended to focus on one or at most two of the concepts of stigma, mental health literacy, and resilience/well-being, rather than all three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This is despite evidence inferring that the three concepts are to some extent interlinked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. For example, Naylor et al.'s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] intervention significantly reduced conduct problems and improved prosocial behaviour, despite the fact that the intervention did not contain any features designed to reduce mental illness or promote mental health. Though the research is not directly designed to look at this, if stigma, mental health literacy, and resilience/well-being are interlinked, it may be that by addressing all three simultaneously, a greater impact can be achieved.</p><p>The current intervention also addresses many of the methodological issues which have been highlighted by previous systematic research reviews as problematic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The study has a high level of power; utilises an active control group; measures and evaluates demographic differences including ethnicity, religion, and gender for response to the intervention; attempts to improve consent rate by utilising an opt-out consent method; is delivered by the research team rather than by teachers from the individual schools and assessed for fidelity of implementation. The research measures mediator variables such as resilience as well as baseline characteristics of the individual such as whether they know someone with a mental illness, and the exact nature and content of the intervention will be explicitly described and freely available.</p><p>If positive trends result from the present feasibility trial this will support the development of further longitudinal work on a larger scale, something which is urgently needed in this field.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KC is chief investigator on the project and drafted the manuscript.
