Luminal A tumours have a better prognosis and they tend to be sensitive to anti-estrogen drugs. Luminal B tumours have incomplete sensitivity to endocrine therapy. Her2 tumours, which have an aggressive natural history, are sensitive to trastuzumab. Finally, basal-like tumours might be eligible for chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemosensitivity to docetaxel and doxorubicin of breast cancer subtypes. Patients with locally advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive 4 cycles of full dose doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) or docetaxel (100 mg/m2).

Among 130 samples analysed most ER positive tumours were luminal subtype. 41% of Her2 positive tumours assessed by immunohistochemistry and FISH were Her2 according to the gene expression profile. Luminal A and normal-like tumours have low expression of proliferation genes as well as ki67, whereas Her2 and basal-like tumours are highly proliferative. Both treatments have the same efficiency (20% of responses). However, basal tumours have the poorest outcome in the doxorubicin branch (0% of responses) while they are the most sensitive to docetaxel (50% of responses). Luminal and normal-like tumours have the poorest responses to both treatments.

Luminal A tumours have a better prognosis and they tend to be sensitive to anti-estrogen drugs. Luminal B tumours have incomplete sensitivity to endocrine therapy. Her2 tumours, which have an aggressive natural history, are sensitive to trastuzumab. Finally, basal-like tumours might be eligible for chemotherapy (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>AIM OF THE STUDY</title><p>To evaluate the chemosensitivity to docetaxel and doxorubicin of breast cancer subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>Patients with locally advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive 4 cycles of full dose doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) or docetaxel (100 mg/m2). After the fourth cycle, patients were submitted to surgery to ascertain pathological response.</p><p>RNA was extracted from the pre-treatment tumour biopsy using Quiagen RNeasy Mini Kit following the instructions of the manufacturer. Whole Human Genome Oligo 4x44 Microarray (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were hybridised following Low RNA Input Fluorescent Amplification 4 x 44k Perou lab protocol (available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://peroulab.med.unc.edu/protocols/index.htm">http://peroulab.med.unc.edu/protocols/index.htm</ext-link>). Samples were classified as previously described (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Treatment response was assessed according to Symmans classification (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>RESULTS</title><p>130 samples were analysed. Most ER positive tumours were luminal subtype. Similarly, we found that all basal-like tumours were triple negative by immunohistochemistry. Only 41% of Her2 positive tumours assessed by immunohistochemistry and FISH were Her2 according to the gene expression profile. Luminal A and normal-like tumours have low expression of proliferation genes as well as ki67, whereas Her2 and basal-like tumours are highly proliferative. As previously described, we also found that there is a correlation between tumour subtype and histological grade. The average age of diagnosis is lower in the basal-like tumours.</p><p>Regarding chemosensitivity, we found that both treatments have the same efficiency (20% of responses). Basal tumours have the poorest outcome in the doxorubicin branch (0% of responses) while they are the most sensitive to docetaxel (50% of responses). Luminal and normal-like tumours have the poorest responses to both treatments. Finally, Her2 tumours had similar outcome in both branches (20% of responses).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Several gene signatures have been developed to predict tumour prognosis and treatment response. However, there are few data concerning tumour sensitivity to single agent chemotherapy regimens. Two gene signatures predictive for treatment response to docetaxel have been published (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) but none of them give information about tumour subtype. One study developed in a cohort of patients treated with doxorubicin found that luminal B profile was associated with resistance to doxorubicin (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>The genomic classification by Perou et al has been widely accepted. This classification may assist the physician in the choice of a specific treatment based on the sub-type of tumour. Therefore, it is important to asses the sensitivity of the different subtypes to chemotherapy agents.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>FUTURE WORK</title><p>This study provides the basis for building individualized neoadjuvant therapies for breast cancer. Testing the value of the addition of other therapies than docetaxel in Her2 (i.e. trastuzumab) or basal-like carcinomas (i.e. antiangiogenics or platinum salts) might be the logical next step.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>I would like to thank the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory medicine as well as the SECQ (Spanish Society of Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology) for their support.
