Its role in the etiology of periodontal disease has been extensively documented. Across the world, it is confronted that deterrence and reticence of accumulation of plaque on the surfaces of tooth result in a major breakthrough to achieve excellent periodontal health. Regular removal of supragingival plaque has been shown to reduce counts of pathogenic species both supra- and sub-gingivally.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Various techniques have been introduced and investigated for successful usefulness of tooth brushing in plaque removal. Comparative studies are also available with regard to brushing techniques claiming significance of one over the other performed by both manual and powered toothbrush.</p><p>The bristle toothbrushes were first invented about the year 1600, in China, and were first patented in America in 1857, and have since undergone little changes. A Swedish watchmaker Fredrick Wilhelm Tornberg is credited with designing the first mechanical toothbrush in 1885. According to Rosenthal, the first powered toothbrush was introduced at the American Dental Association Convention in St. Louis in 1938. It was in the 1960s that widespread use and testing of electric brushes in controlling plaque, gingivitis, and staining were initiated.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The electric toothbrush is both efficient and surprisingly appealing to patients. For these reasons, it has a definite use for some patients such as individuals lacking fine motor skills, especially the physically challenged and those who lack digital dexterity.</p><p>The motto in training oral hygiene procedures is it to reduce plaque accumulation. Although many advancements in the field of periodontology have been evaluated to control the oral hygiene, the ultimate prevention and control of gingivitis and periodontitis rest in the hands of the patients.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Since the arrival and invention of the electric toothbrush, there has been continuing controversy whether or not it is more efficacious than a manual toothbrush. Some reports seem to indicate that powered toothbrushes are better than manual ones in maintaining good oral hygiene.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, the results of previously conducted studies have concluded that both the brushing modalities have similar effect on plaque control.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Furthermore, like the manual brush, electric brushes are not very effective in removing plaque on the interproximal and lingual tooth surfaces.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Consequently, other mechanical devices in the form of toothpicks, floss, single-tufted toothbrush, interdental (bottle brush type) brushes, and water picks were devised and advocated to supplement a given brushing technique, for most effective and complete plaque removal.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The goal of the present study was to appraise the safety and adequacy of the Braun/Oral-B two-dimensional (2D) powered toothbrush for the elimination of supragingival plaque and developing gingival health and to compare it to a routine manual toothbrush Oral-B40 Regular Advantage Plus toothbrush.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>A<sc>IM AND OBJECTIVE</sc></title><p>To figure out, analyze and assess the efficacy and effectiveness of the powered toothbrush (Braun/Oral-B 2D) and manual toothbrush (Oral-B40 Regular Advantage Plus) on supragingival plaque and gingival health.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was conducted in the Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Kalinga Institute of Dental Sciences, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, from February to May 2016, after obtaining ethical approval from Institutional Ethics Committee (KIMS/KIIT/IEC/148/2016).
