current stimulation (tDCS) on the upper limb of function of patients with post-stroke
hemiplegia. [Subjects] Twenty subjects were randomly allocated to either the upper tDCS
group or the functional training group, with 10 subjects in each group. [Methods] The two
groups received functional training for thirty minutes a day, five days a week for four
weeks. The tDCS group additionally received tDCS for 20 minutes. The outcome was assessed
by the Box and Block test (BBT), grip strength, and the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA).
[Results] There were significant improvements between pre- and post- intervention in both
groups, in the BBT, grip strength, and the upper limb and lower lims sub-items of the FMA.
The tDCS group showed significantly greater improvements than the control group in the
BBT, and upper limb and lower limb sub-items of the FMA. [Conclusion] These findings
suggest that tDCS may be more beneficial than functional training for improving the upper
and lower limb functions of chronic stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>tDCS</kwd><kwd>Limb function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke refers to the lesions and neurologic symptoms resulting from damage to the blood
vessels distributed in the brain. Its clinical symptoms include muscle weakening, abnormal
muscle tones, somatosensory deficit, decline in physical intelligence, and speech
disorders<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. These symptoms cause
restriction of stroke patients&#x02019; daily living activities, such as abnormal gait, to the
extent that 85% of patients show disorders in upper limb functions six months after the
onset of stroke<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the upper limb
functions of stroke patients, hand functions are the most seriously impaired because Betz
cells exist the most densely in the region that is responsible for hand control in the motor
cortex<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In stroke patients, the
recovery of upper limb motor function is essential for independent performance of daily
living activities, because the upper limbs remarkably contribute to most daily living
activities and are important for the performance of voluntary movements<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the functional recovery of the upper limbs is a
primary objective of physical therapy and clinicians should focus on effective plans and
treatments for patients&#x02019; performance of upper limb related activities. Recently, studies
have been actively conducted on non-invasive nerve stimulation methods intended to promote
the plasticity and reorganization of injured areas of the brain after brain lesions. Schlaug
and Renga<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when transcranial
direct current stimulation (tDCS) and motor learning were implemented in combination, the
cerebral cortex was enhanced and functional recovery was promoted. Stefan et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that cerebral cortex stimulation
had positive effects on peripheral activities and centric stimuli.</p><p>tDCS is a direct brain stimulation method that can be simply and conveniently used in
clinics, and can efficiently activate stroke patients&#x02019; motor cortexes<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although many studies have performed peripheral stimulation
of cranial nerves using electrical stimulation or functional electrical stimulation, for
stroke patients&#x02019; functional recovery, studies that have performed centric stimulation such
as tDCS are lacking. Therefore, the present study investigated the clinical effects of tDCS
as rehabilitation therapy for the central nervous system by objectively examining the effect
of tDCS on stroke patients&#x02019; upper and lower limb functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted with those who voluntarily agreed to participate in the
experiment after being given sufficient explanation about the purpose and method of the
study. The subjects were recruited from patients diagnosed with hemiplegia due to stroke who
had gait disturbance. The subjects were participated ten of experimental group (age,
59.8&#x000b1;11.4&#x02005;years; height, 166.3&#x000b1;5.8&#x02005;cm; weight, 65.0&#x000b1;8.3&#x02005;kg; affected side (left/right), 6/4;
since onset, 13.8&#x000b1;4.6 months; MMSE-K, 25.6&#x000b1;2.8; Brunnstrom stage, 5.2&#x000b1;0.7), and 10 subjects
in the control group (age, 57.8&#x000b1;9.9&#x02005;years; height, 168.0&#x000b1;8.8&#x02005;cm; weight, 65.2&#x000b1;7.7&#x02005;kg;
affected side (left/right), 5/5; since onset, 14.5&#x000b1;3.6 months; MMSE-K, 26.7&#x000b1;2.6; Brunnstrom
stage, 4.78&#x000b1;0.8). The general characteristics of the subjects were not significantly
different between the groups.</p><p>The subjects were assigned to the treatment groups by having each of the subjects take out
one card from a box containing two types of card representing both of the treatment groups.
All the subjects received basic training for functional improvement of the upper and lower
extremities for 30 minutes per day, five times per week for four weeks. The experimental
group additionally received tDCS for 20 minutes.</p><p>For tDCS (Phoresor II Auto model PM 700, IOMED, Salt Lake City, USA), 7&#x000d7;5&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>
(area; 24&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>) sized sponge electrodes (Daeyang medical Co., Ltd, Korea) were
used. The anode of the electrode was attached to the precentral sulcus (10&#x02013;20 international
electroencephalography system C3 or C4), which is the primary motor area on the same side as
the lesion, and the cathode was attached to the forehead on the other side. The electrodes
were soaked in water and fixed in maximal tight contact with the relevant areas using bands.
The intensity and time of the stimulation applied were 1 mA and 20 minutes, respectively.
These conditions were sufficient to generate large amounts of motor evoked potential without
causing adverse effects or inconvenience within the range of safety indicated by previous
studies<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The box and block test can be used as a measure of manual dexterity and can provide one
indication of hand dominance. The box and block test consists of a wooden box 53.7&#x02005;cm by
25.4&#x02005;cm which is divided into two equal compartments by a 15.4&#x02005;cm-high partition. Subjects
were instructed to transfer as many 2.5&#x02005;cm cubes as possible from one compartment to the
other in one minute. Subjects&#x02019; scores were the number of cubes transferred in one
minute<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Grip strength was evaluated by a dynamometer (JAMAR hand dynamometer, Sammons Preston
Rolyan, Ilinois, USA). For measurement, subjects sat with their arms at their sides with the
elbow joint in 90&#x000b0; flexion and the wrist joint in the neutral position. The subjects were
asked to squeeze the dynamometer with as much force as possible, being careful to squeeze
only once for each measurement. Three trials were made with a rest of about one minute
between each<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The FMA is a
stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. It is designed to assess motor
function, balance, sensation and joint function of patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. It
is used clinically and in research to determine disease severity, describe motor recovery,
and to plan and assess treatment<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
maximum score for the motor performance is divided into 66 points for the upper extremity
and 34 for the lower extremity<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA). After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, the paired t-test
was used to compare the changes occurring between pre-test and post-test in each group. The
differences between the two groups were tested using the independent t-test. The statistical
significance level, &#x003b1;, was chosen as 0.05</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were significant improvements after the intervention in both groups, in the BBT, grip

Stimulation of the brain by non-invasive technique such as tDCS, regulates the function of
non-specific neural structures, and improves corticomotor excitability and motor function
enhancement<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. tDCS is a comfortable
and painless corticomotor stimulation technique that induces functional changes dependent on
the parameters, intensity, duration, and location of stimulation<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study evaluated the effect of tDCS training with
conventional physical therapy on function of the upper and lower limbs and activities of
daily living (ADL) of stroke patient with activity limitations. The main findings of our
study were significant improvements in upper limb and lower limb motor function and ADL in
the experimental group compared to the control group.</p><p>This is similar to findings that the application of tDCS improves activation of the
premotor cortex and hand function<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Fregni et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that tDCS could
improve of impaired lower limb function and ADL, such as independent and voluntary motor
performance. Hummel et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that
tDCS for ten days of the primary motor cortex shortened reaction times by 11.75% in the
Jebsen-Taylor hand function test. In addition, regarding a study applying tDCS to the hand
and leg areas of the motor cortex reported improved activation of the corticospinal tract,
enhanced recovery level, and a shortened recovery time among stroke patients<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. This means that application of tDCS
improves the walking ability of stroke patients.</p><p>In this study, limb motor function and ADL assesment significantly improved in the
experimental group, which indicats that tDCS had a beneficial effct for these subjects. This
result agrees with previous reports that tDCS increased motor performance assessments of the
shoulder, elbow, and wrist, and lower limb assessments of stroke patients<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Together, these results suggest that conventional physical therapy
with tDCS provides non-specific input to the motor cortex, facilitating changes in neural
activation and synaptic plasticity which promote functional recovery, and enhance voluntary
activities such as ADL by increasing the activity of the cerebral cortex in damaged brain
areas<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the application of
tDCS could facilitate cortical repair by brain reorganization, and have great clinical
benefits through improvements of impaired cortex and motor dysfunction of stroke patients. A
variety of stimuli delivered to the cerebral cortex may enhance neural plasticity and motor
learning. Application of tDCS combined with physical therapy may be more beneficial than
functional training for improving the limb functions and activities of daily living of
patients with chronic stroke. Further studies are needed to generalize these findings, to
investigate a variety of physical therapies with concurrent tDCS, and to consider patients&#x02019;
quality of life as well as independence of ADL.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kautz</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Patten</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Interlimb influences on paretic leg function in post
