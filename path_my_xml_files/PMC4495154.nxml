Nearly 440 thousand people are infected with MDR-TB worldwide every year. As a high burden country, about 100 thousand MDR-TB cases appear in China annually [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Treatment of MDR-TB requires the use of toxic, expensive, and less effective second-line drugs for 2 years or more, leading to low patient compliance and poor treatment outcomes with high mortality. The recent situation demonstrates the urgent need to search for novel strategies to treat MDR-TB. Adjunctive immunotherapy, together with chemotherapy, has the potential to improve treatment outcomes of drug-resistant tuberculosis [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Protective immunity against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) is based on cell-mediated immunity involving CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), mainly secreted by activated T cells, is central to the development of an adaptive immune response to infection, promoting differentiation and proliferation of lymphoid cells. The systemic immune response in peripheral blood is characterized by enhanced Th2 function and decreased Th1 function in TB pathogenesis [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These disturbances were remarkable in MDR-TB [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recovery from TB depends, in part, on the generation of an effective cell-mediated immune response against the pathogen. Therefore, IL-2 injection has been deemed to be a natural adjunctive therapy for TB. Several studies have shown recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) to be safe and well tolerated [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the only large-scale randomized trial evidenced that intradermal therapy with rhIL-2 did not produce an improvement in clinical symptoms and sputum bacillary clearance [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There has been a lack of more recent such clinical studies. Changes of T cell subsets in response to treatment were especially scarce in MDR-TB patients.</p><p>To further elucidate this issue, we conducted a randomized trial to examine the effects of rhIL-2 plus standard chemotherapy by following up the whole duration of therapy in MDR-TB patients. We also evaluated the frequencies of T cell subsets and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells at several time points in the peripheral blood of patients throughout the course of rhIL-2 administration, and aimed to explore the correlation between alterations in immune cells and treatment outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 50 MDR-TB patients aged 18 to 70 years were recruited from six multicenter organizations: the Third Hospital of Zhenjiang City, the Fourth People's Hospital of Lianyungang, Taizhou People's Hospital, Nanjing Chest Hospital, the Sixth People's Hospital of Nantong, and Taixing Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Patients were identified according to guidelines for pulmonary TB diagnosis and therapy published by the Tuberculosis Branch Association of the Chinese Medical Association. All patients were HIV seronegative and had pulmonary MDR-TB, defined as culture-confirmed Mtb resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin.

Radiographic changes were evaluated by comparing baseline and follow-up chest X-rays after the end of the third, sixth, twelfth, eighteenth, and twenty-fourth months of anti-TB treatment. Changes were rated to the following four grades: marked absorption (meaning significant improvement of more than half of initial abnormalities), absorption (meaning definite improvement better than initial abnormalities but less than a half), no changes (no certain difference in films compared with original lesion), and deterioration (being worse than initial abnormalities or spreading to another area). Simultaneously, the cavity closure was observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunologic measurement of peripheral blood</title><p>Five milliliters of venous blood were obtained from patients on an empty stomach in the morning prior to study and after the first, third, and seventh months of treatment. Whole blood was collected in plastic tubes containing anticoagulant.

Ten &#x003bc;l of IgG-FITC/IgG-PE/IgG-Percy5 was placed into one tube as an isotype control. After incubating for 10 min, erythrocytes were removed using 1 ml of diluted lysing solution. Subsequently, the cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS, centrifuging at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and supernatant was removed. Then, the cells were resuspended in 500 &#x003bc;l of PBS, and run on the BD FACSCalibur (BD, USA). The samples were counted at 50,000 events, setting the lymphocyte gate using the CellQuest program. Finally, the percentage value of all the markers was calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>During anti-TB treatment, the adverse events were counted.

Indeed, we found that adjunctive immunotherapy with rhIL-2 enhanced sputum conversion negative rates, and improved the chest radiograph. Although rhIL-2 administration only lasted for 7 months, the successful effects from rhIL-2 were maintained during the whole duration of antituberculosis treatment, suggesting that the immune regulatory effects were sustained long term. Intradermal therapy with rhIL-2 was generally safe and well tolerated.</p><p>Our results are consistent with the serial studies of Johnson <italic>et al</italic>. In 1995, they firstly reported the beneficial results of rhIL-2 for TB of 20 patients with drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB), or MDR-TB with optimal multidrug chemotherapy [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Subsequently, in 1997, a clinical trial in 35 patients with MDR-TB comparing daily or pulsed IL-2 therapy with placebo identified improved sputum clearance with daily treatment, and it was also noted that there were strikingly different results with variation in the rhIL-2 treatment schedule [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the earlier studies followed up only short term, and not the full course of treatment. Furthermore, there are three different changes in our long period of rhIL-2 treatment protocol: 1) single dose: 500 000 IU per time in our study, 225 000 IU used by Johnson; 2) dosing schedule: once every other day scheme, compared to twice daily rhIL-2 treatment regimen; 3) duration: a total of four courses applied at the first, third, fifth and seventh month of treatment vs. the first month of anti-TB treatment. The reason for novel treatment modalities in our study could be described as follows. The MDR-TB patients included in our study mostly belonged to the form of relapse, having experienced over three times multidrug therapy due to chronic and severe infection. Because of the gravity and refractory profile, we made the treatment program of rhIL-2 prolonged to cover the enhancement period of MDR-TB therapy. Our results extended previously published reports, and further supported findings that a long period of rhIL-2 had favorable effects on MDR-TB patients [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>These improvements were undoubtedly associated with rhIL-2-induced changes of immune status. Interleukin-2 signals influence the differentiation of effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, promoting the generation of Th1, Th2, and regulatory T (Treg) cells [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recent insight into the crucial role of IL-2 is not only for protective immunity but also necessary for the development and homeostasis of Treg cells [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Experimental studies found that IL-2 was needed to efficiently activate Treg cells, and also demonstrated that Treg cells, which did not produce IL-2, competed for IL-2 secreted by responder T cells [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These findings indicated that IL-2 designed to enhance the immune response could induce suppressive activity, which might explain the detrimental effects of rhIL-2 reported by Johnson [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To understand when and how IL-2 plays its distinct function is crucial for the development of safe and efficient therapeutic approaches for protective immunity. A recent review indicated that the dichotomous role of IL-2 depended on different doses of IL-2 [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Interleukin-2 at low doses may be used to expand Treg cell numbers in conditions of autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], while high-dose IL-2 administration can abolish Treg suppression of responder T cells, having a therapeutic role in some kinds of cancer [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Profound immune suppression was shown in MDR-TB [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], whereas different studies presented various performances. Our findings disagreed with the results of Chu <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], who found that there were higher levels of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> ratio in the rhIL-2 group after treatment, but agreed with the study by Johnson <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], who found no significant changes in the size of leukocyte subpopulations during the study in any patient group. Moreover, in our study, while not statistically significant, the value of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> ratio declined with rhIL-2 administered. The mechanism involved might be related to the successful control of inflammation and down-regulation of the immune response after rhIL-2 therapy. Alternatively, there is increasing evidence for the importance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cytotoxic cells, which play a major role in the late phases of TB disease [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It was further proposed that efficient immunotherapy might seek to increase CD8<sup>+</sup> activity [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, it could be speculated that the underlying clinical response to rhIL-2 was not only simply associated with boosting Th1 protective immunity, but might be linked to an additional mechanism.</p><p>Here, we tested the overall frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells. This subpopulation contains Treg and effector T cells, as CD25<sup>+</sup> is also a marker of activation of T cells [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is becoming evident that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells are expanded in DS-TB and MDR-TB patients [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and may contribute to inhibit effector functions of Th1 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We observed that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells were negatively correlated with CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> T and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which indicated that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells in the present study might include many Treg cells, though we did not measure FOXP3 expression. Interestingly, we found an increase in the proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells after standard chemotherapy. One possible explanation was that the immune reaction to mycobacterial antigens was very strong due to the TB bacillary persistence. Similar observations were made in extra-pulmonary TB patients [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Another possible explanation might be the low level of IL-2. As evidenced in our previous study [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], MDR-TB patients produced lower levels of IL-2 in their serum compared to DS-TB and healthy controls. Such a low level of IL-2 has been proved to drive expansion of Treg cells, which by competition for IL-2 resulted in further inhibition of responder T cells [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In patients with active TB, frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells were increased, being maintained even at completion of chemotherapy [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We did not identify CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T cells; it would be of great interest to measure this subpopulation using CD4, high expression of CD25 and low expression of CD127 antigen in our next investigation [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Collectively, the increase of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells may represent an increase of both activated T cells and Treg cells, which are associated with high level inflammatory status, plausibly correlating with the fact that the clinical outcomes were suboptimal in the multidrug arm.</p><p>In contrast to previous reports [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the important finding was that rhIL-2 induced only slight but no significant increase of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells. The reasons underlying the differing results between our studies and earlier studies might be related to the rhIL-2 treatment regimen. As we have mentioned, in the current study, the single dosage of each injection was higher, and the duration of 4 months of rhIL-2 application was a long period, which might represent high-dose administration. In the presence of high-dose IL-2, the function of effector T cells was enhanced, and the expansion of Treg cells was abrogated [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It was probably that the numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells were limited, caused by the IL-2 regimen used in the present study, which contributed to the lack of significant change of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells in the rhIL-2 group. A recent review concluded that pathogen clearance is achieved through a careful balance between effector and suppressor response [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The success of rhIL-2 therapies might in part originate from such a balance, thereby increasing clearance of TB.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that adjunctive immunotherapy with rhIL-2 showed protective efficacy in MDR-TB patients. Using rhIL-2 for a long period did not induce significant expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells. By contrast, persistence of increased frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells might be related to infection progression in MDR-TB patients receiving only multidrug chemotherapy. However, TB immunology is considerably complex, and further clinical and laboratory studies are warranted to explore the interaction between IL-2 and T cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by a grant from the Important National Science and Technology Specific Projects of China (Approval No. 2008zx100 03-014).</p></ack><sec id="S0018"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="confproc"><collab>World Health Organization</collab><article-title>Multidrug and extensively drug-resistant TB (M/XDR-TB): 2010 global report on surveillance and response</article-title><year>2010</year><publisher-loc>Geneva, Switzerland</publisher-loc><publisher-name>WHO</publisher-name><comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2010/mdrtb2010report_executive_summary.pdf">http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2010/mdrtb2010report_executive_summary.pdf</ext-link>.
