Physiotherapy is often provided by the NHS to address dysfunction following knee replacement; however the efficacy of this is unknown.

The intervention will be either &#x02018;intensive&#x02019; involving both hospital and home-based functional exercise rehabilitation, or &#x02018;standard of care&#x02019; consisting of home exercises. Patients will be randomised to either group using a web-based system. Both groups will receive pre and post-intervention physiotherapy review. Patients will be followed-up to one year post-operation.

Total knee replacement (TKR) is an increasingly common procedure with over 75,000 knee replacements performed each year in the UK alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Projections of future surgical volume suggest further great increases year on year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. TKR is highly effective at reducing pain and improving physical function in patients with end stage osteoarthritis. Around 20% of patients however report dissatisfaction with their post-operative outcome, twice the rate following total hip replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Physiotherapy is a commonly employed intervention to address dysfunction following TKR; though the efficacy of this is unknown. A previous study suggested that post-operative physiotherapy was not effective at improving the patients&#x02019; one year outcome, when applied uniformly to all patients after knee replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Clinically, patients performing poorly post-operatively are often referred for physiotherapy review; however no study has specifically assessed patients that perform poorly post-operatively. Demonstration of the effectiveness of post-operative physiotherapy management in this &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; group would provide support for specific policy to address this substantial population.</p><p>A recent Cochrane review examined multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes following hip and knee joint replacement and concluded that home-based care may be beneficial; but stressed the low quality of the current evidence-base and surmised that further high quality research is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Unspecified post-operative physiotherapy applied to a whole cohort of patients who had undergone knee replacement did not find a significant improvement over the control group one year following surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However as the majority of patients had a good result, it was not possible to determine if targeted intensive physiotherapy would have helped the patients destined to have a poor outcome.</p><p>A previous UK economic analysis of a different physiotherapy treatment than is proposed in this trial showed no significant effects, when such physiotherapy is applied universally to all total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The analyses therefore reverted to cost-minimisation analysis, in which assessment is made on the basis of least costs alone. It is entirely possible that subgroups of patients may be cost-effective to treat when the total population is not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Mitchell <italic>et al</italic>. (2005) found the cost of physiotherapy to be small at only &#x000a3;136.50 per patient (95% CI &#x000a3;113 to &#x000a3;160), as such, only a comparatively small change in patient quality of life is required for the treatment to fall comfortably below the threshold of &#x000a3;30,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) implied by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] as being cost-effective.</p><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of TRIO is to evaluate if early targeting of post-operative physiotherapy to patients that initially perform poorly following TKA can improve patient outcome at one year following surgery.</p><p>Secondary objectives include assessment of patient function, patient satisfaction and the cost effectiveness of delivering enhanced targeted physiotherapy.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing the effect of intensive physiotherapy with current standard of care therapy, targeted at patients considered to be performing poorly at six weeks following TKR.</p><p>This study makes use of the national patient Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS) programme, whereby all providers of elective knee replacement are required to collect pre-operative data using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and EuroQol 5-Dimension score (EQ-5D). All the centres involved in this project collect routine baseline data using these metrics. This allows us to recruit only those poorly performing patients at the initial <italic>post-surgical</italic> clinical review (six weeks post-operation), and not the entire TKR population. These pre-operation data will be accessed retrospectively for recruited patients at the individual centres.</p><p>All patients will be made aware of the study pre-operatively at the recruiting centres. Prior to surgery, they will complete the routine pre-operative outcome assessment questionnaires (OKS and EQ-5D) as part of the national PROMS program and then undergo the local standard TKR and immediate post-operative care pathway. All patients will be routinely reviewed six weeks post-operatively by the usual clinical teams. At this review the OKS will again be assessed. Those patients who report a score of 26 or less (on the 0 to 48 OKS scoring system), which is defined as poor by the modified Kalairajah classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], will be approached to consent. If consent is given and they are eligible to enter the trial, they will be randomised to either standard care (defined in this study as: initial physiotherapy review, six weeks of home exercise prescription and final review) or an interventional arm, where 18 sessions of structured physiotherapy will be administered over a six week period. Six of these 18 sessions will be &#x02018;contact sessions&#x02019; performed under the supervision of the physiotherapist.</p><p>Focus groups run by the Arthritis Research UK Osteoarthritis Clinical Study Group in the preparation phase of this trial identified that the standard care provision of physiotherapy post-arthroplasty varies across the UK and even within local healthcare authorities. We therefore standardised the control arm to be an unsupervised home exercise intervention with initial and final physiotherapist review, which the focus group agreed represented a frequent provision across the UK. This approach allows us to comment on the efficacy of &#x02018;contact&#x02019; interventional physiotherapy in addition to simple review and exercise provision and to assess the cost-effectiveness of differing ways of providing post-operative physiotherapy to this targeted patient group.</p><p>All trial participants will be reviewed immediately post physiotherapy intervention (that is, at 14 weeks post-operation) and then by postal questionnaire at six months and one year post-operation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All post-operative data collection time points are determined by the date of surgery (not the date of trial randomisation). Use of the national PROMS program outcome assessment tools, in addition to their direct applicability, will allow direct comparison of outcome in our interventional group with the wider TKA population.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial flowchart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-15-44-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>The OKS was selected as the primary outcome assessment as it has been developed specifically to measure the outcomes of knee replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The OKS is a patient reported outcome measure that was designed to measure the impact of pain and functional disability on an individual&#x02019;s life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As such, it is an extensively validated and widely adopted outcome measure in patients undergoing knee replacement surgery and is sensitive to detect changes over time. The OKS is also the most appropriate tool as it is the chosen PROM for this population in the National Joint Registry.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>Global knee pain severity will be assessed using an 11 point (0 to 10) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), where 0 represents no pain and 10 the worst possible pain. The validity and sensitivity of the VAS has been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It has been suggested that using multiple measurements of pain status as opposed to a single value of &#x02018;current pain&#x02019; may provide more realistic and meaningful measurements of pain intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Separate assessments are made of &#x02018;worst pain&#x02019; and &#x02018;perceived mean daily pain&#x02019; as has been specifically recommended for use in osteoarthritis (OA) clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The Timed-get-up-and-go test (TUG) is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility, requiring both static and dynamic balance. It is the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. TUG performance has been found to decrease significantly with mobility impairments, while residential status and physical mobility status have been determined to be significant predictors of TUG performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The TUG has excellent inter-rater and intra-rater reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The test score also correlates well with gait speed and scores on balance assessments.</p><p>Patient satisfaction will be assessed with a specific patient satisfaction question. The overall satisfaction response is thought to be primarily influenced by patient pain, function and meeting of pre-operative expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], thus a further four additional specific sub-questions relating to these facets of satisfaction will also be asked to explore the effect of the trial intervention.</p><p>Health economic analysis will compare the cost-effectiveness over one year of providing additional physiotherapy, as described above, against standard care for those patients defined as performing poorly by their Oxford Knee Score after six weeks. A cost-utility analysis (calculation of incremental costs per quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained) will be performed from the NHS perspective in line with the preferred method by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The EQ-5D questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and bespoke health economic questionnaire will be used to collect these data. Resource use estimates from the study will be combined with unit costs taken from standard costing sources to produce an estimate of the cost to the NHS of providing the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Four hundred and forty patients identified at six week post-operative clinical review and defined as performing poorly will be recruited to the study.

In the case of adverse events, participants will be advised to seek medical advice through their general practitioner. Specific adverse events such as treatment withdrawals and missed treatments due to pain will be collected through the study case report form. Patient reported outcomes will measure knee pain using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and global health state via the EQ-5D.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size for TRIO is 400 patients (200 per arm). This was determined from previous research. The power calculation (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) is based on the accepted change in the OKS that is considered clinically significant and of interest when comparing interventions (3 points) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Typical one year change scores for the OKS are 16 points with a reported standard deviation of 9.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Power calculation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Difference</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Size</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Power</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">3<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">150<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">80%<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">200</td><td align="left">90%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 (two-sided), assumed SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.2.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>A large prospective cohort is required to achieve the desired numbers of poorly functioning knees; therefore the study will recruit from multiple major centres. Based on reported poor outcome rates of approximately 20%, and allowing for a potential of up to 20% of eligible patients being unwilling to be randomised, we aim to screen 2,750 patients prospectively at the six-week post-surgical review to identify 550 eligible, poorly functioning patients and to achieve recruitment (randomisation) of 440. Allowing for a further 10% loss to follow-up in the RCT will yield the 400 patients we require.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The difference in mean OKS between the groups at one year will be estimated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to adjust for baseline OKS at randomisation (that is, at six weeks). The results will be presented as an adjusted mean difference with its corresponding 95% confidence interval. The principal analysis will be on an intention to treat basis where participants will be analysed according to the allocated group using all available data. Additional summary statistics will also be presented for change in OKS from pre-operative values.</p><p>Health economic analysis will compare the cost-effectiveness (over one year) of providing targeted additional physiotherapy to those patients defined as performing poorly after six weeks against standard care. A cost-utility analysis (calculation of incremental costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained) will be performed from the NHS perspective in line with the preferred method by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Resource use estimates from the study will be combined with unit costs taken from standard costing sources to produce an estimate of the cost to the NHS of providing the treatment. Health benefits in terms of QALYs will be derived from the standard UK tariff for the EQ-5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Estimates of NHS cost and QALYs will then be combined to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. This ratio will be presented using probabilistic sensitivity analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] with deterministic analysis used on key modelling assumptions.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>TRIO has received ethical approval from the National Research Ethics Service, South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee 01 in April 2013 (REC reference: 13/SS/0051).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment to TRIO commenced in September 2013 and is on-going at the time of manuscript submission.
