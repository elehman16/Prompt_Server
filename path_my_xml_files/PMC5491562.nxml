Both the development and progression of type 2 diabetes are marked by declining beta cell mass and function. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study investigators estimated that 50% of beta cell function may already be lost by the time of diagnosis, and subsequent glycaemic deterioration has been found to be associated with continued loss of beta cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Addressing beta cell function is critical to the durability of diabetes treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) appear to have several beneficial effects on beta cell function, offering individuals with type 2 diabetes the potential for enduring glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. GLP-1 has been shown to prevent glucolipotoxicity in beta cells, thereby helping to protect and improve their overall function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">GLP-1RAs help to restore beta cell sensitivity to elevated blood glucose and improve beta cell function across a number of indices in people with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These effects have been illustrated in a sequence of studies with the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide vs placebo. Liraglutide treatment resulted in increased first- and second-phase insulin secretion, increased maximal insulin secretion after arginine infusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], increased HOMA of beta cell function (HOMA-B), a higher level of C-peptide, and a reduced proinsulin-to-insulin ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In another study, liraglutide restored beta cell responsiveness to glucose during a stepwise glucose clamp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which is in line with trials showing glucose-dependent insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], decreased glucagon secretion from pancreatic islets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and delayed gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Semaglutide (Novo Nordisk, Bagsv&#x000e6;rd, Denmark) is a GLP-1 analogue in development for the once-weekly treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has 94% structural homology to native human GLP-1, and is based on the same acetylation technology as liraglutide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Important structural modifications make semaglutide more resistant to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and improve binding to albumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

The trial included four tests that together provide a comprehensive picture of changes in beta cell function during treatment with semaglutide. The primary objective was to evaluate the effects of semaglutide on first- and second-phase insulin secretion. Secondary objectives were to investigate the effects of semaglutide on fasting and postprandial glucose, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon concentrations, and on maximal insulin secretory capacity. The beta cell responsiveness to graded glucose infusion was assessed in participants with type 2 diabetes treated with semaglutide or placebo and in a group of healthy untreated participants. Additionally, the study assessed the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of semaglutide.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par25">This was a single-centre, randomised, multiple-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in participants with type 2 diabetes.

It was demonstrated by IVGTT that semaglutide treatment increased first- and second-phase insulin secretion threefold and twofold, respectively, compared with placebo. Correspondingly, levels of glucagon and glucose were decreased with semaglutide vs placebo. Similar findings have been reported for once-daily liraglutide, which significantly increased both first- and second-phase insulin secretion after 14&#x000a0;weeks of treatment in participants with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">Results from the AST under hyperglycaemic conditions showed that maximal insulin capacity had improved following semaglutide treatment. Despite insulin levels prior to the test being higher in semaglutide-treated participants than in participants receiving placebo, insulin levels increased immediately in response to the stimulus and remained high for the duration of the test. This effect could contribute to the reported efficacy of semaglutide in improving glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], particularly as recent research suggests that individuals with sustained endogenous insulin-secreting capacity may benefit more from GLP-1RA therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">In the 24&#x000a0;h meal test, encompassing three standardised meals, semaglutide reduced glucose and glucagon, and increased C-peptide levels (a marker of endogenous insulin production) in comparison with placebo. Reductions in glucose and glucagon levels with semaglutide were observed in the fasting as well as in the postprandial state, both in terms of the absolute levels and the incremental response. As shown with other GLP-1RAs, a higher insulin level was observed in the fasting state after semaglutide treatment despite lower fasting glucose levels, possibly due to the well-known incretin effect of the GLP-1 class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Notwithstanding this higher initial insulin level, similar postprandial insulin profiles were observed with semaglutide treatment and placebo. The similar insulin profiles were probably related to the lower incremental increase in glucose. A potential additional factor explaining this observation may be the loss of body weight during the course of the trial, possibly impacting insulin resistance. These findings are consistent with previous observations on the relative contributions of insulin stimulation and glucagon inhibition in overall glucose turnover mediated by exogenous GLP-1 and other GLP-1RAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Mean 2&#x000a0;h postprandial glucose was lower than the 2&#x000a0;h postprandial goal (&#x0003c;10&#x000a0;mmol/l) as recommended by the ADA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and more than 80% of the semaglutide-treated participants achieved the ADA target.</p><p id="Par69">Beta cell responsiveness was markedly increased after treatment with semaglutide compared with placebo, and at the end of treatment closely resembled that of healthy participants, as measured by the GGIT. It is important to note, however, that BMI was higher in participants with type 2 diabetes than in healthy participants; differences in fat mass could potentially influence insulin sensitivity and this should be kept in mind when interpreting these results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition, mean age was also higher in participants with type 2 diabetes than in healthy participants; the negative impact of ageing on beta cell responsiveness, triacylglycerol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and glucose homeostasis should also be considered in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The possible role of managing beta cell function in type 2 diabetes, as a means to delay disease progression, has been a subject of discussion among researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. GLP-1RAs have attenuated beta cell dysfunction to varying degrees both in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and in humans with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par70">Semaglutide treatment was associated with marked weight loss, even during this relatively short trial. These weight loss effects have persisted in trials of longer durations with semaglutide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and other GLP-1RAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The high proportion of individuals with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese makes the combination of glycaemic control and body weight loss highly relevant to clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par71">No new safety or tolerability issues were observed for semaglutide. Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity and there were no serious TEAEs that were considered likely to be related to treatment. Longer and larger scale clinical trials will provide more information on the safety profile of semaglutide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As reported with other GLP-1RAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], gastrointestinal disorders were the most commonly reported AEs with semaglutide treatment.

The SUSTAIN clinical trial programme, comprising six global phase 3 trials, will determine how the improvements in beta cell function with semaglutide translate into clinical benefits, compared with current treatment options.</p><p id="Par73">In conclusion, the results of the current study are consistent with previous findings during treatment with the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and suggest that treatment with semaglutide may offer a protective effect on beta cell function. In addition, the results show that semaglutide is a promising once-weekly GLP-1 analogue for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, associated with improved beta cell responsiveness comparable with that observed in healthy individuals. All aspects of beta cell function, including first- and second-phase insulin responses, were significantly increased in participants with type 2 diabetes treated with semaglutide vs placebo after 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. In addition, semaglutide reduced fasting and postprandial glucose and glucagon levels, compared with placebo, in a 24&#x000a0;h meal test. Improved glycaemic responses appeared to be a combined effect on the pancreas of increased insulin secretion and decreased glucagon response.
