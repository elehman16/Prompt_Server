Rasht is the biggest city located in northern Iran with more than one million people. This city has a humid subtropical climate with relatively high temperatures in summer and rainfall coming from convectional thunderstorm activity and tropical cyclones in winter. The required sample size was determined as 269 based on results of Harrison&#x02019;s Principles of Internal Medicine, Lanky et al.&#x02019;s study and the National Census of America.<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In this study, each patient was his/her own control during the 24&#x000a0;h before the onset of symptoms and was compared with that at the time of a few days, few weeks, and few months before the onset of AMI. The first 24&#x000a0;h was considered as the hazard period. In addition to hazard period, another time interval, known as a control period, was considered to study the trigger effect. In this study, three control periods were used to study on triggers&#x02019; effect with regard to their nature. This period was determined as one day, two days, and five days before AMI onset for triggers such as anger, quarrel, hearing sudden news, insomnia, watching sport games, sudden exposure to hot or cold weather, exposure to traffic jam, witnessing a car accident, doing heavy and sexual activities, eating high-fat foods and overeating, alcohol and drug abuse, and coffee or tea drinking, while this period was established as one week, two weeks, and more than four weeks before AMI onset for triggers such as respiratory infections and losing a job due to the chronic nature of the trigger. The control period was determined as one month, one to six months, and six to 12&#x000a0;months before AMI onset for loss of loved one trigger. According to previous studies that showed loss of loved ones living with a long-term effect on the incidence of myocardial infarction,<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> for this trigger the longest period of control time was considered. Cochran method was used to consider significant differences between triggers in the four time periods including one hazard period and three control periods. GEE method with logistic function default was applied in order to determine exposure to triggers and study incidence relative odds of AMI. Triggers were measured based on patient's exposure or non-exposure to a trigger. The unit for hazard period was an hour, and that for the control period was the day, week or month.</p><p id="p0030">Patients were selected through convenience sampling, and they were enrolled based on medical records contents including changes in the electrocardiogram, laboratory findings, clinical symptoms, and AMI diagnosis by a cardiologist. The patient with STEMI and NSTEMI included in this study and unstable angina pectoris (UAP) were removed. Sampling was conducted over a period of 5&#x000a0;months, from September to February 2015. Inclusion criteria included patients&#x02019; willing to participate in the interviews (having written informed consent), having appropriate consciousness, age over 18&#x000a0;years, and lack of memory disorder or psychosis. Data were collected using researcher-made questionnaire through the interview. Before data collection, a written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The questionnaire contained two parts: 1. demographic data and 2. triggers in four sections, and included 30 items, totally. The first part of the questionnaire contained 13 questions on demographic data such as gender, age, marital status, education, income, history of diabetes, hypertension, body mass index (BMI) based on the data recorded by the nurse on time of admission, cigarette smoking, alcohol and drugs abuse, drinking coffee or tea over three cups a day, and previous history of MI. The second part comprised of 17 questions to identify the acute triggers (emotional, environmental, physical, and chemical). This part was, in turn, divided into four sections. The first section contained the questions on identifying the emotional triggers including anger, insomnia, quarrel, hearing the sudden news, losing a job, the death of a loved one, excitement resulted from watching sports games and competitions and dramatic serials, and that exposure to these triggers was studied through calculating time interval. The second section composed of the questions on environmental triggers including long-term driving, exposure to traffic jam, witnessing a traffic accident or being involved in a driving accident, catching respiratory infections and exposure to hot or cold weather. The third section consisted of physical triggers including heavy and sexual activities, and the fourth section of the questionnaire included chemical triggers such as overeating, alcohol, and drugs abuse, and taking coffee or tea measures with a drunk cup of coffee or tea a day. The hazard and control period were evaluated for each trigger.</p><p id="p0035">The questionnaire was given to 10 university faculty members to determine validity, and content validity index was obtained as 98.6%. Test-retest method was used for reliability. Since the answers to the questions were qualitative, kappa coefficient was used, and the consensus coefficient degree was determined as 1 indicating the patients&#x02019; agreement in measurement. In this study, five patients were reluctant to participate, and one patient was excluded due to misdiagnosis. The collected data were then encoded and were analyzed using SPSS version 21. Demographic data were reviewed using descriptive statistics methods (frequency, mean, and standard deviation). Cochran test was used to examine triggers&#x02019; significance in four time periods including one hazard period and three control periods, while GEE with logistics function default was applied to categorize triggers.

The results of this study showed that emotional triggers: quarrel and hearing sudden news were associated with significantly twofold increased odds of AMI. In a study conducted by Masoumi, it was shown that hearing bad news caused a 6.9-fold rise in odds of AMI; hence, the current study is consistent with Masoumi one. Also, a quarrel in the study was related to twofold increased odds of AMI. Furthermore, Colombo stated that quarrel at work or home can increase the odds of AMI.<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Here, acute psychological stress mechanism is a common factor. Despite a higher frequency of occurrence of anger and insomnia, they were not the predictive factors for AMI. Mostofsky and Penner reported that anger trigger was associated with 2.3-fold increased odds of AMI.<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Bulkey indicated that anger trigger was related to 8.5-fold increased relative risk rate of AMI.<xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The results of this study contradict those of Mostofsky and Bulkey in the case of anger trigger. It seems that due to the lack of categories in the study and different interpretations of anger in various cultures, the contradiction emerges. Anger in Bulkey&#x02019;s study was divided into seven degrees, and anger with more than five degrees increased odds of AMI, while the only measure was the presence of anger trigger in this study. In a study performed by Clark, insomnia was associated with 1.69-fold increased odds of AMI,<xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> which is incompatible with that in our study. The discrepancy could be due to differences in individual interpretation of insomnia. Also, the patient may not have enough accuracy to report insomnia period. In the case of loss of loved one, relative odds of AMI was low and had a conflict with Mostofsky<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and Carey studies.<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> The discrepancy could be due to very limited exposure to the above-mentioned trigger and short-term hazard period in this study. In Carey and Mostofsky studies, the hazard period was considered as by one month, while this period was 24&#x000a0;h before the onset of AMI. In the case of losing a job and watching sports games, the results cannot be generalized due to very limited exposure.</p><p id="p0065">Of environmental triggers, respiratory infections and exposure to hot and cold weather increased odds of AMI. The study found that respiratory infections were associated with 6.78-fold raised odds of AMI. Warren-Gash et al. reported that 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days following respiratory infections onset caused 4.19-fold increased odd of AMI.<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Corrales et al. showed that pneumonia was associated with fourfold raised odds of AMI.<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Also, Colombo et al. noted that respiratory infections were related to 2.7-fold increased odds of AMI.<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> In the conducted study, exposure to hot and cold weather was among the most important environmental trigger of developing AMI that was associated with 2.19-fold heightened odds of AMI. In a study done by Masoumi, it was expressed that exposure to cold weather was not AMI predictor<xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>; it seems that difference in results is because of dissimilar weather conditions in Kerman and Guilan. Behaskaran in a study showed that temperatures above 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C can be associated with twofold increased odds of AMI.<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> In this study, the daily temperature was not recorded, and results of summer, autumn, and winter were studied; therefore, they cannot be generalized. Of physical triggers, both physical and sexual activities were AMI triggers and increased its odds. Sexual and heavy activities were related to 2.36- and 1.66-fold raised odds of MI, respectively. Masoumi et al. reported that sexual activities were associated with 3.4-fold heightened odds of AMI.<xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Also, Colombo showed that physical activities were related to 4.3-fold increased odds of MI.<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p id="p0070">The most common chemical triggers for AMI were eating high-fat foods and overeating. In this study, overeating was associated with 3.7-fold increased odds of MI. Mitelman and Colombo introduced overeating as MI trigger, and Colombo indicated that overeating was related to sevenfold raised odds of MI.<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> There was no significant difference between tea, alcohol, and opium consumption among participants. Thus, these factors could not be AMI predictors. Mitelman and Mostofsky stated that alcohol abuse was associated with 2.3-fold heightened odds of ischemic stroke, but it has no effect on the incidence of MI, and this result is consistent with that of our study.<xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Moreover, Mitelman and Mostofsky showed that cocaine and marijuana abuse was related to 23.7- and 4.8-fold increased odds of MI, respectively.<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> There is a contradiction between the results of this study and those of Mostofsky one in terms of drug abuse and AMI trigger. This inconsistency derives from a common drug that is opium in our society, while Mostofsky worked on cocaine and marijuana having a different mechanism. Despite tea high consumption, no relationship between tea drinking and the incidence of AMI was observed. Likewise, no similar study showed a relationship between tea consumption and AMI incidence. Bylin et al. found that coffee drinking is an AMI trigger.<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> The results of our study were different from Bylin ones, which may be due to the difference in the type of beverage and the dissimilarity in the caffeine level in tea and coffee. Also, Nikpazhoh noted that there is no clear relationship between taking caffeine and heart diseases, and it appears that moderate consumption of coffee is not harmful to the heart. For some people having a particular sensitivity to caffeine, a physician may recommend that they avoid drinking coffee.<xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0075">This study showed that quarrel and hearing sudden news are among the most important triggers of AMI. It is essential that people at risk avoid exposure to stressful situations, and relaxation techniques to be taught to them. The study found that in addition to doing heavy activities, inactivity is an AMI trigger. Therefore, adjustments in daily activities and doing regular exercise are recommended to society&#x02019;s people. Furthermore, to avoid overeating, to treat respiratory infections at the proper time, and to reduce exposure to sudden hot or cold weather are recommended to prevent triggers&#x02019;
