The incidence of ESBL-E has increased in both community and hospital settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The European Antimicrobial Surveillance Network has reported major increases of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> proportions in health care institutions, ranging from 1.7% in 2002 to 8% in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Similar trends have been noted with ESBL-E infections by the French National Surveillance Network for Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria (BMR-RAISIN). The overall incidence rate increased between 2002 and 2012 from 0.13 to 0.53 per 1,000 patient-days, and in intensive care units (ICUs) the incidence rate during the same period increased from 0.79 to 2.36 per 1,000 patient-days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], a rate three- to fivefold higher in ICUs than in non-ICU surgical or medical departments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Control of ESBL-E spread is therefore urgently required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Many infection control measures, such as contact isolation of patients with colonization or infection, antimicrobial stewardship programmes, active screening culture (ASC) and selective digestive decontamination (SDD), have been proposed to control bacterial transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. According to a report of a French study of three ICUs, an ESBL-E outbreak was controlled by the association of ASC for all patients at admission with contact isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Without evidence supporting specific infection control strategies, no definite guidelines can be implemented in nonoutbreak settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Only general recommendations on the control of Gram-negative organisms are currently available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A 2011 literature review revealed a dearth of research on the control of ESBL-E transmission in hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The lack of evidence-based guidelines, with disparities in infection control practices, may be factors behind the increase in ESBL-E incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The importance of ASC is unclear in the absence of outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. &#x02018;Universal screening&#x02019; is costly and may not be needed when patient-to-patient transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and prevalence of carriage at patient admission are low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. An option is &#x02018;targeted surveillance&#x02019; of patients with severe underlying disease or risk factors for ESBL-E carriage at admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Recent studies have implicated several risk factors for ESBL-E colonization at admission: prior ESBL-E carriage, transfer from hospitalization units and especially long-term care facilities or ICUs, coming from a high-prevalence country, poor functional status, current antibiotic use and chronic renal insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>In our institution, universal screening is performed at ICU admission. In 2010, targeted screening at ICU admission for patients transferred from another unit or hospital was implemented in one of the ICUs because of high costs and resource constraints. We hypothesized that this targeted screening at admission does not increase 3GC-RE-related hospital-acquired infection (HAI) incidence rates in ICUs compared with universal screening and might therefore represent an interesting strategy. The total number of rectal swabs should decrease with targeted screening. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of targeted screening at ICU admission on 3GC-RE-related HAI incidence in a quasi-experimental setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting, subjects and design</title><p>We performed a 3-year quasi-experimental study with intervention and control groups to evaluate targeted screening for 3GC-RE at ICU admission. Data were collected prospectively between January 2008 and December 2011 at Edouard Herriot Hospital, an 850-bed university-affiliated hospital in Lyon, France. Two ICUs located in separate buildings were included in the study: Unit A, the intervention group, comprised a polyvalent medical ICU with 15 single rooms; and unit B, the control group, comprised a polyvalent medical-surgical ICU with 12 single rooms. These two ICUs had a similar staff&#x02013;patient allocation. Data from two different time periods were collected. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> outlines the study design. Period 1 (pre-test period) included patients admitted between 1 January 2008 and 30 September 2010. During this time period, both units A and B undertook universal screening for 3GC-RE at patient admission. The intervention was the implementation of targeted screening for 3GC-RE at patient admission in the last quarter of 2010 in unit A. After the intervention, the posttest period (period 2) included patients admitted between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011. Targeted screening for 3GC-RE at patient admission was implemented in unit A. During this period, unit B maintained universal screening for 3GC-RE at patient admission. The last quarter of 2010 was a wash-out period for targeted screening in unit A. The incidence rates of overall HAIs and 3GC-RE-related HAIs and the total number of rectal swabs between the two time periods were compared to assess the effectiveness of targeted screening.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

All patients hospitalized for &#x02265;48&#x000a0;hours in either unit A or B during the study period (except for the washout period at the end of 2010) were included in the national surveillance network and participated in the study. Data were collected prospectively by the hospital infection control team (nurses and physicians), and feedback was provided annually to ICU physicians and nurses. Furthermore, a team member was regularly present in both units to remind ICU staff of prevention practices. Infection control strategies were similar in both units during the surveillance periods, and written protocols were available. Universal precautions (including regular hand hygiene with alcohol-based solution and wearing gloves and gown during activities likely to generate contact with body fluids) were applied throughout the study. Barrier precautions (that is, rigorous handwashing, strict use of gowns and gloves) were enforced for all 3GC-RE-positive patients, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Counselling by the expert infection control team was similar during the surveillance period.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of targeted screening compared with universal screening at admission on incidence rates of 3GC-RE-related HAIs in ICUs.</p><p>The main finding of this study is the absence of an increase of the incidence density of 3GC-RE-related HAIs (per 1,000 patient-days) during period 2 (&#x02018;targeted screening&#x02019;) compared with period 1 (&#x02018;universal screening&#x02019;) in unit A, even in multivariate models. A strength of the study is that HAI surveillance is included in the REA-RAISIN. Thus, HAI definitions did not change over the study period, and data collection followed a standardized protocol, limiting collection bias. Moreover, the study was carried out in a nonoutbreak setting. Infection control measures were the same over time (that is, standard precautions and contact isolation of 3GC-RE-positive patients).</p><p>In addition, the results of our study show that the number of patients screened for 3GC-RE at admission decreased in unit A during period 2. Among patients who tested positive for 3GC-RE carriage at admission, less than 15% developed an infection due to 3GC-RE. Conversely, nearly three-fourths of patients who tested positive for 3GC-RE at admission and became infected by 3GC-RE during their hospitalization were transferred from another hospitalization unit. These results reveal that targeted screening at admission decreased the workload of ICU staff and permitted them to target those patients at greatest risk for 3GC-RE infection among all patients colonized by C3G-RE at admission.</p><p>To avoid patient-to-patient transmission, it may be important to detect patients colonized by 3GC-RE at admission to ICUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For several reasons, universal screening may not be an optimal ICU strategy. First, the proportion of patient-to-patient transmissions remains somewhat unknown and seems to vary from species to species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In some studies, researchers have tried to evaluate patient-to-patient transmission by analysing the genetic similarity of isolates, but the results appear to be discrepant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is increasingly implicated in infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and some evidence of low patient-to-patient transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] may challenge interest in universal screening. Universal screening does not appear to be cost-effective for ESBL-E eradication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It was reported to be more than CAD $1 million in a 2002 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, targeting patients at risk of colonization at ICU admission may be worth further assessment as an alternative to universal screening. There is in choosing criteria for targeted screening at ICU admission. Transfer from another hospital unit is known to be a risk factor for 3GC-RE carriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This criterion was chosen in unit A in the present study for its simplicity because transferred patients are easy to identify. However, other risk factors might be spotlighted according to local 3GC-RE epidemiology. Targeting patients with a high risk of nosocomial infection and in whom adequate antibiotic treatment is warranted (for example, patients with severe trauma, major surgery) is also worth considering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>SDD could be viewed as a competing strategy. Indeed, universal decolonization was found to be more effective than targeted screening and isolation in reducing rates of MRSA clinical isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], but its efficacy is not fully known in the case of 3GC-RE. Some researchers have reported positive results with decolonization of carriers in ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], even if the emergence of resistance was a particular concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>A 2005 to 2009 Canadian study suggested that the higher the proportion of screened patients, the lower the 3GC-RE-related HAI incidence rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which could be explained by a higher number of patients in contact isolation and decreased patient-to-patient transmission. This assumption runs counter to our results, which show no increase of the 3GC-RE-related HAI incidence rate with a lower proportion of screened patients. However, various individual and facility factors influencing 3GC-RE acquisition might explain the difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Compliance with barrier precautions, as well as other noncollected data (such as previous antibiotic therapies), was not evaluated in our study. Thus, even if our results may not be extended, targeted screening for 3GC-RE at ICU admission seemed to be as effective as universal screening in our study.</p><p>Our investigation has some potential limitations. First, its quasi-experimental design is limited by a lack of randomisation. Randomisation, which requires human and financial resources, is indeed tricky to implement in health care settings. The unicentric design does not permit extension of the data. The key strength of our study is the prospective nature of surveillance based on a national, standardized protocol. Moreover, it follows the guidelines for quasi-experimental study design and statistical analysis recommended in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], that is, adjustment on temporal trends and confounding factors. Inclusion of a control group improves the study&#x02019;s internal validity.</p><p>Given the nature of our study, based on a surveillance network protocol, we did not collect all confounding factors described in the literature. Covariables may be incomplete or unsuitable. For instance, the nature and duration of antibiotic administration at admission were not specified. Some comorbidities (such as diabetes mellitus) were not recorded and could have been confounding factors. Some patients&#x02019; characteristics changed between periods 1 and 2 in both ICUs, especially length of ICU stay, showing that patients hospitalized in both ICUs changed over time. Nevertheless, the absence of an increase in the 3GC-RE-related HAI incidence rate was still apparent after multivariate analysis, which permitted adjustment for potential confounders. The decreasing incidence may be due to an unidentified change of a noncollected factor over time in one or the other unit. Whereas the 3GC-RE-related HAI incidence rate was high during period 1, it might have decreased during period 2, even in the absence of intervention. Nevertheless, we can hypothesize that the decreased workload associated with targeted screening led to increased infection control compliance regarding 3GC-RE-colonized patients.</p><p>3GC-REs are due mainly to ESBL on one hand and overproduction of cephalosporinase on the other hand. Whereas ESBLs are carried by mobile elements, cephalosporinases have mainly chromosomal support. However, plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases have been described in the literature. For example, in a French multicentre ICU study of the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of resistance to 3GCs for <italic>E. coli</italic>, 41 3GC-R <italic>E. coli</italic> were isolated, of which 19 (46.3%) strains were ESBL-producing <italic>E.coli</italic> and 18 (43.9%) were the AmpC phenotype. Among these 18 strains, 5 (27.8%) of the plasmids carried AmpC enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Regarding the cost and workload required for ESBL diagnoses, notably in bacteria among ESBL that could be masked by cephalosporinase, and the emergence of plasmid mediated cephalosporinases, the lack of distinction between ESBL-E and 3GC-RE is a minor limitation of the study. Between 2008 and 2011, the proportions of ESBLs in clinical samples were 84.2% in unit A (144 of 171 clinical samples) and 70.8% in unit B (68 of 96 clinical samples).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study results indicate that the implementation of a relatively simple procedure, consisting of targeted screening for 3GC-RE at ICU admission for transferred patients, does not increase the 3GC-RE-related HAI incidence rate. Universal screening for 3GC-RE requires human and financial resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and targeted screening may be worth further assessment as an alternative to universal screening. However, it remains difficult to recommend such a strategy before robust evidence of proportions of patient-to-patient transmission acquired in multicentre studies has been provided. In addition, controlled and cost-effectiveness studies are warranted to confirm potential interest in targeted screening for 3GC-RE at admission.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Key messages</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The efficacy of universal screening to detect 3GC-RE carriers at ICU admission on the 3GC-RE HAI incidence rates is imperfectly known and seems not to be cost-effective, particularly if patient-to-patient transmission or prevalence at admission is low.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of targeted screening for 3GC-RE at ICU admission on the 3GC-RE HAI incidence rate and compare it to universal screening.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A quasi-experimental study with intervention and control groups showed that the implementation of targeted screening for 3GC-RE at ICU admission for patients transferred from another unit or hospital does not involve an increase of 3GC-RE HAI incidence over time.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An 85% decrease in the total number of rectal samples was observed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Targeted screening may be worthy of further assessment as an alternative to universal screening.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>ASC</term><def><p>Active screening culture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BAL</term><def><p>Bronchoalveolar lavage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESBL</term><def><p>Extended-spectrum &#x003b2;-lactamase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESBL-E</term><def><p>Extended-spectrum &#x003b2;-lactamase-producing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAI</term><def><p>Hospital-acquired infection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p>Intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRR</term><def><p>Incidence rate ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRSA</term><def><p>Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAPS II</term><def><p>Simplified Acute Physiology Score II</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDD</term><def><p>Selective digestive decontamination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>3GC-RE</term><def><p>Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic></p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>CD contributed to study design and data analysis and interpretation and drafted the manuscript.
