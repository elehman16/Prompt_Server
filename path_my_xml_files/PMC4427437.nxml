Endocannabinoids (ECs) are endogenous agonists of the cannabinoid receptors CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub>. The CB<sub>1</sub> receptor is located primarily in the brain but has also been identified in peripheral tissues, such as the gastro-intestinal tract and adipose tissue [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are the two most well-studied and described ECs. AEA belongs to the <italic>N</italic>-acylethanolamines (NAEs), a group of endogenous compounds that is assumed to share the same biosynthesis and degradation pathways. Unlike AEA, most other NAEs are not able to bind CB<sub>1</sub> or CB<sub>2</sub> receptors, but are suggested to be involved in physiological processes via their action on other receptors or via a potentiating (entourage) effect on AEA [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. NAEs are synthesized from the hydrolysis of their corresponding N- acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs), whereas 2-AG is produced from diacylglycerol after conversion by diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). NAEs and 2-AG also have different degradation pathways; NAEs are hydrolysed by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), while 2-AG is degraded by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The effects of AEA and 2-AG on anxiety and depression have been demonstrated in animals. Decreased anxiety and depression responses were demonstrated after inhibition of AEA and 2-AG degradation [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or by microinjection of an AEA analogue into the prefrontal cortex of rats [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Human studies also indicate a role of ECs in mood regulation [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Considerable insight has become available from the use of rimonabant, an inverse CB<sub>1</sub> agonist. The drug was not approved by the FDA and taken from the market in Europe 1 year after its approval because of side-effects, including anxiety and a depressed mood [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Further support for an involvement of AEA and 2-AG in mood comes from a study of Hill et al. (2009) who showed decreased AEA and 2-AG serum levels in individuals with major depression. However, in another study of Hill et al. (2008) individuals with minor depression displayed higher AEA and 2-AG serum levels. These findings suggest that progression of depression might be associated with a reduced ECS activity. Hill and Patel (2013) hypothesized that in healthy individuals the ECS acts as a buffer system that dampens negative emotions to regulate mood, while in individuals with major depression the ECS is hypoactive [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This is supported by neuroimaging studies showing a reduced amygdala activity in response to aversive emotional stimuli after cannabinoid administration, or in regular marijuana users [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126421.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>ECs have been demonstrated to have a regulatory role in the stress response as well [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Mood is negatively influenced by psychological stress, which increases tension and depression. In human interventions, an increase in circulating 2-AG and AEA was shown in response to psychological stress [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126421.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the study of Dlugos et al. (2012) also the other NAEs oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) were increased by stress. Therefore, we suggest that NAEs other than AEA may also play a role in mood regulation.</p><p>Taken together, these studies suggest that circulating ECs and their NAE congeners are relevant to measure in relation to mood and psychological stress regulation. Circulating concentrations of ECs have been suggested to be a &#x02018;spill-over&#x02019; of local production in tissues, as ECs are produced on demand and are thought to have mainly local effects [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126421.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In a previous study, we showed that plasma AEA and related NAEs strongly correlate with serum free fatty acid (FFA) levels after food intake, suggesting that changes in NAE and FFA concentrations may be induced via common mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>However, to date, no study in humans has been done in which the response of ECs and their NAE congeners on mood changes were evaluated. Mood can be influenced by ambiance both positively and negatively. Ambiance consists of multiple environmental factors, such as lighting and music, which can each affect mood. For example, soft lighting and listening to preferred music makes people feel more comfortable compared to bright lighting and listening to non-preferred music [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, mood can be influenced by moderate alcohol consumption. Well-known effects of alcohol on mood are stimulating effects, e.g. feelings of elation and happiness, and increased feelings of relaxation and sleepiness [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of mood induction on circulating concentrations of ECs and related NAEs in humans. It was hypothesized that a more negative mood would increase circulating ECs and NAE congeners, whereas a more positive mood would not influence circulating ECs and NAE congeners. Mood was induced by either a positive or negative meal ambiance and by moderate alcohol consumption or no alcohol consumption. Mood was evaluated by a short version of the &#x02018;Profile of Mood States&#x02019; (POMS-SF), a validated and widely used mood questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Plasma concentrations of the ECs 2-AG and AEA and 4 related NAEs were analysed by a validated LC-MS/MS method [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was conducted at TNO (The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research) in Zeist, The Netherlands, and was performed according to the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

Eligible subjects did not use any medication, habitually consumed alcohol (3&#x02013;20 glasses/week), and had no (family) history of alcoholism. During the screening also the use of THC was excluded. We chose women who were taking oral contraceptives, thus expecting to reduce possible effects of the menstrual cycle on mood.

Subjects consumed three glasses of sparkling white wine (30 g alcohol) or alcohol-free sparkling white wine with a meal in either a pleasant or an unpleasant ambiance. Each subject participated in all four experimental conditions, which occurred at least one week apart. Subjects were equally divided in 4 groups with different intervention orders according to a Latin square design. Allocation to intervention order was randomized according to body fat percentage and age by a computer-generated randomization scheme. Randomization and intervention order allocation were performed by statisticians of TNO. Subjects were kept ignorant to the study aim; they were informed that the study aim was to investigate the effect of different meal settings and alcohol on hormones and satiety. In addition, they were informed the alcohol content of the beverages could vary per intervention day. Subjects were blinded to the alcohol intervention.</p><p>An overview of the procedures during a study day is shown in <xref rid="pone.0126421.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. Subjects were instructed to refrain from drinking alcohol on the preceding evening, to eat their normal breakfast and lunch on standard times, and to refrain from eating and drinking anything except water 2 h before testing. After a baseline blood collection at 16:30 h, subjects relaxed for at least 15 min in a room where soft music was playing. Afterwards, they went to the test rooms with either a pleasant or an unpleasant ambiance. In these rooms, subjects filled out a computer questionnaire on mood before they consumed their first glass of sparkling white wine or alcohol-free white wine at t = 0 within 5 min. Immediately after they consumed their wine, the participants were served a meal consisting of a macaroni dish (2004 kJ, Apetito B.V., Denekamp, The Netherlands) with two more glasses of wine. The meal and 2 glasses of wine had to be finished in 15 min. Blood was drawn by venapuncture before the first drink and 30 min and 120 min afterwards. BAC was measured with a breathalyzer (Alcotest 7410, Dr&#x000e4;ger Nederland, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) at regular time points. The mood questionnaire was filled out before the first drink and at 20 min, 50 min and 110 min after.</p><p>Minor changes were made in the study procedure after the second study day to reduce potential stress from e.g. number of blood collections.

In the pleasant meal ambiance room there was colourful decoration, softened lighting, and music. The unpleasant meal ambiance was created by having very bright lighting, no music, a filled dustbin next to the table, no decoration and plastic cutlery and serving dish. These ambiances were enhanced by showing the participants either a happy or sad film scene from the animation films &#x02018;Bambi&#x02019; (Walt Disney, 1942) and &#x02018;The Lion King&#x02019; (Walt Disney, 1994). The scenes were approximately 2.5 min long and were shown during the first glass of wine or alcohol-free wine. The happy scenes were either the scene of &#x02018;Bambi on the ice&#x02019; or the Lion King scene of &#x02018;hakuna matata&#x02019;. The sad scenes were the scene of &#x02018;Bambi&#x02019;s mother dying&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or the &#x02018;Lion Kings father dying&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Subjects watched each film scene once.

As alcohol consumption is combined with food consumption, the blood alcohol concentration was expected not to exceed 0.5&#x02030;. Therefore, we considered consumption of 30 g alcohol together with a meal as a moderate dose.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Mood questionnaire</title><p>Changes in mood states were measured using the short version of the &#x02018;Profile of Mood States&#x02019; (POMS) [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] questionnaire. The questionnaire was computer based and asked participants to answer questions on a five-point interval scale ranging from &#x02018;strongly disagree&#x02019; to &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019;. The POMS also comprises adjectives for five different subscales for mood. The subscale Anger (range 7&#x02013;35), Depression (range 8&#x02013;40), Fatigue (range 6&#x02013;30) and Tension (range 6&#x02013;30) refer to a negative mood state, whereas the subscale Vigour (range 5&#x02013;25) refers to a positive mood state. We added two more positive mood subscales, Happiness (range 4&#x02013;20) and Calmness (range 4&#x02013;20) from the Brunel mood scale [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] to make the questionnaire more balanced. Subjects practised the questionnaire once to familiarize.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Biochemical analyses</title><p>Blood samples were collected in tubes containing clot activator for serum or in ice-chilled tubes containing EDTA for plasma. (Vacutainer Systems, Becton Dickinson, Plymouth, UK). For the analysis of ECs and related NAEs, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and URB602 (biphenyl-3-ylcarbamic acid, cyclohexyl ester) were added to the blood samples to inactivate the degradation enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase and monoglycerol lipase immediately after blood collection. In addition, blood samples for plasma were handled at 4&#x000b0;C and centrifuged within 30 min for 15 min (2000<italic>g</italic>, 4&#x000b0;C) after which they were stored immediately. Serum and plasma samples were stored at -20&#x000b0;C and -80&#x000b0;C respectively, until further analysis. Plasma levels of 2-AG, AEA and the related NAEs, OEA, PEA, stearoylethanolamide (SEA) and docosahexaenoylethanolamide (DHEA) were determined using an LC-MS/MS technique as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Plasma levels of ECs and related NAEs were analysed in a subsample of the subjects (n = 16) that had a complete dataset. Serum concentrations of FFAs and cortisol were determined using Olympus analytical equipment and reagents.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS statistical software package (SAS version 8; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Data were visually checked on normality and constant variance of residuals with histograms and plots of residuals vs. corresponding predicted values.</p><p>Intervention effects were analysed with a mixed analysis of variance model. Because of the crossover design, intervention effects within subjects were compared by including the random factors subject and subject by study day. Alcohol (alcohol vs. alcohol-free), ambiance (pleasant vs. unpleasant ambiance) and time were included as fixed factors. Since the design was a fully crossed design, the two-way interactions between alcohol and ambiance, time and alcohol and time and ambiance, and the three-way interaction between time, alcohol and ambiance were also included as fixed factors in the model. A <italic>post hoc</italic> test with Tukey-Kramer adjustment was used if an intervention effect occurred.</p><p>To assess the correlation of mood changes with changes in plasma concentrations of ECs and NAE congeners, Spearman rank correlations were calculated. These correlations were calculated between changes in scores from pre-meal until 110 min after the meal and changes in ECs and NAEs from pre-meal until 120 min after the meal. A Spearman rank correlation was chosen because it is less sensitive to strong outliers than a Pearson correlation.</p><p>To assess the correlation of ECs and NAE congeners with FFAs and cortisol, Pearson correlations were calculated for each subject. On these individual correlations a Fisher&#x02019;s <italic>z</italic> transformation was applied, to correct for deviations from the normal distribution and a 95% confidence interval was calculated. We used this method, because the variation in concentrations was high enough to compute individual correlations, which results in a more powerful calculation of correlations than with Spearman rank correlations.</p><p>P values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant. The measurements on the first intervention day of the first 11 subjects were considered not valid because of logistic problems that occurred, and were therefore excluded from the analyses.

In the unpleasant ambiance, PEA and SEA concentrations were elevated after 30 min, while they were decreased in the pleasant ambiance. Possibly, these NAEs can become elevated in a tension and depression increasing ambiance, as scores for tension and depression were higher in the unpleasant ambiance. This concords with animal studies indicating a regulatory role for ECs and related NAEs in emotion and stress [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126421.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

In the pleasant ambiance without alcohol we found negative correlations with happiness (2-AG and PEA) and vigour (OEA) and positive correlations with fatigue (AEA and DHEA). These findings might suggest that increasing ECs and NAE congeners are related to decreasing mood states as we hypothesized. However, calmness was positively related to SEA concentrations and no correlations were not found in the other experimental conditions. Therefore, we conclude that we did not observe a consistent pattern of correlations.</p><p>The biological relevance of plasma concentrations of ECs and NAE congeners remains speculative because plasma levels are likely to reflect a &#x02018;spill over&#x02019; of 2-AG and NAE synthesis in tissues, such as adipose tissue, liver and perhaps brain. Joosten et al. (2010) observed that circulating FFAs and NAEs are highly correlated. Here, correlations were calculated between NAEs and FFA levels similarly as in Joosten et al. (2010) and similar correlations were found between postprandial responses of FFAs and AEA, OEA and PEA. Therefore, this study confirms that plasma NAE patterns may reflect fatty acids patterns and that their short-term release from <italic>N</italic>-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) is triggered by similar mechanisms as are involved in the release of FFA. However, in this study, plasma ECs and related NAEs were also positively related to serum cortisol concentrations, especially in the unpleasant ambiance without alcohol. This finding together with the results from previous human studies where ECs and NAE congeners are shown to be responsive to stress [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126421.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126421.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], supports a role for plasma ECs and NAE congeners as indicators of stress.</p><p>Strengths of the study are the randomized crossover design and the controlled study conditions. Furthermore, the mood induction method by meal ambiance was completely standardized and induced a positive and negative mood for a relative long time of three hours. This was shown by higher depression and tension scores in the unpleasant ambiance and higher happiness scores in the pleasant ambiance. In comparison with the mood induction by ambiance, moderate alcohol consumption influenced different mood states and effects were more acute. We also showed an interaction effect of alcohol and ambiance on happiness, which was not shown before. Moderate alcohol consumption in an unpleasant ambiance increased happiness, but drinking alcohol during a pleasant mood results in an equally positive mood state. This indicates that the mood induction methods used were complementary and interacting, thereby providing the ability to study the response of ECs and NAE congeners on a variety of mood changes.</p><p>This study also has some important limitations. The experimental design of this study may not have provided the appropriate conditions to examine the relation between changes in mood and changes in ECs and related NAEs. A further limitation of the study is that ECs and their NAE congeners were measured at three time points and the effects of ambiance on NAEs may have been missed. Additionally, mood was induced by rooms with a pleasant or an unpleasant ambiance. Perhaps, these ambiances did not influence mood to such an extent that correlations between mood scores and plasma ECs and NAE congeners could be observed. Therefore, further research may focus on mood induction by ambiance using more extreme conditions. The role of ECs and NAE congeners may also be better detectable when no food is consumed during mood induction, and consequently exclusively focusing on the association of mood with ECs and NAE congeners.</p><p>This study was carried out in women, and generalizability of the results to men may therefore not be directly possible, because men and women showed different mood effects of a meal in a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0126421.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>We conclude that this is the first human study to demonstrate that plasma NAEs are responsive to an unpleasant meal ambiance. Furthermore, associations between mood states and ECs and related NAEs were observed, but not in all intervention combinations. This study provides additional insight in the response of plasma ECs and NAE congeners on mood changing conditions in humans.</p><p>The findings are in line with animal and human studies suggesting a role of endocannabinoids in mood and stress regulation. However, for a better translation between animal and human studies, animal studies should also measure circulating levels of ECs and NAE congeners and study their response on mood inductions. This would provide more information on the clinical relevance of changes in circulating ECs and NAEs. For clinical implications on the use of plasma ECs and NAE congeners as diagnostic agents for mood disorders, more research is necessary. Future human studies may focus on mood induction by ambiance using more extreme conditions. Associations may also be better detectable when no food is consumed during mood induction, and consequently exclusively focusing on the association of mood with endocannabinoids and NAEs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126421.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126421.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126421.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study protocol &#x0201c;Effect of moderate alcohol consumption on postprandial mood.&#x0201d;</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126421.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge those involved in the conduct of the study and the data analyses and thank the volunteers for their enthusiastic participation.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0126421.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
