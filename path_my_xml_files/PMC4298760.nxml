In this study, the authors evaluated the efficacy of romiplostim in patients who had thrombocytopenia with low-risk/intermediate-1&#x02013;risk MDS.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS</title><p>Patients who had thrombocytopenia with low-risk/intermediate-1&#x02013;risk MDS (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;250) were randomized 2:1 to receive romiplostim or placebo weekly for 58 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>The primary endpoint&#x02014; the number of clinically significant bleeding events (CSBEs) per patient&#x02014;had a hazard ratio for romiplostim:placebo of 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.05; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.13).

For patients who had baseline platelet counts &#x0003c;20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L, there was no difference in the number of CSBEs, but the platelet transfusion rates were higher in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001), which may have affected the overall CSBE results in this group with severe thrombocytopenia. The incidence of bleeding events was reduced significantly in the romiplostim group (relative risk, 0.92), as were protocol-defined platelet transfusions (relative risk, 0.77). Platelet response rates according to 2006 International Working Group criteria were higher for the group that received romiplostim (odds ratio, 15.6). On the basis of interim data, an independent data monitoring committee advised halting study drug because of concerns regarding excess blasts and AML rates with romiplostim (interim hazard ratio, 2.51). At 58 weeks, the AML rates were 6% in the romiplostim group and 4.9% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-3.84), and the overall survival rates were similar.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Romiplostim treatment in patients with low-risk/intermediate-1&#x02013;risk MDS increased platelet counts and decreased the number of bleeding events and platelet transfusions.

Randomization was facilitated through the interactive voice response system (IVRS) and was stratified by baseline platelet count (&#x02265;20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L or &#x0003c;20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L) and IPSS rating (low or intermediate-1). The romiplostim dose could be adjusted in 250-&#x003bc;g increments (from 250 &#x003bc;g every other week to 1000 &#x003bc;g weekly) or volume-matched placebo on the basis of platelet counts. Doses were withheld when the platelet count was &#x0003e;450&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L and were reinitiated at a reduced dose when the platelet count was &#x0003c;200&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L; if patients were receiving 250 &#x003bc;g, then the dose was reinitiated every other week. If the platelet count was &#x0003c;50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L for the first 3 consecutive weeks, then the dose was increased to 1000 &#x003bc;g on the fourth week. Patients who had their dose reduced could increase to the next highest dose if their platelet count was &#x0003c;50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L for 3 consecutive weeks.</p><p>Supportive care, defined as not including treatments that affected platelet production, aggregation, activation, granulocyte-macrophage&#x02013;colony-stimulating factors, or any other investigational agents, was allowed throughout the study. In the extended treatment period only, patients could receive any standard-of-care MDS treatments. After completion of the 58-week study period or early discontinuation of study drug, patients entered LTFU.</p><p>The primary endpoint was clinically significant bleeding events (CSBEs) (grade &#x02265;2 on the modified WHO bleeding scale<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Bleeding for &#x0003e;7 days was counted as a separate event every eighth day. Multiple events from the same organ system on the same day were collapsed into 1 event. Simultaneous bleeding events from unique organ systems were counted as individual events. Protocol-defined platelet transfusion events (PTEs) (ie, platelet transfusions for a bleeding event or platelets &#x02264;10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L), overall bleeding, and platelet response according to 2006 International Working Group Hematologic Improvement-Platelet (HI-P)<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> criteria also were assessed. Overall survival, MDS progression to AML, adverse events, and antibodies to romiplostim or thrombopoietin were assessed during the 58-week study period, which included the time in follow-up for patients who discontinued study drug early.</p><p>Romiplostim can be associated with transient blast cell count elevations in the absence of progression to AML. The study-defined criteria for progression to AML included: 1) confirmation of bone marrow or peripheral blast cells &#x02265;20%<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> at least 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug and at least 2 weeks after the last dose of hematopoietic growth factors; 2) a pathology report confirming extramedullary AML; or 3) initiation of treatment for AML, as designated by the investigator. An independent safety data monitoring committee (DMC) of 3 experts external to Amgen oversaw patient safety and met semiannually to review safety data generated by an independent statistics group.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>A sample size of 240 was planned for this study. The estimated event rate of CSBE was predicted to be 0.053 events per patient per week for the placebo group and 0.035 events per patient per week for the romiplostim group in the 26-week treatment period. The sample size was predicted to provide approximately 83% power to detect a difference in the total number of CSBEs between groups at a significance level of .05 (2-sided).</p><p>The primary endpoint of total number of CSBEs during the 26-week treatment period was analyzed using the Andersen-Gill model.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A Poisson regression model was used both for secondary analysis and to calculate the difference between the rates of PTEs and overall bleeding in each group. We summarized time-to-event endpoints using Kaplan-Meier estimates<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and survival curves according to treatment group at 58 weeks. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a Cox proportional-hazards model<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> stratified by randomization strata. We summarized the incidence of study-defined progression to AML at 58 weeks. Patient status information was updated with disease progression information obtained from LTFU. Disease progression, as assessed by increases in bone marrow blasts, was summarized as an exploratory analysis. For overall duration of bleeding, the relative risk (RR) was calculated from a Poisson regression model with treatment and stratification factors as covariates. Common odds ratios (ORs), adjusted for stratification factors, were calculated for HI-P. All patients who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of investigational product were included in the analysis. An unblinded interim analysis to review safety and efficacy data occurred when all enrolled individuals had completed the test treatment and interim washout period (week 30) or had terminated the study early. The final unblinding and analyses were performed at Amgen Inc.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Baseline Characteristics</title><p>In total, 250 patients were enrolled (romiplostim, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;167; placebo, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;83) at 109 sites in the United States, Canada, and Europe.

patients, the DMC recommended that all patients discontinue study treatment. The DMC was concerned that transient increases in peripheral blast cell counts associated with romiplostim put patients at risk for diagnosis of and treatment for AML and that the potential benefit of a reduction in bleeding did not outweigh that risk. All patients discontinued treatment by February 24, 2011, but remained on study for follow-up. All patients had received at least 1 dose of investigational product. Seventy patients (41.9%) who received romiplostim and 39 patients (47%) who received placebo completed the 26-week test treatment period and started the extended treatment period. Because of the DMC recommendation, 69 patients (27.6%) discontinued study drug early, including 41 in the test treatment period and 28 in the extended treatment period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Only 56 patients (36 patients in the romiplostim group and 20 patients in the placebo group) completed the 58-week study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Patient disposition is illustrated.

The treatment groups did not differ with respect to the primary endpoint: CSBE. There was no demonstrated effect on survival. The overall incidences of adverse events were similar, although there were more serious adverse events with romiplostim (nonsignificant). Because the DMC recommended early discontinuation of the study drug based on interim data, thereby decreasing the study's statistical power, additional study conclusions are limited. However, platelet count increases and the incidence of platelet response were greater in romiplostim-treated patients. Romiplostim decreased overall bleeding events (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.026) and CSBEs in patients who had baseline platelet counts &#x02265;20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001).</p><p>The CSBE endpoint is confounded by the significantly greater rate of platelet transfusions received in the placebo group. In patients with baseline platelet counts &#x0003c;20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L, no difference in CSBEs between treatment groups was observed. However, the percentage of patients with PTEs was significantly lower in the romiplostim group overall (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), particularly among patients with baseline platelet counts &#x0003c;20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L. It is likely that PTEs in patients with baseline platelet counts &#x0003c;20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L reduced bleeding events, which may account for the overall lack of difference in CSBEs between the placebo and romiplostim groups.</p><p>A composite endpoint of bleeding and platelet transfusions, similar to that comprising both bleeding and rescue medication use developed for patients with immune thrombocytopenia,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> might aid in the evaluation of romiplostim in MDS. Additional trials evaluating additional patient populations with endpoints that account for platelet transfusions and bleeding may be worthwhile.</p><p>Although the study drug was discontinued because of concern about blast increases and progression to AML with romiplostim, the rates of overall survival and progression to AML-free survival were similar between study arms. However, the study was not designed or powered to evaluate AML risk and was truncated early. Two romiplostim-treated patients who had increases in peripheral blast cell counts initiated treatment for AML without undergoing bone marrow biopsies 4 weeks after discontinuing romiplostim. Such patients were counted as having progressed to AML, which could affect interpretation of the results. In both arms of the study, patients with RAEB-1/RAEB-2 were disproportionately represented among those who developed AML. Romiplostim may stimulate megakaryocytes and other hematopoietic cells,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> which may account for the increases in blast cell counts observed more frequently with romiplostim and which often decreased after romiplostim discontinuation. Additional analysis revealed that, in most of these patients, romiplostim induced an increase in immature white blood cell forms and peripheral blood blasts, which could have led to an incorrect diagnosis of and treatment for AML.</p><p>One limitation of this study is the early discontinuation of study drug, which led to a smaller data set. This reduced power may have contributed to not meeting the primary endpoint: CSBE. Second, CSBE may have been confounded by platelet transfusions for which there were no set guidelines. Third, standard-of-care MDS treatments were allowed in the extended treatment period and during LTFU. The study was not designed to analyze the impact of those therapies, so their effects on outcomes were not evaluated. Finally, the broad criteria for diagnosing AML, some of which did not require bone marrow evaluation, along with data on transient blast increases, may account in part for the relatively high rate of AML observed in this low-risk population.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Because this represented a homogeneous population of relatively healthy patients with lower risk MDS, generalization is limited.</p><p>Although the data set was affected by the early discontinuation of study drug, the available data indicate that romiplostim monotherapy increased platelet counts and decreased platelet transfusions and all bleeding except CSBEs in thrombocytopenic patients with low-risk/intermediate-1&#x02013;risk MDS. The rates of AML and survival were similar between study arms. Additional data will be evaluated as LTFU continues, including the effects of romiplostim on the risk of disease progression to AML.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>FUNDING SUPPORT</title><p>This study was funded by Amgen Inc.
