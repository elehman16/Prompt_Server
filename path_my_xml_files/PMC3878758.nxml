Patients report symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, and abdominal cramping. The inability to digest lactose, lactose maldigestion (LM), occurs when the concentration of lactase enzyme is reduced in the brush border of the small bowel mucosa. This reduction typically begins early in childhood. Seventy-five percent of the world&#x02019;s population are maldigesters and, as dairy consumption spreads globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], these individuals are susceptible to develop sensitivity to lactose, i.e. lactose intolerance. In the United States, it is estimated that up to 80 million Americans have the potential for lactose intolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Symptoms of intolerance result when undigested lactose moves to the colon where it is fermented to produce acetate, carbon dioxide, hydrogen gas and methane. The osmotic effects of lactose and its fermentation products cause the symptoms most frequently associated with LI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The most common advice that physicians give patients with LI is to avoid dairy foods (Objective Insights, June 2012, unpublished data). However, this advice carries a significant nutritional risk. Dairy foods are excellent sources of calcium, potassium, vitamin D, B vitamins and high quality protein. In 2010, the United States Department of Health and Human Services reviewed 55 observational studies from 1967 to 2009 and indicated that low dietary milk and dairy intake was a risk factor for bone fracture, osteoporosis and other adverse health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Dietary calcium supplements did not consistently increase bone mineral density or reduce fracture risk. At the 2010 NIH Consensus Conference on Lactose Intolerance and Health, there was a strong call for additional research that would encourage dairy food consumption while limiting symptoms of intolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition to health consequences, dairy avoidance decreases the types and the abundance of lactose-digesting bacteria in the digestive tract and makes sufferers even more sensitive when accidentally exposed to dairy products.</p><p>Colonic bacterial adaptation in response to prebiotic therapy is one of the most promising new treatments for many gastrointestinal conditions including LI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. When microbial adaptation in the human intestinal tract occurs in a patient with LM, the altered population of anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria increases intraluminal beta-galactosidase activity, thereby enhancing digestion and reducing the production of fermentation products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As early as 1993, adaptation of the colon bacteria by increasing the exposure to lactose was a suggested approach by Briet et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] to improve lactose digestion and tolerance. In 1996, Hertzler and Savaiano demonstrated significant improvement in lactose digestion and tolerance and elevation of fecal beta-galactosidase due to colonic adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) are similar to lactose but contain 2-4 galactose units per molecule. GOS are non-digestible and not absorbed into the blood stream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Colonic adaptation, as a result of GOS administration, has been reported since the 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; however, no effective treatments for lactose intolerance using this mechanism have been developed. The hypothesis for the present study is that administration of RP-G28, a GOS, will shift colonic bacterial metabolism such that there will be both an improvement in lactose digestion and improved tolerance to an orally-administered lactose load.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A first-in-human, proof-of-concept study was conducted with RP-G28 between March 2011 and November 2011. RP-G28 is a proprietary product that is greater than 95% galacto-oligosaccharide. The empirical formal is: C<sub>(n+2)6</sub>H <sub>22+10n</sub> O <sub>(n+2)5</sub>. The study objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of RP-G28 in subjects with lactose intolerance. The study was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study conducted at 2 sites in the United States. The trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) on February 15, 2011, and the research was carried out in accordance with the clinical research practices defined in the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH).</p><p>An overview of the Study Design is shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Once informed consent was obtained, eligible subjects underwent screening assessments. Key inclusion criteria included adults ages 18 to 64 with current or recent self-reported history of dairy intolerance of at least 1-month duration. In order to confirm lactose intolerance and study participation, subjects underwent a 25-gram lactose challenge in the clinic. Lactose intolerance symptoms and hydrogen production via hydrogen breath test (HBT) were assessed in the clinic for 6&#x000a0;hours post-lactose challenge. Eligible subjects were required to demonstrate a minimum symptom score and a positive hydrogen breath test in order to be eligible for randomization. A positive HBT was defined as a hydrogen gas elevation of 20 parts per million (ppm) at 2 time-points within the 6&#x000a0;hours following a lactose-loading dose. Key exclusion criteria included diabetes mellitus, disorders known to affect GI motility such as gastroparesis or amyloidosis, disorders with GI symptoms such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease, or a history of surgery known to alter the normal function of the GI tract. At Visit 2, subjects meeting all eligibility criteria were randomized 2:1 [RP-G28:placebo] based on the randomization sequence. A 3-digit randomization code, which identified the treatment, was assigned to each subject sequentially based on the order in which the subject qualified. The pharmacist was unblinded to subject randomization; however, the clinical study staff, Medical Monitor, Study Monitor and Sponsor remained blinded throughout the entire study.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1475-2891-12-160-1"/></fig><p>The investigational product (IP), RP-G28 or placebo, was provided to subjects as a liquid in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles. Each HDPE bottle contained 1 dose of the IP. Subjects added water to the bottle to dilute the IP prior to ingestion. Investigational product was dosed with a meal. Placebo comparator was corn syrup with a similar consistency and sweetness and used the same dosing schedule and packaging as RP-G28. The dose of RP-G28 and Placebo was escalated in 5-day increments according to a fixed schedule from 1.5 grams per day (given once daily) to 15 grams per day (given as 7.5 grams twice daily). The precise schedule of dose escalation can be found in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. During the 35-day treatment period, all subjects were asked to avoid dairy products. After completion of the treatment period, subjects were followed for an additional 30&#x000a0;days and instructed to reintroduce dairy foods back into their diets.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Schedule of dose escalation for both RP-G28 and Placebo subjects</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th colspan="3" align="center"><bold>Dose escalation schedule</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Day</bold><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Breakfast</bold><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Dinner</bold><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">1&#x02013;5<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.5&#x000a0;g<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">6&#x02013;10<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3.0&#x000a0;g<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">11&#x02013;15<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">6.0&#x000a0;g<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">16&#x02013;20<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.5&#x000a0;g<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">6.0&#x000a0;g<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">21&#x02013;25<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3.0&#x000a0;g<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">6.0&#x000a0;g<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">26&#x02013;30<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">6.0&#x000a0;g<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">6.0&#x000a0;g<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">31&#x02013;35</td><td align="center">7.5&#x000a0;g</td><td align="center">7.5&#x000a0;g</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>To demonstrate effectiveness of RP-G28, subjects underwent two additional 25-gram lactose challenges on Day 36 (immediately post-treatment) and Day 66 (30&#x000a0;days post-treatment).

HBT machines were provided to each site and were properly calibrated to minimize variability in the data. To reduce other external factors on the HBT results, subjects were asked to refrain from using mouthwash or toothpaste and to refrain from strenuous exercise on the evening before and the morning of the clinic visit. Subjects were instructed to fast for at least 8&#x000a0;hours prior to the lactose challenge. On the evening before the HBT, subjects were given dinner restrictions, particularly to have a low intake of sugar, carbohydrate, and fiber as well as to avoid all dairy products. Over the 6-hour assessment period post-lactose challenge, subjects did not smoke, sleep, lie down, or engage in strenuous exercise. At the start of the HBT, subjects exhaled into a gas collection bag, and the breath concentrations of hydrogen, methane, and CO<sub>2</sub> were measured (baseline, Hour 0). The subject then ingested 25 grams of lactose in a liquid solution and breath samples were collected hourly for 6&#x000a0;hours. Total hydrogen production was calculated as the sum of the hydrogen levels in ppm above baseline at each time-point.</p></sec><sec><title>Lactose intolerance symptom assessment</title><p>In parallel to the HBT, symptoms of LI [i.e., abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and cramping] were collected at 3-and 6-hour time-points following the 25 gram, in-clinic lactose challenge at baseline, Day 36 (end of treatment) and Day 66 (30&#x000a0;days post-treatment). Severity of symptoms was evaluated using an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale from 0 (none) to 10 (worst).</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Global Assessment (PGA)</title><p>The subject&#x02019;s perception of lactose tolerance was captured using a quality of life questionnaire on Day 66.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Adverse Events (AEs) were collected and monitored from the time a subject received the IP until the end of the study or early termination. In general, any clinically significant changes from baseline were considered AEs. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were AEs which resulted in death, were life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization, resulted in a significant incapacity, or were considered to be an important medical event.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The power calculations for each endpoint were performed independently. With the calculation of total hydrogen production, literature reports indicate a lactose challenge of 6, 12, or 20&#x000a0;g result in mean total 8-hour hydrogen productions of 145, 292, and 488&#x000a0;ppm above baseline, respectively, with SDs of approximately 126&#x000a0;ppm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

All safety analyses were performed using the ITT population. The efficacy analysis was conducted on the per protocol (PP) population because the PP population included all subjects who were randomized and completed through Day 36. Subjects excluded from the PP population did not submit Day 36 data and therefore there was no data to use for efficacy analysis. At any point, if data for a measure were missing, the data remained missing. No imputation of missing data was performed.</p><p>Using the PP population (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;62), the median change from baseline (Day 0) at Day 36 in breath hydrogen levels and the change from baseline (Day 0) in each symptom at Day 36 was calculated. For each symptom, those subjects who reported having had the symptom at Day 0 and reported at least a 50% reduction in severity were classified as &#x0201c;responders.&#x0201d; A Chi square test was performed to analyze the difference in the responder rates between the placebo and RP-G28 groups. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to analyze the change from baseline at Day 36 for median breath hydrogen and for each symptom. For each ANCOVA, treatment, study center, and the treatment/study center interaction were included as factors and the appropriate baseline measurement was included as a covariate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>There were 395 subjects screened. 310 subjects were excluded, and 85 subjects were randomized. Of those, 57 were randomized to RP-G28 and 28 to placebo. In the randomized population, 42% were male, the mean age of 41&#x000a0;years and the mean BMI of 27.1&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. 38% of the participants were Asian, 26% were African-American, 15% were White, and 21% were other. There were no obvious differences in the two treatment groups. Due to a discoloration of a batch of study medication, 18 subjects (12 in the RP-G28 group and 6 in the placebo group, since the study was double blinded) were prematurely withdrawn by the Sponsor before Day 36. None of these subjects were included in any of the efficacy analyses since they did not complete Day 36. Five additional subjects withdrew from the study between randomization and Day 36 for the following reasons: withdrew consent (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2; both in RP-G28 group), lost to follow-up (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1; RP-G28 group), and protocol non-compliance (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2; placebo group). 62 subjects (42 subjects in the RP-G28 group and 20 subjects in the placebo group) completed through Day 36 of the study and comprised the per protocol population.

By avoiding dairy products, many lactose intolerant individuals in the US and other developed countries have lower bone density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Low calcium consumption increases the risk for chronic diseases, most notably osteoporosis and its sequelae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Colonic adaptation, to allow adequate dairy consumption without uncomfortable clinical symptoms, holds significant promise for lactose intolerant patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The mechanism for this adaptation includes the selection of a higher diversity and concentration of lactose-metabolizing species of bacteria, induction of microbial beta-galactosidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and enhanced utilization of hydrogen gas produced during fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As a result, lactose can be rapidly metabolized by intestinal flora with limited production of uncomfortable clinical symptoms. Adaptation of the gut can turn symptomatic LI patients into lactose digesters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] despite the underlying genetically-controlled biology of low intestinal lactase activity.</p><p>GOS preparations have been shown to stimulate microfloral changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, these preparation have high levels of lactose contaminates and are not ideal for lactose intolerant patients. This clinical study is the first to specifically look at the effect of RP-G28, a high quality GOS, on lactose intolerant individuals. Results of the trial show that RP-G28 is effective at improving the clinical symptoms and digestion of lactose while maintaining an excellent safety and tolerability profile.</p><p>The variation in breath hydrogen seen over the 6-hours post lactose challenge is typical for a breath hydrogen curve. While the differences are not large, it is clear that the RP-G28 group had lower levels of breath hydrogen from Hours 2 to 6. In the placebo group, these differences are not apparent. Although the HBT is useful to diagnose LM, it is not used in clinical practice for the assessment of LI severity and changes in HBT do not directly correlate to changes in LI symptoms. Thus, HBT would not provide clinically meaningful information to the clinician or patient.</p><p>This study further explores methods for identifying meaningful treatment benefits to patients coping with LI. A 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale of symptoms following a lactose challenge was utilized. Mean differences between baseline and follow-up symptom scores were intended to be a straightforward method to evaluate symptom improvement. The challenge with mean scores is that they may show small numerical difference among an individual patient&#x02019;s symptom reduction even though the improvement may have been a robust and meaningful effect for the patient. Also, in evaluating a total mean symptom score, symptom categories that may be responsive are &#x0201c;diluted&#x0201d; by the unresponsiveness of other categories. As a result, it&#x02019;s important to evaluate symptoms individually and use additional methods to objectively quantify clinically meaningful results.</p><p>There were two results which were signals of RP-G28&#x02019;s meaningful benefit to patients: the Patient&#x02019;s Global Assessment and the number of subjects reporting abdominal pain at Days 36 and 66 (Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The global assessment of a patient&#x02019;s symptom improvement was used to evaluate patient response to therapy. Patient Global Assessment data are widely accepted to provide the most reproducible clinical responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] in evaluating treatment efficacy in patients with functional GI disorders. In this study, RP-G28 treated subjects were six times more likely, versus placebo, to report being lactose tolerant 30&#x000a0;days after discontinuing treatment; this result was statistically significant. This finding provides evidence suggestive of the strength of RP-G28&#x02019;s effect beyond the acute treatment phase.</p><p>In patients reporting abdominal pain at baseline following a 25-gram lactose load, half reported a zero on the pain scale immediately after treatment and 30&#x000a0;days post-treatment. It is reasonable to conclude that the development of tolerance to lactose is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of abdominal pain in patients with symptomatic lactose intolerance when treated with RP-G28. Literature suggests that functional abdominal pain is the key symptom that drives other gastrointestinal symptoms because it occurs after stimulation of multimodal afferent neural pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This appears to be mediated by responses to distension and may be important in the development of symptoms, not just in patients with LI, but in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.</p><p>Future studies should consider capturing the time-course, intensity, frequency and duration of LI symptoms following lactose ingestion. The benign adverse event safety profile observed in this trial suggests that higher doses of RP-G28 may be well-tolerated and have a more pronounced effect on the improvement of lactose intolerance symptoms experienced by subjects administered an acute treatment of RP-G28.</p><p>The significant elimination of abdominal pain post-treatment and 30-days post treatment combined with a benign safety profile support continued clinical evaluation of RP-G28. RP-G28 has potential to allow people the ability to regularly consume dairy foods without experiencing symptoms of LI.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contribution</title><p>All authors participated in the preparation of the manuscript.
