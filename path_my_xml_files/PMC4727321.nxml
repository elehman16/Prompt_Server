Despite the provision of child protection education programs in many countries, few have been rigorously evaluated to determine their effectiveness. We describe the design of a multi-site gold standard evaluation of an Australian school-based child protection education program. The intervention has been developed by a not-for-profit agency and comprises 5 1-h sessions delivered to first grade students (aged 5&#x02013;6 years) in their regular classrooms. It incorporates common attributes of effective programs identified in the literature, and aligns with the Australian education curriculum.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">A three-site cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Learn to be safe with Emmy and friends&#x02122; will be conducted with children in approximately 72 first grade classrooms in 24 Queensland primary (elementary) schools from three state regions, over a period of 2 years. Entire schools will be randomised, using a computer generated list of random numbers, to intervention and wait-list control conditions, to prevent contamination effects across students and classes. Data will be collected at baseline (pre-assessment), immediately after the intervention (post-assessment), and at 6-, 12-, and 18-months (follow-up assessments). Outcome assessors will be blinded to group membership. Primary outcomes assessed are children&#x02019;s knowledge of program concepts; intentions to use program knowledge, skills, and help-seeking strategies; actual use of program material in a simulated situation; and anxiety arising from program participation. Secondary outcomes include a parent discussion monitor, parent observations of their children&#x02019;s use of program materials, satisfaction with the program, and parental stress.

The term child maltreatment refers to one or more of 4 major subtypes: physical abuse, emotional (or psychological) abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect. Child maltreatment can involve acts of omission or commission by parents, caregivers, or community members (e.g. teachers, clergy) and may result in death, serious injury, or exploitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Epidemiological monitoring reveals it is associated with a variety of specific negative outcomes for children, including higher levels of mental illness, poverty, greater engagement with crime, and physical, emotional, mental and social maladjustment across the entire developmental trajectory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">One way to help children to learn about and safeguard themselves from maltreatment is through school-based child protection education programs, which were first implemented in the USA in the 1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Also known as child abuse prevention, child assault prevention, child safety, personal safety, and protective behaviours programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], these typically focus on teaching severalcore concepts, including how to recognise safe and unsafe situations, how to react when approached, and how to identify safe adults to speak with about unsafe situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A major benefit of child protection education programs is that, unlike programs focusing solely on one type of harm (i.e. bullying, physical violence, sexual harassment), they equip children with knowledge and skills that may be generalised to recognise, react to and report multiple types of harm and risk situations.</p><p id="Par7">Despite the wide uptake of child protection education programs in countries as diverse as Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], systematic reviews and meta-analyses highlight that very few highly rigorous program evaluations exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Indeed, it has been identified that few evaluations have used control groups and randomised designs, whilst fewer still track outcomes for more than 6&#x000a0;months to examine the long-term effectiveness of these programs. There have also been concerns regarding the measures utilised to evaluate outcomes. For example, recommendations for future research designs include the need to measure: a) primary or targeted program outcomes such as self-protective skills, behaviour change, abuse disclosures;b)multiple program outcomes including knowledge, intentions, skills,and program satisfaction,within the one sample; and c) potential negative impacts such as increased fear or anxiety.</p><p id="Par8">This study extends an earlier successful Australian study of a specific child protection education program, <italic>Learn to Be Safe with Emmy</italic>&#x02122; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This was a quasi-experimental study in which classrooms were randomised to conditions (program and waitlist); with the waitlist comparison group receiving the program after they completed post-test measures (5 weeks after administration of baseline measures). In this study, a total of 245 first grade students (aged 5&#x02013;6 years) participated in the <italic>Learn to Be Safe with Emmy</italic>&#x02122; program, recruited from five primary (elementary) schools on the Gold Coast, Queensland. The study demonstrated the program was effective in increasing participants&#x02019; self-protective knowledge and skills, and their intentions to respond in a safe manner to unsafe situations including hypothetical situations with risks of bullying, abuse and sexual assault, without increasing or decreasing child anxiety.</p><p id="Par9">The current study will extend on Dale et al.

It will: (i) use a larger sample, with schools from a broader range of demographic areas; (ii) randomise at school-level to prevent cross-learning between conditions; (iii) provide a 6-month follow-up for the waitlist control condition, and 12- and 18-month follow-ups for the intervention condition; (iv) examine the degree to which parents/guardians discuss intervention content with children at home; (v) develop and utilise an in-vivo measure to assess children&#x02019;s ability to discriminate safe/unsafe situations and disclose their experience to trusted adults; and (vi) enhance the intentions to respond measure by asking about both safe and unsafe situations to test if safety responses (i.e. telling an adult) were used appropriately according to the level of perceived risk.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p id="Par10">The aim of this study is to conduct an empirical assessment, using a cluster randomised-controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], of key outcomes of the <italic>Learn to be safe with Emmy and friends</italic>&#x02122; program.

An information sheet detailing the <italic>Learn to be safe with Emmy and friends</italic>&#x02122; program and explaining the evaluation will be sent to school principals who will be asked to provide consent for their school&#x02019;s participation. Randomisation will be conducted following principal consent, after which time, schools will be asked to distribute standardised information sheets with consent forms (either waitlist-control or intervention version) to parents/guardians (hereafter, parents) of all children enrolled in first grade. Parents return consent forms to the school if they agree for their child to participate.</p><p id="Par25">A simple random sampling strategy with individuals as the primary sampling unit was assumed, and G*Power was then used to estimate sample size. This returned a suggested total sample size of at least 100 children per group at each of three sites. Based on similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] that have used cluster sampling with schools as the primary sampling unit, the sample size with this design effect was estimated to be approximately 1.5, taking into account potential attrition of (20&#x000a0;%) owing to student absences and/or mobility. In addition, enough power will be needed to examine the effects for subgroups (sex/school/family/stress, etc.). Therefore, a total sample size of at least 1350 is required in this study to test the effectiveness of the intervention. Assuming conservative class sizes of 20 students per class (60 children per school; 9 schools in each region), a final initial sample size of 1620 Year 1 children and their parents is planned to give sufficient power for this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p id="Par26">Children will be eligible to participate in the study if they are enrolled in a first grade classroom at a participating school.

<italic>Learn to be safe with Emmy and friends</italic>&#x02122; is a child protection education program designed for first grade students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It consists of five 1-h sessions provided free-of-charge by trained facilitators, delivered in children&#x02019;sregular classrooms once per week for five weeks. A unique program feature is the presence of an adult-size program mascot called &#x0201c;Emmy&#x0201d; who, as a child-like character, assists program facilitators by drawing attention to key themes, and modelling strategies in developmentally-appropriate ways. The <italic>Learn to be safe with Emmy and friends</italic>&#x02122; program addresses many of the core themes common toeffective child protection and bullying prevention programs including 1) teaching children how to recognise potentially dangerous people or situations, 2) teaching children how to respond (i.e. with rehearsed statements and positive actions) and 3) encouraging children to report or disclose past, current or future abuse or unsafe encounters to trusted authority figures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

Content focuses on early warning signs (i.e., indicators given by the body that a situation may be unsafe), discriminating safe and unsafe situations, and identifying situations that may feel unsafe but are either fun (e.g. roller coasters) or within the child&#x02019;s control (e.g. a test).</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Personal Space and Private Body Areas. Content addresses the concept of personal space and private body areas as well as teaching responses to personal space violations and information regarding disclosure.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Safe/Unsafe Secrets. Content focuses on examples of safe and unsafe secrets and distinguishing between these. Encouragement is also given to disclosing potentially unsafe secrets to safe adults.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Identification of Safe Adults and Safety Networks for Disclosure.

Regression will be used to test the mediation analyses and to examine any effects of moderators (e.g. demographic variables, parental stress, dose&#x02013;response) to determine which factors may differentiate intervention effects.

This program will be rigorously evaluated in the first multi-site cluster randomised controlled trial of a school-based child protection education program conducted in Australia. This child protection education program targets first grade children (aged 5&#x02013;6 years), and draws on a set of core concepts identified in child protection and bullying prevention programs. Several key program outcomes will be assessed at multiple stages. We hypothesise that children&#x02019;s short-term (T1 to T2) knowledge of program concepts,intentions to use program knowledge, skills, and help-seeking strategies, and actual use of program material in a simulated situation will increase. We also hypothesise that&#x000a0;children will show long-term (T2 to T5) retention of these knowledge and skills. Children&#x02019;swill also be measured to rule out any potential adverse effects of raising awareness of dangers and risk related to child protection issues. Other key program elements that will be assessed include parental discussion of material, parents&#x02019; observations of their children&#x02019;s use of program materials, parents&#x02019; satisfaction with the program, and parental stress. The effectiveness of this program will also be evaluated for moderating effects, which will determine whether adaptations are required for different populations. Few experimental evaluations of a child protection education program have ever been reported in Australia (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], for an exception); this study, therefore, will fill an important gap in the child maltreatment prevention literature and will provide robust evidence of the benefits or otherwise of school-based child protection education programs in this context. The <italic>Learn to be safe with Emmy and friends</italic>&#x02122; program, while delivered selectively to volunteering schools at present, may have potential to become a more widely-used program should its effectiveness be determined.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
