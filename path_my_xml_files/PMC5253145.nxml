</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malnutrition is a prevalent but under recognized problem in hospitalized patients. Up to 50&#x000a0;% of patients may be malnourished at hospital admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, decreased appetite, decreased food intake, and dietary disruptions caused by medical procedures all tend to cause a patient&#x02019;s nutrition status to deteriorate during hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Malnutrition is most prevalent in older adults, a population that commonly has multiple comorbidities and that accounts for more than 30&#x000a0;% of hospital admissions and half of total hospital expenditures in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The clinical implications of malnutrition at hospital admission are substantial, as the condition is associated with increased medical complications and infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Malnutrition also has important economic ramifications, as it is associated with longer length of stay, delayed recovery, and increased risks of readmission and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Patients with malnutrition or with poorer nutritional status also have significantly higher costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Malnutrition and its effects can be attenuated by identifying, screening and providing a nutritional intervention to this patient population. A systemic review and meta-analysis by Cawood et al. reported that the use of multi-nutrient, high protein oral nutritional supplements (ONS) is associated with improved outcomes in a range of patient populations in a variety of health-care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. They concluded that high protein ONS (providing&#x000a0;&#x02265;20&#x000a0;% total energy from protein) confers clinical, nutritional and functional benefits and that there is little evidence that it suppresses normal food intake. In a subsequent meta-analysis, Stratton et al. found that use of ONS significantly reduced hospital readmissions during a 2- to 12-month period following discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The review also found that most observed benefits accrued to older individuals with a variety of conditions following hospitalization.</p><p>A recent randomized, controlled study (NOURISH Study) reported that early initiation and sustained use of a nutrient-dense ONS significantly decreased post-hospitalization mortality rates in a population of malnourished older adults hospitalized for congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (4.8 vs. 9.7&#x000a0;%; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.018) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A key question is whether this adjunctive therapy is cost effective. The following analysis addresses this question using subject-level data from the clinical trial. We report results for the trial period (extending 90&#x000a0;days&#x02019; post-hospital discharge) in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved, a metric that accounts for both longevity and quality of life. We also project cost effectiveness in terms of cost per life-year saved over a lifetime.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We estimated the cost effectiveness of the investigative treatment evaluated in the NOURISH trial. NOURISH was a prospective, randomized, double-blind study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01626742) evaluating the effect of specialized ONS in 622 elderly (&#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age) patients hospitalized with CHF, AMI, pneumonia or COPD in the USA. A total of 313 patients received the investigative ONS and 309 received the placebo product. The mean age of the study population was 78&#x000a0;years. The mean body mass index (BMI) was about 24&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Per enrollment criteria, all patients were functionally independent at the study admission; patients from nursing homes or residential facilities were excluded. Only malnourished patients were included in the study, with a Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) class of B (moderate or suspected malnutrition) or C (severe malnutrition). More details about the study population and compliance information have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The investigative product was a nutrient-dense, ready-to-drink liquid ONS containing a high concentration of protein and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate. The placebo product was also a ready-to-drink liquid, containing carbohydrate and vitamin C. Subjects were given designated products twice a day, from the time of enrollment during hospitalization to 90&#x000a0;days after discharge. The study tracked health-care utilization, quality of life and survival over the course of the study period. Cost effectiveness is the incremental cost incurred by subjects in the trial treatment arm (compared to controls) divided by the accrued incremental health benefits, measured in terms of either added survival (life-years) or added QALYs.</p><p>We conducted two cost-effectiveness analyses from a US health-care system perspective. The horizon for one analysis matched the follow-up period for the underlying clinical trial and therefore extended through the index hospitalization and concluded at the end of 90&#x000a0;days&#x02019; post-discharge. That analysis used QALYs to measure added benefits. As recommended by guidelines for conducting cost-effectiveness analyses, we also developed a lifetime horizon based on the clinical trial results and other sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This lifetime horizon analysis used life years in place of QALYs because no quality-of-life information was collected beyond the 90-day post-discharge trial follow-up period. The population was the intention-to-treat group from the clinical trial. We included costs and benefits pertinent to the health-care payer perspective. All costs were inflated to 2015 US dollars using the Consumer Price Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ninety-Day Post-Discharge Analysis</title><p>Costs for this time horizon have four components: (1) the investigative treatment; (2) hospitalization costs prior to discharge; (3) readmission hospitalizations post-discharge; and (4) other health-care consumption post-discharge.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention Costs</title><p>We estimated costs for the investigative treatment (component 1) as the product of the trial-reported number of servings consumed per subject and the price per serving. We assumed the unit price for the investigative treatment is US$3.00 per serving. We did not include placebo costs in this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Hospital Costs Prior to Discharge</title><p>We estimated costs for the index hospitalization (component 2) as the product of the trial-reported length of stay for each subject and a per-day average cost for the subject&#x02019;s primary admission Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) diagnosis, as calculated using cost-per-day values reported by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUPNet) database (in particular, HCUP&#x02019;s total population cost for the indicated diagnosis divided by the product of the number of discharges for that diagnosis and the HCUP-reported average length of stay per discharge for that diagnosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Per the trial inclusion criteria, the primary index hospitalization diagnosis for all subjects was one of the following: CHF, AMI, pneumonia, or COPD. Finally, for NOURISH subjects without a recorded length of stay, we used the HCUPNet estimate for cost-per-stay for the subject&#x02019;s diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Readmission Costs</title><p>We estimated costs for hospital readmissions (component 3) in the same way, although for the readmissions, we did not restrict diagnoses to a particular list of conditions. For example, using the HCUPNet database, we were able to calculate an average daily cost of US$1871 for asthma. When the length of stay was two days, total costs of a readmission for asthma were US$3742. Because HCUPNet does not report cost-per-day estimates for all readmission diagnoses, we could not in all cases compute costs as the product of the length of stay and cost-per-day. When cost-per-day from HCUPNet was unavailable (2.5&#x000a0;% of cases), we estimated the cost using cost-per-day or cost-per-stay estimates taken from the literature. For example, if the patient was readmitted with fall within 90-day post-discharge, we estimated total costs using cost-per-day estimate from Roudsari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Observation days were not counted as readmissions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Other Health-Care Costs</title><p>We calculated costs for outpatient care following discharge (component 4). For patients discharged to their home, the trial data reported visits to the hospital emergency room (ER), hospital outpatient setting, primary-care doctor, medical specialists, urgent-care setting, and other medical-care settings. Cost estimates come from the 2012 Medical Panel Expenditure Survey (MEPS) database and the published literature (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Rehabilitation Costs</title><p>For subjects discharged from the hospital directly to an inpatient rehabilitation facility, we summed inpatient costs (the product of length of stay and a cost-per-day of US$1361) and outpatient costs (the product of number of outpatient visits and cost-per outpatient visit of US$194 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We were not able to identify outpatient rehabilitation costs from the MEPS and therefore, we assumed that this cost was the same as the average cost for other health-care visits. Here, we assumed: (1) length of inpatient stay was the difference between the hospital discharge dates and rehabilitation discharge dates; and (2) the &#x0201c;number of visits&#x0201d; corresponded to outpatient visits made subsequent to discharge from the rehabilitation facility. When missing data ruled out calculation of the inpatient and outpatient&#x000a0;rehabilitation costs (16.3&#x000a0;% of patients), we instead included a cost of US$18,109 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which corresponds to the average cost of an inpatient stay in a rehabilitation facility. For all subjects not discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation facility, we assumed that the cost incurred amounts to the number of outpatient visits times the per visit cost of US$194.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Long-Term Care (Nursing Home) Costs</title><p>For subjects discharged to a long-term care facility for whom we had the needed information, we estimated cost as the product of length of stay and a cost-per-day of US$359 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For subjects discharged to a long-term care facility lost to follow-up and with missing length of stay we assumed a cost-per-stay of US$9691 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Utility Weight</title><p>Finally, we estimated quality-adjusted survival through the end of the trial&#x02019;s follow-up period (90&#x000a0;days&#x02019; post discharge). In general, the number of QALYs accrued over an entire year ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, depending on an individual&#x02019;s preference-weighted quality of life, which reflects factors such as level of discomfort and diminished function. The number of QALYs accrued per year (the health condition&#x02019;s &#x0201c;utility weight&#x0201d;) is close to 1.0 if a health condition has a small adverse impact on quality of life. On the other hand, a grave health condition (e.g. being in a vegetative state) considered equal to being dead would have a utility weight of 0. We estimated QALYs accrued for each subject as the interpolated area under the utility weight curve. The clinical trial reported two utility weight estimates at each time point (discharge, 30, 60, and 90&#x000a0;days&#x02019; post-discharge): the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) estimated utility weight, and the EuroQOL five dimensions with three levels of problems (EQ-5D-3L) utility weight.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Lifetime Horizon Analysis</title><p>Since no cost information was available for subjects after the conclusion of the follow-up period, which ended at 90&#x000a0;days&#x02019; post-discharge, we assumed that costs incurred after this time were independent of the subject&#x02019;s treatment arm. As a result, the difference in lifetime costs is the same as the difference in costs through 90&#x000a0;days&#x02019; post-discharge and therefore, costs were not discounted. In short, we used the same incremental cost estimates for the lifetime analysis as we used for the 90-day post-discharge analysis.</p><p>Because utility information was not available for the period beyond the end of follow-up, we measured benefits as life-years survived post-discharge. We did not discount life-years because of the growing controversy relating to discounting nonmonetary health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Clinical trial data informed estimates of survival through the end of follow-up. To estimate post-discharge survival, we used projections reported by Cho et al. because those projections are population based, and are conditioned on health status, as well as on age and gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Cho et al. reported specific survival estimates for COPD and CHF, which we used for subjects with those conditions. They also reported survival for subjects with low/medium severity comorbidities (in contrast to either no comorbidities or &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; severity comorbidities). For AMI and for pneumonia, we used survival estimates for the &#x0201c;low/medium&#x0201d; comorbidity category described by Cho et al.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Ninety-Day Post-Discharge Analysis</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Costs</title><p>The 313 subjects in the treatment arm of the clinical trial consumed a total of 29,481 servings of the investigative nutritional supplement, or an average of 94.19 servings per person (cost: US$283 per person).</p><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> details hospital length of stay and costs prior to discharge.

Because of the long-term care facility costs, total per-subject costs for the control group slightly exceeded corresponding costs for the treatment group (US$4532 vs. US$4519 per subject).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Other health-care costs during the 90-day post-discharge period</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"/><th align="left" rowspan="2">Unit cost (US$)</th><th align="left" colspan="3">Control group (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;309)</th><th align="left" colspan="3">Treatment group (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;313)</th></tr><tr><th align="left">Cohort total number</th><th align="left">Cohort total cost (US$)</th><th align="left">Cost per subject (US$)</th><th align="left">Cohort total number</th><th align="left">Cohort total cost (US$)</th><th align="left">Cost per subject (US$)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Hospital emergency room visits</td><td char="." align="char">975<sup>a</sup>

Moreover, although previous studies have reported that ONS improves a range of health outcomes, the NOURISH study is the first to show a statistically significant impact on survival in older hospitalized patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The economic assessment described in this paper suggests that the nutritional therapy for older, malnourished hospitalized patients can be highly cost effective. Even when the analysis conservatively accounts only for health benefits accrued within the first 90&#x000a0;days&#x02019; post-discharge, this specialized ONS therapy improved health at a cost of no more than US$34,000 per QALY (based on SF-36 results), a value below (more favorable than) the commonly cited benchmark of US$50,000 to US$100,000 per QALY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Although costs may vary by region and facility, the difference in costs between the two arms should vary much less. That is because many costs in this analysis show up in both arms of the trial. Even more importantly, a major component of cost differences is the nutritional supplement, and because it is a nationally distributed product, its costs should not vary substantially across regions.</p><p>In contrast to findings based on the SF-36, quality-of-life measurements based on the EQ-5D suggest accrual of slightly more QALYs per person in the control group, compared to the treatment group, during the first 90&#x000a0;days&#x02019; post-hospital discharge. The EQ-5D may not have sufficient granularity to characterize shifts in quality of life in the context of the NOURISH trial. For example, the EQ-5D-derived utility weight was identical across at least two time points for approximately 40&#x000a0;% of all subjects.</p><p>Our 90-day post-discharge analysis limits attention to the first 90&#x000a0;days following hospital discharge because that is the extent of the empirical follow-up recorded in the NOURISH trial. Extending the analysis time horizon by making reasonable assumptions about survival gains after that period is recommended by health-economic methodology guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and is appropriate when evaluating an intervention that has an impact on patient survival. We estimated that if the cohort were followed for their entire lifetime, the intervention would cost US$524 per life-year saved. Conservatively assuming that over each life-year, a patient may gain 0.6 QALYs (i.e. assuming the individual&#x02019;s quality of life is severely compromised), and yields a cost-per-QALY ratio of less than US$1000 per QALY gained. This result compares favorably to a number of well-accepted health-care interventions, including treatment of atrial fibrillation in 70-year-olds with warfarin (US$2573 per QALY), dialysis for critically ill 60-year-old men with kidney injury (US$5590 per QALY), influenza vaccinations for the US population aged over 50 (US$8053/QALY), and aspirin for the prevention of CHD in 65-year-old women with moderate risk (US$16,122/QALY) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The post-discharge analysis also implies that the survival advantage associated with treatment quickly outweighs the quality-of-life decrements for treatment suggested by the EQ-5D data (see above). In particular, the nearly 2-fold higher mortality rate in the control group (9.7&#x000a0;%) compared to the treatment group (4.8&#x000a0;%), along with an assumed QALY weight of 0.6 implies an expected annual 4.7&#x000a0;% QALY gain for each subject in the treatment group. At that rate, the survival advantage outweighs the 90-day post-discharge quality-of-life decrement (0.003 QALYs) in just over one additional month beyond the 90-day post-discharge time period.</p><p>Although the use of randomized controlled trial data provides a robust basis for assessing the value conferred by nutritional supplements, the trial data had limitations for the purpose of assessing economic value. First, survival data were only available for 90&#x000a0;days&#x02019; post-discharge. Our current effort addressed the limited follow-up by using published survival estimates that account for baseline age and comorbidity. As noted, even without follow-up, our results suggest this specialized ONS is cost effective. Nonetheless, it would be useful to assess the extent to which the extrapolation we used is consistent with the trial population&#x02019;s experience. Future research may be needed to investigate effect of ONS on patients in other health-care facilities.</p><p>Second, there were limitations in the collection of health-care utilization data in the clinical trial. For example, for some subjects, the number of days spent at rehabilitation facilities was not clear or was missing. That uncertainty reflects lack of clarity regarding the nature of some visits &#x02013; in particular, whether the visits were inpatient stays or outpatient visits. Because there is no reason to believe that the intervention systematically influenced the introduction of this uncertainty, we do not believe that our conclusions have been substantively affected. Nonetheless, mitigating this source of uncertainty would improve future studies. In addition, we did not collect staff and care-giver time to provide assistance to promote consumption. However, subjects in the treatment group consumed similar number of servings per subject (94 servings) compared to subjects in the control group (96 servings) and therefore, we assumed costs of staff and care-giver time were also similar between two groups.</p><p>Third, we used mean estimates for quality-of-life (SF-36) and health-care utilization even though these outcomes did not in many cases differ statistically between the two trial groups. Setting aside the statistical significance criterion prevents this analysis from excluding information about differences between the two trial arms that are important but fail to meet the conventional <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 criterion that has been criticized because of its arbitrary nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In any case, restricting ourselves to costs and clinical benefits that differ statistically across the two trial arms (the increased survival duration of 3.5&#x000a0;days in the treatment group and the added US$283 cost of the nutritional supplement) yields a cost-effectiveness ratio of US$29,500 per life-year gained. That result is similar to and even somewhat more favorable than the base-case result we report.</p><p>Finally, the generalizability of our results is limited. The study only included patients with four medical conditions and was mainly based on the US health-care system. Findings therefore may not be directly applicable to other settings or countries. A number of factors, such as population characteristics and different payment systems, could influence relevance to other settings. Future research is needed to assess the cost effectiveness of this therapy in other countries.</p><p>Although up to 50&#x000a0;% of hospitalized patients are at risk of malnutrition, few patients received nutrition intervention during hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Data from a 11-year&#x000a0;retrospective&#x000a0;study reported ONS use was less than 2 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The Canadian Malnutrition Task Force cohort study also reported that only 7&#x000a0;% hospitalized patients received nutrition support during the first week of hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A recent survey of hospital clinicians found &#x0201c;opportunities to improve education around a nationally standardized approach to nutrition assessment, as well as the need for increasing clinician participation in the nutrition care process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]&#x0201d;. All current guidelines recommend use of ONS for patients who are at risk for malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The results of our study suggest an opportunity to improve the health and survival of these patients at a low marginal cost. Few interventions that have been studied achieve health gains less expensively, particularly in this population. A shift by payers, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, towards value-based purchasing may encourage health-care professionals and providers to further examine interventions that deliver cost-effective results.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Author contribution</title><p>YZ, JTC, and SG contributed to study conception and design, data analysis, drafting and revision of the article, and final approval of the article.
