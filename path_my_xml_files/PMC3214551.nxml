The drug was given over 15 min intravenously along with glycopyrrolate 0.004 mg/kg and tramadol 1.5 mg/kg, 30 min before induction of anesthesia.</p><p>In the operation theatre, after pre-oxygenation, anesthesia was induced with sleep dose of 2.5% thiopentone sodium followed by succinyl choline, 2 mg/kg to facilitate tracheal intubation. When there was no response to Train-of-Four on peripheral nerve stimulation, trachea was intubated with an appropriate sized cuffed, disposable endotracheal tube. Lungs were mechanically ventilated with O<sub>2</sub> - N<sub>2</sub>O (50-50), sevoflurane (1-2%), and vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg bolus followed by 1 mg intermittently for neuromuscular blockade. Tidal volume and ventilator frequency were adjusted to maintain normocapnia (EtCO<sub>2</sub> 40 &#x000b1; 4 mmHg). Pneumoperitoneum (PP) was created by insufflations of CO<sub>2</sub> and operation table was tilted to about 15&#x000b0; reversed trendelenberg. Intra-abdominal pressure was not allowed to exceed 15 mmHg. Throughout the study period, all the parameters selected (HR, SBP, DBP, MAP, and SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded at specified timings. Any change in hemodynamic variables more than 20% on either side of baseline was considered significant. Any increase in MAP up to 20% from baseline was treated by increasing the concentration of sevoflurane to a maximum 2%. Any increase in MAP more than 20% from baseline was treated with nitroglycerine infusion. Nitroglycerine infusion was adjusted to maintain the MAP within 20% of baseline. Time duration from creation of pneumoperitoneum to the release of pneumoperitoneum was taken as duration of pneumoperitoneum. At the end of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine 50 &#x003bc;g/kg and glycopyrrolate 10 &#x003bc;g/kg intravenously. After satisfying the extubation criteria, trachea was extubated and patients were transferred to post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). In PACU, HR, SBP, DBP, MAP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, sedation score, and any incidence of complications/adverse event were monitored for next 1 h. Maintenance of MAP and SpO<sub>2</sub> within 20% of baseline and sedation score &#x02264; 2 was considered criteria for recovery.</p><p>Sample size of minimum 29 per group was derived using Cohen's formula based on assumption of &#x003b1; error 0.05 and power of study 80% after permitting &#x003b2; error of 0.2 to detect a difference of at least 4 in the quantitative variables between the groups. Mean and standard deviation were calculated for all the quantitative variables using graph-pad prism statistical software.

The anesthetic technique for upper abdominal laparoscopic surgery is generally limited to general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade, tracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery leads to significant hemodynamic changes such as an increase in MAP and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and a decrease in cardiac output. The decline in cardiac output and venous return can be attenuated by volume infusion before pneumoperitoneum. However, an increase in MAP and SVR requires therapeutic intervention. Techniques like reduction in intra-abdominal pressure during pneumoperitoneum and gasless laparoscopy using abdominal elevators have been tried to counteract these detrimental effects of pneumoperitoneum.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Pharmacological agents like &#x003b2;-blocker, opioids, increasing concentration of inhalational anaesthetic agents, nitroglycerine, and &#x003b1;-2 adrenergic agonist have been used to minimize these hemodynamic derangements during laparoscopy with varied results.</p><p>Clonidine, a selective &#x003b1;-2 adrenergic agonist, has desirable actions like anxiolysis, sedation, analgesia, antiemesis, and prevention of shivering. It is a potent hypotensive agent. Clonidine inhibits catecholamine and vasopressin-mediated increase in SVR caused by pneumoperitoneum.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Studies using oral clonidine (150 &#x003bc;g) administered 60 to 90 min before induction of anesthesia have shown promising results in minimizing the hemodynamic changes during laparoscopic surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Although the bioavailability of clonidine after oral administration is over 90%, it requires 2 to 4 h to develop its peak effect necessitating its ingestion at least 2 h prior to induction to have clinically desirable actions. As intravenous clonidine has an onset of action within 15 min (with a peak at 30 min), its administration half an hour before induction of anesthesia is a better option. Numerous studies using intravenous clonidine found effective prevention of hemodynamic derangements during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 3 &#x003bc;g/kg[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and 8 &#x003bc;g/kg[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] of intravenous clonidine used as premedication effectively attenuated hemodynamic changes during laparoscopic cholecystectomy without any side effects. A study using 4.5 &#x003bc;g/kg of clonidine intramuscularly[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] found a significant decrease in MAP and HR during pneumoperitoneum. These studies demonstrated significantly less analgesic requirement when clonidine was used as premedication. Clonidine thus is a desirable premedication for laparoscopic surgery.</p><p>Though, various studies found intravenous clonidine effective in attenuating the hemodynamic changes during laparoscopic surgery, there is wide difference in the dose of clonidine used. Joris <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] used 8 &#x003bc;g/kg of clonidine intravenously and surprising reported stable intraoperative hemodynamic. They did not find any adverse effect in perioperative period, though they felt the need of further research to determine the ideal dose of clonidine required. This study was planned with the objective of determining the minimum safe and effective dose of intravenous clonidine as premedication in laparoscopic surgery by comparing effects of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg and 2 &#x003bc;g/kg doses.</p><p>This was essential to exclude hemodynamic variation due to hypercapnia. Diamante <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] reported a 35% decrease in cardiac output in dogs with a raised intra-abdominal pressure of 40 mmHg. Ishizaki <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] observed a significant fall in cardiac output at 16 mmHg intra-abdominal pressure, but hemodynamic alteration was not observed at 12 mmHg intra-abdominal pressure. In two studies, ejection fraction of left ventricle was assessed using trans-esophageal echocardiography during pneumoperitoneum and no significant change in ejection fraction was reported up to 15 mmHg intra-abdominal pressure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Based on these observations, the current recommendation is to monitor intra-abdominal pressure and to keep it as low as possible. Intra-abdominal pressure was kept below 15 mmHg in this study.</p><p>Following pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide, ventilation was adjusted to maintain normocapnia. In spite of maintaining normocapnia and the intra-abdominal pressure below 15 mmHg, a significant rise in HR, SBP, DBP, and MAP was observed in group I. Fourteen patients in group I had a rise in MAP more than 20% from base line and required nitroglycerine infusion. Pneumoperitoneum produces significant hemodynamic derangements which may be detrimental and needs to be prevented, especially in high risk hemodynamically compromised patients. In this study, 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of clonidine could achieve hemodynamic stability during pneumoperitoneum but hemodynamic response to intubation and extubation could not be prevented, though the magnitude of this stress response was less as compared to group I. With 2 &#x003bc;g/kg of intravenous clonidine, hemodynamic stress response of pneumoperitoneum as well as of tracheal intubation and extubation was effectively prevented.</p><p>A decrease in sympathetic tone by central action and pre-synaptically mediated inhibition of norepinephrine and vagomimetic action at nucleus tractus solitarius by clonidine is responsible for bradycardia. Bradycardia was however not observed in both the treatments groups in this study. Many studies reported significant reduction in HR, SBP, DBP, and MAP during laparoscopic surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] We have not compared the results of this study with that of these studies because of wide differences in the doses used.</p><p>The sedation score was comparatively higher in group III, but it never approached 2 in any patient and no sign of respiratory depression was noted. A comparatively higher sedation score in group III can be viewed as an advantage as all the patients were sleeping comfortably. Monitoring depth of anesthesia using a bispectral index monitor could have been an additional tool to assess the efficacy of clonidine as a supplement to general anesthesia but it was not used in this study due to non-availability. The mean sedation score in both the treatment groups was less than 1 at 1 h post-operative which proved that these doses of clonidine did not prolong recovery.</p><p>Ten per cent patients in group I experienced shivering against none in other two groups. This finding corroborates the finding of Nicolaou <italic>et al</italic> who stated that clonidine could be used as an effective perioperative anti-shivering agent as it inhibits the cold thermoregulatory response due to an effect on central integration control and output from the thermoregulatory center.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Clonidine increases gastrointestinal motility by decreasing sympathetic and increasing parasympathetic outflow from the central nervous system, thus reduces incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] We found a statistically significant decrease in the incidences of postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to the control group in our study.</p><p>In conclusion, significant hemodynamic derangements during pneumoperitoneum of laparoscopic surgery can be effectively attenuated by premedication with 1 &#x003bc;g and 2 &#x003bc;g/kg of intravenous clonidine. We recommend the use of clonidine 2 &#x003bc;g/kg intravenously, 30 min before induction of anesthesia to attenuate the hemodynamic stress response of pneumoperitoneum and tracheal intubation/extubation in otherwise healthy patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by Sir Takhtasinhji Hospital, Government Medical College, Bhavnagar, Gujarat, India.
