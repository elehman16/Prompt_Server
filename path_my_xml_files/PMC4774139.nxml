While OME usually resolves spontaneously, it can affect speech, behaviour and development. Children with persistent hearing loss associated with OME are usually offered hearing aids or insertion of ventilation tubes through the tympanic membrane. Oral steroids may be a safe and effective treatment for OME, which could be delivered in primary care. Treatment with oral steroids has the potential to benefit large numbers of children and reduce the burden of care on them and on health services. However, previous trials have either been too small with too short a follow-up period, or of too poor quality to give a definite answer.</p><p>The aim of the Oral Steroids for the Resolution of Otitis Media with Effusion in Children (OSTRICH) trial is to determine if a short course of oral steroids improves the hearing of children with OME in the short and longer term.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A total of 380 participants (children of 2 to 8&#x000a0;years of age) are recruited from Hospital Ear, Nose and Throat departments in Wales and England. A trained clinician seeks informed consent from parents of children with symptoms for at least 3&#x000a0;months that are attributable to OME and with confirmed bilateral hearing loss at study entry. Participants are randomised to a course of oral steroid or a matched placebo for 1&#x000a0;week. Outcomes include audiometry, tympanometry and otoscopy assessments; symptoms; adverse effects; functional health status; quality of life; resource use; and cost effectiveness. Participants are followed up at 5&#x000a0;weeks, and at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after the day of randomisation. The primary outcome is audiometry-confirmed satisfactory hearing at 5&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>An important evidence gap exists regarding the clinical and cost effectiveness of short courses of oral steroid treatment for OME. Identifying an effective, safe, nonsurgical intervention for OME in children for use in primary care would be of great benefit to children, their families and the NHS.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN49798431">ISRCTN49798431</ext-link> (Registered 7 December 2012)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Oral steroids</kwd><kwd>Otitis media with effusion</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>Hearing</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000664</institution-id><institution>Health Technology Assessment Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the most common cause of hearing loss in children in the United Kingdom, and up to 80&#x000a0;% of children are affected by OME by 4&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Overall, the prognosis for OME is good, with more than 50&#x000a0;% of OME episodes resolving spontaneously within 3&#x000a0;months and 95&#x000a0;% within 1&#x000a0;year. However, 30 to 40&#x000a0;% of children have recurrent OME episodes, and 5&#x000a0;% of preschool children (under 5&#x000a0;years of age) have persistent (longer than 3&#x000a0;months) bilateral hearing loss associated with OME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Hearing loss from OME can have an important impact on children&#x02019;s mood, communication, concentration, learning, socialisation and language development. This may affect other family members and family function. OME in early childhood can affect IQ, behaviour and reading into teenage years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline (2008) for OME management recommends a &#x02018;watchful waiting&#x02019; period of 3&#x000a0;months, with referral to an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) department if hearing is significantly affected, OME persists for longer than 3&#x000a0;months, or if there is suspected language or developmental delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Treatment options for these children are limited to hearing aids or surgical insertion of ventilation tubes (grommets) through the tympanic membrane. Hearing aids are an effective treatment, but this intervention is not problem-free; children often find them uncomfortable, may feel self-conscious and may become a target for bullying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Although the diagnosis of OME in primary care has increased over the last decade, the number of grommet operations performed in England fell from 43,300 in 1994 to 1995 to 25,442 in 2009 to 2010, primarily as a result of the &#x02018;watchful waiting&#x02019; strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, OME remains the most common reason for childhood surgery in the UK and comprises a considerable workload for hospital ENT departments. Furthermore, a wide variation exists in the rate of grommet surgery among regions, which is unlikely to be explained by variation in the disease. In Wales, a six-fold variation exists in the European age-standardised rates of grommet surgery between the highest and the lowest local authorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Both hearing aids and surgery require referral to secondary care, with major cost consequences. The Department of Health commissioned &#x02018;McKinsey&#x02019; report states that the National Health Service (NHS) could save &#x000a3;21 million per year by reducing grommet insertion by a further 90&#x000a0;%, a procedure that they assessed as being &#x02018;relatively ineffective&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This position has been challenged. Deafness Research UK and the 2009 ENT UK Position Paper conclude that reducing access to grommets will disadvantage thousands of children who have a genuine need of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Antibiotics, topical intranasal steroids, decongestants, antihistamines and mucolytics are all ineffective treatments for OME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A rigorous evaluation of anti-inflammatory treatment for OME has been a priority for many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Cochrane systematic reviews have found insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of both oral steroids and autoinflation (AI) devices in resolving OME in children to recommend implementation but sufficient evidence to recommend further research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>A recent trial of an AI device in children with OME and 4 to 11&#x000a0;years of age found a modest effect for some children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, 80&#x000a0;% of children are affected by OME before the age of 4&#x000a0;years at the time when language development is most rapid, and hearing loss has its greatest effect on language development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, alternatives to hearing aids or surgery for children less than 4&#x000a0;years of age (who are unable to use an AI device) are required.</p><p>Williamson et al. (2009) evaluated topical intranasal steroids for children with OME in general practice and found they are unlikely to be clinically effective for OME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Topical steroids applied through the nose would not be expected to reach the middle ear. However, systemic steroids do reach the middle ear epithelium and modulate OME in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The evidence from in vitro and animal models suggests that steroids reduce effusions and middle ear pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Various mechanisms have been proposed for a role for steroids in resolving middle ear effusions, including (a) reducing arachidonic acid and associated inflammatory mediators, (b) shrinking peri-eustachian tube lymphoid tissue, (c) enhancing secretion of eustachian tube surfactant with a resultant improvement in tubal function, and (d) reducing middle ear fluid viscosity by its action on mucoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The latest update of the Cochrane review on oral or topical steroids for OME (last search August 2010) found no benefit from intranasal steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the review did identify evidence of a statistically significant benefit from oral steroids plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone for OME (5 studies, 409 participants, 23&#x000a0;% in the intervention group and 47&#x000a0;% in the control group with persistent OME at follow-up), and a trend towards a significant benefit for oral steroids versus placebo in the short term (3 studies, 108 participants). Oral antibiotics alone are not effective. The only study to assess the effect of oral steroids on hearing as an outcome was underpowered.</p><p>Studies included in the systematic review were short-term, underpowered, often poorly described inclusion criteria and/or did not assess hearing at the time of inclusion, used ears rather than children as the unit of analysis, and used intermediate outcome measures, such as tympanometry results, rather than improved hearing. No cost effectiveness studies of oral steroids for OME were found. Therefore, insufficient evidence exists to recommend oral steroids as a treatment for persistent OME because of inadequate evidence about short-term effect on hearing and cost-effectiveness, and absence of evidence about longer-term effects.</p><p>No significant adverse effects of steroids were reported by the studies included in the Cochrane review. However, the number of participants was too small to rule out that possibility. Short courses of prednisolone are widely used in treating children with acute asthma, and adverse events are extremely rare; when they do occur, they are largely limited to behavioural disturbances and dyspepsia and resolve on withdrawal of the steroid drug. The safety of multiple short courses of oral steroid therapy has been evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Short courses of oral steroids such as prednisolone do not have lasting negative effects on bone metabolism, bone density, adrenal gland function or weight or height, even if used on several occasions over the course of a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>An important evidence gap exists regarding the clinical and cost effectiveness of short courses of oral steroid treatment for OME. Identifying an effective, safe, cost-effective, acceptable non-surgical intervention for OME in children (including those in the first 4&#x000a0;years of life) for use in primary care remains an important research priority.</p><p>The OSTRICH trial aims to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of a 7-day course of oral prednisolone (steroid) on improving hearing over the short term in children with bilateral OME, as diagnosed at an ENT outpatient or Paediatric Audiology/Audiovestibular Medicine (AVM) clinic, who have had symptoms attributable to OME present for at least 3&#x000a0;months and current significant hearing loss (demonstrated by audiometry).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of the OSTRICH trial is to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of a 7-day course of oral steroid on improving hearing at 5&#x000a0;weeks from randomisation in children with bilateral OME, who have had symptoms attributable to OME present for at least 3&#x000a0;months and have current significant hearing loss (demonstrated by audiometry). Oral steroids are likely to have their effect within the first few weeks, and most of the existing evidence is for an effect at 4 to 6&#x000a0;weeks. This is, therefore, the time point at which the maximum effect is expected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>OSTRICH is a double-blind, individually randomised, placebo-controlled trial involving children with persistent OME and significant hearing loss.

The randomisation schedule prepared by the Trial Statistician (TS) comprises random permuted blocks that are stratified by site and child&#x02019;s age. The IMP Manufacturer (Piramal Healthcare UK Limited) was provided with a list of random allocation numbers linking to either the steroid or placebo. Whether the allocations relate to the steroid or placebo was determined by an independent statistician to ensure the TS remains blinded. The allocation numbers are used to label the trial medication packs. Each trial medication pack has a unique identification number (Trial Pack number).</p><p>As children are recruited, they are assigned the next vacant Participant Identification number (PID). Trial medication packs are only released once informed consent has been obtained and a consent form signed. Participants are randomised to receive either the steroid or the matching placebo by receiving the next sequentially numbered Trial Pack allocated to the participant by the site Pharmacy. A designated member of the OSTRICH trial site team (where possible) or the participant&#x02019;s parent/legal guardian collects the pack from Pharmacy on behalf of the participant. Participant randomisation is considered to have occurred once a consent form is signed and the Trial Pack opened. The Trial Pack number is then entered onto the participant&#x02019;s case report form (CRF).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Blinding</title><p>Participants, parent/legal guardians, clinic staff and members of the OSTRICH trial team remain blind to treatment allocation.

In the event that telephone contact is not successful, visit reminder letters are sent to rearrange the appointment.</p><p>If parents/legal guardians are unable or unwilling to attend a follow-up appointment, they are asked if they are willing to complete the questionnaire booklet that would be sent to them in the post. A freepost self-addressed envelope is provided for parents to return their diary, unused medication and/or questionnaire booklet. Alternatively, they will be given the option of answering a brief questionnaire over the telephone, comprising questions extracted from the diary regarding symptoms (for the 5-week follow-up, if not completing/returning the diary) and quality of life (if not completing and returning a questionnaire booklet).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="Sec26"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculation is based on demonstrating a change in the rate of resolution of hearing loss at 5&#x000a0;weeks post randomisation (4&#x000a0;weeks post completion of treatment) from 20&#x000a0;% in the control group to 35&#x000a0;% in the intervention group. OME resolves spontaneously in a high proportion of children, and some studies have found a significantly higher rate of spontaneous resolution. For example, Williamson et al. found a resolution rate in their control group of 47&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, we anticipate a lower spontaneous rate of resolution because we will only include children who have been symptomatic for at least 3&#x000a0;months and are recruiting children in a secondary care setting, where a more severe spectrum of illness can be anticipated. The Cochrane review of steroids for OME reported a ratio of proportions for resolution of OME at 2&#x000a0;weeks of 3.80 (95&#x000a0;% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.93 to 15.52). In the five studies in the Cochrane review of oral steroids versus placebo, overall there was a 23&#x000a0;% recovery rate in the placebo plus antibiotic group and a 47&#x000a0;% recovery rate in the oral steroid plus antibiotic group, which represents a 24&#x000a0;% difference (antibiotics on their own are ineffective) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We have selected a conservative estimate of 1.75 for our effect size (ratio of proportions) because we believe that a 15&#x000a0;% absolute increase in the rate of resolution at 5&#x000a0;weeks would represent a clinically meaningful benefit that could result in a meaningful reduction in unnecessary operations and a related saving in cost for the NHS. In order to demonstrate a difference between 20&#x000a0;% and 35&#x000a0;% with an alpha of 0.05 and 80&#x000a0;% power, we will need 302 participants (nQuery software version 4.0). We will recruit 380 to allow for a 20&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up at 1&#x000a0;year. Although our primary outcome data will be gathered at 5&#x000a0;weeks, we believe that it is important to be able to assess long-term outcomes and, therefore, want to ensure that we will have sufficient power for longer term follow-up assessments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary analyses will be intention to treat and will employ a logistic regression model to investigate differences in the proportion of children with acceptable hearing at the 5&#x000a0;weeks post randomisation follow-up appointment between the two treatment arms, adjusting for site. Comparisons will be presented as the absolute difference in proportions and the adjusted odds ratio, with 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval and <italic>P</italic> value.</p><p>Secondary outcomes with a binary outcome (present/absent), such as satisfactory hearing and presence of effusion, will employ repeated measures logistic regression to investigate differences between the trial arms and over time (5&#x000a0;weeks and 6-month and 12-month follow-ups). Changes in hearing over time will also be analysed to identify children who show early resolution but then relapse. For continuous secondary outcomes, such as PedsQL, and OM8-30 scores, repeated measures linear regression models (using transformations as necessary) will be used to investigate differences between the trial arms and over time (5&#x000a0;weeks, 6&#x000a0;months and 12&#x000a0;months) adjusting for baseline. The duration between the start and the resolution of the symptoms will be calculated and the median (interquartile range) for each randomised group will be presented. A Cox regression model will be used to test whether time to resolution differs between the randomised groups.</p><p>A number of outcomes will be calculated from the parents&#x02019; diary for the first 5&#x000a0;weeks, such as total time off school/nursery and work (days) and the number of healthcare consultations. These will be analysed using Poisson regression to investigate differences between the two trial arms.</p><p>Previous researchers have mapped OM8-30 scores to utility values on the HUI-3 scale. As this trial measures both OM8-30 and HUI-3, it provides the opportunity to evaluate the generalisability of the existing mapping. This will be done by correlating the mapped utility values on the HUI-3 scale (obtained via the mapping formula from the OM8-30 facet scores) with the newly acquired HUI-3 scores.</p><p>Possible confounders such as the child&#x02019;s age and history of atopy and relevant interaction terms will be entered into the primary regression analyses for each of the outcomes in order to conduct pre-specified subgroup analyses. These subgroups will be defined in advance of any analysis based on the best available evidence. Since the trial is powered to detect overall differences between the groups rather than interactions of this kind, the results of these exploratory analyses will be presented using confidence intervals as well as <italic>P</italic> values. No interim analyses are planned.</p><p>Full description of the methods to be used will be stated in a trial statistical analysis plan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Economic analysis/cost effectiveness analysis</title><p>The cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from the perspective of the UK NHS and Personal Social Services and also will consider a broader partial societal perspective, encompassing impacts on patients and their families. The cost-effectiveness component will have two time durations: a within-trial assessment and a longer term time horizon based on decision-analytic modelling and populated from parameter estimates derived from the trial and from information from literature sources relating to long-term effects of hearing difficulties in children. These time periods offer a longer duration than previous studies and will be used, alongside other sources, to arrive at more meaningful estimates of cost-effectiveness.</p><p>The costs of the course of oral steroids will be calculated and combined with differences in costs between intervention and control groups to determine overall costs associated with the intervention. The resource utilisation of both groups (consultations, medications, operations, equipment, etcetera) and treatments associated with adverse events, will be assessed through the completion of self-completed questionnaires at baseline, at 5&#x000a0;weeks, 6&#x000a0;months and 12&#x000a0;months and translated into costs using appropriate published unit costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The difference in overall costs between groups will be compared with differences in outcomes, as specified above, and including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). QALYs will be computed from PedsQL and HUI 3 and from utilities derived from mapping responses to the OM8-30 questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>A series of one-way sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the impact of parameter variation on baseline estimates of the cost-effectiveness ratios and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis undertaken to determine the extent to which the intervention can be regarded as representing value for money.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Ethical and governance approval</title><p>This trial protocol was reviewed and approved by Wales Research Ethics Committee (REC) 3, which is recognised by the United Kingdom Ethics Committee Authority (UKECA).

Some clinicians already prescribe oral steroids for OME with others opposed to such practice. The analysis proposed by OSTRICH will generate much needed evidence that will greater inform clinicians and will dispel the strongly opposing views about the use of oral steroids for the treatment of OME.</p><p>If shown to be effective, the use of oral steroids for OME could benefit children and provide the option of primary care treatment as opposed to costly secondary care.</p><p>The economic analysis will assess the cost of any benefits achieved through the use of oral steroids for the resolution of OME in children. In addition to direct costs, this will include any savings (or additional costs) that result from prescribing the oral steroid. For example, costs for the NHS may be lowered if the number of grommet operations that are needed is reduced. This will provide additional important information to healthcare providers and funders to aid them in making the most efficient use of their finite resources.</p><p>Conversely, if shown not to be clinically effective, then that information will provide evidence to change practice where they are currently being used, and research efforts could focus on developing alternative pathways for improving the management of OME in children.</p><p>The OSTRICH trial will address the important evidence gap regarding clinical and cost effectiveness of short courses of oral steroid treatment for OME. Identifying an effective, safe, cost-effective, acceptable non-surgical intervention for OME in children (including those in the first 4&#x000a0;years of life) for use in primary care remains an important research priority and would be of great benefit to children, their families and the NHS.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>A&#x00026;E</term><def><p>accident and emergency</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AI</term><def><p>autoinflation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AVM</term><def><p>audiovestibular medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTIMP</term><def><p>Clinical Trial of Investigational Medicinal Product</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>dBHL</term><def><p>decibels hearing level</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ENT</term><def><p>ear, nose and throat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>good clinical practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>general practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HUI3</term><def><p>Health Utilities Index Mark 3</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMP</term><def><p>Investigational Medicinal Product</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KH</term><def><p>kilohertz</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p>National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICE</term><def><p>National Institute for Clinical Excellence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIHR HTA</term><def><p>National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OME</term><def><p>otitis media with effusion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OM8-30</term><def><p>Otitis Media with Effusion Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEDS-QL</term><def><p>Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PID</term><def><p>patient identification number</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PIS</term><def><p>patient information sheet</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTA</term><def><p>pure tone audiometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>quality-adjusted life years</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>REC</term><def><p>research ethics committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEWTU</term><def><p>South East Wales Trials Unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TS</term><def><p>trial statistician</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VRA</term><def><p>visual reinforcement assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UKECA</term><def><p>United Kingdom Ethics Committee Authority</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Christopher C Butler and Nicholas Francis are joint last authors.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>CCB and NF are co-Chief Investigators of this trial.
