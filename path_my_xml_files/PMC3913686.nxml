Infant CMV acquisition did not differ between study arms, with 46/70 infants (66%) in placebo arm and 47/71 infants (66%) in the valacyclovir arm acquiring CMV; median time to CMV detection did not differ. CMV DNA was detected in 92% of 542 breast milk specimens with no difference in CMV level between study arms.

Valacyclovir is often used to suppress genital herpes simplex type-2 (HSV-2) infection during pregnancy, and acyclovir has been used successfully at high doses to reduce CMV reactivation in transplant recipients <xref rid="pone.0087855-Winston1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>; in HIV-1-infected adults, prophylaxis with high-dose valacyclovir resulted in a 33% risk reduction of CMV disease compared to acyclovir <xref rid="pone.0087855-Feinberg1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087855-Emery1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We hypothesized that maternal valacyclovir could reduce CMV transmission by reducing maternal CMV replication both antenatally to prevent <italic>in utero</italic> transmission, and postnatally by reducing breast milk CMV. We further hypothesized that small reductions in maternal CMV replication, as expected with this low dose of valacyclovir, could delay infant acquisition, an important consideration since infants acquire CMV at very young ages. Our final hypothesis was that valacyclovir converts to acyclovir and is present in breast milk in low levels, and might therefore prophylax the infant. Our aims were to measure the impact of maternal valacyclovir on maternal CMV levels, especially in breast milk, and on the rate of infant CMV acquisition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All participants provided written informed consent; mothers provided written consent for both themselves and their child; the study was approved by ethical review committees at the University of Washington and Kenyatta National Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study was a secondary aim of a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (RCT) evaluating the effect of valacyclovir prophylaxis (500 mg twice daily versus placebo) on maternal HIV-1 RNA levels; the study design, methods and main findings have been published (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> NCT00530777) <xref rid="pone.0087855-Drake1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

Infants received standard care and immunizations, and were tested for HIV DNA at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year, with additional testing of earlier samples if HIV was detected. Women were counseled to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months, and received prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 (PMTCT) prophylaxis according to contemporaneous Kenyan guidelines (maternal zidovudine from 28 weeks, maternal and infant single-dose nevirapine, and 6 weeks of infant zidovudine prophylaxis).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Laboratory Methods</title><p>For maternal blood, breast milk, and cervical specimens, DNA was extracted from 200 &#x000b5;l of maternal plasma, breast milk supernatant or cervical fluid extract using the Qiagen UltraSens kit (Qiagen, California).

Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the CMV glycoprotein B gene <xref rid="pone.0087855-Atkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. CMV levels in plasma, breast milk and cervical fluid were reported as DNA copies/ml with a lower limit of detection (LLD) of 100 copies/ml. CMV levels in cervical fluid were adjusted for a concentration factor at extraction, ensuring comparability.

Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to compare proportions, and the independent T test or Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare means between groups. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) with robust standard errors and exchangeable correlation matrix were used to measure the change in cervical CMV over time; the binomial link function was used to analyze cervical CMV DNA detection as a dichotomized outcome and a linear model with Gaussian distribution was used to analyze CMV level as a continuous outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient Characteristics</title><p>From the trial, 147 women consented to CMV testing; a total of 141 infants underwent CMV testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087855-g001">

To our knowledge, this is the first RCT evaluating the effect of maternal antiviral prophylaxis to prevent CMV transmission to children. Including these secondary endpoints into an ongoing RCT enabled rapid evaluation of the potential benefit of an affordable, well-tolerated drug at doses routinely used in pregnancy, and allowed us to evaluate this intervention in a population of HIV-1-exposed infants in Kenya who are vulnerable to early CMV infection.</p><p>Detection of early CMV infection in 7% of infants by 2 weeks of age confirms high prevalence of early infant acquisition of CMV found in an earlier cohort studied in Kenya, where 6% of HIV-1-seronegative infants born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers had CMV detected at birth and 20% detected by one month <xref rid="pone.0087855-Slyker1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Lower prevalences of early infant CMV have been observed among HIV-1-seropositive mothers who start triple antiretroviral therapy before or during pregnancy: 3.6% of infants born to HIV-1 infected mothers had CMV detected at birth in a US cohort <xref rid="pone.0087855-Frederick1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and 1.2% of similar infants had CMV detected at birth in the French ANRS cohort <xref rid="pone.0087855-Guibert1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This high prevalence of early infant CMV infection in our cohort, where women received zidovudine monotherapy and perinatal nevirapine, suggests that HIV-exposed infants are at risk of early acquisition of CMV due to maternal factors such as immunosuppression. In this cohort, mothers had T cell counts &#x0003e;250 cells/&#x000b5;l but had only a few months of exposure to zidovudine at delivery. One mechanism to explain the high prevalence of infant CMV may be the observation that HIV-1 infected mothers may transfer less protective antibody to their infants perinatally <xref rid="pone.0087855-Glennie1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Valacyclovir treatment was previously shown in this cohort to reduce maternal HIV-1 RNA levels by &#x0223c;0.5 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml in plasma and breast milk <xref rid="pone.0087855-Drake1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Previous studies report correlations between CMV and HIV-1 levels in plasma and breast milk <xref rid="pone.0087855-Slyker1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087855-Gantt1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. HIV-induced immunosuppression impairs CMV containment, and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated bi-directional cellular interactions between the two viruses that reciprocally enable infectivity and replication <xref rid="pone.0087855-Griffiths1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In light of this synergy, reductions in breast milk CMV DNA secondary to HIV-1 RNA reduction were expected, but were not observed.</p><p>The dose of valacyclovir was inadequate to impact breast milk CMV DNA levels, even though valacyclovir penetrates the breast compartment. Prophylaxis studies against CMV disease in organ transplant patients have used much higher doses of acyclovir (1.5&#x02013;8 g/day) <xref rid="pone.0087855-Winston1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087855-Kalil1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> with significant effect. A pilot study reported using 8 g of valacyclovir in pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0087855-Jacquemard1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> to treat mothers of fetuses with congenital CMV infection. Controlled trials in pregnancy or breastfeeding with acyclovir or novel antivirals have not been conducted. Despite the limitations of 500 mg twice-daily dosing of valacyclovir in preventing CMV reactivation, our hypothesis was that our more realistic goal of small reductions in the high CMV load in breast milk would translate into delays in infant acquisition. These delays may be significant: in newborn infants living in areas of high infant mortality, delaying CMV acquisition by even 2&#x02013;4 weeks could translate into morbidity and mortality benefits. Our trial results, however, showed conclusively that this dose of valacyclovir did not benefit HIV-1 exposed infants.</p><p>We found a modest effect of valacyclovir on maternal cervical CMV shedding. In a prior study in the Gambia, maternal genital shedding of CMV was associated with both congenital and early infant infections <xref rid="pone.0087855-Kaye1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Few studies have examined effects of antiviral therapy on CMV levels in the genital tract; an RCT in HIV-1-infected men found no effect of 500 mg twice daily valacyclovir on semen CMV levels <xref rid="pone.0087855-Zuckerman1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In our placebo arm, cervical CMV shedding increased between 34 and 38 weeks, consistent with reports of increased shedding during late pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0087855-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, but this increase was attenuated in the valacyclovir arm. CMV shedding has been observed to increase during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and is associated with progesterone and estradiol levels <xref rid="pone.0087855-Mostad1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, suggesting hormonal cervical changes may be determinants of local CMV replication. The genital tract was the only compartment where we saw a difference in CMV shedding, which may be due to valacyclovir&#x02019;s penetration to cervical and vaginal tissues.</p><p>Strengths of this study include its prospective randomized design and robust power to detect differences in infant acquisition and breast milk CMV levels. Women had high adherence to the study protocol, verified by valacyclovir detection in breast milk <xref rid="pone.0087855-Drake2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and HIV-1 suppression. Because no infant blood was obtained, we were unable to confirm CMV infection using serology, and we may underestimate the true number of infant infections, particularly those with low-level or short-duration viremia. Additionally, comparison of plasma and DBS specimens demonstrates lower sensitivity of DBS with low CMV levels (Atkinson, in preparation). However, even if some infant CMV infections were missed, the 93 transmission events observed were adequate to detect a significant impact on CMV transmission, and our randomized design preserves our ability to discern effects even with possible underascertainment. We are unable to comment on the effects of valacyclovir on HIV-1-seronegative women or HSV-2- seronegative coinfected women and their infants.</p><p>In conclusion, maternal valacyclovir had a modest impact on cervical CMV shedding in late pregnancy, but did not affect infant CMV acquisition or breast milk CMV levels. Early CMV infection may be one of a series of concurrent infections that adversely affect infant health, growth and survival in developing countries, especially among HIV-1-exposed infants. Maternal antiretroviral therapy has reduced infant CMV infection among HIV-1-exposed infants in developed countries, but may not be as effective in developing countries, where most CMV acquisition occurs in the first year of life, and where breastfeeding continues to be recommended for infants of HIV-1-seropositive mothers. Maternal antiviral prophylaxis with higher doses of valacyclovir or novel antiviral agents to prevent or delay infant CMV acquisition in the early postnatal period may warrant further study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0087855.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0087855.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0087855.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0087855.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was presented as a poster abstract G16 at <italic>CMV 2012</italic>, San Francisco, California, October 29-November 2, 2012.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0087855-Gompels1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
