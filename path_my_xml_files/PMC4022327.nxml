However, no specific recommendation is related to the reporting of conflicts of interest (CoI). The objective was to compare physicians&#x02019; confidence in the conclusions of abstracts of randomized controlled trials of pharmaceutical treatment indexed in PubMed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We planned a three-arm parallel-group randomized trial. French general practitioners (GPs) were invited to participate and were blinded to the study&#x02019;s aim. We used a representative sample of 75 abstracts of pharmaceutical industry-funded randomized controlled trials published in 2010 and indexed in PubMed. Each abstract was standardized and reported in three formats: 1) no mention of the funding source or CoI; 2) reporting the funding source only; and 3) reporting the funding source and CoI. GPs were randomized according to a computerized randomization on a secure Internet system at a 1:1:1 ratio to assess one abstract among the three formats. The primary outcome was GPs&#x02019; confidence in the abstract conclusions (0, not at all, to 10, completely confident). The study was planned to detect a large difference with an effect size of 0.5.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Between October 2012 and June 2013, among 605 GPs contacted, 354 were randomized, 118 for each type of abstract.

Several empirical studies showed that pharmaceutical industry-funded trials more often report positive conclusions than do non-industry&#x02013;funded trials
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Internal industry documents, which have become public because of litigation, have revealed how industry trials selectively report favorable results and modify the interpretation of results to favor their drug
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Similarly, the financial relationship among industry, scientific investigators and academic institutions can affect the presentation and interpretation of clinical trial results
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>To deal with these issues, some initiatives have aimed to increase transparency in medical research. The American Medical Association encourages physicians to regularly update all their financial and CoI disclosures required by employers, advisory bodies and entities funding research. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals or medical supplies to report annually certain payments or other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. The manufacturers&#x02019; reports will be available on a public searchable website
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) recommends that all authors who submit a manuscript complete the ICMJE Uniform Disclosure Form for Potential Conflicts of Interest
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Finally, the CONSORT Statement for abstracts recommends reporting the funding source in the abstract of randomized trials and in the full-text articles
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, despite these recommendations, the funding source and CoI are frequently inadequately reported
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. For example, despite the CONSORT Statement for abstracts, the funding source is reported in less than 20% of abstracts for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in high-impact-factor journals
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and author CoI are usually not reported in abstracts for RCTs.</p><p>The reporting of the trial funding source and the authors&#x02019; financial CoI could affect readers&#x02019; interpretations. Some studies showed that disclosure of the funding source or authors&#x02019; financial CoI in abstracts can lead readers to discount the results of a trial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Recently, Kesselheim and colleagues showed that the reporting of industry funding in abstracts negatively affected readers&#x02019; interpretations independent of the trial&#x02019;s quality
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, most of these studies involved a small number of abstracts representing hypothetical scenarios of clinical trials evaluating a new drug
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, these studies did not compare the effect of reporting both the trial funding source and the authors&#x02019; financial CoI.</p><p>We aimed to compare the confidence of primary-care physicians in the conclusions of a large representative sample of abstracts for RCTs of pharmaceutical treatment indexed in PubMed reported with or without mention of the funding source and/or authors&#x02019; financial CoI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>We planned a three-arm parallel-group RCT with a sample of representative abstracts of RCTs of pharmaceutical treatment indexed in PubMed, each reported with 1) no mention of the funding source or authors&#x02019; financial CoI, 2) the funding source only or 3) the funding source and CoI.</p><p>We obtained ethics approval from the Institutional Review Board of Paris Descartes University, Paris, France (no. 2012-A00032-41), and the protocol is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (

The search strategy is detailed in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. One researcher screened all retrieved citations on the title, abstract and the full text when necessary. The eligibility criteria were an industry-funded RCT with at least one author having a financial CoI, testing superiority, assessing pharmaceutical treatment (drugs) prescribed in a primary-care setting (defined as drugs that may be prescribed by a general practitioner (GP) or prescribed for diseases managed jointly by a specialist and a GP), with a conclusion in favor of the beneficial effect of the experimental treatment.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were investigation of nonpharmaceutical treatments (that is, medical devices, patient education), equivalence or noninferiority trials, safety trials, trials assessing different pharmacological procedures, and abstracts reporting a negative or neutral conclusion. One researcher (CB), who is an assistant professor in primary care, screened all retrieved abstracts and selected abstracts following these inclusion criteria. In cases of doubt regarding the inclusion of an abstract, a second researcher (IB) evaluated the abstract to achieve consensus.</p><p>From the selected reports, the reviewer systematically extracted the industry funding source and all authors&#x02019; financial CoI. If these data were not reported in the abstract or full-text article, the abstract was excluded.</p><p>Of the 2,797 citations screened, reports of 75 RCTs were selected [see Additional files
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>]. In 29 reports (37%), all authors had financial CoI. In 62 (81%), more than 50% of the authors had financial CoI. In 58 (77%), authors who had financial CoI were industry employees and were the first, second or last author in 34 (45%) reports.</p></sec><sec><title>Abstract construction</title><p>The abstracts for all selected RCTs were standardized and modified. The journal name, date and registration number at ClinicalTrials.gov were deleted. Authors' names were substituted by names randomly selected among the 200 names most common in the United Kingdom [see Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>]. Treatments were referred to as &#x02018;experimental treatment A&#x02019; or &#x02018;experimental treatment B&#x02019;. Acronyms used for the study were deleted and dates in the text were modified to avoid trial recognition. Furthermore, each abstract was translated into French. As a quality procedure, three GPs read all abstracts to ensure the quality of the translation and the relevance of the abstracts for GPs.</p><p>The abstract for each RCT was reported in three formats as follows:</p><p>&#x02013;&#x000a0;Abstract with no mention of the funding source or CoI. If the funding was reported in the original abstract, it was removed.</p><p>Abstract reporting the funding source only. A heading &#x02018;FUNDING&#x02019; was added after the abstract conclusions. Under this heading, we reported the name of the pharmaceutical industry funding the trial.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x000a0;Abstract reporting the funding source and CoI. Two headings were added after the abstract conclusions. Under the first heading &#x02018;FUNDING&#x02019;, we reported the name of the pharmaceutical industry funding the trial. Under the second heading &#x02018;CONFLICTS OF INTEREST,&#x02019; we reported the initials of authors who 1) were employed by the industry and 2) had a financial interest and/or other relationship with the industry (for example, fees, travel costs, stock options, link with a family member employed by the industry). The number of authors with CoI varied in the RCT reports (for 37% of abstracts, all authors had financial CoI; for 81%, more than 50% of authors had financial CoI; for 45%, the first, second or last author was employed by the pharmaceutical industry) (see examples in Table&#x000a0;

We used two different sources of recruitment for pragmatic reasons. Such a strategy is very often used in most RCTs to increase the sample size and the generalizability of the study results. The GPs were informed that their participation would involve reading only one abstract of an RCT and answering some questions about their interpretation of the abstract. They were informed that the collected data would remain anonymous and that we would inform them of the study results when available. However, they did not know that abstracts were modified and that several formats were compared. As approved by the ethics committee, participant consent was considered obtained as soon as they logged onto the survey site. If GPs agreed to participate, they had to complete a questionnaire related to their general characteristics. They were instructed to carefully read one abstract that was randomly selected for them and they had to answer questions related to their interpretation of this abstract (see Outcomes and Additional files

The secondary endpoints were the perceived methodological quality of the study and the interpretation of the treatment benefit in terms of safety and efficacy.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], most studies evaluating how physicians interpret research funding disclosures showed that abstracts reporting a funding source or CoI could modify readers&#x02019; interpretation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In contrast, our results did not show a statistically significant difference in GPs&#x02019; interpretation of an abstract&#x02019;s findings by the disclosure statements. However, our confidence intervals were wide, with an effect going in the same direction, and confidence in abstract conclusions was surprisingly low, 3.6 on a scale from 0 to 10. Therefore, we cannot exclude an effect, particularly for abstracts reporting both a funding source and authors&#x02019; CoI.</p><p>Previous studies evaluated physicians&#x02019; interpretation of specifically developed vignettes or abstracts of hypothetical trials
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] or used the abstract of a single trial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Contrary to these studies, we aimed to have a pragmatic approach and used abstracts from a large sample of real trials. We selected a representative sample of abstracts of RCT reports published in 2010 and indexed in PubMed, and we systematically recorded the funding source and authors&#x02019; CoI for these trials. To avoid bias, all information that could allow readers to identify the trial or drug investigated was deleted or modified by using, for example, fictitious names for authors. Abstracts reporting a negative or neutral conclusion were not included so as to homogenize abstract conclusions and facilitate the interpretation of our results.</p><p>In this trial, we evaluated the reporting of both a funding source and authors&#x02019; CoI in abstracts for several reasons. First, we focused on abstracts because they are an essential mode for disseminating research results
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, the CONSORT statement for abstracts clearly recommends reporting the funding source to improve transparency, but we lack a clear recommendation on the reporting of authors&#x02019; financial CoI in abstracts. CoI are defined by a set of circumstances that create a risk that professional judgment or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. CoI are divided into various categories, from financial to non-financial ties, such as personal relationships
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In our study, we did not specifically assess CoI other than financial ones. Furthermore, we explored only one factor -- reporting funding source and CoI disclosure -- and we acknowledge that in most cases, a multifaceted type of approach is required to change attitudes and behavior.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, in the context of a study on the interpretation of abstract results, GPs might not have interpreted abstracts as they usually do in clinical practice. Evaluation of how carefully the GPs read the abstract was not done as this is difficult to appraise. <bold>A</bold>nonymization of abstracts may have distanced the reader and contributed to the low confidence in the abstracts. As well, the low confidence overall suggests that GPs were more suspicious than usual, by searching details with attention. Second, these results may not be applicable to all physicians. The participants in this study were GPs involved in clinical research and/or with part-time activity in a university general practice department as a teacher or student supervisor. Our participants probably have higher expertise in clinical research than the usual French GP. Finally, this study was planned to detect a large effect, and confidence intervals were wide. Therefore, we cannot exclude a smaller effect
