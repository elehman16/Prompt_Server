However, relevant stoma morbidity after rectal cancer surgery exists and has a significant impact on quality of life. Moreover, a diverting stoma has an influence on completeness of chemotherapy but it remains unclear in which way. There is no evidence regarding optimal timing for stoma closure in relation to adjuvant chemotherapy. Two randomised controlled trials have studied early stoma closure after low anterior resection in patients with rectal cancer, one of them showing that early closure around day 8 after resection is possible without increasing morbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>CoCStom is a randomised multicentre trial comparing completeness of adjuvant chemotherapy as primary endpoint after early (8&#x02013;10 days after resection, before starting adjuvant therapy) versus late (~26&#x000a0;weeks after resection and completion of adjuvant therapy) stoma closure in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing low anterior resection after neoadjuvant therapy. After exclusion of post-operative anastomotic leakage 257 patients from 30 German hospitals are planned to be included in order to assure a power of 80&#x000a0;% for the confirmatory analysis of at least 214 evaluable cases. An absolute increase of 20&#x000a0;% for the rate of completely administered adjuvant chemotherapy is regarded as a clinically meaningful step forward and serves as basis for sample size calculation. Quality of life, stoma-related complications, individual completeness of chemotherapy rate, percentage of patients stopping adjuvant therapy or undergoing dose modifications or delay, oncological outcomes, cumulative days of hospitalisation and number of readmissions, rate of symptomatic anastomotic leaks after stoma closure, mortality, post-operative complications and toxicity of adjuvant chemotherapy are secondary endpoints.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The CoCStom trial aims to clarify optimal timing of stoma closure in the context of adjuvant chemotherapy. Depending on the results of the trial, patients could benefit either from early or late stoma closure in regard to long term oncological survival due to a higher rate of completeness of adjuvant chemotherapy treatment and thus better effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>German Clinical Trials Register, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&#x00026;TRIAL_ID=DRKS00005113">DRKS00005113</ext-link>.

An anastomosis performed close to the pelvic floor is associated with a relevant risk of anastomotic leakage (3&#x02013;17&#x000a0;%), which contributes to mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Based on level-1 evidence a diverting stoma effectively reduces the rate of symptomatic anastomotic leakage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>However, a diverting stoma also causes morbidity, which may affect nearly half of all patients as shown in an analysis of patients with protective stoma for distal colonic anastomosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Stoma-related morbidity includes high-output stoma, stoma prolapse, small bowel obstruction and wound infection and has been evaluated in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, a stoma may impair quality of life (QoL). The global QoL as well as the physical functioning and role scores are negatively influenced by stoma after LAR with total mesorectal excision (TME) as shown in two prospective observational longitudinal studies of 22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and 24 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] respectively. These scores and additionally the mental health improved 6&#x000a0;weeks after ileostomy closure. Contrarily, 23 patients receiving a high anterior resection without stoma had higher QoL scores postoperatively compared to preoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Very little evidence regarding the optimal timing for stoma closure was found despite an extensive systematic search in relevant literature databases and trial registries. Our prospective multicentre pilot study investigating the timing of stoma closure and longitudinal QoL before LAR with TME, before stoma closure and 6&#x000a0;months after stoma closure on 171 patients from 17 participating German surgical centres showed that this is in median performed 5.1&#x000a0;months after creation, with a wide range (0.6&#x02013;32 months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Earlier stoma closure is feasible with low morbidity and no mortality as a pilot study demonstrated by closing the stoma 11&#x000a0;days after tumour resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Finally, a prospectively randomised multicentre trial with 186 patients confirmed that stoma closure on day 8, during the same hospitalisation, is possible without increase of the perioperative complication rate. In this study, which reflects the best available evidence, the overall postoperative complication rate was significantly lower in the early closure group (small bowel obstruction early vs. late: 3 vs. 16&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002 and medical complications: 5 vs. 15&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.021) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The hospitalisation period was also significantly shorter in the early stoma closure group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.013) but there was no difference in QoL (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.566). Major drawback of this study is that there is no data on administered adjuvant chemotherapy. The only larger, albeit retrospective, study investigating stoma related complications and postoperative morbidity in 120 patients with colorectal carcinoma undergoing colorectal resections in regard to adjuvant chemotherapy showed a trend toward fewer complications (12.5&#x000a0;%) if stoma closure was performed early (i.e. before starting adjuvant chemotherapy) rather then during (42.9&#x000a0;%) or after (21.2&#x000a0;%) chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, an early closure of the stoma may also negatively influence the completeness of chemotherapy (CoC) due to complications like symptomatic anastomotic leakage or LAR syndrome. The latter is a well-known clinical condition occurring after deep anterior rectal resection potentially severely impairing QoL in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This usually becomes evident during the first months after stoma reversal and may also aggravate side-effects of chemotherapy, again resulting in less patients receiving all cycles of planned chemotherapy.</p><p>Timing of diverting stoma closure in advanced rectal cancer has also not yet been adequately investigated in the setting of adjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, no randomised studies specifically investigating the influence of CoC on overall survival (OS) in patients having undergone rectal resection for rectal cancer have yet been published. We re-analyzed the data from our phase-III study comparing 5-FU and capecitabine in the perioperative treatment of patients with stage II and III rectal cancer with regard to influence of CoC on survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. CoC in this trial was associated with a significant improvement of 3-year disease free survival (DFS) as well as 5-year OS. Therefore, since adjuvant chemotherapy is considered to improve long-term survival in nodal-positive (stage III) disease and recommended as standard treatment in the German S3-guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] it is suitable to consider CoC as primary endpoint in a prospective randomised clinical trial. Moreover, in order to improve the rates of completed adjuvant chemotherapy treatment in rectal cancer, it is highly patient relevant to investigate the influence of a stoma.</p><p>In conclusion, the optimal timing for stoma closure with regard to CoC remains controversial. It seems advantageous to close the stoma as early as possible, but on the other hand early closure may result in more complications which may impair the administration of all planned cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>CoCStom is an investigator-initiated prospective randomised open-label multicentre trial with two parallel study groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient population</title><p>Patients with rectal cancer stadium UICC II-III undergoing low anterior resection with diverting stoma after neoadjuvant therapy and planned adjuvant chemotherapy will be included in the trial.

According to our recent randomised phase III trial on perioperative treatment of stage II and III rectal cancer, a total of 61.7&#x000a0;% (capecitabine) and 57.5&#x000a0;% (5-FU), respectively, started adjuvant chemotherapy, and 45.7 and 40.0&#x000a0;% had their scheduled cycles completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These data are consistent with the findings in other studies investigating perioperative chemo (radio)therapy in rectal cancer.</p><p>Based on this data, we assume a CoC rate of 42&#x000a0;% for the standard patient group with a diverting stoma during adjuvant chemotherapy. A 20&#x000a0;% absolute increase of CoC (42&#x02013;62&#x000a0;%) is regarded as a clinically meaningful step forward. In order to significantly detect this difference on a type I error level of 5&#x000a0;% (two-sided) with a power of 80&#x000a0;%, a sample size of 107 is required in each arm based on the application of Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. The Mantel-Haenszel procedure stratifying for centre will be used for the primary hypothesis of the trial.</p><p>Any major deviation from these CoC rate assumptions will lead to increased power, if the delta of 20&#x000a0;% is retained. According to the primary endpoint, the number of losses in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population should be minimal. A rate of 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% of drop-outs and losses to follow-up is expected. Thus, about 260 patients should be randomised to ascertain sufficient power in the per-protocol analysis. Stratification by centre is foreseen, since centre-specific characteristics such as the quality of surgery, patient guidance with respect to chemotherapy compliance, etc. may have a major influence on important outcome parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Definition of analysis population</title><p>Patients who were enrolled although they unequivocally did not fulfil the selection criteria of the trial a priori (&#x0201c;non-eligible&#x0201d;) will be excluded from the statistical analysis, in accordance with ICH recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>All other patients will primarily be evaluated in an ITT analysis according to allocation by randomisation.

While data on all functional and symptoms scales will be described, formal comparisons are going to focus on global QoL and symptoms related to the impact of chemotherapy and surgery on rectal cancer patients specifically (overall QoL, diarrhoea, constipation, vomitting).</p><p>In case of disease-free survival, local recurrence-free survival and distant recurrence-free survival Kaplan Meier survival curves for the groups will be presented and compared by the log rank test. Further secondary endpoints will be compared using a Wilcoxon-Mann&#x02013;Whitney-U test or tests for contingency tables, as appropriate according to the type of data.</p><p>No interim analysis is planned. However, while the main statistical analysis is performed, as soon as documentation of post-operative therapy is completed in all patients at about 7&#x000a0;months post randomisation, a second analysis on long-term endpoints is performed about 1.5&#x000a0;years later.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Individual trial termination</title><p>Patients may be withdrawn from the trial any time at their own request without giving reasons for their decision or if, in the investigator&#x02019;s opinion, continuation of the trial would be detrimental to the patient&#x02019;s well-being.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Premature closure of the trial</title><p>The trial may be prematurely closed by the principal investigator in consultation with the steering committee. If the termination of the trial becomes necessary, the steering committee will discuss this issue with the independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB).

Additionally, an ethical approval has been obtained at all participating centres (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The responsible investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki (Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, Somerset West, Edinburgh, Seoul and Fortaleza amendments) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and the laws and regulations of the country. The protocol has been written, and the trial will be conducted according to the principles of ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Patient data in the eCRF will be pseudonymised.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Benefit-risk assessment</title><p>Benefit-risk assessment was critically reviewed. Potentially, early stoma closure could result in more clinically relevant leaks of the rectal anastomosis as the time period for complete anastomotic healing is shorter. In order to exclude or minimize the risk of developing a clinically relevant leak of the rectal anastomosis after stoma closure the appropriate investigations confirming a healed anastomosis, which are usually done before late stoma closure, are mandatory also for early stoma closure. Several studies, including a large randomized controlled study, have not shown an increased risk for symptomatic leaks of the rectal anastomosis after early stoma closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Healing of the small bowel anastomosis after stoma closure may be impaired in the early group, because tissues may still be more friable such a short time after laparotomy. Again, several studies, including a large randomized controlled study, have not shown an increased complication risk for patients undergoing early stoma closure. On the other hand stoma closure may be more easy and faster as scaring may not yet be so pronounced less than ten days after stoma creation. Moreover, multiple complications may occur after stoma placement (e.g. kidney failure, prolapse, etc.), which may be minimized by early stoma closure. Finally, early stoma closure may have an impact on CoC potentially resulting in more patients receiving the full or at least a higher dose of scheduled chemotherapy which in turn could improve the oncological prognosis. Several studies including an analysis of our own data within a randomized controlled trial have shown that incomplete chemotherapy cycles and reduced dosages influence oncological outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, even if a small to moderate increase of complications occurred due to early stoma closure this may be acceptable in order to improve overall outcome of patients.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Discussion</title><p>Whether the time point of stoma closure influences the complete administration of the planned adjuvant chemotherapy, in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing LAR with TME after neoadjuvant therapy, remains unclear. Besides local complications stoma can have a negative impact on the patient&#x02019;s psychological state since the mental health score was shown to be impaired in the presence of a stoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. After tumour resection, stoma has a significant influence on the patients&#x02019; well being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], affects them emotionally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and thus has a major impact on their compliance with the treatment. Some patients insist on stoma closure before the end of adjuvant chemotherapy cycles which may lead to a delay of the remaining therapy and may also increase complication rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other patients stop therapy prematurely due to presence of a stoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>That early stoma closure is an important issue in the complex therapy of rectal cancer patients is confirmed also by a newly started prospectively randomised Scandinavian multicentre study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It compares early closure versus standard treatment (8&#x02013;13 days vs. 12&#x02013;26 weeks after surgery) with postsurgical morbidity as primary endpoint, QoL and the socio-economic effects of early closure as secondary endpoints. But this trial does not investigate CoC which therefore will remain an open question with high clinical relevance for the individual patient.</p><p>It is of major importance that patients undergo all chemotherapy cycles in order to maximally benefit from adjuvant treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] but several studies show that not all patients are able to receive all cycles of the planned adjuvant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This may be due to suboptimal compliance with the therapy which can be explained by chemotherapy toxicity and postoperative complications.</p><p>Since early stoma closure is possible without increase in preoperative mortality and the complete administration of the planned chemotherapy cycles potentially improves the oncological outcome, it remains to be determined how early stoma closure influences CoC. This is the primary goal of the CoCStom trial and will contribute to clarifying how the largest benefit from adjuvant therapy can be gained for the affected patients. Therefore, CoC is a suitable primary endpoint and has high clinical relevance for the individual patient.</p><p>The trial may also have relevant socio-economic impact as early closure, if shown as equivalent or even superior, can cut costs due to reduced need for stoma care products and also due to a shorter overall period of hospitalisation.</p><p>CoCStom is a combined surgical-oncological trial. Its success requires a very good collaboration between surgeons and oncologists and the results may also have an impact on current guidelines as early closure of a stoma is currently not regarded as standard of care. Furthermore, results may also influence the &#x0201c;German DRG-System&#x0201d; on which is based the financing of medical in-house procedures. Presently, ileostomy closure within the same hospital stay as the rectal resection is not additionally reimbursed in contrast to late stoma closure in a second hospital stay.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment has started in December 2013.
