Although sub-paresthesia SCS has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain, empirical criteria for sub-paresthesia SCS have not been established and its basic mechanisms of action at supraspinal levels are unknown. We tested our hypothesis that sub-paresthesia SCS attenuates behavioral signs of neuropathic pain in a rat model, and modulates pain-related theta (4&#x02013;8&#x02009;Hz) power of the electroencephalogram (EEG), a previously validated correlate of spontaneous pain in rodent models. Results show that sub-paresthesia SCS attenuates thermal hyperalgesia and power amplitude in the 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;Hz range, consistent with clinical data showing significant yet modest analgesic effects of sub-paresthesia SCS in humans. Therefore, we present evidence for anti-nociceptive effects of sub-paresthesia SCS in a rat model of neuropathic pain and further validate EEG theta power as a reliable &#x02018;biosignature&#x02019; of spontaneous pain.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Neuropathic pain is highly prevalent, costly and contributes to the opioid crisis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, in part due to ineffective pharmacotherapy and overprescription of opioids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a non-opioid, FDA-approved therapy for severe pain conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Though SCS is known to reduce pain severity by more than 50% in more than 50% of patients, there is urgent need for achieving better clinical outcomes.</p><p id="Par3">Paresthesia secondary to SCS challenges the gold standard double-blind study design because it is impossible to blind the subjects, thus undermining research efforts to enhance the therapeutic benefits of SCS. Interestingly, it was recently demonstrated that SCS at current amplitudes below those evoking sensory perception (i.e. sub-paresthesia SCS) is effective in alleviating pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and offers the benefit of reducing subjective bias and placebo effects in prospective studies. Therefore, there has been an emerging interest in establishing empirical criteria for sub-paresthesia SCS and in elucidating its basic mechanisms of action at supraspinal levels.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we used a rat model of neuropathic pain to test our hypothesis that sub-paresthesia SCS attenuates behavioral signs of neuropathic pain, and modulates pain-related &#x02018;biosignature&#x02019; activity in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), which mediates the discrimination and localization of pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Briefly, a principle feature of the biosignature consists of electroencephalography (EEG) power enhancement in the theta band (4&#x02013;8&#x02009;Hz) that is correlated positively with nociceptive behavior and negatively with analgesic treatment in awake, unrestrained rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In SCS studies using pre-clinical animal models, current amplitudes are mostly determined under anesthesia in reference to motor thresholds (i.e. minimal current amplitude eliciting muscle twitch), which vary widely between animals and are incompatible with clinical settings whereby SCS protocols are based on the verbal report of paresthesia (i.e. paresthesia-based). To overcome this limitation, we determined paresthesia thresholds in rats according to behaviors indicative of alertness to SCS in awake states. We chose 50&#x02009;Hz, 200 &#x000b5;s pulse width as standard SCS parameters that have been used clinically for over 50 years, while setting the amplitude according to perception threshold (defined as overt behavioral response to the onset of SCS, see Methods).</p><p id="Par6">Epidural SCS leads were chronically implanted and stimulation was applied continuously for 3&#x02013;4 hrs during awake state. Data show that rats with behavioral signs of neuropathic pain manifest increased S1 theta power, confirming our previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Sub-paresthesia SCS attenuated nociceptive behavior and power amplitude in the 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;Hz range, but not the 5&#x02013;8&#x02009;Hz range of the theta band. These results are consistent with clinical data showing significant yet modest analgesic effects of sub-paresthesia conventional (50&#x02009;Hz) SCS on spontaneous pain in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> (however see Kapural <italic>et al</italic>. for a claim with regards to superior efficacy of sub-paresthesia SCS at 10&#x02009;kHz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>). Thus, we provide novel evidence for anti-nociceptive effects of sub-paresthesia SCS in a rat model of neuropathic pain. We further validate EEG theta power as a &#x02018;biosignature&#x02019; of spontaneous pain in pre-clinical, and potentially clinical studies testing the efficacy of neuromodulation technologies for pain management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">In the experiments described below, behavioral and electrophysiological data were recorded in awake rats (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;9); of these, two rats were excluded from EEG analysis due to electrode failure (see Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Methods for detailed description of the experimental set-up and procedures).

We also sought to elucidate the mode of action of SCS at a cortical level using a &#x02018;biosignature&#x02019; of spontaneous pain consisting of increased EEG theta power. Results show that sub-paresthesia SCS effectively reverses thermal hyperalgesia in rats with CCI, and significantly reduces EEG power over S1 in the 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;Hz range, which overlaps with the theta band (4&#x02013;8&#x02009;Hz).</p><p id="Par12">Our experiments were carefully designed to be translational and to have more direct clinical relevance compared to prior pre-clinical studies. Our experimental approach was unique in many ways, including: 1) Use of paresthesia threshold to determine current amplitudes, which is more clinically relevant compared to motor threshold and leading to less variability in SCS parameters between animals; 2) continuous SCS in awake animals, which ruled out anesthetic effects; 3) pain assessment using behavioral testing and EEG as complementary methods to evaluate stimulus-dependent (hyperalgesia) and stimulus-independent (EEG theta) sensory states indicative of pain, while elucidating the supraspinal mechanisms of SCS.</p><p id="Par13">First, our results show that paresthesia thresholds were fairly consistent in all rats, in contrast to motor thresholds that varied widely, arguably due to anesthesia. Accordingly, it is assumed that all rats in this study received comparable electrical charges per second.

Of note, the use of paresthesia threshold in rats has been previously reported, but SCS was applied at a higher frequency (500, 1,000 and 10,000&#x02009;Hz)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> compared to this study (50&#x02009;Hz).</p><p id="Par14">Second, SCS significantly attenuated thermal hyperalgesia at day 7 after CCI. Thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, commonly used methods that are considered cardinal signs of neuropathic pain in awake rats, are stimulus-dependent reflex behaviors indicative of hypersensitivity. However, the primary outcome and gold standard of pain assessment in clinical studies is the patient&#x02019;s verbal report of spontaneous or stimulus-independent pain, not hypersensitivity. Hence, we predicted that EEG in non-restrained awake rats, using theta power as a valid correlate of spontaneous pain, is more directly relevant to the clinical setting. We previously demonstrated that theta (4&#x02013;8&#x02009;Hz) power is correlated positively with nociceptive behaviors and negatively with analgesic treatments in rodent models of pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We further elucidated the relevant thalamocortical circuits modulating theta power in nociceptive states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, showed evidence of increased theta power in humans evoked by a noxious cold stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and proposed a predictive, hierarchical model of functional connectivity in the brain as a theoretical framework for pain-related theta power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Accordingly, data obtained in this study showing power reduction in the 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;Hz band suggest that SCS may not result in a complete reduction of spontaneous pain, corroborating results of a recent human study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Though it has been generally assumed that patients must feel the paresthesias of SCS in order to obtain effective pain relief, sub-paresthesia SCS has been shown to confer analgesia in patients with refractory angina pectoris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> or other neuropathic pain conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> as measured by the visual analogue scale, albeit effects are significantly less compared to conventional paresthesia SCS (however, see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> using 10&#x02009;kHz SCS). Interestingly, our data showed enhancement of power in the 10&#x02013;30&#x02009;Hz range in rats with CCI and a further increase following SCS. Whereas the perceptual correlate of power modulation within the beta and low-gamma bands remains to be elucidated (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> for phase-locking between theta and gamma oscillations, and<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> for a discussion of the relation between gamma oscillations and pain), we conclude that modulation of these bands is not relevant to the analgesic effects of sub-paresthesia SCS. While we do note that the lead implant resulted in a uniform reduction of power in the 3&#x02013;30&#x02009;Hz range, behavioral pain sensitivity was not changed. Hence, the putative effects of the lead implant <italic>per se</italic> did not constitute a confounding variable with regards to our interpretation of the effects of SCS. Collectively, our results confirm the validity of EEG theta power as a reliable biomarker of spontaneous pain and as a predictor of effective <italic>versus</italic> ineffective analgesia.</p><p id="Par15">Third, the effects of SCS on brain activity is incompletely understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In a systematic review of the literature, it was concluded that empirical evidence for supraspinal effects of SCS is limited and inconclusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This conclusion was based on studies using functional imaging and evoked EEG or MEG responses (which is different from resting state EEG). Although SCS initially emerged as a direct application of the Gate Control Theory at a spinal level, analgesic effects must manifest eventually <italic>via</italic> ascending input to the brain. Consequently, our scientific understanding of the supraspinal mechanisms of SCS analgesia remains severely restricted. For example, the mechanisms of sub-paresthesia, high frequency SCS is attributed primarily to spinal cord segmental (&#x02018;at-level&#x02019;) mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Based on our results, however, it is clear that sub-paresthesia SCS modulates activity in S1 which mediates the discrimination and localization of pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">In conclusion, our experimental paradigm and approach in this study are fundamentally aligned with clinical settings, a major advantage for pre-clinical transitional studies and prospective double-blind clinical studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par17">Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were housed individually, under a 12-hour light/dark cycle, in a temperature and humidity controlled environment with food and water available ad libitum.

Rats could freely navigate individually in Plexiglas chambers. The rat&#x02019;s behavior was visually monitored, noting periods of rest. Each EEG recording session was approximately 5&#x02009;minutes per animal. Of that 5-min interval, 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10-sec epochs were selected randomly during rest state per condition, per animal.

Only data during awake resting periods (defined as idle wakefulness with no locomotor behavior) were further analyzed. Potentials generated due to vigorous myogenic activity (such as scratching) were excluded from analysis.
