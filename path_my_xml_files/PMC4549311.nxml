The experiment involved two fatigue evaluation phases carried out before and after a fatigue inducing phase. A 1-hour AX-continuous performance test was used to induce mental fatigue in the fatigue-inducing phase, and participants&#x02019; subjective evaluation on the mental fatigue, as well as their neurobehavioral performance in a Go/NoGo task, were measured before and after the fatigue-inducing phase. A total of 36 undergraduate students (18&#x02013;22 years) participated in the study and were randomly assigned to the music group and control group. The music group performed the fatigue-inducing task while listening to relaxing music, and the control group performed the same task without any music. Our results revealed that after the fatigue-inducing phase, (a) the music group demonstrated significantly less mental fatigue than control group, (b) reaction time significantly increased for the control group but not for the music group, (c) larger Go-P3 and NoGo-P3 amplitudes were observed in the music group, although larger NoGo-N2 amplitudes were detected for both groups. These results combined to suggest that listening to relaxing music alleviated the mental fatigue associated with performing an enduring cognitive-motor task.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the First-class Disciplines of Shanghai Colleges and Universities (Psychology).

In the present study, mental fatigue is defined as the feeling that people may experience during and following prolonged periods of cognitive activity requiring sustained mental activity [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Mental fatigue, which has been found to considerably disrupt task performance, is very common in daily life. It can lead to a variety of negative consequences, such as low productivity, poor study efficiency and even traffic accidents [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, it is of great importance to explore the mechanisms underlying mental fatigue, and develop efficient methods to alleviate mental fatigue.</p><p>The effects of mental fatigue on cognitive-motor performance are well documented. Mental fatigue leads to decreased attention, delayed reaction times and increased number of errors during visual reaction tasks as a result of decreased levels of brain activation [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136446.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Subjective feelings of mental fatigue are typically assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale, which asks participants to rate their subjective feelings of mental fatigue from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum) [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Using the Go/NoGo paradigm, increased mental fatigue has been found to increase the latencies of Go- and NoGo-P3 and NoGo-N2, while decreasing the amplitude of NoGo-P3 [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The amplitude of Go-P3, a late positive event-related potential (ERP) component, is an index of the amount of resources devoted to identifying a target stimulus. In addition, Go-P3 latency has been suggested as a measure of stimulus evaluation duration that is independent of response selection and execution processes [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].The NoGo-N2 component reflects detection of response conflict, indicated by an increased amplitude in high-conflict trials [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136446.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>A number of methods have been developed that alleviate the effects of mental fatigue on cognitive motor performance. First, attempts have been made to prevent mental fatigue before it occurs. For instance, ingestion of nutrients (such as a vitamin/mineral supplement) before a sustained cognitive task reduced subjective mental fatigue and improved the subsequent cognitive performance [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136446.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Second, methods have been created to alleviate concurrent mental fatigue. It has been reported that the presence of intermittent odours during the completion reduced mental fatigue and improved attentional/effortful control of response selection, resulting in a better cognitive-motor performance [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, Kaplan [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported that exposure to natural settings and stimuli such as landscapes and animals to reduce mental fatigue. In conclusion, interventions have been designed to either prevent or reduce mental fatigue. The focus of the present study was testing an intervention designed to reduce concurrent mental fatigue.</p><p>People tend to listen to music while working, studying or driving in daily life. It is believed that music may help alleviate mental fatigue and improve work efficiency. A number of studies have found that music affects people's cognitive processes [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For instance, Arikan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported that hearing music that was well-known by participants increased the allocation of attentional resources during memory updating processes in an auditory oddball task. This should also be reflected by a larger P3 amplitude. Also, it has been shown that listening to relaxing music is an effective way to recover from exercise-induced physical fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136446.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Jing et al. [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found that compared to those who had 15-minute rest without music after completing an exhausting cycle ergometer test, participants who listened to relaxing music for 15 minutes had a greater decrease in heart rate, urinary protein, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). However, the effect of listening to the relaxing music on the mental fatigue induced by the enduring cognitive motor task remained unknown. The present study was designed to examine this issue, along with the associated neurobehavioral mechanisms.</p><p>The Go/NoGo paradigm was used to examine the availability of participants&#x02019; attentional resources and conflict monitoring and inhibition process (as indexed by N2 and P3) following completion of the continuous performance task, with and without the presence of relaxing music. This will provide information in regards to the underlying neurobehavioral mechanisms. It was hypothesized that listening to relaxing music would result in a reduced subjective feeling of mental fatigue and reduce the negative effects of fatigue on cognitive-motor performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Materials and Method</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>36 undergraduate students (18 females and 18 males) between 18 and 22 years of age (M = 20.3) participated in the experiment.

Each participant was seated in a dimly lit, electrically shielded room with response keyboard in his/her right hand. The experiment consisted of 3 continuous phases. The first phase was filled with a 15min long Go/NoGo task as fatigue-evaluating task. Participants could have a rest every 5min in order to prevent fatigue. After which, participants were required to fill out the VAS. Phase 2 was filled with the fatigue-inducing task, during which participants performed 60 min AX-continuous performance task without rest. Then participants performed the VAS again and finished phase 3 with another 15min long fatigue-evaluating task, which was the same as the first phase. The participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible, maintaining a high level of accuracy. Both the control and music group performed the fatigue-evaluating task with the concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded, which was not performed during the fatigue-inducing phase. While performing the fatigue-inducing task, participants in the music group listened to the relaxing music, those in the control group did not. The relaxing music was chosen from functional music developed by the China Institute of Sport Science. These pieces of music helped Chinese athletes alleviate mental fatigue during the preparing for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. All participants listened to the same 12 pieces of instrumental folk music (no lyrics) music during the fatigue-inducing phase. The chosen pieces were played to the participants at a tempo of 60&#x02013;80 beats per minute. The music was presented via a power amplifier connected to a computer, with a volume of 40dB.</p><sec id="sec005"><title>Fatigue-evaluating task</title><p>A Go/NoGo paradigm was used to measure effect of mental fatigue.

Four squared configurations subtending 4&#x000d7;4&#x000b0; were presented for 100ms on a dark background, and were displayed randomly with equal probability (p = 0.25), and a stimulus onset time of 800ms. Two configurations were defined as targets and two non-targets (<xref rid="pone.0136446.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

This is in accord with previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and suggests that our task manipulation was successful in inducing mental fatigue. Importantly, based on the scores of Visual Analogue Scale, the control group reported suffering from more mental fatigue than the music group.</p><p>This phenomenon was also demonstrated by behavioral data. After the fatigue-inducing phase, the reaction time of the control group increased on the Go/NoGo task, while the music group remained the same. The accuracy of the two groups did not change in the Go/NoGo task, which could be due to the flooring effect, where participants had maintained a fairly high accuracy in the task. The behavioral results implied that when people perform cognitively challenging tasks, listening to relaxing music could mitigate performance deterioration (e.g., a slower response) caused by mental fatigue.</p><p>The observed performance deterioration might be related to a reduction in attentional resources allocated to the task due to mental fatigue. Kok [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] suggested that the attentional availability of resources is the most important factor in determining the performance in the cognitive task. Lack of attentional resources will lead to the poorer performance. In our study, the Go-P3 amplitude significantly decreased after the fatigue-inducing task for the control group, suggesting that participants had increasing difficulty allocating resources for stimulus detection as the task unfolded. In Kato&#x02019;s study, they found that mental fatigue had no effect on the Go-P3 amplitude[<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which was inconsistent with ours. We assumed that different proportion of the Go and NoGo trials used for study would account for this difference. In their study, the stimulus probability of Go trials (80%) was greater than that of NoGo trials (20%). As mental fatigue may cause the decreased availability of cognitive resources [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136446.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], in order to maintain a speedy response, the most reasonable decision is to allocate the limited resources to the Go stimuli instead of the NoGo stimuli. Therefore, participants may have limited capacity to allocate attentional resources to the NoGo stimulus alone due to mental fatigue. The stimulus probability of Go trails and NoGo trials in our study was 50% to 50%, thus, participants detected the two stimuli with equal probability, and they had to allocate equal amount of attentional resources to both Go and NoGo stimuli. Interestingly, the Go-P3 amplitude decreased less in the music condition compared to the control condition after the fatigue-inducing task, suggesting that the attentional availability of resources did not decline much in the music condition. Hence, participants who performed the fatigue-inducing task in the music condition suffered less mental fatigue.</p><p>N2 is an important ERP component in NoGo trails. Many studies have been performed to clarify the cognitive process reflected by NoGo-N2, some of which suggested that NoGo N2 reflected conflict monitoring[<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136446.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and others thought it reflected response inhibition[<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. More and more evidence suggested that N2 might reflect the conflict monitoring process. Bruin et al. [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] examined the effects of response priming on N2 evoked by target stimuli in a Go/NoGo task. They found that N2 was not modulated by response priming, and concluded that it was not associated with response inhibition. Instead they proposed the frontal P3 to be inhibition-specific. This positive wave peaked between 300 and 600 ms after stimulus presentation and was enhanced on NoGo trials relative to Go trials on the frontal electrode channels. In the present study, we found that the decrement of NoGo-P3 amplitudes after the fatigue-inducing task were smaller in the music condition than in their absence. These findings suggest that listening to the relaxing music plays an important role in mitigating the deterioration of cognition performance and inhibition resulted from mental fatigue. For the NoGo-N2 trials, there was only a main effect of testing phase at Cz site with no group difference. We assumed that music only modulated response inhibition without effect on the conflict monitoring process. The relationship between mental fatigue and response inhibition remains unclear. Falkenstein et al. [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] investigated the inhibition-related ERP components, and they found that there was no effect of time on task on NoGo-P3 component, therefore, they suggested that the inhibitory processes were fairly robust against mental fatigue. In Kato&#x02019;s study [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the NoGo-P3 amplitude decreased with time on task, suggesting that mental fatigue affected controlled processing for response inhibition. At this point, our findings were consistent with Kato&#x02019;s. The NoGo-P3 amplitudes at Cz and Pz sites significantly decreased after the fatigue-inducing task, indicating the response inhibition was impaired. These findings combined to suggest that listening to the relaxing music mitigated the decrement of response inhibition during mental fatigue.</p><p>A previous study found that the presence of intermittent odours during the continuous performance task helped to reduce mental fatigue and maintain performance [<xref rid="pone.0136446.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The present study showed the similar effect using relaxing music. Listening to the relaxing music during a cognitive task may make people feel less mentally fatigued and maintain high productivity. The effects of relaxing music on alleviating mental fatigue may better explain why people tend to listen to music while working, studying or driving in daily life. Nevertheless, there are some limitations of the study. Firstly, the fatigue-inducing task AX-CPT is a relatively simple task, and so future research should attempt to replicate results using a more difficult task to induce mental fatigue. Secondly, the relaxing music might act as a distracting stimulus, blocking mental fatigue instead of exerting a relaxing effect. A group listening to a non-musical sound may be added as a better control in the future experiment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current study suggests a potential intervention for reduction in mental fatigue while performing an enduring cognitive-motor task. By listening to relaxing music during a fatigue-inducing task, both mental fatigue and deterioration in motor performance were reduced. The analysis of ERP signals further suggested that the music group suffered less impairment of attentional control of response selection and inhibition than the control group. In sum, these findings demonstrate that listening to relaxing music can alleviate the mental fatigue encountered in performing an enduring cognitive-motor task at both behavioral and cognitive levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0136446.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Fatigue scale data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0136446.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0136446.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Behavioral data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0136446.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0136446.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>ERP data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0136446.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0136446.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
