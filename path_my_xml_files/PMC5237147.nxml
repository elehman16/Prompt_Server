Tailoring is an approach of systematic intervention development taking account of previously identified determinants of practice. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a tailored program to improve the implementation of three important processes of care for this patient group: (a) structured medication counseling including brown bag reviews, (b) the use of medication lists, and (c) structured medication reviews to reduce potentially inappropriate medication.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial with a follow-up time of 9&#x000a0;months. Participants were general practitioners (GPs) organized in quality circles and participating in a GP-centered care contract of a German health insurance. Patients aged &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;years, suffering from at least 3 chronic diseases, receiving more than 4 drugs, and being at high risk for medication-related events according to the assessment of the treating GP were enrolled. The tailored program consisted of a workshop for GPs and health care assistants, educational materials and reminders for patients, and the elaboration of implementation action plans. The primary outcome was the change in the degree of implementation between baseline and follow-up, measured by a summary score of 10 indicators. The indicators were based on structured surveys with patients and GPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We analyzed the data of 21 GPs (10 - intervention group, 11 - control group) and 273 patients (130 - intervention group, 143 - control group). The increase in the degree of implementation was 4.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval: &#x02212;0.3, 8.6) higher in the intervention group compared to the control group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1). Two of the 10 indicators were significantly improved in the intervention group: medication counseling (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.017) and brown bag review (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.012). Secondary outcomes showed an effect on patients&#x02019; self-reported use of medication lists when buying drugs in the pharmacy (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The tailored program may improve implementation of medication counseling and brown bag review whereas the use of medication lists and medication reviews did not improve. No effect of the tailored program on the combined primary outcome could be substantiated. Due to limitations of the study, results have to be interpreted carefully. The factors facilitating and hindering successful implementation will be examined in a comprehensive process evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>

Implementation of evidence-based recommendations for drug treatment is a challenge in patients with polypharmacy. Reasons for the high prevalence of preventable negative health outcomes in this patient group can be found in different areas of care:</p><p>Suboptimal <italic>communication between physicians and patients</italic> about medication-related issues in both inpatient and outpatient settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] can cause medication errors due to inappropriate prescribing, low adherence to, or wrong application of a prescribed medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Prescribing and monitoring errors</italic> are common in primary and hospital care. They may lead to a potentially inappropriate medication (PIM), which can be determined by implicit criteria, such as the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and explicit criteria, such as the PRISCUS list, a German adaption of the Beers criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Medication errors according to implicit criteria appear in 5% of all prescriptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The PIM prescription rate in the elderly according to the PRISCUS list in Germany is relatively stable around 23% with only a small decrease within the past years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Patients taking PIM are at higher risk for ADR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and hospital admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Insufficient documentation and exchange</italic> of medication-related information between health care professionals are a potential cause of prescribing errors and ADR. Since there is no established electronic system for data exchange between different health care providers in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], to date the written, paper-based medication list of each individual patient is the most important document for medication-related information. Yet, deficiencies concerning the quality and availability of medication lists are well known: In Germany, only 25&#x02013;50% of patients with polypharmacy have a medication list [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Several studies showed discrepancies between the documented and actually taken medication in about 75% of the cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], with 25% of those discrepancies being considered potentially harmful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Due to lacking standardization, important information is frequently lacking or in case of handwritten medication lists not readable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The German health system</title><p>Hence, optimal care for multimorbid patients with polypharmacy requires information sharing between multiple prescribers, input of pharmacological knowledge into clinical decision making, continuous monitoring, and counseling of patients. This is particularly challenging for general practitioners (GPs) who act as main providers and coordinators of care for most adults with chronic diseases. Germany has no formal gate-keeping system in ambulatory care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and the GP is not necessarily the central care provider, so that patients&#x02019; medication regimens may be adapted by various physicians without communicating with a GP. As an attempt to strengthen the coordinating role of GPs, some German health insurances offer &#x0201c;GP-centered care contracts (HzV)&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For some HzV care contracts, regular participation in &#x0201c;quality circles&#x0201d; (QC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] is obligatory for GPs. QC comprise educational small group meetings of GPs of one geographical region and written feedback on their individual practice patterns and prescribing behavior on the basis of claims data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Evidence-based care</title><p>An increasing number of studies evaluate strategies to improve appropriate use of polypharmacy especially in older patients. Few studies have been done in Germany and difficulties of providing high-quality evidence in this field due to methodological challenges have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. So, it is still uncertain which strategies are most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For the study &#x0201c;Implementation of recommendations for polypharmacy in multimorbid patients (PomP),&#x0201d; we identified three core recommendations on drug management in polypharmacy patients from the research literature which are also recommended in a German guideline for multi-medication in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. They were chosen out of a range of recommendations, because they focus&#x02014;as described above&#x02014;on different aspects of care with substantiated deficiencies, namely communication, prescribing, and documentation:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>
<italic>Recommendation 1 on communication: structured medication counseling (SMC):</italic> All patients with polypharmacy and additional risk factors for medication problems should receive SMC at least once per year. Beside medication-related information, SMC comprises a complete inventory of the actually taken medication (so called &#x0201c;brown bag review&#x0201d;) and the assessment of patient adherence and possible application problems. A separate appointment should be planned for SMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. There is evidence that SMC increases patient satisfaction with health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and adherence and reduce ADR and hospitalizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It has been shown that better physician-patient communication leads to better health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Recommendation 2 on documentation: consequent use of medication lists</italic>: All patients with polypharmacy should take along an updated, complete, and comprehensible medication list, concordant with the template of the Drug Commission of the German Medical Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is consensus that medication lists are an important and useful document for HCP as well as for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], which is emphasized by the fact that the patients&#x02019; right to receive a complete medication list has been regularized by the German E-Health law enacted in 2015 (German Social Security Code 5, &#x000a7;31). It is plausible that medication lists have a positive influence on health outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Recommendation 3 on prescribing: medication reviews to reduce PIM:</italic> Physicians should review the medication regimens of patients with polypharmacy systematically with the aid of tools, such as the PRISCUS list [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or the MAI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Both tools integrate a substantial body of knowledge on drug treatment. There is evidence that systematic medication reviews reduce emergency department contacts at least in hospital settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Tailoring</title><p>Implementation of evidence-based practice in health care is often hindered by specific barriers or facilitated by enablers, also referred to as &#x0201c;determinants of practice.&#x0201d; Tailored programs are programs explicitly designed to address such previously identified determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This study is part of the &#x0201c;Tailoring Interventions for Chronic Diseases&#x0201d; (TICD) project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], during which five tailored programs have been developed and evaluated in randomized controlled trials according to a coordinated research plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

</p><p>Details of the tailored program have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Control</title><p>GPs in the control group were informed about the general aim of the study and thus about the three evidence-based recommendations we intended to implement. Consequently, they were aware about the &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; and the desired professional behavior. As the enrolment of patients into the study included the identification of patients at high risk for ADR, GPs in the control group were also aware of patients in need for intensified care in their practice. Beside this, they did not receive any further instructions or aids for the implementation of the recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome was the change in the degree to which the three core recommendations have been implemented into the primary care practice, measured by a set of self-developed indicators (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The decision for a combined, primary outcome (which had not been validated before) has its rationale in the logic model of the intervention (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and the peculiarities of implementation research: Our aim was to assess whether the implementation of the recommendations increased, i.e., whether the behavior of patients or GPs respectively changed, whereas it was assumed based on prior evidence that a change of behavior would lead to improved health outcomes. Since the recommendations comprised a number of different behavior patterns and since no validated outcomes reflecting the changes in behavior were available, we decided to use a range of indicators reflecting the desired behavior.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Indicators of successful implementation of the core recommendations (primary outcome)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Recommendation/implementation objective</th><th colspan="2">Indicator</th><th>Data source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">Recommendation 1: SMC incl. brown bag review was performed at least once</td><td>1a</td><td>Percentage of patients answering the item &#x0201c;Have you had an appointment for medication counseling with your GP within the last 9&#x000a0;months&#x0201d; in the affirmative</td><td rowspan="2">Patient questionnaire</td></tr><tr><td>1b</td><td>Percentage of patients answering the item &#x0201c;If yes, have you brought all your medication packages to this appointment&#x0201d; in the affirmative</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">Recommendation 2: patients take along medication lists meeting minimum standards</td><td>2a</td><td>Percentage of medication lists specifying the name of the active substance of each drug</td><td rowspan="5">Medication lists generated by the practice</td></tr><tr><td>2b</td><td>Percentage of medication lists specifying the reason for prescription for each drug</td></tr><tr><td>2c</td><td>Percentage of medication lists specifying the exact dosage for drugs taken as needed</td></tr><tr><td>2d</td><td>Percentage of medication lists containing instructions for the application of at least one drug</td></tr><tr><td>2e</td><td>Percentage of medication list with a date not older than 9&#x000a0;months</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Percentage of patients with long-term medication having a medication list with them</td><td>Oral survey in the practices</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Recommendation 3: GPs review the medication systematically using tools to reduce PIM</td><td>4a</td><td>The response scale of the item &#x0201c;Do you use the PRISCUS list&#x0201d; to review the medication of your patients?&#x0201d; was converted into a percentage value with always&#x02009;=&#x02009;100%, frequently&#x02009;=&#x02009;75%, sometimes&#x02009;=&#x02009;50%, rarely&#x02009;=&#x02009;25%, never&#x02009;=&#x02009;0%</td><td rowspan="2">GP questionnaires</td></tr><tr><td>4b</td><td>The response scale of the item &#x0201c;Do you use the MAI&#x0201d; to review the medication of your patients?&#x0201d; was converted into a percentage value with always&#x02009;=&#x02009;100%, frequently&#x02009;=&#x02009;75%, sometimes&#x02009;=&#x02009;50%, rarely&#x02009;=&#x02009;25%, never&#x02009;=&#x02009;0%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p>The data sources for the indicators were questionnaires to be completed on a tablet PC in the practice by patients and GPs at baseline and follow-up. Additionally, we planned to analyze the medication lists of the practices and patients. For this purpose, GPs were asked to send the medication lists they had stored in their practice for each patient to the study center at baseline and at follow-up. Furthermore, they were asked to copy and de-identify the medication lists the patients were carrying with them when coming to the practice to complete the questionnaires and send it to the study center. To determine the percentage of patients carrying a medication list with them, we conducted an oral survey in each practice: Each patient entering the practice in a defined time period of 4&#x000a0;h was asked whether he or she was taking long-term medication and whether he or she had a medication list with him or her. The responses were documented anonymously using a tally sheet. Since this survey was conducted at the practice level, the value for the indicator 3 (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) was identical for GPs working in a group practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>A set of questionnaires was used to assess medication-related outcomes at the patient level:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>a self-developed questionnaire assessing the use of medication lists;</p></list-item><list-item><p>the German Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] consisting of 13 item with a mean score ranging from 1&#x02013;5, higher values reflecting stronger patient activation</p></list-item><list-item><p>the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] consisting of 5 items with a score ranging from 5 to 25, higher values indicating higher adherence</p></list-item><list-item><p>the specific part of the German Beliefs About Medicine Questionnaire (BMQ-D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] measuring patients&#x02019; beliefs about the particular medication prescribed for them.

Linear regression models were fit to assess the effect of the tailored program on the summary score and each individual indicator. The primary outcome variables at GP level were calculated as the difference between the baseline and the follow-up assessment. Explanatory variables were treatment group and the baseline assessment. Generalized estimating equations were used to adjust for the clustering in practices, with PCPs on level 1 and GPs on level 2.</p><p>Further, secondary outcomes at the patient level were fitted using two-level linear mixed models for continuous outcomes, which were fitted using the restricted maximum likelihood method, and two-level generalized mixed models for binary outcomes using the residual pseudo-likelihood method, with practices on level 1 and patients on level 2. All models were adjusted for patient age, gender, highest number of prescribed drugs in one quarter of the year, and number of diagnosed chronic diseases. The score difference between follow-up and baseline was included as dependent variable in the linear mixed models, while intervention group and gender were included as fixed factors, alongside age, highest number of prescribed drugs in one quarter of the year, number of diagnosed chronic diseases and the outcome&#x02019;s baseline value, which were included as fixed covariates. The binary outcome at follow-up was included as dependent variable in the generalized mixed models, while intervention group, patient gender, and the binary outcome&#x02019;s baseline value were included as fixed factors, and patient age, highest number of prescribed drugs in one quarter of the year, and number of diagnosed chronic diseases were included as fixed covariate. For all models, type III tests for the intervention group effect were performed, confidence intervals for the effect estimate were calculated, and the ICC was determined.</p><p>All statistical tests were two-sided and a significance level of alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 was used in the analysis of the primary outcome. <italic>p</italic> values pertaining to secondary outcomes need to be interpreted descriptively.

We did not observe a significant difference in changes between groups and the treatment effects for the single indicators were heterogenous: Our results suggest that the implementation of structured medication counseling and brown bag reviews may have improved in the intervention group and small effects may be present on patients&#x02019; self-reported use of medication lists when buying drugs in pharmacies. On the contrary, some of the indicators for medication list use by GPs had&#x02014;though not significant&#x02014;a reverse tendency indicating a higher adoption of the recommendations in the control group.</p><p>Other tailored programs focusing on polypharmacy used similar strategies than those we selected for our program, such as academic detailing, education, treatment algorithms, patient information leaflets and paper bags [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. We did not include pharmacists, a frequently used strategy with heterogeneous effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], because this is difficult to implement in German primary care as collaboration of practices and pharmacists is not well established. Systematic reviews on interventions to improve polypharmacy often conclude that the effects of the interventions are conflicting and variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], so it remains unclear under which circumstances which strategy effectively improves the use of polypharmacy.</p><p>The fact that patients in the intervention group were more likely to receive medication counseling and a brown bag review during the previous 9&#x000a0;months than those in the control group suggests that the TI effectively induces changes on practice organization and related determinants. However, long-term implementation has to be examined. There are different possible reasons why the intervention had no or only a minor effect on the other two recommendations: The baseline performance for some outcomes was comparatively high, such as 90% of the patients having a medication list. In other German studies, this rate was lower between 25 to 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] indicating that there might have been a selection bias of practices and/or patients, maybe due to the fact that all practices participated in quality circles, where pharmaceutical issues are regularly discussed. The PIM prescription rate of 26&#x02013;32%, however, was comparable to larger studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, it may be possible that important implementation factors were not successfully addressed by the program, either because they were not identified or because the selected strategies were not effective. A comprehensive process evaluation which was conducted additionally to the main analysis to examine this issue, showed that fidelity to some of the intervention components was low and that some important barriers were not or insufficiently modified and deduced suggestions for improvement of the intervention (Jager C, Steinhauser J, Freund T, Kuse S, Szecsenyi J, Wensing M. A tailored program to implement recommendations for multimorbid patients with polypharmacy in primary care practices &#x02013; process evaluation of a cluster-randomised trial. Under review in Implementation Science). Other possible reasons for the low effectiveness of the trial might be related to limitations of the trial.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Limitations</title><p>A limitation of the trial is that the sample size was lower than planned, which may have led to lack of statistical power to detect intervention effects. On the other hand, we had to use a proxy measure for the power calculation which implies uncertainties regarding this calculation. Furthermore, we had to use a range of non-validated outcome parameters since no validated measures for the behavior change intended to be induced by the intervention were available. So it is unclear, whether the used outcome parameters reliably measure implementation improvement.</p><p>The baseline differences in patient characteristics (patients of the control group were by trend older, received more drugs and suffered from more chronic diseases) and the differences in practice structure (all GPs of the control group worked in single practices while GPs of the intervention group worked in group practices) might be relevant determinants for the implementation of guideline recommendations, especially since the ICC was extraordinarily high for several outcomes, suggesting that patient outcomes strongly depended on the practice with a high variance between practices.</p><p>Although we reduced the minimum age for inclusion to 50&#x000a0;years, the patterns for age, sex, family status, and living arrangements were similar to those of a German representative epidemiological study on multimorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Previous research found that 25% of patients suffering from at least 6 chronic conditions are younger than 50&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. This indicates that polypharmacy is not only a challenge in elderly patients but that also younger patients might profit from intensified care. This should be taken into account in further research projects.</p><p>Given the limitations of the study, the findings of the trial need to be interpreted carefully in an explorative manner. However, we believe that the information provided by the study is nevertheless useful for other researchers in the field of medication management&#x02014;a relatively young research field in Germany which is receiving more and more scientific and political attention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study examined a tailored program intending to improve the implementation of three evidence-based recommendations for the management of multimorbid patients with polypharmacy in primary care. No effect on the combined primary outcome could be substantiated. Yet, the results suggest that the program may lead to improved implementation of structured medication counseling and brown bag reviews, while only a marginal effect on the use of medication lists and no effect on the use of tools for medication reviews could be observed. Due to limitations of the trial, the results should be interpreted in an explorative manner. The factors facilitating and hindering successful implementation are examined &#x0feff;separately in a comprehensive process evaluation.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADR</term><def><p>Adverse drug reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMQ-D</term><def><p>German version of the &#x0201c;Beliefs in Medicine Questionnaire&#x0201d;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HZV</term><def><p>&#x0201c;hausarztzentrierte Versorgung&#x0201d; (GP-centered care contract)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>Intraclass correlation coefficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MA</term><def><p>Medical assistant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAI</term><def><p>Medication appropriateness index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MARS</term><def><p>Medication Adherence Report Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAM-13D</term><def><p>German version of the &#x0201c;Patient Activation Measure&#x0201d;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PIM</term><def><p>Potentially inappropriate medication</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PomP</term><def><p>&#x0201c;Implementation of recommendations for polypharmacy in multimorbid patients&#x0201d;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QC</term><def><p>Quality circles</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCS</term><def><p>Specific Concerns Scale (of the BMQ-D)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMC</term><def><p>Structured medication counseling</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SNS</term><def><p>Specific Necessity Scale (of the BMQ-D)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TICD</term><def><p>&#x0201c;Tailoring Interventions for Chronic Diseases&#x0201d; project</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the AOK Baden-Wuerttemberg (health insurance fund) for providing claims data and to the AQUA Institute (Institute for Applied Quality Improvement and Research in Health Care) for recruiting practices and for data management.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The study was funded by the European Union Framework 7 program within the theme HEALTH.2013.3.1-1 under grant agreement no. 258837.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly available due to German data protection directives but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CJ, JS, JSz, and TF designed the study with input from MW.
