situation as an epidemic and a worldwide problem<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. Since the 1980s, the rates of obesity have increased by about three times, in
regions such as the Middle East and countries such as China and Australia. Even in
countries with a lower prevalence, the rates observed are considered high. It is
estimated that, in the coming two decades, the increase in the number of new cases of
obesity will be over hundreds of millions<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>It is possible to observe that in countries where obesity affects a large proportion of
the population, such as the United States, investments are made in public and private
initiatives with the aim of preventing obesity among the young through Special Nutrition
Programs, interventions, programs and actions encouraging healthy eating and the
undertaking of physical activity<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>It is known that genetic and metabolic factors directly influence weight gain; however,
other factors, such as physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet and psychosocial stress
increase the risk of developing obesity. As a result, interventions geared towards these
factors must be undertaken to prevent or reverse the situation of obesity in the
individual and populational ambit<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In spite of obesity and the proposals for its treatment being widely publicized, as far
as is known, there have been few intervention studies aiming for the control not only of
body mass, but principally changes in behaviors of risk. In this regard, as part of the
therapeutic process, it is important to assess and determine how the individual feels in
relation to a possible change in behavior, and how to motivate the person to change his
or her lifestyle, as this will be reflected directly in the results desired and in
healthier standards<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>As a result, the Stages of Readiness for Behavioral Change (SRBC) model, or
trans-theoretical model (TM), is used for assessing behaviors related to the practice of
physical activity and eating and to propose necessary intervention strategies<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. It allows one to classify the individuals in their respective stages of change,
making a distinction between those subjects who are genuinely disposed to change their
lifestyle, and those who do not have the intention of doing so. It is emphasized that
the changes tend to occur more efficiently among those who are disposed to change
behaviors<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In the light of the above, this study's objective was to ascertain the effectiveness of
an intervention program on the anthropometric variables and on the Stage of Readiness
for Behavioral Change among women with excess weight. </p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>An intervention study, of the before and after type, undertaken with adult women with
excess weight (BMI&#x02265;25 kg/m&#x000b2;), resident in the municipality of Pai&#x000e7;andu in the Brazilian
state of Paran&#x000e1; (PR).</p><p>The sample was made up of women recruited in a study titled "Populational study
regarding the prevalence of risk factors and protection factors for cardiovascular
diseases in the metropolitan region of Maring&#x000e1; (PR)", undertaken in Maring&#x000e1;, Pai&#x000e7;andu
and Sarandi. In the municipality of Pai&#x000e7;andu, a total of 415 individuals were evaluated,
of whom 287 were female. Of the latter, 83 were overweight. All were invited to
participate in this study. </p><p>The 51 women who accepted to participate in the study were randomly allocated to two
groups, 25 in the intervention group (IG), and 26 in the control group (CG). Only 33
were evaluated at the end of the 16 weeks of intervention: 13 in the IG, and 20 in the
CG. The six women who dropped out of the CG did not attend for assessment at the second
point, in spite of numerous attempts at contact. In the IG, 12 women were excluded for
various reasons, with one having an orthopedic fracture, two becoming pregnant, and nine
alleging difficulty in traveling to the place where the interventions were undertaken
and/or lack of time. </p><p>All 33 women participating were subjected to a general protocol of assessment including:
identification of the sociodemographic characteristics, the taking of a patient history,
aptitude for the practicing of physical exercise, anthropometry and Stage of Readiness
for Behavioral Change (SRBC). The anthropometric assessments were undertaken through
measurements of body mass, height, and circumference of the waist and hips. Height was
determined with the person standing straight, their arms extended by their side and with
the hands turned towards the thighs. The feet were bare, with the heels together and the
weight equally distributed through both feet. </p><p>The measurement of the waist circumference (WC) was taken using a flexible tape measure,
at the midpoint between the costal margin and the iliac crest, with the individual
standing up and breathing normally. Central obesity was considered to be present when WC
was superior to 88 cm. In addition, the measurements referent to body mass index (BMI)
and waist-hip ratio were made using the Biospace InBody 520<sup>(r)</sup> multifrequency
bioimpedence device, which as well as being available in the signatory institution,
allows the study participants themselves to see the distribution of their body mass. </p><p>The ability for the practicing of physical exercises was determined through the
application of the PAR-Q questionnaire (Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire)<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The evaluation of the food-related SRBC and of physical activity (PA) was made through
applying the Stage of change (SoC) questionnaire, based on the transtheoretical model
proposed by American researchers and validated for the Brazilian context<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. The SRBC is determined according to the mean score obtained; values between 1
and 1.4 indicate a stage of precontemplation; between 1.5 and 2.4, contemplation;
between 2.5 and 3.4, preparation; between 3.5 and 4.4, action; and between 4.5 and 5,
maintenance<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. In order to ascertain the global stage of readiness for behavioral change, the
general mean of the scores obtained in each one of the domains was ascertained. </p><p>The intervention program was undertaken in the hall of the church located in the center
of the city, over 16 weeks. The assessments undertaken in the pre- and post-intervention
points took place outside this period in the two groups. All the materials, apparatus
and equipment (mattresses measuring 1.20 x 0.60 meters, stethoscope, manual
sphygmomanometer, heart rate monitor and portable digital weighing scales, with a
maximum capacity of 150 kg and an accuracy of 0.1 kg) used during the intervention or in
the assessments belonged to the researchers. It is emphasized that during the
undertaking of the activities, alternative equipment was used, such as broom handles for
stretching and 500 mL plastic bottles containing sand for lifting weights using the
upper limbs.</p><p>Body mass (in kilograms) was determined using a portable digital weighing scales
(maximum capacity of 150 kg, and accuracy of 0.1 kg). For determining height (in
meters), a circumference measuring tape was used. For calculating Body Mass Index (BMI),
the individual's weight (in kilograms) was divided by the square of the person's height
(in meters). The values were classified in: normal weight BMI &#x0003e;18.50 to 24.99
kg/m<sup>2</sup>, overweight BMI &#x02265;25 to 29.99 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and obesity BMI &#x02265;30
kg/m<sup>2(</sup>
<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. Central obesity (concentration of adipose tissue in the abdominal region) was
determined when the abdominal circumference was superior to 102 cm for men and 88 cm for
women<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>, measured at the midpoint between the costal margin and the iliac crest. </p><p>The intervention included the practicing of physical exercises, nutritional guidance,
and education in health. The physical exercises were undertaken three times a week, for
60 minutes, structured in three points: initial warm-up and stretching (15 min), aerobic
activity followed by localized exercises (35 min) and final stretching (10 min). The
participants were monitored using heart rate monitors, with the specific intensity for
each activity determined through the maximum cardiac frequency obtained through the one
mile walk test<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Health education and nutritional guidance took place fortnightly on an alternative
basis, over 60 minutes, and were always held on Mondays, prior to the program of
exercise. The health education was undertaken by a nurse, with sporadic participation
from specialists in the areas of endocrinology, nephrology, speech therapy, occupational
therapy and pharmacy, who provided specific guidance related to their areas of work. </p><p>The nutritional guidance was provided in the group, without individual diet-related
prescriptions. This involved various issues such as the food pyramid, energy density and
the nutritional composition of foods, the importance of macro- and micronutrients, the
appropriate way of preparing and consuming these, and encouragement to create new
food-related behaviors.</p><p>Prior to undertaking the comparisons of the results obtained in the pre- and
post-intervention points, the extent was ascertained to which the individuals who had
dropped out of the study resembled those who participated in it until the end; it was
observed that there was no significant difference between these in relation to the
variables of body and biochemical composition (lipid profile). Once evidenced that the
loss was random and not intentional, the results of the intervention were compared. It
is highlighted that it was not investigated whether the members of the control group
began/undertook a diet or physical activity during the study period. </p><p>The SPSS statistical package, version 18.0, was used for the statistical analysis of the
data; and the Shapiro-Wilk test was used for the distribution of these data. The
descriptive statistics used for characterization of the sample involve the measurements
of central tendency and dispersion (mean, median, standard deviation and interquartile
range). In the comparisons between the pre- and post-intervention points, in relation to
the domains/questions, the Student's t-test was used for the dependent samples, and
Wilcoxon's nonparametric test for the dependent samples. The improvement in the
anthropometric variables was ascertained based on the difference between the final and
initial measurements. The Chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were used to check
the association between the reduction of the anthropometric variables and the general
SRBC in the pre-intervention phase. A level of significance of 5% was adopted in all the
analyses. </p><p>The undertaking of the study was approved by the Standing Committee for Ethics in
Research with Human Beings (COPEP) of the State University of Maring&#x000e1; (Opinion N.
546/2011) and the wider project from which this study derived was approved by the
Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (RBR-6673s5). All the participants signed two copies
of the terms of free and informed consent. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the women in the IG was 43.08 (&#x000b1;11.79) years old, and in the CG was 49
(&#x000b1;8.86) years old. In relation to the purchasing power, the majority of the women were
classified as being from class C (70% and 75% of the IG and CG, respectively), while the
other women belonged to class A/B. In the IG, four women were overweight, seven had
grade I obesity and two had grade II obesity. In the CG, four were overweight, 12 had
grade I obesity, two had grade II obesity, and two had grade III obesity. </p><p>After 16 weeks, the women from the IG presented significant reduction for all the
variables analyzed. In the CG, no reduction was observed; on the contrary, an increase
occurred in the mean of three of the four measurements analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). </p><p>

</p><p>Regarding the behavior of what people eat, one can observe, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>, significant differences between the two points in relation
to six behaviors in the IG and to two in the CG, it being the case that in the IG, the
changes were related to the size of the portions and quantity of foods ingested, and
also to the adoption of a diet low in fat, although no other behavior which
characterizes this type of diet underwent a change. Attention is also called the absence
of change in relation to the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Among the women of
the CG, significant change was observed only in relation to the dressing used in the
preparation of salads, and in the substitution of fried foods by vegetables. </p><p>

values for body weight, BMI, WC and WHR only among the women of the IG, reinforcing the
efficacy of the intervention (physical activity and nutritional advice). The literature
indicates that interventions related to practicing physical activity and nutritional
guidance with women are capable of promoting changes in the anthropometric parameters,
mainly in those related to body mass and WC<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>The inclusion of new habits in the routine is indispensable for the success of any
intervention, especially when one compares various conditions prior to its beginning and
after its end, but also such that behaviors resulting from the intervention, and
triggers of positive results, may be maintained in the long-term. As a result, assessing
the readiness for behavioral change is important, as it determines the real
possibilities of this occurring, to the extent that it allows one to distinguish
individuals who are disposed to changing their lifestyle from those who do not have
well-defined plans in relation to this. In this way, one can avoid a negative evaluation
of the intervention in the cases in which the unsatisfactory results may be related more
to the fact of the individual not wanting to change behaviors/habits. </p><p>In the present study, it was identified that in the beginning, three participants of the
IG were in the contemplation stage, three planned to begin actions in the near future,
and seven had already begun them. In the CG, four women were in the contemplation stage,
15 in the preparation stage, and one in the action stage. Generally speaking, therefore,
the proportion of women who were in the preparation stage and action stage may be
considered similar in the two groups (76.9% in the IG and 80.0% in the CG). This
constitutes a positive aspect, as what is indicated most in intervention studies is that
participants are in these stages, as they indicate that the same are disposed to
practicing new behaviors<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In spite of the two groups' similarity, reduction in the means of the anthropometric
measures was only observed in the IG, which shows the importance of the intervention,
characterized by the practicing of physical activity and nutritional guidance for women
with excess weight. Another aspect which deserves to be highlighted is the fact that
five women who presented regression in the stage of readiness for action presented
reduction in the values of the anthropometric variables, which may have resulted from
the practicing of physical activity proposed by the intervention. </p><p>One study undertaken in Brazil with 662 adolescents indicated the direct relationship
between the stages of behavioral change and motivation for practicing physical exercise.
It was emphasized that as individuals advance in the stages of behavioral change, they
increase their strength of motivation for exercise and this makes the subjects more
self-determined to include physical exercise as a daily routine<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>
<sup>).</sup>.</p><p>It is highlighted that the simple progression from one stage of the transtheoretical
model to another more advanced stage allows the individual to present a profile which is
more favorable to physical activity and/or eating habits, thus reducing the risks to his
or her health<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In this regard, it was observed that the IG presented significant changes in the stages
of readiness for change after the 16 weeks of the intervention. This indicates that the
advice related to appropriate foods, and to the regular practicing of physical exercise,
caused the IG participants to effectively include certain changes in their day-to-day.
These changes involve three domains of the SRBC: the size and quantity of the portions,
the quantity of fat in the diet, and the practice of physical activity. The control
group did not present changes in any of the domains. </p><p>One study undertaken with 90 Iranian women showed there to exist a significant
association between the loss of body weight and the SRBC, emphasizing that for effective
changes to occur it is necessary for the individual genuinely to perceive her health
condition and to be in a stage of preparation and/or action. It also indicated the
importance of providing these subjects with support through systematized interventions
and in the long term, emphasizing that individual readiness to change may not be
sufficient. It is therefore necessary to intervene directly through offering activities
which promote food education, healthy habits, and the regular practice of physical
activity<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In Brazil, a study with 145 users of the health service, which used TM for assessing the
eating-related behavior, observed that individuals classified in the initial stages,
such as "contemplation" and "precontemplation" were more susceptible to having a diet
rich in fats. Those, on the other hand, who were in a stage of "action" showed greater
concern with the quality of their eating habits<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>. This condition, therefore, can be determinant for the individual who has as her
proposal to begin a process of behavioral change with the aim of losing weight.</p><p>In analyzing specifically the issues which are integral to each one of the domains of
the SRBC, one can observe that habits related to adjustment of eating habits determined
by quantity of food, consumption of fruits and vegetables and quantity of fat were
significantly changed for the women of the IG. It is emphasized that food choice is a
complex process which involves numerous determinants, such as experiences acquired
throughout life, influences of cultural ideals, personal factors, resources available
and demographic determinants, among others<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>).</sup>.</p><p>One factor which is related directly to success in behavioral change is the perception
of the risk that excess weight can cause in health. One Brazilian study which assessed
behavioral change related exclusively to consumption of fruits and vegetables indicated
that 83.3% of the individuals who were most concerned with appropriate consumption were
in the stages of action and maintenance<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>
<sup>).</sup>
</p><p>Another study which evaluated whether the SRBC are related to consumption of fat
evidenced that all the 131 women evaluated consumed more fat than recommended, and that
the consumption of fat was lower among the women who were in the stages of action and
maintenance<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. The authors emphasized that the use of the questionnaire for classification of
the SRBC makes it possible to identify the eating-related errors present and, as a
consequence, makes it possible to promote a direct and accurate intervention regarding
these<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>It is highlighted that, in recent decades, how Brazilians eat has changed in ways that
have been reflected directly in their body composition. One frequently-observed change
is the increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods, it being common for these
to contribute more than half of the total calories consumed. As a result, greater
consumption of ultra-processed foods is associated positively with the excessive
consumption of harmful substances such as fats, cholesterol, sodium and calories - and
negatively, with the consumption of carbohydrates, proteins and dietary fiber, which
triggers weight gain and metabolic changes<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>As a result, it is believed that nutritional guidance favors the development of
individual strategies which can influence the choice of foods, as with the quantity and
quality of what is consumed.</p><p>In spite of the low quality of evidence related to the impact of the interventions
regarding sustainable behavioral change, even with multi-professional actions, it is
observed that the individuals evaluated through this model tends to seek improvements in
the quality of their food, principally reducing consumption of fat and increasing
consumption of fruits and vegetables<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>, as observed in the present study. One systematic review on interventions based
in theoretical models indicates, with a strong degree of evidence, that individuals
benefit from the diet-related changes implemented<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>As well as a balanced diet, the habitual practice of physical activity is a fact which
contributes, both to weight loss and to the maintenance of body weight<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>. The domain corresponding to the active behaviors presented significant results
for the IG after the intervention, with emphasis on the issues related to daily habits.
Based in the results presented, it is highlighted that the women of the IG presented
significant changes regarding the inclusion of daily habits of physical exercise. </p><p>It is emphasized that there is a shortage of studies, particularly in the Brazilian
ambit, addressing the impact of interventions on changing behaviors and lifestyle. This
is probably related to practical difficulties in holding this type of study, such as the
constitution of homogenous groups and the impossibility of controlling the dropping-out
of volunteers over the course of the studies. </p><p>The limits of this study's results relate to the small number of participants, which
made it impossible to generalize from its results; to the possibility of contamination
between the groups, as the study was undertaken in a small municipality, it being
probable that at least some of the participants knew each other; and to the fact that
the participants of the IG had frequent contact with health professionals, which may
have influenced the results of this group (the Hawthorne effect). </p><p>In spite of these limitations, this study presents relevant contributions for the
advancing of knowledge in the area, in that its results suggest that interventions which
incorporate diet-related guidance, allied with encouragement to the practice of physical
activity in a group, may help to prevent the increase in rates of obesity in women. They
also indicate the need for further studies for a better understanding of the state of
readiness for action in behavioral change among women with overweight and obesity; and
likewise for studies which involve a larger sample and in which there is greater control
of the variables related to the intervention in the members of the control group. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study's results show that, generally speaking, the participants from the two groups
were predisposed to undertaking behavioral changes; however, only the women from the IG
presented anthropometric indicators that the changes had really taken place. </p><p>The results allow one to infer that for significant behavioral changes to happen, that
is, for there to be impact on the anthropometric components, it is not enough for the
individuals to present good indicators for disposition for change. It is necessary for
there to be support, encouragement and the offering of actions which aim to promote the
regular practice of physical exercise and a balanced diet. It is emphasized that in this
study in particular, the multi-professional support was important for the changes
observed to occur. </p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Paper extracted from Master's Thesis "Multiprofessional treatment for obese woman",
