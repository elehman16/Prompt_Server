An established and effective therapy for OSAS is treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which prevents obstructive apneas, stabilizes sleep <xref rid="pone.0093931-Latshang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-McArdle1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and reduces daytime symptoms <xref rid="pone.0093931-Engleman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. It is known that OSAS patients show alterations in brain activity, for example a slowing of the EEG during waking compared to healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0093931-Morisson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-Morisson2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, as well as reduced slow-wave activity (SWA), theta and sigma activity and slowing of sleep spindles during sleep <xref rid="pone.0093931-Dingli1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093931-Ondze1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The efficacy of CPAP treatment is reflected in the normalization of cortical activity after several months, as indicated by increased SWA during non-REM sleep and absent EEG slowing during wakefulness <xref rid="pone.0093931-Morisson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-Heinzer1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Since mountain tourism has increased during the last decades, it is nowadays popular to spend weekends and holidays at mountain resorts or lodges located at moderate altitudes between 1500 and 3000 m. Sleep at altitude is altered in healthy individuals. A shift towards lighter sleep together with an increase in central apneas has been observed at altitude <xref rid="pone.0093931-Hoshikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093931-NussbaumerOchsner1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Compared to the obstructive apneas observed at baseline in OSAS patients, central apneas induced by an ascent to altitude are characterized by the intermittent absence of the drive to breathe <xref rid="pone.0093931-AASMTask1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and are generated by the brainstem respiratory center as a response to changes in blood gas concentrations <xref rid="pone.0093931-CaruanaMontaldo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. One treatment for central apneas at altitude is acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor frequently used in the treatment of acute mountain sickness <xref rid="pone.0093931-Leaf1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Acetazolamide prevents central apneas at altitude through metabolic acidosis by its diuretic effects <xref rid="pone.0093931-West1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Sleep of OSAS patients at 490 m and at 1630 to 2590 m with and without CPAP treatment was investigated in three previous studies <xref rid="pone.0093931-Latshang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-NussbaumerOchsner2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-NussbaumerOchsner3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, in which acetazolamide was shown to reduce central apneas compared to placebo during sojourns to moderate altitude <xref rid="pone.0093931-Latshang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-NussbaumerOchsner2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In addition, as observed in healthy subjects <xref rid="pone.0093931-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, acetazolamide in OSAS patients reduced the apnea/hypopnea index compared to placebo and increased oxygen saturation and improved sleep quality (sleep efficiency, arousals, slow-wave sleep) <xref rid="pone.0093931-Latshang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-NussbaumerOchsner2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>While the positive effect of acetazolamide on breathing and sleep architecture at altitude has been investigated <xref rid="pone.0093931-Leaf1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, its effect on cortical oscillations remains unknown. Indeed, acetazolamide is known to reduced cortical excitability and for this reason has been used in the treatment of epilepsy <xref rid="pone.0093931-Staley1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>A primary aim of the present study was to examine the effect of acetazolamide on cortical activity as measured by the sleep and wake EEG at moderate altitude in OSAS patients. We used quantitative analysis of the sleep and wake EEG, namely spectral analysis, to quantify the changes in cortical activity. Due to its frequent use and beneficial effect on sleep quality, the impact of acetazolamide on brain function is of great interest. As some patients discontinue their CPAP therapy for short time periods for various reasons a secondary aim of this study was to investigate changes in cortical oscillations during non-REM sleep resulting from short-term discontinuation of CPAP therapy in previously CPAP-treated OSAS patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We analyzed data from two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trials <xref rid="pone.0093931-Latshang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-NussbaumerOchsner2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> to evaluate the effect of two doses of acetazolamide on the non-REM sleep and wake EEG spectra in OSAS patients with and without CPAP treatment.

In this way, effects that are due to altitude are present in both, placebo and acetazolamide condition. A direct comparison of the two should therefore reveal the impact of acetazolamide on the EEG spectrum independent of altitude. At both altitudes acetazolamide reduced power density in the lower frequency range from 1 to 9.6 Hz by approximately 10% compared to placebo at the corresponding altitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093931-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, power density at 13.2&#x02013;13.4 Hz was increased by 10&#x02013;15%. This change in the spindle frequency range (sigma activity) suggests that spindle peak characteristics may have been affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093931-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, absolute spectra). Thus, we further investigated the effect of acetazolamide on the spindle peak frequency and height in a subset of 34 subjects (those that showed a spindle peak in the non-REM sleep EEG spectra; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">methods</xref>).

Short-term discontinuation of CPAP treatment for a few nights reduced delta power (0.8&#x02013;4.8 Hz) and increased beta power (14.6&#x02013;20 Hz) most likely due to the occurrence of obstructive apneas.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Acetazolamide compared to placebo</title><p>Acetazolamide is a well-established and frequently used drug to treat acute mountain sickness (AMS) <xref rid="pone.0093931-Leaf1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and associated high-altitude periodic breathing <xref rid="pone.0093931-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In addition, acetazolamide is used to treat patients suffering from central sleep apnea due to heart failure <xref rid="pone.0093931-Javaheri1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The recommended dosage of acetazolamide is 250&#x02013;750 mg per day <xref rid="pone.0093931-Ritchie2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In the present two studies subjects received 500 mg in study 1 (250 mg in the morning and evening <xref rid="pone.0093931-NussbaumerOchsner2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>) and 750 mg in study 2 (250 mg in the morning, 500 mg in the evening <xref rid="pone.0093931-Latshang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>). While the dose administered in the morning was 250 mg in both studies, the evening-dose was twice as high in study 2 compared to study 1 (500 mg vs. 250 mg). Since the half-life time of acetazolamide is 6&#x02013;9 hours <xref rid="pone.0093931-E1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, one can assume that the morning-dose had minimal influence at night and the main effect on sleep and breathing variables was due to evening doses. Independent of the dose, acetazolamide reduced the total AHI, by abolishing central apneas, increased SpO<sub>2</sub> and reduced PCO<sub>2</sub> in both studies <xref rid="pone.0093931-Latshang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-NussbaumerOchsner2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In terms of sleep architecture, waking was reduced and percent of non-REM sleep and sleep efficiency were increased with acetazolamide. Changes in cortical activity as investigated by spectral analysis of the sleep and waking EEG were, however, only observed with the evening-dose of 500 mg in study 2.</p><p>The reduction of EEG power in the lower frequency range (1 to 9.6 Hz) and increase in spindle power after treatment with acetazolamide is very similar to the sleep EEG changes observed after administration of Benzodiazepines or analogs (Z-drugs) <xref rid="pone.0093931-Aeschbach1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093931-Brunner1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Binding of Benzodiazepines to brain GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors promotes binding of GABA and leads to hyperpolarization of the cells. Benzodiazepines thereby reduce the excitability of neurons <xref rid="pone.0093931-Treiman1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The GABA<sub>A</sub> ionophore is selectively permeable to chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub>

<sup>-</sup> and influx of Cl<sup>-</sup>, resulting in a more negative membrane potential <xref rid="pone.0093931-Staley1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Similar to Benzodiazepines, acetazolamide might lead to an increased efficacy of GABA-mediated inhibition. As a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide leads to renal bicarbonate excretion and limits the HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>-</sup> efflux from the GABA channel <xref rid="pone.0093931-Staley1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We therefore attribute the benzodiazepine-like effect (spectral &#x0201c;fingerprint&#x0201d;) of acetazolamide on the sleep EEG to reduced excitability of neurons due to GABAergic hyperpolarization induced by a reduction in bicarbonate concentration. Due to their inhibiting effect on neuronal excitability both, acetazolamide and Benzodiazepines, are also effective as anticonvulsants in epileptic patients <xref rid="pone.0093931-Staley1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-Treiman1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

Whether the changes in brain oscillations observed at the higher dose are beneficial or detrimental is unclear. On the one hand, the absence of changes to cortical oscillations of the lower dose may be advantageous as cortical oscillations remain unchanged. On the other hand, benzodiazepines and analogs are used to improve sleep quality and the benzodiazepine-like effect of the higher dose on cortical oscillations may positively impact sleep. Future studies should investigate the dose-dependent effect of acetazolamide on not only cortical oscillations but also other outcomes measures, such as behavioral testing (e.g. daytime alertness), to reach a final conclusion about the best dosage.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Short-term discontinuation of CPAP therapy</title><p>Treatment with CPAP improves sleep quality <xref rid="pone.0093931-Latshang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-McArdle1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-Fietze1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and reduces daytime symptoms <xref rid="pone.0093931-Engleman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-Morisson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093931-Engleman2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

In contrast to the aforementioned studies which examined previously untreated patients, we measured the impact of short-term discontinuation of CPAP treatment. We observed that independent of altitude (490 m, 1630/1860 m and 2590 m) non-REM sleep slow-wave activity (SWA; 0.8&#x02013;4.6 Hz) was reduced and beta activity increased, if OSAS patients discontinued their CPAP treatment for a few days.

A reduction in SWA and increase in beta activity was also observed in untreated OSAS patients compared to healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0093931-Guilleminault1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We therefore attribute the alterations in brain oscillations observed during a night where patients discontinued CPAP treatment mainly to be due to respiratory disturbances and subsequent micro arousals or EEG activation, while other factors such as fluctuations in oxygen saturation may have only minor effects on EEG activity.</p><p>SWA is considered a reliable indicator of sleep depth or sleep intensity and is used to measure sleep homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0093931-Borbly3" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.
