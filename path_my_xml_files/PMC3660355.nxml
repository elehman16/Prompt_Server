The recordings of the peripheral wave form were accepted if the variations in pulse height, diastole and pulse length were equal to or less than 7% as calculated by the software and the mean pulse height was above 80 mV. A quality index provided by the software was to be 80% or above. All recordings were made after 10 minutes of rest in a supine position, and were made in duplicate by the same trained observer on the right side of the patients.</p><p>The cfPWV was measured by recording the pulse wave at the site of the femoral artery followed by recording at the carotid artery along with simultaneous electrocardiograph recordings (ECG). The distance on the surface of the patient was measured from the suprasternal notch to the carotid and femoral arteries respectively and measure points were marked to ensure equal lengths of travel for the pulse wave at duplicate measurements made on the same day. The algorithm in the software subtracts the distances and PWVs are calculated with reference to the ECG. The SphygmoCor&#x000ae; software provides a validated generalized transfer function which performs all calculations of pulse wave measurements obtained through the applanation tonometer. The PWA included assessment of the augmentation index (AIx). The AIx is the difference between the second (P2) and the first (P1) systolic peaks expressed as a percentage of the pulse pressure (PP) and calculated as: ((P2-P1)/PP)*100. The AIx is dependent on heart rate (HR) and is therefore also reported as a value standardized to a HR of 75 beats per minute (AIx@HR75). HR at the pulse wave measurements as well as 24 h HR was recorded.</p><p>For the calibration of the pressure wave form in the general transfer function systolic and diastolic BP was measured manually as described below.</p><p>All measurements took place in the morning at 8 or 9 a.m. and patients were without intake of morning medication or food/drink.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Blood pressure measurements</title><p>Each recorded BP was based on three measurements after 10 minutes of rest. The first measurement was discarded and the average of the last two was used. Office BPs at the control visits were made with patients in the sitting position and at the pulse wave examination visits with patients in the supine position. Cuff width was selected according to arm circumference. All measurements were made by the principal investigator using sphygmomanometry.</p><p>24 h oscillometric ABPMs were obtained after measurement of pulse wave parameters. ABPM was made on the non-dominant arm with SpaceLabs 90217 equipment. Recorders were programmed to obtain measurements every 15 minutes during the daytime (8.00&#x02013;23.00 hours) and every 30 minutes during the night (23.00 to 8.00 hours).</p></sec><sec id="s2e3"><title>Ambulatory arterial stiffness index</title><p>For calculation of the AASI, the regression slope of diastolic on systolic BPs was computed for each individual 24 h BP recording and AASI was calculated as 1 minus the regression slope <xref rid="pone.0064549-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

The dose was chosen after considerations on safety regarding potential risk of hyperkalaemia in CKD stage 3&#x02013;4, as well as the intention of studying BP independent effects of eplerenone rather than reduction in arterial stiffness due to haemodynamic changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2e5"><title>Blood and urine analyses</title><p>All biochemical analyses were carried out at the Department of Clinical Chemistry at Herlev Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="s2e6"><title>Statistics</title><p>A sample size of 37 patients in each group was estimated according to the following criteria: a power set at 0.8, the level of significance at 0.05 and a minimal relevant difference in cfPWV between the groups of 1 m/s and a standard deviation (SD) of 1.5 m/s. Characteristics at baseline were compared by independent samples t-test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for dichotomous variables. Changes in outcome parameters were evaluated including only patients who completed the full 24 weeks by independent samples t-test.</p><p>Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to compare the changes in the two groups with adjustment for the baseline values of the particular variable (as recommended by Vickers <xref rid="pone.0064549-Vickers1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>).

Urinary albumin excretion was skewed and therefore log-transformed prior to analysis. Baseline data are presented as geometric means with 95%CI, and changes are presented as ratios with 95%CI.

Five patients did not complete the study, four in the eplerenone group and one in the control group. In the eplerenone group, three patients were withdrawn due to possible side effects: one due to recurrence of gout, one due to a feeling of swollenness of the tongue and one patient due to nausea, dizziness and general discomfort. The last withdrawal in the eplerenone group was caused by other serious non-renal disease resulting in acute renal failure.

It was reported, that for every 10% absolute increase in AIx the risk of all-cause mortality increased by 1.51 and CV mortality by 1.48 <xref rid="pone.0064549-London1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A similar result was found in pre-dialysis patients <xref rid="pone.0064549-Weber1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thus prevention of increase in AIx, as shown in the present study, may have important prognostic implications.</p><p>cfPWV was the same order of magnitude as in a previous study by our group in CKD patients of similar age <xref rid="pone.0064549-FrimodtMoller3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and in both studies cfPWV was higher than in healthy individuals of the same age (10 m/s vs. 8 m/s) <xref rid="pone.0064549-Borresen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. By contrast the baseline AIx levels in the present study are of the same order of magnitude as found in healthy individuals of comparable age <xref rid="pone.0064549-Borresen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and is somewhat lower than in our earlier study <xref rid="pone.0064549-FrimodtMoller3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, possibly because of better BP control and treatment with RAS-blockers in almost all patients. Still, the elevated cfPWV demonstrates conduit artery remodelling with room for improvement by therapeutic intervention. In clinical studies eplerenone has been found to reduce stiffness in resistance arteries and in the aorta in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients with normal kidney function and in elderly hypertensive patients <xref rid="pone.0064549-Savoia1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064549-White1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Thus, treatment for one year with 50 mg eplerenone daily reduced the in vitro stiffness in resistance vessels in gluteal biopsies when compared to treatment with the beta blocker atenolol <xref rid="pone.0064549-Savoia1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In another study, the calcium channel blocker amlodipine and eplerenone both caused significant reduction of cfPWV over 24 weeks, but the patients had very high baseline BPs and cfPWVs. Data on pulse wave reflection and kidney function were not reported <xref rid="pone.0064549-White1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A study in young normotensive, drug-free patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and normal kidney function showed an increased AIx, whereas cfPWV was the same as in a normal control group <xref rid="pone.0064549-Borresen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. It was proposed, that AIx was higher than expected according to age and kidney function due to early-onset changes in small resistance vessels, preceding hypertensive and uremic remodelling in the larger conduit vessels. This is in line with our results and Savoia et al <xref rid="pone.0064549-Savoia1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> where the lowering of AIx may be a result of eplerenone facilitating a reduction in peripheral resistance, which has seemingly not lost its adaptive abilities. A parallel group, placebo controlled study by Edwards et al in 112 patients with CKD stage 2&#x02013;3 reported significant reductions in cfPWV (&#x00394;0.8 m/s), and AIx (&#x00394; 5.2%) versus &#x00394;cfPWV 0.1 m/s and &#x00394;AIx 1.4% in the control group after 40 weeks of treatment with spironolactone <xref rid="pone.0064549-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Speculations on reasons for our results differing from those of Edwards et al <xref rid="pone.0064549-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> could be differences in pharmacological actions between eplerenone and spironolactone as well as shorter intervention time and a greater disease burden in the present study.</p><p>In the present study there were no changes in AASI, peripheral (office and 24 h) or central BP. Within the eplerenone group both 24 h systolic and diastolic BPs were reduced, though the change was only found to be significant for systolic BP. This may explain why AASI was not changed, since the two parameters changed in the same direction, and AASI is calculated from the regression line of diastolic on systolic BP. It is of note, that the 24 h systolic BP is almost identical to the office BP. This confirms a previous finding by finding by our group <xref rid="pone.0064549-Boesby1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, but is at variance with other studies, where 24 h systolic BPs are normally found to be lower than office BPs <xref rid="pone.0064549-Boesby1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064549-20031" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. An explanation for this could be the lack of night time dipping in patients with CKD <xref rid="pone.0064549-Boesby1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064549-ElungJensen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>The increase in arterial stiffness is a result of changes in the extracellular matrix as well as the contractile elements in the vessel wall. These processes are accelerated in CKD and ESRD, and may in part be due to increased levels of aldosterone <xref rid="pone.0064549-Briet1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. P-aldosterone levels are increased in CKD. This applies to those who are na&#x000ef;ve to treatment with RAS-blockers as well as to those in such treatment <xref rid="pone.0064549-Hene1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064549-Bomback1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Animal studies have shown that aldosterone induces inflammation leading to vascular fibrosis and that blockade of mineralocorticoid receptors reduce this response <xref rid="pone.0064549-Nehme1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The present study also investigated 24 h urinary albumin excretion, which was found in a previous study to be decreased during 8 weeks of treatment with eplerenone <xref rid="pone.0064549-Boesby2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. After 24 weeks the 24 h urinary albumin excretion was lowered by 40% in the eplerenone group, but unchanged in the control group. This difference did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>Safety evaluation showed increases in p-potassium and p-creatinine, as well as a decrease in eGFR, but there were no significant differences when compared with control patients and generally, the treatment with eplerenone 50 mg once daily was well tolerated. Despite this, it is important that patients with reduced renal function have potassium supplements withdrawn and p-potassium monitored frequently when treatment with eplerenone is initiated.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>The main limitation is that the number of patients needed according to power calculations was not obtained. The closure of the study was in no manner related to results or interim analysis. The study was planned within a fixed time frame which it was not possible to prolong. Power calculations were based on expected difference in cfPWV. Therefore there may be risk of a type 2 error concerning the lack of effect on that parameter. The difference in AIx between the eplerenone and control groups was significant, making sample size less of an issue. The duration of treatment time may have been inappropriate for remodelling of the conduit arteries, or the arterial stiffness may have been too advanced to respond fully to eplerenone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Add-on treatment with eplerenone in CKD stage 3&#x02013;4 may have beneficial vascular effects leading to attenuated pulse wave reflection.
