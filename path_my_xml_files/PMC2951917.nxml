We sought to demonstrate the feasibility of creating a simplified consent form for biobanking that comprises the minimum information necessary to meet ethical and regulatory requirements. We then gathered preliminary data concerning its content from hypothetical biobank participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We followed basic principles of plain-language writing and incorporated into a 2-page form (not including the signature page) those elements of information required by federal regulations and recommended by best practice guidelines for biobanking. We then recruited diabetes patients from community-based practices and randomized half (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;56) to read the 2-page form, first on paper and then a second time on a tablet computer. Participants were encouraged to use &#x0201c;More information&#x0201d; buttons on the electronic version whenever they had questions or desired further information. These buttons led to a series of &#x0201c;Frequently Asked Questions&#x0201d; (FAQs) that contained additional detailed information. Participants were asked to identify specific sentences in the FAQs they thought would be important if they were considering taking part in a biorepository. On average, participants identified 7 FAQ sentences as important (mean 6.6, SD 14.7, range: 0&#x02013;71). No one sentence was highlighted by a majority of participants; further, 34 (60.7&#x00025;) participants did not highlight any FAQ sentences.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our preliminary findings suggest that our 2-page form contains the information that most prospective participants identify as important. Combining simplified forms with supplemental material for those participants who desire more information could help minimize consent form length and complexity, allowing the most substantively material information to be better highlighted and enabling potential participants to read the form and ask questions more effectively.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Advances in genomic research are generating opportunities for progress toward the vision of &#x0201c;personalized medicine&#x0201d;&#x02014;tailoring risk reduction, diagnosis, and treatment strategies to individual patients to improve health, prevent disease, and potentially reduce healthcare costs <xref rid="pone.0013302-Hamburg1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013302-Personalized1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

Although the collection, storage, and research use of biospecimens and data are typically thought to involve minimal risk <xref rid="pone.0013302-National2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, information must be conveyed during the consent process that can be complex or controversial. Examples include the use of biospecimens and data for future research that is unspecified at the time of consent; indefinite storage; ongoing medical record access; contact for future research; large-scale data sharing; development of commercial products; privacy and confidentiality protections; participants' access to research results; and the ability to discontinue participation.</p><p>At the same time, there have been continuing calls for consent documents to be simplified <xref rid="pone.0013302-National3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0013302-National4" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

In addition, although nearly half the adult population of the U.S. cannot read at higher than an 8th grade level <xref rid="pone.0013302-National5" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, few consent documents are written at less than a 10th grade level <xref rid="pone.0013302-Beardsley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0013302-LoVerde1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013302-PaascheOrlow1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0013302-Grossman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

In response to this challenge, we developed a simplified biobanking consent form comprising what we considered to be the minimum information necessary to meet ethical and regulatory requirements. We then gathered preliminary data from hypothetical biobank participants about whether the form included the information they would find most important to a decision about taking part in a biobank. Here we describe our form and the rationale for its content, as well as the results of preliminary testing with research participants.

As noted in our form, direct personal benefit from biobank participation is unlikely; rather, the benefits accrue to society at large if research discoveries are translated into clinical and public health practice. As per disclosures expected under the Common Rule, our form states that taking part in the biobank entails no additional costs to participants or their insurance.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Voluntariness and Alternatives</title><p>Federal regulations require a statement that research participation is voluntary and that persons can refuse without penalty or loss of benefits to which they are otherwise entitled.

This kind of choice is most easily implemented when biospecimens are originally collected for research on a specific condition. In such a case, a binary choice could be presented between consenting to future research that condition only, versus on other conditions as well. However, tiered consent may be inappropriate if the purpose of the biobank&#x02014;as reflected in our form&#x02014;is to provide biospecimens for a broad range of research, in which case providing participants with a list of potential types of research would be burdensome and uninformative <xref rid="pone.0013302-National6" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Our form suggests other kinds of choices that participants could potentially be offered; if implemented, these would necessitate a robust system to ensure that participants' stated wishes are followed.</p></sec><sec id="s2k4"><title>Certificates of confidentiality</title><p>Biorepositories may consider using Certificates of Confidentiality to help protect identifiable research information from forced disclosure <xref rid="pone.0013302-National6" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. When in effect, consent forms must contain appropriate language that describes the protections and limitations a Certificate provides <xref rid="pone.0013302-National9" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013302-Beskow2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>In addition to satisfying basic regulatory and best practice requirements using language that is easy to read, we believe the level of detail provided in a shorter, simpler consent form should be guided by what a &#x0201c;reasonable person&#x0201d; would want to know in order to make an informed decision. Thus, after devising our 2-page document (not including the signature page) as described above, we recruited a diverse group of diabetes patients from community-based physician practices in Durham and Kannapolis, NC. (IRBs for the Duke University Health System and the Carolinas Medical Center-Northeast Medical Center approved this research and all participants provided informed consent.) Half of those recruited (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;56) were randomized to read the 2-page form, first on paper and then a second time on a tablet computer. (The other half was assigned to a group that read a longer form <xref rid="pone.0013302-Beskow3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.) Participants were encouraged to use &#x0201c;More information&#x0201d; buttons, available in each section of the electronic version on the tablet computer, whenever they had a question or wanted to know more (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013302.s003">Appendix S2</xref>). These buttons led to a series of &#x0201c;Frequently Asked Questions&#x0201d; (FAQs) that we developed based on the more detailed information available in a model biobanking consent form of traditional length (i.e., 6&#x0002b; pages) <xref rid="pone.0013302-Beskow3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Specifically, for each sentence in the longer form that was not already represented in the 2-page form, we devised a question that participants might ask to which that sentence was the answer. Through these FAQs, participants had access to every sentence they might plausibly see in a detailed form of traditional length.</p><p>Participants were asked to use the computer's electronic stylus to highlight specific sentences in the FAQs they thought would be important if they were considering taking part in a biorepository. Each participant received the following scripted instruction:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic>If you look at the answers to any of the Frequently Asked Questions, we would like to know whether they contain any information that&#x02014;in your opinion&#x02014;would be very important to know about taking part in a biorepository. If so, please highlight the sentences that have information that would matter most to you, if you were thinking about taking part in a biorepository.</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>In other words, we asked them, in essence, to identify information that we should consider adding back to our simplified form.</p><p>On average, these participants identified 7 sentences in the FAQs as important (mean number 6.6, SD 14.7, range: 0&#x02013;71). No one sentence was highlighted by a majority of the participants; thus, no clear mandate emerged for any specific item of information to be reincorporated into the main body of the electronic consent form. Further, 34 (60.7&#x00025;) did not highlight any sentences in the FAQs, which suggests that these participants felt the 2-page form already contained the most important information. Available evidence indicates that participants at least considered the other information; on average, they clicked on 5 of the 16 &#x0201c;More information&#x0201d; buttons (mean 4.7, SD 5.1, range: 0&#x02013;16).</p><p>These preliminary results suggest that the simplified form we had developed contains the information that most prospective participants identify as important to a decision about taking part in a biorepository. Obviously, some information not contained in the 2-page form was selected as important by some participants. The 10 sentences most often selected concerned medical record access, ethics review of proposed studies, information about re-contacting participants about additional research, privacy risks, and participant access to individual research results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013302.s004">Appendix S3</xref>; many of these items have been incorporated into the current version of the form (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013302.s001">Exhibit S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology <xref rid="pone.0013302-Presidents1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> recommended the creation of an integrated national network of standardized biospecimen repositories as well as continued efforts aimed at developing a standard consent template for the collection and storage of specimens and data for future research use.</p><p>We produced our form in response to this and other calls for the simplification of consent documents. Although longer than the 1 page form recommended by NCI <xref rid="pone.0013302-National4" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, we believe our form comprises the minimum information necessary to meet ethical and regulatory requirements. Further, it meets our goal of being easier to read (&#x0003c;7<sup>th</sup> grade reading level) and the results of our preliminary studies suggest that it contains the information that most prospective participants identify as important.</p><p>Clearly, however, informational needs vary at an individual level; approximately one-third of our participants wanted more details and there was little agreement on which items of information should be added to our form. Although we incorporated those most commonly selected, adding back every item of information that any individual might find important would undermine the goal of developing a shorter, simpler document that focuses on the most substantively relevant information based on a reasonable person standard. One solution proposed by those advocating simplified consent is the use of supplemental materials <xref rid="pone.0013302-National3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0013302-National4" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This approach could help minimize the length and complexity of the consent form, allowing key elements to be better highlighted and enabling potential participants to read the form and ask questions more effectively, while still providing additional details for those who desire them.</p><p>As with any model consent materials, it is imperative that someone using a form like ours customize it to convey accurately the specifics of the research at hand. Regulations and best practices do not in every instance point to one policy option, and in these situations, the content of our form represents one possible approach supported in the literature. However, there may be other ethically acceptable approaches and the fact that we selected one as a &#x0201c;placeholder&#x0201d; in our efforts to develop a simplified form should not be construed as a policy recommendation. For example:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>NCI Best Practices <xref rid="pone.0013302-National6" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> state the participants should be told &#x0201c;whether or not&#x0201d; they will have access to individual research results (Recommendation C.2.2.4). The language in our form sets a high threshold for such release, but some studies may set a different threshold&#x02014;particular those that aim to study participants' reactions to receipt of results <xref rid="pone.0013302-Beskow4" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our form suggests that participants who wish to discontinue participation will be offered various levels of withdrawal, but some studies may choose not to offer any options other than destroying the remaining sample, or may not have maintained a link that would allow the sample to be identified.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our form depicts several optional choices for participants, but a particular study might be designed to offer only some or none of these choices.</p></list-item></list><p>These three examples represent a general principle that applies to every section: It is essential that each be carefully considered and modified as needed&#x02014;ideally with an eye toward maintaining succinct and simple language&#x02014;to ensure that it accurately represents that research for which the form will be used.</p><p>Three steps are vital for finalizing a simplified approach to informed consent for biobanking. First, IRBs and institutional legal counsel must agree as to the ethical and regulatory sufficiency of the simplified form, within the context of a complete informed consent process. Second, there is a critical need for research to evaluate the simplified form (as compared to a &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; length form)&#x02014;again, within the context of a complete informed consent process&#x02014;with respect to prospective participants' understanding of what they are being asked to consent to, their satisfaction with the amount of information received, and their preference for one kind of form or another. Third, further study is needed on the effective use of supplemental materials. As one example, the FAQs we developed were simply a means by which to present additional information to participants in our preliminary study for consideration&#x02014;but it is possible similar FAQs might serve as a useful format for supplemental material. The effectiveness of this or other formats in promoting participant understanding and satisfaction, and the ways that supplemental materials should be incorporated into the informed consent process are important areas for future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0013302.s001"><label>Exhibit S1</label><caption><p>Simplified biobanking consent form.</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0013302.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0013302.s002"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>Annotated simplified biobanking consent form.</p><p>(0.10 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0013302.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0013302.s003"><label>Appendix S2</label><caption><p>Frequently Asked Questions.</p><p>(0.08 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0013302.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0013302.s004"><label>Appendix S3</label><caption><p>Additional sentences participants most often selected as important in preliminary testing.</p><p>(0.07 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0013302.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Jonathan McCall of the Duke Clinical Research Institute for editorial assistance and manuscript preparation, and Ashley Dunham, Laveina Dash, Whitney McLeod, and Maria Fawzy for their assistance implementing this study.
