home-based modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT). </p></sec><sec><title>Method:</title><p>Aprevious randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the addition of
trunk restraint to the mCIMT. Twenty-two chronic stroke survivors with mild to
moderate motor impairments received individual home-based mCIMT with or without
trunk restraints, five times per week, three hours daily over two weeks. In this
study, the participants were separated into dominant group, which had their
paretic upper limb as dominant before the stroke (n=8), and non-dominant group
(n=14) for analyses. The ability to perform unimanual tasks was measured by the
Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and the Motor Activity Log <italic>(</italic>MAL),

Four out of five stroke survivors experience acute upper limb
weaknesses and between 45% and 75% of the patients continue to have limited upper limb
function six months after stroke<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. According to Taub et al.<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, many patients use their nonparetic upper limb to perform their
daily activities, which progressively decrease the amount and quality of use of the
paretic upper limb. This learned non-use phenomenon is responsible for increased
weaknesses, decreased abilities of the paretic upper limb in performing unimanual and
bimanual activities, and restricted social participation<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Therefore, the treatment of such residual
deficits is critically important for the stroke population and Constraint-Induced
Movement Therapy (CIMT) has emerged as a promising intervention to improve upper limb
function after stroke<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. </p><p>Originally, the therapy was delivered for six hours a day over two weeks, but current
evidence suggested modifications to the protocol to improve the efficacy and efficiency
of the intervention regarding the patients'needs and preferences<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Nowadays, CIMT is clearly described as a
behavioral intervention, which allows patients to actively explore new possibilities of
actions and should be composed of three pillars: (i) intensive and repetitive
task-oriented training of the paretic upper limb, following the principles of difficulty
in the progression and involvement of functional training, carried out by shaping and
task practices; (ii) the transfer package, which includes a set of behavioral methods to
transfer the gains of supervised training to the individuals' real world; and (iii) the
restriction of the non-paretic upper limb during 90% of awake hours, during the training
days<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. </p><p>Most of the studies that investigated the effects of CIMT have demonstrated significant
gains in upper limb function, as well as increases in the paretic upper limb use during
daily activities<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Some of these studies also reported the
long-term effects of the CIMT, suggesting that the benefits were maintained up to two
years<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. A large randomized clinical trial with 222
participants found that, from baseline to 12 months, the CIMT group showed greater
improvement regarding performance and the amount and quality of use of the paretic upper
limb, compared with controls<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Although the
short- and long-term benefits of CIMT have already been described, it is well known that
most individuals have one upper limb which performs daily skills more proficiently<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Thus, it is possible that upper limb
dominance prior to stroke may interfere with the acquisition and the maintenance of
upper limb skills, due to the specific brain activation patterns or the amount of upper
limb use during daily activities. </p><p>The immediate influences of upper limb dominance after CIMT were examined only in one
study with nine individuals after stroke and no significant differences were found
between the participants who had their paretic upper limb as dominant, compared to those
who had the non-paretic upper limb as dominant<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.
However, improvements associated with the intervention were observed for both groups.
These results suggested that dominance may not interfere with the acquisition of upper
limb skills after an intensive unimanual intervention approach, but provided no
information regarding the influences of upper limb dominance on the maintenance of the
acquired skills. </p><p>Thus, the aim of the present study was to compare the immediate effects and the
maintenance of the effects after a home-based modified CIMT (mCMIT) on measures of upper
limb capacity and performance of individuals with chronic stroke, taking into account
their previous upper limb dominance, to better comprehend the influences of upper limb
dominance associated with this therapy. </p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study followed the design previously described regarding the protocol of a
randomized clinical trial<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12 </xref>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). The study was registered and allocated

</p><p>Data from 22 participants who had completed the two-week intervention of home-based
mCIMT with and without trunk restraint were analyzed to investigate the influences of
hand dominance on the acquisition and maintenance of the improvements. Since no
differences were found between the groups (with and without trunk restraint), the
present study included all subjects and took into account only the hand dominance
prior to stroke. For analyses, the participants were separated into two groups:
Dominant, for subjects whose paretic upper limb was dominant before the stroke, and
non-dominant, for subjects whose paretic upper limb was non-dominant before the
stroke. Hand dominance was reported by the individuals when asked which hand they
used to write a sentence. The severity of the motor impairments was determined based
upon the upper limb items of the Brazilian version of the Fugl-Meyer scale, with mild
scores ranging from 51 to 66, and moderate ones, from 26 to 50<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. </p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Chronic stroke survivors were recruited from the general community of the city of

restraints from well-trained physical therapists, five times per week, three hours
daily over two weeks. They were encouraged to use a glove to restrict their
non-paretic wrist and fingers for 90% of the time that they were awake during the
two-week period. A diary was provided to all participants to record the amount of
time they wore the glove. Three-hour sessions of mCIMT included 30 minutes of the
transfer package exposure and applications of the items of the Motor Activity Log
(MAL)<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, followed by two hours and 30 minutes of
four shaping tasks, and one complete practice task. Task difficulty was individually
adjusted to be sufficiently challenging, as determined by the physical therapist, and
shaping techniques were incorporated, with increasing task difficulty over successive
sessions. Blood pressure measures were obtained before and after the interventions,
and heart rates were continuously monitored by a heart rate monitor (Polar, modelo S
610i)<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. </p><p>The MAL was developed to evaluate the effects of CIMT. This scale, adapted to the
Portuguese-Brazilian language, contains 30 items related to routine daily activities
undertaken with the paretic upper limb. The individuals were asked about the amount
of use (AOU) and the quality of movement (QOM) with their paretic upper limb during
their daily activities. The MAL total scores were obtained by the sum of the answers
divided by the number of the assessed items, which ranged from five to zero. Higher
scores are indicative of better performance of the paretic upper limb<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. </p><p>Out of the 17 WMFT tasks, 15 were timed, and the maximum time allowed for the
completion of each task was 120 seconds, which was qualified in accordance with these
scores. The test was always initiated with the examiner explaining and demonstrating
the execution of all of the tasks at both the slow and fast speeds. The evaluations
were videotaped, so that the functional ability, or the qualitative scores, was also
analyzed after the completion of the evaluations. All subjects were allowed to
perform the tasks with their non-paretic upper limb first for familiarization
purposes<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

All activities were timed and the maximum time allowed for the completion of each

researcher, who was blinded to the group allocations. All measures were analyzed with
intention-to-treat analyses, and descriptive statistics were calculated for all
outcome measures. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA), which controlled for the baseline
characteristics, were employed to analyze the effects of the intervention. The
results were reported as means and standard deviations or means and 95% confidence
intervals (CI). Repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by pre-planned contrasts, were used
to verify the main and interaction effects within and between groups for the four
time points. To better understand the influences of upper limb dominance on the
acquisition and maintenance of the improvements, the differences between the groups
were provided as means and 95% CI. This type of analysis was chosen because, while
the null hypothesis significance tests use probability levels (e.g. p&#x0003c;0.5), effect
size analyses focus on the magnitude of the differences between the groups and the
probability of an effect to report and interpret the results. This type of
description assists in determining the clinical interpretation and importance of the
observed differences, as well as the statistical significance of the findings<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This was the first study to investigate the influence of upper limb dominance prior to
stroke on the acquisition and maintenance of upper limb skills after an intensive
unimanual intervention approach. This modality of intervention was chosen due to its
characteristics (intensive, repetitive, and progressive practice) and proven efficacy
(short- and long-term effects). Although a previous study with a small sample<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> suggested that upper limb dominance did not
interfere with the acquisition of upper limb skills, no information regarding the
long-term effects was provided. The results of the present study corroborated other
findings and demonstrated that the referred improvements in the AOU and QOM of the
paretic upper limb during unimanual tasks, as well as in the time to perform bimanual
tasks observed immediately after the mCIMT occurred, regardless of upper limb dominance.
However, the follow-up measures indicated that only the participants of the dominant
group were able to retain the gains in their unimanual abilities, while both groups
maintained their bimanual improvements. These results suggested that upper limb
dominance influenced the maintenance of unilateral improvements, but did not affect the
maintenance of the gains in bimanual skills. </p><p>The influence of the dominance of the upper limb in carrying out bimanual functional
activities was previously evaluated with stroke individuals. McCombe Waller and
Whitall<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28 </xref>conducted a training, based upon
bimanual activities with 22 individuals, 11 were paretic-side dominant and 11 were
pareticside non-dominant. They demonstrated significant training effects for the
dominant group<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. In the present study, the
training was specific to the paretic side, regardless of whether it was the dominant
one, therefore the dominant and the non-dominant UL received the same training intensity
and similar performances were expected for both groups immediately after the
intervention. Another issue is that CIMT involves the individuals' commitment as an
integral part of the transfer package, because it is an important behavioral therapy
imprint<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Thus, it was expected that all
participants, regardless of upper limb dominance, would demonstrate similar gains, as
was found in this study. </p><p>The maintenance of gains appeared to suffer the direct influences of upper limb
dominance. This could be explained by the interactions of the individuals in their
environment, guided by intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Individuals who had past experiences of
preferred use of one of the upper limbs prior to the stroke, as was the case of the
dominant group, would tend to return to their preferred patterns after the cessation of
the intervention. Then the individuals whose paretic side was the dominant side before
the stroke would have a greater tendency to maintain gains in unilateral activities, as
was evidenced by the maintenance of the MAL scores during the follow-ups only for the
dominant group. On the other hand, individuals whose paretic side was the non-dominant
side would tend to go back to using their preferred upper limb during unimanual
activities as before. Importantly, these results appear to be clinically meaningful. For
example, Lang et al.<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32 </xref>demonstrated that
improvements of at least 1 point on the MAL scores were considered patient-perceived
meaningful changes for stroke participants. This minimal clinically important difference
indicates that the between-group differences immediately after the mCIMT were neither
statistically, nor clinically significant. However, the observed differences between the
dominant and non-dominant groups regarding the maintenance of the gains during the
follow-ups proved to be not only statistically, but also clinically, meaningful. Thus,
the results demonstrated that, immediately after training, the non-dominant group also
showed improvements in upper limb skills regarding the unimanual activities, but these
gains were lost over time. </p><p>Although some unilateral gains were lost after the interventions for the non-dominant
group, the findings of the present study demonstrated that both groups showed
significant improvements in their abilities to execute bimanual tasks immediately after
the intervention and that these within-groups gains remained after the cessation of the
intervention. These results indicated that intensive unilateral training promoted
bimanual ability improvements. Possibly, the achieved gains associated with the
intervention were incorporated during the performance of bilateral activities as
indicated by the improvements in the time to execute activities measured by the BAAS.
The results suggested that the paretic upper limb has the potential to be used after
unilateral intervention to help the non-paretic upper limb to execute bilateral
activities faster. In addition, the present findings suggested that individuals,
regardless of their upper limb dominance, managed to incorporate the immediate gains
when performing bimanual activities in their daily routines. These results suggest that
performance and capacity for carrying out bimanual tasks are important parameters to
measure the real effects of any therapy aimed at improving upper limb activity after
stroke. </p><p>The participants of the non-dominant group lost their abilities to perform unimanual
tasks after the end of the intervention, but their abilities to perform bimanual tasks
were maintained. Since during bimanual tasks they kept the same AOU of their paretic
upper limb, this adaptation was integrated into their daily routines, possibly becoming
a permanent change. Regarding the maintenance of unimanual gains for the non-dominant
group, strategies to monitor losses and avoid the return of the learned disuse
phenomenon would be required. These strategies could include periodic revaluations, home
guidelines or even more specific interventions, depending upon each case. </p><p>Significant gains in unimanual tasks after training, as evaluated by the WMFT, were
found only for the non-dominant group. This could be explained by the small sample size.
Considering that the WMFT baseline scores for the dominant group were higher than those
of the non-dominant, the sample size may have been insufficient to detect significant
changes. For the dominant group, there was a power of 0.12 with an effect size of 0.32,
whereas for the non-dominant group, there was a power of 0.26 with a similar effect size
of 0.38. Although previous studies demonstrated the immediate positive effects of the
CMIT on the paretic upper limb's unimanual capacity<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, variations regarding training duration and
participants' characteristics may also have influenced these different results. The
effects of dominance on unimanual capacity after mCIMT should be better investigated in
future studies. </p><sec><title>Study limitations</title><p>There are some limitations of the present study. Since the size of the two groups
differed and the values obtained at baseline, mainly for both MAL scores, were also
heterogeneous, the generalization of the present findings should be taken with
caution. Although there were between-group differences at the baseline MAL scores,
the groups were similar regarding the Fugl-Meyer motor assessment scores and the
muscle strength. For the confirmation of these results, studies with larger samples,
more homogeneous groups with specific criteria are necessary regarding the
interference of upper limb dominance. </p><p>There was no stratification of the participants regarding hand dominance prior to
stroke, which could have interfered with the acquisition of the gains. However, since
both groups equally improved after intervention, we believe that the participants
were similar regarding hand dominance prior to stroke or that possible differences
did not influence the results of the present study. Further studies are recommended
to examine the influence of hand dominance prior to stroke on the acquisition and
maintenance of upper limb skills. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Hand dominance did not interfere with the acquisition of upper limb skills, but
influenced the maintenance of the gains observed after the application of the mCIMT for
individuals with chronic stroke. The participants, whose paretic upper limb was the
dominant, reported improved ability in maintaining unimanual gains. The bimanual
improvements were maintained for both groups regardless the upper limb dominance
previous to stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Brazilian Funding Agencies: <italic>Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel
