This is an important comparison to draw, because Asians have been suggested to respond more favorably to calcium channel blockers and less favorably to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in comparison to Westerners. We sought to compare these two regimens in Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>174 patients were randomized to receive LST 50 mg once daily, which could be titrated to LST/HCTZ 50/12.5 mg at 4 weeks, followed by 100/25 mg at 8 weeks; or to receive amlodipine besylate 2.5 mg once daily, which could be titrated to 5 mg at 4 weeks, followed by 10 mg at 8 weeks to achieve diastolic blood pressure &#x0003c;90 mmHg.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At 12 weeks, the differences between the LST/HCTZ and amlodipine groups with regard to diastolic and systolic blood pressure were 1.2 mmHg (95% confidence interval: -1.1 to 3.4) and -0.5 mmHg (95% confidence interval: -4.3 to 3.4), respectively. The rates of achieving systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;140 mmHg were 66.7% in the LST/HCTZ group and 75.9% in the amlodipine group (p=0.20). The rates of drug-related adverse events were 15.6% in the LST/HCTZ group and 11.9% in the amlodipine group (p=0.49).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The two regimens, with a relatively higher dose of LST/HCTZ compared to that required in Westerners, produced equivalent blood pressure reduction and were comparably well tolerated in Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Drug combinations</kwd><kwd>Losartan</kwd><kwd>Hydrochlorothiazide</kwd><kwd>Amlodipine</kwd><kwd>Koreans</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In most hypertensive patients, two or more drugs are required to achieve target blood pressure goals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1)</xref> In this respect, combinations of two drugs in a single tablet (i.e., fixed combinations) carry the advantages of increased compliance and cost-effectiveness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3)</xref> Thus, their market share is rapidly increasing. Among the various fixed combinations of antihypertensive drugs, those of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) are most widely used because of their synergism in antihypertensive efficacy, as well as their counterbalance of side effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5)</xref></p><p>There have been several studies comparing the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a fixed combination of losartan (LST) (the first of the ARBs) and HCTZ with those of amlodipine besylate in Westerners.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9)</xref> However, these is little data in Asians, who have been suggested to respond more favorably to calcium channel blockers and less favorably to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors compared to Westerners.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10)</xref> In this study, we compared the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a fixed combination of LST and HCTZ with those of amlodipine besylate monotherapy in Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and study design</title><p>This study was performed with a multi-centre, randomized, open-label, parallel-group design at six sites in the Republic of Korea. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at each site.</p><p>The study consisted of initial screening, a 2-week washout period, and a 12-week active treatment period. Outpatients from 20 to 75 years of age with uncomplicated, essential hypertension were eligible for the study. All patients delivered informed consent before entering the study. Complete medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests were evaluated during the initial screening.</p><p>After the 2-week washout period, patients whose baseline sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) was between 90 and 114 mmHg were randomized to receive either LST 50 mg once daily for the LST/HCTZ group or amlodipine besylate 2.5 mg once daily for the amlodipine group. To achieve SiDBP &#x0003c;90 mmHg, regimens could be titrated to LST/HCTZ 50/12.5 mg at 4 weeks, followed by 100/25 mg at 8 weeks in the LST/HCTZ group. Similarly, in the amlodipine group, amlodipine besylate could be titrated to 5 mg at 4 weeks followed by 10 mg at 8 weeks. The treatment schedule is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>.</p><p>At each visit, sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP), SiDBP, and pulse rate were measured. Blood pressure was measured at the same time of the day, before dosing, in the same arm, and by the same investigator, at each center, with mercury sphygmomanometers manufactured by one company (W. A. Baum Co. Inc, New York, U.S.A.).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11)</xref> At each visit, patients were asked about adverse events (AEs).</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy and safety variables</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was the difference in the mean change of SiDBP between the two groups at 12 weeks. The secondary efficacy variables included the difference in the mean change of SiSBP; the mean change of SiDBP, SiSBP, and pulse rates; and the response rate defined as the proportion of patients whose SiSBP was &#x0003c;140 mmHg at 12 weeks.</p><p>Tolerability was assessed based on the incidence of overall (reported by the patients) or drug-related (adjudicated by the investigators) AEs, expressed as the proportion of patients reporting one or more AEs. The mean change in laboratory measures at 12 weeks was also assessed, including serum uric acid levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For the comparison of the two groups, the prespecified boundary for non-difference in the mean change of SiDBP was defined as [-6, 6] mmHg. Assuming the between-group difference in the mean change of SiDBP as 6.0 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 10 mmHg and an exclusion rate of 30%, we calculated that 88 patients per treatment group would provide 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference with a 2-sided &#x003b1; level of 0.05. Efficacy variables were compared using the analysis of covariance test. The pattern of serial changes in blood pressure through 4, 8, and 12 weeks was compared using the repeated measures analysis of variance test.</p><p>The efficacy measures were analyzed in two populations. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included the patients who had received at least 1 dose of the study drug after randomization, had valid baseline data, and had at least 1 valid post-baseline data. On ITT analysis, any missing post-randomization measures were estimated by carrying forward the last observed data. The per-protocol (PP) population included only those patients who had completed the 12-week treatment schedule and whose drug compliance was 75% or better. Tolerability measures were analyzed in the ITT population, which included all patients who took at least 1 dose of the study drug. The incidence of AEs was compared between the two groups using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test, where appropriate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>After the 2-week washout period, 176 patients were randomly assigned to the LST/HCTZ group (n=90) or the amlodipine group (n=84).

Both regimens were comparably well tolerated.</p><p>Previous studies comparing LST with amlodipine in Asian populations have reported comparable efficacy of the two drugs in reducing blood pressure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17)</xref> However, those studies have generally made an assumption that LST 50 mg is equivalent to amlodipine besylate 5 mg, which is based on the clinical data from Western populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9)</xref> In the present study, we adopted a relatively conservative strategy for the LST-based regimen, assuming that LST 50 mg is equivalent to amlodipine besylate 2.5 mg rather than 5 mg, that losartan/HCTZ 50/12.5 mg is equivalent to amlodipine besylate 5 mg, and that losartan/HCTZ 100/25 mg is equivalent to amlodipine besylate 10 mg in Korean patients. This strategy is partially supported by the report of Rhew et al., in which LST/HCTZ 50/12.5 mg once daily for 12 weeks did not significantly reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure in Korean patients with ischemic heart failure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18)</xref> Adopting this strategy, the patterns and degrees of change in SiDBP according to serial time points were nearly identical between the two groups, although LST 50 mg was more effective than amlodipine besylate 2.5 mg was in reducing SiSBP. However, it is still uncertain whether Asians, who have been suggested to respond less favorably to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and more favorably to calcium channel blockers than Westerners respond less favorably to ARBs.</p><p>In terms of tolerability, the incidence of amlodipine-related AEs in this study (11.9%) was notably lower than that (30%) in a previous summary of 40 placebo-controlled studies by Osterloh.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18)</xref> This difference might be attributable to the between-race difference in susceptibility to lower extremity edema, which potentially entails discontinuation of medication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20)</xref> The incidence of lower extremity edema in the amlodipine group in this study (1.1%) was markedly lower than that (11 to 24%) seen in previous studies of Westerners.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22)</xref> Indeed, only one patient reported lower extremity edema in the amlodipine group, which was not considered drug-related by the investigator.</p><p>Goldberg et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25)</xref> reported a placebo-like tolerability profile of LST in a previous pooled analysis of 2,900 patients treated in double-blinded clinical trials. Fixed combinations of LST/HCTZ 50/12.5 mg and 100/25 mg also demonstrated placebo-like tolerability profiles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26)</xref> Wu et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14)</xref> reported better tolerability of LST in an Asian population compared with amlodipine in a Formosan population. In the present study, the LST-based regimen and amlodipine-based regimen showed comparable tolerability in terms of the overall incidence of AEs (35.6% and 34.5%, respectively) and incidence of drug-related AEs (15.6% and 11.9%, respectively). Specifically, when even 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide was combined with LST in LST/HCTZ 100/25 mg, there was no increase in the incidence of AEs, suggesting the placebo-like tolerability of this regimen in an Asian population. There were no cases of significant uric acid elevation or dyslipidemia aggravation.</p><p>In summary, the two regimens, with a relatively higher dose of LST/HCTZ than that required by Westerners, produced equivalent blood pressure reduction and were comparably well tolerated in Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This
