Viral responses, immunologic responses, adverse events and drug resistence were monitored at baseline and the end of week 4, 12, 24, 36, 52. Viralogical response and immunological response were also comparaed in different strata of baseline CD4 T lymphocyte counts and plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations. At baseline, the plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.44&#x000b1;0.68, 4.52&#x000b1;0.71 and 4.41&#x000b1;0.63 lg copies/ml in group A, B and C respectively (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.628). At the end of the study, the plasma viral load reached 2.54&#x000b1;1.11, 1.89&#x000b1;0.46 and 1.92&#x000b1;0.58 lg copies/ml in group A, B and C respectively (p&#x0003c;0.001). At week 52, suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA to less than 50 copies/ml was achieved in more patients in group B and C than in group A (68.2&#x00025;, 69&#x00025; vs. 39.7&#x00025;; p&#x0003c;0.001). In planned subgroup analyses, the decrease of viral response rate was seen in group A when CD4 cell count &#x0003e;200/ul (subgroup H). But in subgroup L, viral response rate of three groups has no significant statistic difference. There were no statistically significant differences among three groups in immunological response wthin any of the CD4 or pVL strata. 3 out of 193 patients with available genotype at baseline showed primary drug resistant. Of 26 patients with virologic failure, 17 patients showed secondary drug resistant, 16 subjects in group A and 1 subject in group B. Logistic regression analysis indicated that presence of hepatotoxicity was associated with HCV-Ab positive (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.096, 95&#x00025;CI: 1.106&#x02013;3.973, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.023) and higher CD4 baseline (CD4 count &#x0003e;250/ul)(OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.096, 95&#x00025;CI: 1.07&#x02013;4.107, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.031).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings strongly support the use of 3TC&#x0002b;d4T and 3TC&#x0002b;AZT as the nucleoside analogue combination in NVP-based antiretroviral therapy. The regimen of AZT&#x0002b;ddI&#x0002b;NVP produced poor virological response especially in the stratum of CD4 count more than 200/ul. More patients showed secondary drug resistant in this arm too. Patients with HCV-Ab&#x0002b; and CD4 count &#x0003e;250/ul appear to have significantly high risk of hepatoxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00618176">NCT00618176</ext-link>

The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in profound suppression of HIV replication, substantial increase of CD4&#x0002b; T cells and partial reconstitution of the immune system.<xref rid="pone.0003918-Autran1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> All of these result in significant declines in morbidity and mortality from HIV/AIDS. In Western countries, twenty individual antiretroviral drugs, four fixed dose two-drug combinations, and two fixed dose three-drug combinations are available and many prospective, randomized clinical trials were performed to assess the efficacy and safety of HAART.<xref rid="pone.0003918-Bartlett1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> All these robust evidences were utilized to constitute the guidelines for occidental HIV/AIDS patients. In China, there are 650,000 people who are living with HIV infection, including about 75,000 AIDS patients.<xref rid="pone.0003918-Chinese1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Chinese government provide seven kinds of free-of-charge antiretroviral drugs which include Zidovudine (AZT), Stavudine (d4T), Lamivudine (3TC), Didanosine (ddI), Nevirapine (NVP), Efavirenz (EFV) and Indinavir (IDV). They are all generic drugs except for 3TC and EFV. About 16,000 AIDS patients have been treated with free-of-charge antiretroviral therapy. <xref rid="pone.0003918-Xinhuanet1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> The most popular drug combinations in China were NVP-containing regimens because of their convenience and tolerability. However limited data was come from trials of Chinese patients and no prospective randomized trial of different NVP-containing HAART strategies in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve HIV-1 infected subjects was performed to give the evidences to verify their efficacy and safety in Chinese patients. To address this question, we compared three regimens containing the nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor NVP with the combination of two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor AZT&#x0002b;ddI, 3TC&#x0002b;d4T or AZT&#x0002b;3TC with respect to antiretroviral potency, immunologic reconstitution, safety, tolerability, and the potential for drug resistence.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting consort checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003918.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003918.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>A.

In present study, we performed two separate and complementary analyses of these data: the analysis according to the actual treatment and the intention-to-treat analysis. For the analysis according to actual treatment, we included only patients for whom outcomes were measured at specified time points. The intention-to-treat analysis involved patients who underwent randomization, received at least one dose of study medication, and had at least one plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement after treatment began. Missing values were imputed for the analysis with the use of a last-observation-carried-forward method. When a continuous outcome variable is considered, we use analysis of covariance to control for baseline variables. The change between the baseline value and the follow-up value of a particular outcome is evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis test or Mann-Whitney U test. Using a chi-square test, we compared the rates of response among the treatment groups in terms of the percentage of patients with suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels to less than 400 copies per milliliter as well as the percentage for whom it was less than 50 copies per milliliter. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with the presence of certain outcome. For all tests, P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></list-item></list></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>A.

Mutations related to NNRTI (K103N/R, Y181Y/C, G190A, V106A, V179T/D, Y188L/C, K101E, F227L) were detected in 17 patients. Mutations related to NRTI (M41L, A62V, K65R, D67N/S, T69N/S, K70R, L74V, V75M, V118I, M184V, L210W, T215Y, 151 Complex) were detected in 8 out of 17 patients.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>F.

The baseline HIV pVL of HCV(&#x0002b;) subjects and HCV(&#x02212;) subjects were 4.43&#x000b1;0.72 copies/ml, 4.47&#x000b1;0.64 copies/ml (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.75). The baseline CD4&#x0002b;T cell count of HCV(&#x0002b;) subjects and HCV(&#x02212;) subjects were 231.1&#x000b1;75.6/ul, 218.0&#x000b1;75.3/ul (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.281). At the end of this study, 57.4&#x00025; HCV(&#x0002b;) patients and 57.9&#x00025; HCV(&#x02212;) patients achieved a pVL of less than 50copies/ml (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.952).

This was a prospective, multicentre study to evaluate three NVP-based regimens in terms of antiviral efficacy and tolerability in Chinese HIV-1 infected patients.</p><p>To date, information on the direct comparison among NVP-containing antiretroviral therapy has been scarce. The dissimilar criteria used of inclusion and exclusion in the studies makes it difficult to compare the efficacy of the regimens with different nucleoside backbones described in the different trial. In this study, we found significant difference over 52 weeks among three NVP-based regimens in the initial treatment of HIV-1 infection with regard to virologic response and resistance mutation. The regimen of AZT&#x0002b;ddI&#x0002b;NVP produced poor virological response especially in the stratum of CD4 count more than 200/ul. In the INCAS trail, the maximal effect in the AZT&#x0002b;ddI&#x0002b;NVP group was observed at week 16, with 68&#x00025; of patients demonstrating a pVL&#x0003c;20 copies/ml, with 51&#x00025; maintaining this level of suppression at week 52.<xref rid="pone.0003918-Montaner1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> One of the inclusion criteria of the INCAS trial was CD4&#x0002b;T cell count between 200&#x02013;600/ul. The discrepancy of virological response probably attribute to different ethnic group and CD4&#x0002b;T cell stratum. Few studies took the AZT&#x0002b;ddI&#x0002b;NVP regimen as an independent arm. So the result of this trial must be confirmed in other studies. Contrarily, the effect of treatment arm on the increase in CD4 count over time did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>In this study, two of the NVP-containing regimens: NVP&#x0002b;d4T&#x0002b;3TC, NVP&#x0002b;AZT&#x0002b;3TC, are effective in ART-na&#x000ef;ve patients, producing a durable virological and immunological response. There are no significant differences over 52 week between these two regimens with regard to virological response, immunological response, adverse events or resistance mutations at virologic failure. In a comparison with an Australian trial of the same NRTIs with NVP, the 3TC&#x0002b;d4T and 3TC&#x0002b;AZT arm of the current study had similar proportion of patients at the end of the study with plasma HIV RNA &#x0003c;50copies/ml. <xref rid="pone.0003918-French1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> And the finding of comparable virological efficacy between these two regimens in suppression to a pVL&#x0003c;400 copies/ml is compatible with the results of a systematic review of triple combination therapies in antiretroviral therapy-na&#x000ef;ve patients.<xref rid="pone.0003918-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> In this review, for patients using two NRTI and one NNRTI the overall percentage of patients achieving a pVL&#x0003c;400copies/ml after 48 weeks were 73&#x00025; and the overall percentage of patients achieving a pVL&#x0003c;50copies/ml after 48 weeks were 64&#x00025;. Our findings strongly support the use of 3TC&#x0002b;d4T and 3TC&#x0002b;AZT as the nucleoside analogue combination.</p><p>There were no statistically significant differences of virological response in any pVL or CD4 count strata. After 4-week therapy, there were no statistically significant differences of pVLs in any strata at all. And this trend lasted until the end of the study. Lower CD4 cell counts and higher viral loads at baseline were not associated with poorer virological outcome of HAART. A report from Andrew Phillips,<xref rid="pone.0003918-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> which was based on a large Europe cohort of patients starting HAART, found results broadly consistent with our own. On the other hand, in terms of immunological response, higher viral loads at baseline indicated greater increase in CD4 cell count. This is in line with one of the findings of the ACTG study.<xref rid="pone.0003918-Gandhi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> This may be because of eliminating the high stress of viral load result in significant CD4 cell count recovery. But at the end of this study, the advantage of great increase in CD4 cell count disappeared gradually. In western country, large cohort study demonstrated disease progression to death and AIDS or death was clustered among patients starting antiretroviral therapy with high pVL.<xref rid="pone.0003918-Hogg1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> It is needed to evaluate not only immunological response but also survival rate in a long-term assessment.</p><p>Primary resistance is common among adults recently infected with HIV-1 in North America and Europe. <xref rid="pone.0003918-Little1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0003918-UK1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> But in this study, primary resistance rate is much lower than reports from western country. This discrepancy occurs because antiretroviral therapeutics was available in china much later than weastern country and many of Chinese AIDS patients have been treated with free-of-charge HAART since 2003. One of the main results of this study was that there was a trend toward higher drug resistance rate in AZT&#x0002b;ddI&#x0002b;NVP group. This result explained, at least in part, the higher rate of virologic failure in this group. The higher rate of gastrointestinal disorders and food restrictions of ddI in this therapy group may affect treatment comp1iance. This may be the intrinsic reason of virological failure and drug resistance.<xref rid="pone.0003918-Conway1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>
</p><p>The safety profiles of the three therapeutic arms were also assessed in present study. Hepatotoxicity was the major adverse events of NVP-based therapy. Stern JO and his colleagues reported the increased risk of severe hepatotoxicity in women with CD4 count &#x0003e;250/ul and men with CD4 count &#x0003e;400/ul.<xref rid="pone.0003918-Stern1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> The result of this study is in line with the findings of Stern JO. The odds of hepatotoxicity increased significantly when baseline CD4 count is over 250/ul in all subjects and subgroup of women. The enrolling criterion of baseline CD4 count limits the analysis of odds of hepatotoxicity in men. This result supports the hypothesis that one of the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity is the hypersensitivity reaction.<xref rid="pone.0003918-Nez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> To our knowledge this is the first study that reports the association between the incidence of hepatotoxicity and the stratified baseline CD4 count in Chinese.Another important mechanism of hepatotoxicity is chronic viral hepatitis coinfection. We also found the association between the occurrence of hepatotoxicity and HCV antibody positive. This result is in line with the report of Sulkowski et al.<xref rid="pone.0003918-Sulkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> The overall incidence of hepatotoxicity is 20.7&#x00025;, a little higher than the reports of Sulkowski et al<xref rid="pone.0003918-Sulkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and 2NN study.<xref rid="pone.0003918-vanLeth1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> This differences may be explained by demographics.</p><p>The incidence of hyperlipidemia in treatment group A and C is accordant with the result of 2NN.<xref rid="pone.0003918-vanLeth1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> A higher rate of hyperlipidemia was found in treatment group B in the present study. This is probably related to the presence of d4T in the backbone nucleoside combination, a NRTI that is more likely to cause hyperlipidemia than AZT and 3TC.<xref rid="pone.0003918-PujariSanjay1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0003918-Dube1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> But the lipodystrophy was not occurred in this study because of the relative short period of study.</p><p>All of the three therapeutic arms contain at lest one of AZT and 3TC. As the papers reported <xref rid="pone.0003918-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0003918-Richman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, the hematologic toxic effects developed in three groups almost evenly. This adverse event occupied 29.9&#x00025; severe adverse events of this study and mostly occurred in the early three months of the treatment.</p><p>The adverse events such as rash, gastrointestinal disorders, peripheralneuropathy are always mild and can be controlled by symptomatic therapy. But it is important to well handle these adverse events because it may affect the adherence of HAART.</p><p>In conclusion, as virological response and incidence of viral resistance has been concerned, 3TC&#x0002b;d4T and 3TC&#x0002b;AZT as the nucleoside analogue combination of NVP-based HAART is recommended. The diversity of immunological response of three NVP-based arm do not reach the statistic significant. We confirmed that incidence of hepatotoxicity is significantly higher in subgroup of CD4 count &#x0003e;250/ul and subjects with HCV-Ab positive in Chinese.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003918.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.05 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0003918.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003918.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.07 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0003918.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The following clinical Insititutions or Hospitals participated this study: Beijing Youan Hospital; Beijing1 Ditan Hospital; The First Affiliated Hospital, Henan Medical University; Xian Tangdu Hospital; The 2<sup> th</sup> Affiliated Hospital, Xiangya Medical University; The Shanghai Public Health center; The Shenzhen CDC, The 8<sup> th</sup> Hospital of Guangzhou, The HIV/AIDS Care Center of Yunnan; Zhejiang Medical University.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This study was Supported by the National Key Technologies R&#x00026;D Programm for the 10th Five-year Plan (2004BA719A10).
