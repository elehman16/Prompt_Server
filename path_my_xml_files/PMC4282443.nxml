Per protocol (PP) populations included 133 and 131 patients in the BMV and CBD groups respectively. The mean adjusted TSS-4 significantly decreased through the study from baseline in both groups. The PP (primary) analysis of week 4 data revealed a &#x02212;0.288 (95% CI: &#x02212;0.610 to 0.034) not significant between-group difference in adjusted means, demonstrating non-inferiority of BMV to CBD. Non-inferiority was also demonstrated in the ITT analysis. The PGA and other secondary outcomes were significantly improved from baseline in both groups at week 4. The QoL score was slightly better in the CBD group at week 4, but no difference was observed at follow-up. No safety or tolerability concerns were observed in either group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>Centro Studi GISED, the centre led by LN, received a grant from IBSA Institut Biochimique SA.

All patients signed an informed consent form and were enrolled from April 2010 to January 2011. After a baseline visit they attended control visits at weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 while being treated with the study medications. After week 4, they entered an 8-week treatment-free follow-up period. Early entry into follow-up was possible if all target plaques were cleared or almost cleared before week 4. Patients attended an additional control visit during the follow-up in case of disease reappearance or significant worsening.</p><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible subjects were outpatients of both genders, aged 18&#x000a0;years or more, affected by mild-to-moderate stable CPP for at least 12&#x000a0;months, not requiring systemic treatment, involving less than 10% of the body surface area (BSA) with at least two bilateral plaques on extending parts of the limbs, i.e. knees and/or elbows, measuring &#x0003e;10&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> and &#x0003c;75&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> (surface area equivalent of one BMV dressing). Main exclusion criteria were as follows: non-plaque forms of psoriasis; use of antipsoriatic treatments for a period before inclusion (topical: 2&#x000a0;weeks, topical retinoids and any systemic antipsoriatic product: 4&#x000a0;weeks, biological therapies modifying immune responses: 1&#x000a0;year) ascertained or presumptive hypersensitivity to the active principle and/or formulations&#x02019; ingredients; severe systemic diseases (e.g. cancer) or cardiac, renal or hepatic impairment.</p><p>Two to four BMV dressings were applied to target plaques once a day and had to be worn for at least 20 consecutive hours. The control CBD ointment was applied once a day on target plaques in adequate amounts. The maximum dose was 60&#x000a0;g/week (8.5&#x000a0;g/day).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary efficacy outcome (endpoint) was the TSS-4 score assessed by the investigator at the end of treatment (week 4).

Assuming a 10% drop-out rate, at least 300 patients total, 150 in each group, had to be recruited.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group according to a computer-generated randomization list not accessible to investigators, generated in blocks of four with a balanced 1:1 ratio. Study investigators and independent assessors were blinded to treatment assignment. To minimize the risk of investigator unblinding, patients were instructed to remove the dressing at least 3&#x000a0;h before visits and to avoid applications of the control ointment before visits. Study coinvestigators always checked that the treatment sites were adequately cleaned before sending the patient to the blinded investigator for target plaque evaluation.</p><p>The following populations were considered for analysis: intention-to-treat population (ITT): all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study treatment; per protocol population (PP): all subjects in the ITT population who completed the treatment period, or discontinued the treatment period due to clearance of lesions, without major protocol deviations; safety population: all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study treatments. Missing values were replaced by the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method for up to visit 5 for the ITT and PP analyses. The primary and secondary efficacy variables were analysed in both PP and ITT populations. The primary assessment for non-inferiority was based on the PP analysis and verified by the ITT analysis.</p><p>Between-group comparisons for the primary efficacy outcome was performed using an <sc>ancova</sc> model with TSS-4 at week 4 as the dependent variable, treatment and centre as fixed effects and the baseline value of TSS-4 as a covariate. The significance of the difference between adjusted means was calculated using two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and <italic>P</italic>-values. As a sensitivity analysis, a comparison between treatment groups was performed for TSS-4 at weeks 1&#x02013;4 using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p><p>Individual symptoms, TSS-4 subscores, TSS-3, PGA, surface area of target plaques, DLQI total score and subscores were summarized at weeks 1&#x02013;4 by descriptive statistics. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the changes from baseline (V1) were calculated with their 95% CIs. Between-group comparisons was based on an ANCOVA model with values at weeks 1, 2, 3 or 4 as the dependent variable, treatment and centre as fixed effects and the baseline value of the individual symptom of TSS, PGA and DLQI, respectively, as covariates. The differences between adjusted means were calculated with two-sided 95% CIs and <italic>P</italic>-values. Rates of disappearance of active lesions were compared by the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test, adjusting for the centre. Assessments of treatment satisfaction were summarized at each visit by descriptive statistics; means and SDs of the changes from baseline were calculated with their 95% CIs; between-group comparisons were based on an <sc>anova</sc> model with patient's assessment of treatment satisfaction at weeks 1, 2, 3 or 4 as the dependent variable, and treatment and centre as fixed effects. The number and percentage of patients with relapse/rebound during follow-up period were calculated by treatment group with their 95% CIs. Time to relapse/rebound was summarized by descriptive statistics. AEs were coded using the MedDRA dictionary. The system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) were used for tabulation. Differences between groups were evaluated using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of 325 screened patients, 324 were randomized to BMV (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;165) or CBD (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;159), and considered evaluable for both safety and ITT efficacy analyses. Thirty-two and 28 patients in the BMV and CBD groups, respectively, did not complete the study protocol due to premature discontinuation and/or major protocol deviations and were therefore excluded from the PP analysis. Patients with minor deviations were kept in the PP analysis. Thus, the PP primary efficacy outcome analysis included 133 and 131 patients in the BMV and CBD groups respectively (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patients flow through the study. *Some patients were excluded from PP for more than one reason. **10 patients, two in the BMV and eight in the CBD group, had their target plaques cleared at the time of premature withdrawal and were therefore considered completers and included in the PP analysis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jdv0028-1226-f1"/></fig><p>Major protocol deviations (18 and 21 patients in the BMV and CBD groups respectively) were mainly related to baseline psoriasis severity (either too mild or too severe according to inclusion criteria for 28 patients, 13 in the BMV and 15 in the CBD group). Other major protocol deviations included use of non-permitted medications prior to enrolment (four patients), study treatment incorrectly assigned (five patients), end of treatment control visit performed outside the allowed range (one patient), severe systemic medical condition incompatible with the study (one patient). In addition, 17 patients in each group prematurely discontinued treatment, mainly due to voluntary withdrawal (19 patients) and lost to follow-up (12 patients). Of these, 10 patients (two in the BMV group and eight in the CBD group) had their target plaques cleared at discontinuation, and were therefore considered to have completed the protocol and were used in the PP efficacy analysis. A single patient might have had more than one reason for exclusion from the PP analysis: for instance, two patients (one in each group) of the 34 who prematurely discontinued were also found to have major protocol deviations. Finally, 153 patients (72 and 81 in the BMV and CBD groups respectively) with cleared/almost cleared target plaques entered and completed the 8-week observational treatment-free follow-up period

The response also was more rapid in the CBD ointment group according to TSS-4 reduction from week 1 onward.</p><p>In both treatment groups, the patients&#x02019; improvement during the study period was less marked according to photographic assessment of TSS-3 by an independent assessor than according to clinical evaluation of TSS-4 by the blinded investigators.</p><p>The mean exposure period was 26.3&#x000a0;days in the BMV group and 26.6&#x000a0;days in the CBD group. The number of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs; 20 in both groups) and the proportion of patients with TEAEs (8.48% in the BMV group and 9.43% in the CBD group) were comparable in both groups. No signs of skin atrophy on treated areas were noted in either group. Nasopharyngitis (two patients in the BMV and four in the CBD group) was the most common TEAE. Only one patient in the BMV group reported an adverse drug-related reaction (burning sensation). One non-treatment-related serious AE (stroke) was reported in one patient in the BMV group. This patient was the only one who discontinued prematurely the study due to a TEAE. No clinically relevant changes from baseline of vital signs were observed in either treatment group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This prospective, multicentre, randomized, assessor-blind study showed that the BMV dressing was non-inferior to the CBD ointment in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate CPP, according to both PP and ITT analyses of the primary endpoint (TSS-4 score at week 4). A statistically significant difference was noted between the two groups in the ITT analysis, but it did not reach the conservatively predetermined non-inferiority margin (1-point TSS-4 score), and thus may be considered to have limited, if any, clinical relevance. Overall, patients&#x02019; psoriasis and QoL significantly improved from baseline to the end of treatment in both groups.</p><p>Due to the different nature of the investigational products (dressing vs. ointment), a double-blind design was not applicable. The 10% drop-out rate observed in the study was acceptable, considering both the medical condition studied and the topical route of the treatments. The significant decrease in psoriasis scores from baseline to week 4, and the between-groups differences found in efficacy analyses demonstrate our study's sensitivity.</p><p>The comparison between the BMV dressing and CBD ointment is challenging as the former has a single active ingredient (betamethasone 17-valerate), whereas the latter has two active ingredients (betamethasone dipropionate and calcipotriol), which have been shown to be significantly more effective than either ingredient alone.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Accordingly, our study found several significant differences indicating CBD ointment's more rapid and robust effect during the treatment period, especially in the ITT analysis and on the hyperkeratotic component of psoriasis (scale/crusting). However, it should be stressed that these findings do not invalidate the BMV dressing non-inferiority conclusion based on primary efficacy analyses. Typically, the significant differences found in the ITT analysis were not confirmed in the PP analysis. Moreover, the statistically significant differences often appeared to be of limited clinical relevance. For example, considering that the mean number of target plaques was 2.5 and the difference in target plaque surface area between the treatment groups at week 4 was 3.9 and 6.4&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> in the PP and ITT populations, respectively, the mean additional benefit of CBD over BMV was 2&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> (1.5&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>) per target plaque.</p><p>It was surprising to note in both treatment groups that the photographic assessment of target plaque improvement by distant assessors displayed notably inferior results than those of the clinical assessments of the same plaques by blinded investigators. As this finding mainly depended on ratings of the &#x02018;erythema/redness&#x02019; subscore by distant assessors, we believe that it may have been caused by systematic alteration of colour reproduction on the digitalized photographs.</p><p>The 8-week follow-up treatment-free phase was included in the study according to current recommendations to observe relapse-free rates and durations. Among patients having reached target plaques clearance, relapse/rebound rates during follow-up were low and comparable in the two groups (14.5&#x02013;17% vs. 19.5&#x02013;20% in the BMV and CBD groups respectively). There was no difference in median time to relapse/rebound. A comparable 14% relapse rate was observed during a 12-week follow-up period in a previous randomized trial comparing the same BMV 0.1% dressing to a BMV 0.1% cream.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Both treatments were safe. Rates of TEAEs were low (&#x0003c;10%), similar in the two groups and consistent with the established safety profile of both products. All TEAEs were mild or moderate. We also found no indication that BMV dressing had atrophogenic potential, in accordance with previous clinical results.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>An important result of this study is the favourable impact on patients&#x02019; QoL, measured by the validated DLQI instrument. DLQI scores were significantly improved at the end of the study with both treatments (5.33-point and 5.62-point reductions in the BMV and CBD group respectively) with a significant difference favouring CBD at week 4, but not at weeks 1&#x02013;3, nor at the 3-month follow-up. Interestingly, the significant QoL improvement was preserved during the 8-week follow-up observational period in patients with complete remission of the disease in the BMV group (mean DLQI: 3.60&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.70; median: 2.00), whereas in the CBD group a more rapid worsening was reported (mean DLQI: 4.53&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.54; median: 3.00). Consistently, slightly better scores for the main efficacy variables (TSS-4, TSS-3, investigator- and patient-rated PGA) were reported at the end of the 8-week observational phase in the BMV group than the CBD group.</p><p>Our results are consistent with those of previous studies of the same products. In patients with mild to moderate CPP localized at elbows and/or knees, the BMV dressing was found to clear target plaques in 53% and 60% of patients after 3 and 5&#x000a0;weeks of treatment respectively.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The BMV reduced the TSS score by &#x02212;5.36 after a 4-week treatment in patients with baseline psoriasis severity similar to our patients (mean baseline TSS score: 6.91).<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Studies of the CBD fixed combination ointment over a 4-week period showed efficacy results that are consistent with the findings of this study.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>BMV dressing is non-inferior to CBD ointment in patients with mild to moderate CPP.
