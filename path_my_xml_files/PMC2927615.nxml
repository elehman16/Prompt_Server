The primary end point was development of RA (by ACR criteria) at year 1. Patients were monitored by radiography, MRI, CCP2, rheumatoid factor and 28 joint count Disease Activity Score (DAS28) over 2 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At year 1, 12/26 (46%) abatacept-treated versus 16/24 (67%) placebo-treated patients developed RA (difference (95% CI) &#x02212;20.5% (&#x02212;47.4% to 7.8%)). Adjusted mean changes from baseline to year 1 in Genant-modified Sharp radiographic scores for abatacepttreated versus placebo-treated patients, respectively, were 0 versus 1.1 for total score, and 0 versus 0.9 for erosion score. Mean changes from baseline to year 1 in MRI erosion, osteitis and synovitis scores were 0, 0.2 and 0.2, respectively, versus 5.0, 6.7 and 2.3 in the abatacept versus placebo groups. Safety was comparable between groups; serious adverse events occurred in one patient (3.6%) in each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Abatacept delayed progression of UA/very early RA in some patients. An impact on radiographic and MRI inhibition was seen, which was maintained for 6 months after treatment stopped. This suggests that it is possible to alter the progression of RA by modulating T-cell responses at a very early stage of disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT00124449.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) improved dramatically following the introduction of biological treatments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> and the increased focus on early intensive treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Despite these advances, current treatment requires chronic use of immunomodulatory agents, and prevention of the progression of early disease remains an important therapeutic goal.</p><p>Patients often present during an early undifferentiated phase of arthritis, and one of the challenges faced by rheumatologists (and clinical trial designers) is the classification of these patients. Seropositivity for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) is a useful biomarker in these patients, and indicates a high likelihood of progression to persistent and erosive disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Recent advances in our understanding of the genetics of RA susceptibility suggest that anti-CCP-positive RA may actually represent a distinct disease subset.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Given the strong predictive value of anti- CCP, it is particularly relevant to examine patients with early disease who are positive for this autoantibody.</p><p>Two previous studies have investigated the possibility of preventing disease progression in groups with very early arthritis. In the PROMPT study (PRObable rheumatoid arthritis: Methotrexate versus Placebo Treatment study),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> methotrexate monotherapy delayed progression to definite RA compared with placebo in a cohort of patients with undifferentiated arthritis (UA) with &#x0201c;probable RA&#x0201d;.

HLA molecules play an integral role in T-cell activation, and shared epitope HLA alleles are associated with the development of anti-CCP antibodies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> and anti-CCP-positive RA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Biopsy evidence demonstrates a predominance of activated T cells in active synovial joints,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> and RAlike symptoms are induced in immunodeficient mice following adoptive transfer of synovial T cells from patients with RA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> There is evidence of a specific therapeutic window for treatment; early synovitis destined to develop into RA is characterised by a distinct and transient synovial fluid cytokine profile, including several T-cell cytokines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Abatacept modulates na&#x000ef;ve T-cell activation and downstream cytokine production.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> It is a fully human, soluble fusion protein, which consists of the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) linked to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1. The CTLA-4 portion of the molecule interrupts the CD80/ CD86:CD28 costimulatory signal, mimicking a native homoeostatic mechanism of T-cell downregulation. In an experimental rat model, prophylactic administration of abatacept inhibited the onset of collagen-induced arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></p><p>Here, for the first time, the ability of T-cell modulation to alter the course of disease progression in patients with UA or very early RA was tested by assessing the efficacy of abatacept compared with placebo in a patient population who did not fulfil the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA and who were anti-CCP2 positive.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were aged &#x02265;18 years, met at least one, but no more than three of the ACR criteria required for RA diagnosis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> had symptomatic clinical synovitis of at least two joints and did not meet the classification criteria for any other rheumatic disease.

Although abatacept monotherapy did not prevent development of RA by the ACR 1987 criteria at 1 year (and therefore the primary end point was not met), it impacted radiographic and MRI progression for &#x02265;6 months after the cessation of treatment. A reduction in the level of anti-CCP antibodies was seen after 6 months that was still evident at year 1. This is the first study to demonstrate the efficacy of T-cell costimulation modulation with abatacept in a population of patients with UA or very early RA. The efficacy benefits observed with abatacept monotherapy were coupled with acceptable safety.</p><p>The reduction in anti-CCP2 levels observed after 6 months of abatacept treatment is suggestive of an effect on the underlying autoimmune process. Anti-CCP2 antibodies are highly predictive of the development of RA and, although not formally validated to assess disease activity, reductions in anti-CCP2 have been linked to improvements in clinical status in patients given biological treatments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> This is consistent with the effect on radiological damage that persisted beyond cessation of active treatment, which suggests that the impact of abatacept may be most substantial at the primary site of disease, affecting early synovitis. This is further supported by the inhibition of osteitis, the presence of which is strongly predictive of subsequent radiographic progression in patients with early RA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> These data support the concept of a therapeutic window, during which the course of disease may be altered,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> and several lines of evidence indicate a key role for abatacept in the inhibition of structural damage. Synovial biopsy data from abatacept-treated patients with RA are consistent with a regulatory role of abatacept in osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> and recent data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> have demonstrated that abatacept can directly inhibit the differentiation of osteoclast precursors, suggesting a further mechanism for the inhibition of erosion observed here.</p><p>Based on a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis, the cumulative rate of progression to RA (defined by the ACR 1987 criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) was lower in the abatacept than the placebo group throughout the 2-year study. Rates of DAS28-defined remission were more than twofold greater in the abatacept than placebo groups at month 6. Although the DAS28 has been validated in patients with RA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> it has not been validated in patients with UA, so swollen and tender joint counts may be a more clinically relevant assessment in these patients; the proportion of patients with zero swollen and tender joints was fivefold greater in the abatacept versus placebo groups at month 6. For both of these efficacy measures, rates remained higher in the original abatacept versus placebo group at year 1, despite treatment cessation.</p><p>Although the patients in this trial did not have RA as defined by the ACR 1987 criteria, approximately half already exhibited evidence of erosions at baseline, and it is likely that a significant proportion had early RA. At the time this study was designed (2004), a diagnosis of UA required the presence of inflammatory arthritis in patients not satisfying the ACR 1987 criteria for RA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> or any other rheumatic disease. However, owing to the low discriminative ability of the ACR criteria in patients with recent-onset arthritis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> it is generally accepted that patients may have early RA even if they do not meet the ACR 1987 criteria. Consequently, there is currently uncertainty around the terminology and classification of this group of patients, and the ACR criteria for early disease are currently under revision. It should also be noted that although the ACR criteria are commonly used in RA clinical trials, they do not represent a definitive diagnostic tool to assess the development of RA; it is likely that a number of patients included in this study may have actually been diagnosed with RA in clinical practice. Therefore, the &#x0201c;window of opportunity&#x0201d; for early treatment may have already passed for some patients.</p><p>Some limitations must be considered when interpreting these findings. In this exploratory trial, patient numbers were low and formal statistical hypothesis testing was not performed. Although the primary end point of the trial was not met, it is possible that significance might have been observed in a larger sample with greater statistical power. Over-time analysis of the primary end point (RA defined by the ACR criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) was not possible owing to the requirement for radiographic assessment. Although discontinuation due to lack of efficacy allowed estimation of time to RA development, &#x0201c;lack of efficacy&#x0201d; was defined by the treating doctor and so may not have been completely aligned with development of RA according to the ACR criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Finally, the small number of patients remaining in the study over time meant that analysis of efficacy data was not meaningful in the second year.</p><p>In summary, abatacept reduced anti-CCP antibody levels and maintained the inhibition of radiographic and MRI progression for &#x02265;6 months after treatment cessation in patients with UA or very early RA. Studies in larger patient populations will help to confirm these findings. These data suggest that it is possible to alter the progression of RA by modulating T-cell responses at a very early stage in disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Medicus International for their editorial assistance.
