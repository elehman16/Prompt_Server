Many of such patients experience some degree of radiation-induced cystitis during or after EBRT. There is currently no efficient treatment for preventing radiation cystitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective:</title><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of one of the safe mucilaginous herbs (Malva) in preventing radiation-induced dysuria in patients who are undergoing EBRT for prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From April 2013 to August 2014, 68 patients were randomized into two groups using four block randomization, 34 to the drug (Malva) group and 34 to the placebo group. Of the 68 patients who began the study, 60 completed it. They were instructed to use the medication, i.e., Malva or the placebo, three times a day for six weeks. They were followed by a physician every two weeks for eight weeks, and urinary function was assessed in each visit by asking questions based on the Visual Prostate Symptom Score (VPSS) and a dysuria severity score.

Radical prostatectomy and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with or without brachytherapy are the treatment modality of choice for many cases of clinically localized prostate cancer. However, EBRT often is associated with rather severe complications, including proctitis and dysuria (<xref rid="b1-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Dysuria is one of the most frequent adverse effects of brachytherapy and EBRT in patients with prostate malignancies. Given the high prevalence and increasing incidence of prostate cancer (<xref rid="b2-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), it seems essential to find an effective treatment for its treatment-related complications. Several studies have shown that cellular injury to the superficial layer of the bladder and the loss of glycos amino glycan (GAG) mucus are the main causes of dysuria during radiotherapy for prostate cancer (<xref rid="b3-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This pathogenesis is similar to that of interstitial cystitis, which is treated frequently with a mucilaginous drug known as pentosanpolysulfate sodium (Elmiron) (<xref rid="b4-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Malva species are used commonly in traditional Persian medicine (TPM) as a medicinal edible plant that provides therapeutic effects (such as anti-ulcerogenic activity) that can be attributed to its high mucilage content (<xref rid="b5-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This high level of mucilaginous material has a protective effect against injuries to mucous membranes and can relieve irritation and inflammation (<xref rid="b6-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). MalvasylvestarisL, which also is known as &#x0201c;Khobazi&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Panirak&#x0201d; and althea officinalis, which also is known as &#x0201c;Khatmi,&#x0201d; are Malva species that, according to TPM books and references, are mainly prescribed for urological problems, such as dysuria (<xref rid="b7-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Recent studies have concluded that Malva has anti-inflammatory, wound-healing, anti-oxidant, and anti-cancer properties (<xref rid="b8-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Polysaccharides and flavonoids are considered the main active ingredients of the Malva flower (<xref rid="b6-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In recent years, the anti-cancer properties of flavonoids and anti-oxidants have attracted a great deal of attention (<xref rid="b9-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Review of ethnopharmacological and phytochemical uses of M. sylvesatris suggested that this plant can be considered as an alternative treatment for treatment of radiotherapy-induced dysuria (<xref rid="b11-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this safe medicinal food for preventing radiation-induced dysuria in patients who are undergoing EBRT for prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><label>2.</label><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><label>2.1.</label><title>Trial design</title><p>We conducted this multi-centric, double-blind, randomized study after obtaining approval from our local ethics board and after receiving the registry code from the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (Registration code: IRCT2012100711026N1). Enrolment of subjects took place between April 28, 2013, and August 17, 2014, at three centers in Iran, i.e., Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital in Tehran, Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran, and Namazi Hospital in Shiraz. Sixty-eight patients were randomized into two groups using four block randomization. We allocated the patients randomly to the two groups, i.e., 34 patients to the drug group and 34 patients to the placebo group. After randomization and before starting EBRT, the patients received sachets containing four grams of equally mixed Althea officinalis and Malvasylvestris or placebo powder. They were instructed to use the medication (or placebo) three times a day for six weeks. Then, the patients were selected randomly to be treated with either Malva or placebo. The primary outcomes were changes in the severity scores for dysuria and in the the Visual Prostate Symptom Score (VPSS).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><label>2.2.</label><title>Patients</title><p>All patients who were planned with EBRT with diagnosis of prostate cancer and signed informed consent and were able to express dysuria and did not have Foley catheter were enrolled in the study.

Urinary function was assessed during each visit by asking questions based on the VPSS and a dysuria severity score scale 0&#x02013;10 (with zero representing no dysuria and 10 being the most intense pain possible). Patients rated their symptoms and severity of dysuria only in the past 24 hours, not for the past fortnight.

Four patients withdrew consent, one patient discontinued the placebo because the medication got stuck in his throat causing nausea and discomfort, and three others discontinued the placebo because it did not show any effects after two weeks of consumption. The median age of the 68 patients was 66 (range: 46&#x02013;88), and the median ages of the placebo and Malva groups were 65 (range: 46&#x02013;88) and 67 (range: 49&#x02013;74), respectively. The median Gleason score in all patients was 7 (range: 3&#x02013;9), and the median Gleason score of the placebo and Malva groups were 7 (range: 6&#x02013;9) and 7 (range: 3&#x02013;9), respectively. Fifty-five patients received hormonal therapy (24 patients in the placebo group and 31 patients in the Malva group). Thirty-nine patients were treated by radical prostatectomy and adjuvant EBRT (18 patients in the placebo group and 21 patients in the Malva group) and 21 patients were treated by definitive EBRT (10 patients in the placebo group and 11 patients in the Malva group). The median cumulative radiation doses administered as 95% isodoses to the prostate in both the placebo group and the Malva group were 70 Gy (range: 50.4&#x02013;76) and 70 Gy (50.4&#x02013;76), respectively. The characteristics of the patients and their treatments are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-epj-07-1220">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Twenty-one of 27 patients in placebo group (77.7%) had dysuria, while 23 of 33 patients (69.6%) who received Malva (odds ratio=2.70 for dysuria) had dysuria. The mean scale of dysuria was 2.5 in the placebo group and 1.1 in the Malva group. There were no differences between the placebo group and Malva group before EBRT based on the dysuria score (p = 0.79). After two, four, and six weeks of Malva treatment, dysuria due to EBRT was milder in the treatment group than in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (p = 0.005, p = 0.004, p = 0.001 respectively). On the whole, dysuria due to EBRT in the Malva group compared to the placebo group had statistically significant differences (p &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-epj-07-1220">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-epj-07-1220">Figure 2</xref> also shows the prophylactic effect of Malva on the severity of dysuria. There were no differences between the control group and the Malva group before the start of EBRT based on the VPSS (p = 0.43). After two, four, and six weeks of Malva treatment, VPSS due to EBRT was lower in the Malva group than in the control group, with statistically significant differences (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, p = 0.009, respectively). Overall, VPSS due to EBRT in the Malva group compared to the placebo group had statistically significant differences (p &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-epj-07-1220">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-epj-07-1220">Figure 3</xref> also shows the prophylactic effect of Malva on VPSS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><label>4.</label><title>Discussion</title><p>EBRT causes numerous acute and long-term complications, including proctitis and dysuria. The new treatment modalities, such as 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can diminish those complications and lead to a better quality of life (<xref rid="b1-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Some studies have shown that older patients traditionally suffer worse side effects from EBRT because they may have a slower rate of healing (<xref rid="b13-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, the median ages of the patients in the placebo group and the Malva group were 65 (range: 46&#x02013;88) and 67 (range: 49&#x02013;74), respectively, that was the similar ages for the placebo and Malva group. Some studies have shown that alfa-1 blockers, such as terazosin, have a relaxing effect on neck of the bladder neck, resulting in a better urinary function during radiation therapy (<xref rid="b14-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, none of the 60 patients in our study received alfa-1 blockers during EBRT or within six weeks after EBRT. In contrast, anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, have not been proven effective in alleviating the severity of dysuria during EBRT (<xref rid="b15-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). It seems that, in the management of radiation-induced urinary complications, apart from reducing the inflammation (<xref rid="b1-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), dealing with the overactivity of the detrusor muscle and urethral stricture should be considered (<xref rid="b16-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Malva species are considered to have both anti-inflammatory and spasmolytic effects (<xref rid="b17-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Moreover, they have a high content of mucilage and flavonoids (<xref rid="b5-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), which explains their protective effect on EBRT-induced urothelial cell damage (<xref rid="b3-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Currently, the use of herbs to treat patients who have prostate cancer is increasing despite the fact that only a few studies have been conducted in this field. Studies on the protective effects of cranberries on the mucosal layer of the bladder (<xref rid="b18-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) have shown no effect (<xref rid="b19-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20-epj-07-1220" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). There were some limitations in our study. First, it was a multi-centric study, so it clears that a double blind randomized clinical trial should have been done at a single institution to avoid inter-observer variations. Second, the number of patients (60) was considered small for accurate analysis of the potential protective effect of a drug in urinary toxicity induced by EBRT. Third, we did not evaluate late urinary toxicities (late cystitis) in our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this multi-centric, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, it was shown that a mucilaginous herb (Malva) had a strong, protective effect in relieving the pain associated with EBRT-induced urinary toxicity.
