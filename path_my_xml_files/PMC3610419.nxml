However, twice daily assessment of viremia and daily assessment of NS1 antigenemia indicated balapiravir did not measurably alter the kinetics of these virological markers, nor did it reduce the fever clearance time.

In countries where dengue is endemic, the case burden strains already fragile healthcare systems and has an economic cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C2">2</xref>]. There are currently no licensed vaccines for dengue (although late-stage trials are in progress), and mosquito vector control has been mostly unsuccessful or unsustainable.</p><p>Clinically apparent dengue manifests with a spectrum of symptoms. High fever, erythema, headache, and myalgia are common symptoms, and laboratory findings of leukopenia and mild thrombocytopenia are typical. The critical phase occurs around the time of defervescence, typically on days 4&#x02013;6 of illness, during which a transient capillary permeability syndrome manifests in some patients. In children particularly, capillary permeability can be significant enough to precipitate life-threatening circulatory shock, called dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Treatment is supportive, and the mortality rate for DSS in experienced hospital settings is &#x0003c;1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C2">2</xref>].</p><p>The magnitude of the early dengue virus (DENV) burden in patients with dengue has been associated with overall clinical outcome. For example, the early plasma viremia and/or NS1 antigenemia levels in pediatric dengue patients who develop clinically significant capillary permeability are higher than in patients without this complication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C6">6</xref>]. The higher antigenic burden in these patients is believed to trigger a cascade of immunological events that promotes capillary permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C7">7</xref>]. The association between high viral burdens in the first few days of illness and more severe outcomes has encouraged antiviral discovery efforts for dengue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C9">9</xref>], with the rationale that a reduction of the viral burden should result in a reduced incidence of severe complications and a lessening of symptoms and illness duration.</p><p>Balapiravir is a prodrug of a nucleoside analogue (4&#x02032;-azidocytidine) called R1479 and was developed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection by Hoffmann-La Roche. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C12">12</xref>]. Monotherapy twice per day for 14 days reduced plasma HCV levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner and was well-tolerated at doses up to 3000 mg in adult male patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C13">13</xref>]. However, the clinical development of balapiravir for HCV infection was stopped when clinical safety signals were detected in patients receiving extended courses (2&#x02013;3 months) of balapiravir therapy in conjunction with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Because HCV and DENV possess RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that share a similar overall architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C14">14</xref>], we explored a new indication for balapiravir by testing the in vitro activity of R1479 against DENV. Subsequently, the safety, tolerability, and antiviral efficacy of balapirivir in adult dengue patients were investigated in a clinical trial.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was conducted according to International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

Viremia was measured using a validated, internally controlled reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay in a Good Clinical Laboratory Practice environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C15">15</xref>]. The limit of detection was 357 copies/mL for DENV-1, 72 copies/mL for DENV-2, 357 copies/mL for DENV-3, and 720 copies/mL for DENV-4. The presence of NS1 in plasma was determined using the Platelia NS1 assay (Bio-Rad) and was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasma cytokine levels (interleukin 1&#x003b2; [IL-1&#x003b2;], IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, interferon &#x003b3; [IFN-&#x003b3;], and tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; [TNF-&#x003b1;]) were measured using a Bio-Plex human cytokine assay (Bio-Rad) and a multiplex array reader (Luminex Systems, Bio-Plex workstation from Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50-&#x003bc;L plasma samples were incubated with monoclonal antibody coupled beads. Complexes were washed twice, then incubated with biotinylated detection antibodies and, finally, labeled with streptavidin-phycoerythrin prior to analysis. Cytokine concentrations in samples were calculated by use of recombinant cytokines as standards and software provided by the manufacturer (Bio-Plex Manager). All research samples (for pharmacology, virology, and immunology) were collected and processed in the laboratory within 1 hour of venupuncture.

Other predefined key endpoints included fever clearance time, defined as the time from the start of treatment to the start of the first 48-hour period during which axillary temperature remained &#x0003c;37.5&#x000b0;C; maximum hematocrit level; maximum percentage increase of hematocrit level from baseline; platelet count nadir; and lowest recorded quality of life score.</p><p>Time to event endpoints were compared between treatment groups on the basis of Cox regression and continuous endpoints on the basis of linear regression. Analyses were adjusted for the predose value of the respective endpoint; viremia and NS1 endpoints were additionally adjusted for dengue serotype.

However, we used simulation to post hoc estimate the power of this trial to detect different effect sizes, expressed as log<sub>10</sub> viremia reductions per day due to active drug. We assumed that the effect of high-dose drug is twice as large as the low-dose effect and that the 32 recruited placebo patients are representative of the entire target population. We simulated drug effects of varying size on top of the observed viremia profiles for these 32 patients and then used bootstrap simulation to assess the power of an overall comparison of the AUC of log<sub>10</sub> viremia adjusted for serotype and baseline log<sub>10</sub> viremia between study arms (trend test) and of a pairwise comparison of high dose versus placebo. According to these simulations, the study would have had 80% power to detect a true reduction of 0.25 log<sub>10</sub> viremia per day (ie, one log<sub>10</sub> reduction over 4 days) in the high-dose group by both the trend test and the pairwise comparison at the 2-sided 5% significance level.</p><p>All analyses were performed with the statistical software R, version 2.11.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>In Vitro Inhibition of DENV Replication by R1479 in Huh-7 Cells</title><p>R1479, the active nucleoside released from balapiravir, inhibited replication of DENV reference strains and clinical isolates in Huh-7 cells with mean half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values of 1.9&#x02013;11 &#x003bc;M (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jis470/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>).

Immune Response and Virus Sequence Diversity</title><p>Plasma concentrations of TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and IL-1&#x003b2; were measured in serial (daily) plasma samples during the inpatient period and at follow-up (day 28). Concentrations of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-10 were transiently elevated during the 48&#x02013;96 hours after patient enrollment, but this was independent of the treatment assignment. Concentrations of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-13, and IL-1&#x003b2; were low and did not increase by &#x0003e;2-fold during the treatment period (data not shown). Changes in whole blood gene transcript abundance in serial samples collected at baseline and on study days 4 and 28 were also monitored, but there was no evidence of treatment-related effects on gene transcript abundance in subsequent samples (data not shown). Mutation rates in virus genome sequences in serial plasma samples from patients in the balapiravir and placebo arms were also not significantly different (data not shown). Collectively, these exploratory analyses are consistent with the predefined trial clinical and virological endpoints that suggest balapiravir did not measurably alter the disease evolution of dengue.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The development of antiviral therapies for dengue is, alongside vaccine development and vector control, a rational approach to reducing morbidity and preventing transmission. To this end, here we show that the nucleoside analogue R1479 reduces dengue virus replication in human cells in vitro. Balapiravir, a prodrug of R1479, was also safe and well-tolerated in adult dengue patients who received doses of 1500 mg or 3000 mg twice daily for 5 days. However, balapiravir treatment did not improve virological, immunological, or clinical measures of disease in patients who commenced treatment within the first 48 hours of their illness.</p><p>Balapiravir was well tolerated at both 1500 mg and 3000 mg dosage schedules. The range of clinical and laboratory adverse events observed in the balapiravir treatment arms were typical in Vietnamese adults with dengue and not different from those seen in the placebo arm. The rationale for stopping this exploratory study after a total enrollment of 64 patients was that the dengue transmission season was at an end and the number of patients eligible for enrollment had dropped significantly. Second, a planned joint review of the clinical and laboratory data by the sponsor and investigators led to the conclusion that balapiravir was insufficiently potent to warrant further clinical investigation.</p><p>Balapiravir treatment in this study was not associated with measurable changes in a range of virological, clinical, or immunological endpoints, despite evidence that the active moiety R1479 had anti-DENV potency in vitro. Several possibilities may explain this. First, the size of the patient cohorts meant that only large effects could have been detected (see the Methods section for further information on effect size). Second, concentrations of R1479 in plasma may have been insufficient to inhibit DENV replication. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses of balapiravir in hepatitis C showed a good correlation between exposure (measured as AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12 h</sub> or <italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub>) and antiviral effect (measured as reduction in plasma HCV RNA level) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C11">11</xref>]. In that study, dosing of 1500, 3000, or 4500 mg of balapiravir twice daily was associated with a dose-dependent increase in R1479 plasma exposure and antiviral effect. A mean plasma trough level 3.5-fold above the human serum adjusted HCV replicon EC<sub>50</sub> was achieved at the 1500 mg twice daily dose, and this ratio increased to 4.9 and 7.8 in the 2 higher dose groups. In contrast, no significant antiviral effect was apparent at the lower dose of 500 mg twice daily, for which the mean plasma trough level was similar to the HCV replicon EC<sub>50</sub>, even though <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was &#x0003e;5-fold above the HCV replicon EC<sub>50</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C11">11</xref>]. With a similar relationship between exposure and antiviral effect in DENV infection, mean <italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub> concentrations exceeding 6.7&#x02013;39 &#x000b5;M or <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> concentrations exceeding 25&#x02013;145 &#x000b5;M may be needed for the observation of antiviral effects of R1479 on DENV. This would argue for higher or more frequent doses of balapiravir. Dosing of 4500 mg twice daily of balapiravir achieved mean <italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub> of 21 &#x000b5;M and mean <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> of 88 &#x000b5;M in HCV-infected persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C11">11</xref>]. However, this more aggressive strategy might also be accompanied by increased likelihood of drug-related adverse events as seen previously with short-course monotherapy (4500 mg of balapiravir twice a day in HCV-infected patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIS470C13">13</xref>]. Third, the antiviral effect of R1479 is dependent on phosphorylation to the DENV polymerase inhibitor R1479 triphosphate. Phosphorylation efficiency can differ between cell types, and R1479 may not be efficiently phosphorylated in the primary DENV target cells in humans. Finally, although the median duration of illness history was &#x0003c;40 hours in all treatment groups, it is possible that the timing of treatment was too late in this patient population to demonstrate a marked antiviral effect above the level that the host adaptive immune response achieves. Indeed, it is striking that decreases in viremia were observed in the majority of patients within 24 hours of enrollment irrespective of the treatment assignment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIS470F2">2</xref>). This underlines the imperative of early diagnosis and treatment with antiviral candidates.</p><p>New therapies may require certain properties to be successful for the treatment of an acute infection such as dengue. Antiviral agents must be effective immediately to rapidly control viral replication. Problems of distribution, active metabolite formation, or protein binding may limit the effective response time. Consideration of prophylactic treatment at the first indication of symptoms may be needed to successfully impede viremia, but it will require a compound with a robust safety profile. Although the current study did not furnish evidence that balapiravir at the doses tested is a candidate drug for dengue, it is hoped that this marks the beginning of an intensive period of clinical research on dengue therapeutics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jis470/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/</uri>).
