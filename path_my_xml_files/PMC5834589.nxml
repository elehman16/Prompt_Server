</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Opioid agonists such as morphine continue to be important analgesics in the treatment of pain in the immediate perioperative and critical care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], although they are associated with numerous adverse drug events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In an effort to reduce opioid exposure and thus minimize opioid-related adverse drug events, non-opioid analgesics are being incorporated as foundational therapy into multimodal analgesia protocols for the management of postoperative pain. Numerous surgical and nonsurgical medical societies and accrediting and quality organization guidelines recommend the use of multimodal analgesia (MMA) in order to reduce exposure to opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Many also recommend scheduled use of non-opioid analgesics (paracetamol [acetaminophen], non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) as the first- line foundation of MMA.</p><p id="Par8">A recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] have suggested there is inadequate differentiation of intravenous and oral paracetamol to warrant the higher acquisition cost and longer time to administer the intravenous formulation. Given that opioids remain a key component of post-operative pain management, it is important to note that opioids, along with surgical stress may have a negative impact on orally administered drugs. Opioids inhibit gastrointestinal motility, including delaying gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and thus the route of administration of analgesics used in multimodal regimens may be an important consideration. Specifically, absorption of orally administered paracetamol may be compromised in patients receiving opioids, which could reduce efficacy. Furthermore, delayed absorption of orally administered paracetamol in patients receiving opioids could result in gastric accumulation of paracetamol, thereby markedly changing the pharmacokinetic profile during and after opioid administration.</p><p id="Par9">Paracetamol can significantly reduce the use of opioid analgesics when concomitantly administered&#x000a0;for the&#x000a0;treatment of&#x000a0;acute pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The use of intravenous paracetamol concomitantly with opioids has gained increased popularity for postsurgical pain relief over orally administered paracetamol because it provides an immediate peak plasma concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and is thought to provide a faster analgesic effect. Bioavailability of intravenous paracetamol is 100%, whereas the oral bioavailability of paracetamol can be as low as 79% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In a study comparing the pharmacokinetics of paracetamol 1&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;administered via intravenous, oral, or rectal routes, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 6&#x000a0;h (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;6</sub>) was 24.9, 14.2, and 10.3 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;h/mL, respectively. Absorption phase, variability in plasma and CSF were greater with oral and rectal administration than with intravenous administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Furthermore, in patients receiving opioids, the absorption of orally administered paracetamol may be delayed and could result in gastric accumulation of paracetamol, thereby markedly changing the pharmacokinetic profile. Opioid-induced inhibition of gastrointestinal function would not be expected to affect intravenous paracetamol pharmacokinetics.</p><p id="Par11">To assess potential interaction, the current study evaluated whether an opioid, intravenous morphine, commonly used to treat postsurgical pain, affects the absorption of oral or intravenous paracetamol and results in altered pharmacokinetics during and after co-administration in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par12">This was an institutional review board (IRB)-approved, randomized, single-blind, parallel, single-site, repeat-dose study (NCT02848729) in healthy adult subjects from 18 to 55 years of age (inclusive). The study was completed with four cohorts of subjects: both males and non-pregnant females were enrolled in Cohort 1, and male subjects only in Cohorts 2&#x02013;4. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 parallel groups: 4 repeat doses of 1000&#x000a0;mg oral paracetamol (2&#x000a0;tablets, 500&#x000a0;mg/tablet; Mallinckrodt Inc., Hazelwood, Missouri, USA) at hours 0, 6, 12, and 18, and a dummy 15-min intravenous infusion of saline at the same time points, or 4 doses of intravenous paracetamol (1000 mg/100 mL; Ofirmev<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Mallinckrodt Inc., Hazelwood, Missouri, USA) delivered as an infusion at hours 0, 6, 12, and 18, and 2 placebo tablets at the same time points. Intravenous morphine infusions (0.125&#x000a0;mg/kg in 100 mL saline, approximately 15&#x000a0;min; morphine sulfate injection 10 mg/mL, 1 mL, West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp., Eatontown, New Jersey, USA) occurred at hours 6 and 12 for all subjects. The total study duration for each subject was approximately 38&#x000a0;days. A drop-out rate of 50% was anticipated due to the required discontinuation of subjects who experienced emesis and the known association between morphine and emesis.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bioanalytical Method to Determine Plasma Concentration of Paracetamol</title><p id="Par13">Venous blood was collected by venipuncture in K<sub>2</sub>EDTA-containing tubes, and plasma was separated and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Quantification of paracetamol in plasma was performed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with paired mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Analysis of human plasma samples began on 16 March 2016 and was completed on 01 April 2016. Plasma samples were analyzed with a lower limit of quantitation of 0.100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL and upper limit of quantitation of 50.0&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL. Each calibration curve was calculated using a linear (1/concentration<sup>2</sup> weighted) least-squares regression algorithm. Precision and accuracy were evaluated by replicate analyses of human plasma quality control pools prepared at five concentrations spanning the calibration range. To demonstrate reproducible quantitation of incurred subject samples, approximately 10% of the study samples were re-assayed. Incurred sample repeats were considered acceptable if the original and re-assay values from two-thirds of the repeated samples had a relative percent difference of &#x02264;&#x000a0;20%. The results of the incurred sample repeats met the acceptance criteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p id="Par14">Venous blood samples (6 mL each) for measuring paracetamol concentrations were collected at the following times:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par15">up to 30&#x000a0;min prior to the administration of the first dose of paracetamol;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16">at 15, 30, and 45&#x000a0;min (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;min), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 h (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;min for hours 1, 2, 3, and 4; &#x000b1;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;min for hour 6) after the first paracetamol dose;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par17">at 30&#x000a0;min (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;min), 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 h (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;min for hours 1, 2, 3, and 4; &#x000b1;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;min for hour 6) after both second and third paracetamol doses;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18">and at 15, 30, and 45&#x000a0;min (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;min), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 18 h (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;min for hours 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12 and 18; &#x000b1;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;min for hour 6) after the fourth dose of paracetamol.</p></list-item></list>

Greater pharmacokinetic variability was seen following administration of paracetamol orally compared to intravenously, particularly after subjects were exposed to morphine. This variability could be attributed multiple factors: (1) much of the inter-individual inherent physiologic variability could be contributing to higher variance in absorption, (2) the uptake of paracetamol from the small intestine is much faster than from the stomach due to the greater surface area. An important consequence was that the absorption would be determined by the rate at which the drug was transferred from the stomach to the site of rapid absorption in the upper small intestine, (3) absorption also involved the process of dissolution from an orally administered solid dosage form and either the rate of transit from stomach or dissolution could be rate-limiting. Heading and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] found that rapid gastric emptying in 14 convalescent patients was associated with the early appearance of high peak plasma paracetamol concentrations, whereas peak concentrations were low and appeared late when gastric emptying was slow.</p><p id="Par38">Observed peak paracetamol concentration (<italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the 6-h dosing interval (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;6</sub>) were reduced in this study when oral paracetamol was co-administered with morphine, followed by an abruptly increased <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;6</sub> upon the discontinuation of morphine, indicating the absorption of the accumulated paracetamol entering the small intestine after the effect of morphine dissipated. Noticeable changes were also observed for time to reach maximum drug concentration (<italic>T</italic>
<sub>max</sub>) after the 3rd and 4th doses. Variability in <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;6</sub>, C<sub>6</sub> (paracetamol concentration before the following dosing time), as well as <italic>T</italic>
<sub>max</sub> around 3rd dose was significantly higher than that of first two doses, indicating the impact of morphine on oral paracetamol absorption varies substantially among individual subjects. In contrast, intravenous paracetamol demonstrated more predictable pharmacokinetics in the setting of concomitant opioid use.</p><p id="Par39">In this study, only two 0.125 mg/kg doses of morphine were given, whereas in clinical practice, patients may need more than two doses, which could have an even greater impact on gastric emptying and gut motility, resulting in greater accumulation of paracetamol following repeat oral dose administration. Once gastric function is restored upon the discontinuation of morphine, there is an abrupt release of unabsorbed paracetamol that enters the small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We observed a resultant approximate doubling in AUC (after the 4th dose of oral paracetamol), which may produce significant changes in paracetamol metabolism, as common pathways such as glucuronidation/sulfation get saturated and more drug is converted into the free radical metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which binds to and causes death of hepatocytes.</p><p id="Par40">In general, the pharmacokinetic profile of paracetamol following oral administration is known to exhibit considerable inter-subject variability due to differences in normal physiologic factors such as gastrointestinal movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The plasma concentrations of paracetamol and its absorption are apparently related to the rate of gastric emptying since faster gastric emptying is associated with the rapid appearance of high peak plasma concentrations, while the peaks occur late and are lower in patients with delayed gastric emptying. Gastric emptying likely influences paracetamol absorption directly by controlling the rate at which the drug is delivered to the small intestine. Consistent with the high inter-subject variability in pharmacokinetic profiles seen in the current study in subjects who received oral paracetamol, individual variation in the rate of drug absorption may be due largely to differences in the rate of gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, concomitant use of morphine in the current study introduced even greater variability in orally administered paracetamol exposures, plasma concentrations, and <italic>T</italic>
<sub>max</sub>.</p><p id="Par41">The interaction between morphine and orally administered paracetamol could be even more pronounced in postsurgical patients where factors such as concomitant medications and surgical trauma may further impair gastric function. This may result in inadequate pain control from orally administered paracetamol during opioid co-treatment and subsequent absorption of accumulated paracetamol upon cessation of opioid treatment.</p><p id="Par42">The results from this study are consistent with the pharmacokinetic results of the study by Singla et al 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. With respect to efficacy, plasma and CSF levels need to be considered, though it is difficult to correlate paracetamol CSF levels with efficacy, &#x02014;i.e.,&#x000a0;paracetamol has a central effect but concentrations in CSF are not predictive of (i.e., linearly related to) efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This is a limitation of the study by Singla et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The &#x0201c;effect compartment&#x0201d; is unknown and could be multiple locations (e.g.,&#x000a0;brain and spinal cord) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Paracetamol conversion to the active metabolite AM404 may result in active analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Low plasma concentrations following oral administration of paracetamol could impact efficacy relative to the intravenous route of administration. Plasma <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> may be a better predictor of efficacy than AUC, in that the passive diffusion of paracetamol into the CNS is highly dependent on the concentration gradient across the blood brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Post-operative intravenous paracetamol&#x000a0;previously has been demonstrated to provide faster onset of analgesia than a similar dose given orally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and, more recently, that only two-thirds of patients given an oral dose of 1 g paracetamol preoperatively achieved therapeutic plasma concentrations at any point compared to 96% in those given an intravenous dose of 1 g preoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">In the context of multimodal analgesia, when choosing medications to administer, increased efficacy, decreased adverse effects, and opioid reduction are the primary objectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, selection of non-opioids is imperative, and route of administration should be factored in, given opioid impact on gut motility, which impacts the pharmacokinetics of agents administered orally; substantial inter-subject variability could be the result of morphine&#x02019;s effect, or first- pass metabolism, or both.</p><p id="Par45">Results of this study suggest intravenous paracetamol is a better choice than oral paracetamol in patients receiving concomitant opioids until normal gut function can be demonstrated. A future study should evaluate the extent of the &#x0201c;burst effect&#x0201d; (i.e., the abrupt release of accumulated paracetamol at the end of morphine-mediated GI inhibition following oral administration), to evaluate both pharmacokinetics and safety (in particular, the impact on liver enzyme levels). The study should also aim to measure metabolites to determine the extent of NAPQI formation following the burst effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par46">This study demonstrated that morphine co-administration significantly impacted the pharmacokinetics of oral paracetamol, but not intravenous paracetamol, by significantly reducing/delaying its absorption and substantially increasing the inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability. The abrupt release of the accumulated paracetamol at the end of morphine-mediated gastrointestinal inhibition following oral administration of paracetamol is a safety concern, particularly given that additional postsurgical patient factors may impact gastric function. Intravenous paracetamol thus provides a better option for the management of postoperative pain in the context of multimodal analgesia.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par47">This study was funded by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals.
