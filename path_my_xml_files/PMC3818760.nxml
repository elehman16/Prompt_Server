both the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and primary sensoriomotor cortex (M1)
alters the response time in response inhibition using the stop-signal task (SST).
[Methods] Forty healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. The subjects were randomly
tested under the three: the pre-SMA tDCS, M1 tDCS, and Sham tDCS conditions. All subjects
performed a SST in two consecutive phases: without or after the delivery of anodal tDCS
over one of the target sites (pre-SMA or the M1) and under the Sham tDCS condition.
[Results] Our findings demonstrated significant reductions in the stop processing times
after the anodal tDCS over pre-SMA, and change response times were significantly greater
under the pre-SMA tDCS condition compared to both the M1 tDCS condition and the Sham tDCS
condition. There was no significant major effect after delivery of the tDCS for the go
processing times observed among the three conditions. [Conclusion] Anodal tDCS of the
pre-SMA or M1 during performance of the SST resulted in enhancement of the volitional stop
movement in inhibitory control. Our results suggest that when concurrently applied with
the SST, tDCS might be a useful adjuvant therapeutic modality for modulation of the
response inhibition and its related dynamic behavioral changes between motor execution and
suppression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Transcranial direct current stimulation</kwd><kwd>Stop signal task</kwd><kwd>Response inhibition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Response inhibition is usually attributed to suppression of an inappropriate action in
executive control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Deficits in response
inhibition are thought to be a key component of some neurological and psychopathological
disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies have investigated the cognitive processes of the
elective response between motor execution and suppression using the stop-signal task<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The stop-signal task (SST) is based on the stop-signal paradigm that is most suitable for
the study of response inhibition and is appropriate for the measurement of response times in
both motor execution and suppression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The SST initiates the &#x02018;go process&#x02019; or the
&#x02018;stop process&#x02019;, which is generated by the display of each stimulus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. When performing the SST, the go process is associated with
activation of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit, whereas the stop process is
associated with activation of the fronto-basal ganglia circuit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have reported that the pre-supplementary motor
area (pre-SMA) is especially involved in the initiation of self-paced actions and the
mediation of motor suppression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In addition, the primary motor cortex (M1) is also involved in volitional suppression as
well as movement preparation since they are mediated by its motor programming circuits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS), which are known as modulators of cortical excitability, have been used
to facilitate skill acquisition during the performance of a motor task<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the stimulation of cortical neurons by TMS or tDCS,
the excitability of cortical neurons is increased at the anode, and decreased at the
cathode. Decreased cortical excitability and increased intracortical inhibition have been
demonstrated; however, the details of change in cortical excitability during performance of
the SST are not fully understood. Despite evidence for a neural contribution to motor
execution by M1 or the pre-SMA, no evidence of the contribution to response inhibition in
the functional role of either area has been reported. Therefore, the objective of the
present study was to determine whether application of anodal tDCS to M1 or the pre-SMA
contributes to response inhibition during performance of the SST after delivery of tDCS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Forty healthy participants with no neurological or psychiatric history were recruited.
Participants were excluded if they had prior exposure to other sequence-learning studies
or externally-stimulated experiments of the cerebral cortex, such as transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). All participants
provided their written informed consent prior to participation in this experiment. Ethical
approval was obtained from the research ethics committee of Yeungnam College in accordance
with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects were randomly tested
under the M1-tDCS, pre-SMA tDCS and Sham tDCS conditions, on separate day.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Direct current was delivered by a battery-driven constant DC current stimulator (Phoresor
II Auto Model PM 850, IOMED, USA) and transferred through a water-soaked pair of surface
sponge electrodes (35&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>). To stimulate the primary motor cortex (M1), the
center of the anode electrode was placed over C3 or C4 (international 10/20
electroencephalographic system), which is well known as the neural representational area
of the motor function of the hand<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. To stimulate the pre-supplementary
motor area (pre-SMA), the center of the anode electrode was placed 4&#x02005;cm anterior to Cz
(international 10/20 electroencephalographic system) on the central midline, which is the
neural representational area of conflict resolution or monitoring in motor function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. This site of pre-SMA localization was
used in a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
cathodal electrode was placed over the contralateral supraorbital area.</p><p>The stop signal task (SST) was performed using a computer and stimulus presentation
software (STOP-IT, Universiteit Ghent, Belgium). It consisted of Go (75% of all trials)
and Stop (25% of all trials) trials. The Go signal, such as a square (&#x025a0;), circle (&#x025cf;),
diamond (&#x02666;), or triangle (&#x025b2;) was presented randomly on a monitor during conduct of the Go
trials. The Stop signal, the shape of an X, was displayed following a variable delay (the
Stop-Signal Delay, SSD) subsequent to the overlapping figure signal. The SSD was primarily
set to 250&#x02005;msec and was continuously adjusted with the tracking procedure in order to
obtain a probability of responding of 50%. That is, when the participant successfully
stopped, the SSD increased by 50&#x02005;msec, whereas, when the stop was unsuccessful, the SSD
decreased by 50&#x02005;msec. This setting reflected the response inhibition, which describesthe
probability of responding to a given SSD according to the stop-signal paradigm. The
Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT), which correspondsto the latency of the stopping process,
was estimated by subtracting the mean SSD from the mean No-Signal Reaction Time (NSRT)
during conduct of the Go trials. The analysis program (ANALYZE-IT, Universiteit Ghent,
Belgium) provides descriptive statistics, including mean NSRT, probability of responding,
and SSD, and provides reliable SSRT estimations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All participants were seated in front of a table with the non-dominant hand on the
response keys, which consisted of the left, right, up, and down arrow keys. Following the
visual stimulus on the front of the computer monitor, participants were instructed to
press the button as quickly as possible according to the corresponding stimulus during
conduct of the Go trials. In the Go trials, each stimulus shape was paired with a single
correct response key (square, circle, diamond, and triangle with the left, right, up and
downarrow keys, respectively). However, the participants were told not to press any
buttons in response to the stop stimulus during conduct of the Stop trials. In the SST,
the presented stimuli lasted for 1,250&#x02005;msec, and a default inter-stimuli interval of
2,000&#x02005;msec was provided. A fixation cross was presented at the center of the monitor for
the null (baseline) period until the start of the next trial. Each trial began with the
presentation of the fixation cross, which was replaced by the Go trial stimulus after
250&#x02005;msec. If a button was pressed prior to exhibition of the Go signal, this trial was
excluded from the analysis, and if the wrong button was pressed in response to the signal,
it was also excluded from the analysis.</p><p>All participants performed the SST, which consisted of one block of 132 trials (Go
trials: 99, Stop trials: 33), during two consecutive tDCS phases: the pre-tDCS phase and
the post-tDCS phase. Participants first performed only the SST test without delivery of
tDCS for acquisition of baseline parameters: SSRT and NSRT. After the pre-tDCS phase,
participants received tDCS over one of the target sites (M1 or the pre-SMA) and one with
no tDCS depending on the condition being tested. Participants then performed the final SST
test in the post-tDCS phase. Each participant was tested pre- and post-tDCS under the
three conditions (i.e. the M1, pre-SMA, and Sham tDCS). The time interval between each
condition was at least 24 hours. A constant current of 1mA intensity was applied for 10
minutes. All participants felt the current as a mild itching sensation or senselessness
under the electrodes, depending on the sensitivity of the individuals, who were blinded to
the tDCS condition. For the Sham tDCS condition, electrodes were placed in the same
positions as for anodal M1 stimulation; however, the stimulator was turned off after 5
seconds, as previously described. Thus, participants in the Sham tDCS condition initially
felt a mild itching sensation for one second and believed that they were receiving tDCS in
all procedures, but received no current for the remainder of the procedure.</p><p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for analysis of demographic data, including sex and
age. All data were analyzed in terms of the means of SSD, SSRT and NSRT, only when the
correct movement responses to the Go and Stop signal occurred. The untrimmed mean reaction
time in the Go trials was estimated initially (NSRT), and the mean SSD was then subtracted
from this value for calculation of the SSRT in the Stop trials. The effect of tDCS under
the three conditions was determined using a 2 (factors: M1-tDCS, pre-SMA tDCS, and Sham
tDCS) &#x000d7; 2 (test phase: pre-tDCS, post-tDCS) ANOVA with repeated measures on the two
dependent variables, SSRT and NSRT. SPSS, version 18.0 was used to conduct all statistical
analyses, and p&#x0003c;0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Changes in response times to visual stimuli among the SST test phases (mean &#x000b1;

non-dominant hand during performance of the SST after delivery of anodal tDCS of the
pre-SMA, but not under the sham condition. In addition, performance of the SST after
application of anodal tDCS to M1 resulted in a significant reduction in the stop process
time; however, there was no significant difference, compared to the sham condition. Under
all tDCS conditions, there were no significant changes in the go processing times.
Therefore, improvement in the stop process could be due to enhanced inhibitory control
through the effect of direct stimulation after delivery of tDCS to the pre-SMA.</p><p>Previous studies have reported the role of the pre-SMA in control of volitional action<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. These studies confirmed the critical role of the pre-SMA in
inhibiting competition with single motor plans in situations of response conflict. In
addition, many studies have also reported that M1 plays a vital role in rapid processing
between motor execution and suppression in the active stop process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although go and stop processes, which work alternatively
on each other in the SST, are the functional separation between response execution and
suppression, they are operated according to the motor executive commands originating from
M1. Therefore, to demonstrate an improvement in inhibitory control of stimulation to the
pre-SMA and M1, we attempted an experimental design which performed a comparison with the
sham condition.</p><p>Our findings demonstrated enhancement of the stop movement after application of anodal tDCS
to the pre-SMA, and are in line with those of other studies demonstrating short SSRT in the
SST and other aspects of the cognitive process induced shown by tDCS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous
neuroimaging studies have suggested greater activity in the pre-SMA in association with more
efficient response inhibition by shortened SSRT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results imply that response inhibition is improved by
facilitation of functional connections between the pre-SMA and the basal ganglia, which are
known as a braking system for constant responses, indicating activation of the pre-SMA prior
to initiation of a planned action. In addition, the increased activation of the pre-SMA
influenced the stop process, but not the go process, and it appears to be especially crucial
for cancelling responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other studies have suggested that goal-directed actions
can be automatically started and guided to completion by information in the task
environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, both the goal of the stop movement and the attention
of the stop signal would expedite the stop process and facilitate initiation of response
inhibition.</p><p>Many studies of tDCS have suggested that application of anodal tDCS to M1 during
performance of a motor task involving hand movements resulted in enhanced motor performance
and cortical excitability by recruitment of more cortical neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present
results showed a reduction of response time compared to the sham condition. They are
compatible with the results of prior studies using non-invasive neurostimulation, and motor
execution was improved by the after-effect following tDCS due to enhancement of cortical
excitability. Our results show that after delivery of tDCS to M1, only the response times of
the stop process decreased, but the response time of the go process did not. Previous
studies have suggested that the efficiency of response inhibition improves the preparation
of the go process before display of the stop-signal, and it can reduce the length of the
response time during the stop process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, sufficient preparation
resulted in shortened response times of the stopping process, even though relatively reduced
cortical activation was shown in imaging results.</p><p>In conclusion, application of anodal tDCS to the pre-SMA or M1 during performance of the
SST resulted in enhancement of the volitional stop movement in inhibitory control. Many
studies of the SST have shown that the stop process generated by the stop-signal is like a
focal emergency brake for inhibitory control, which can suppress the excitability of the
whole motor system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, application of anodal tDCS to the pre-SMA or M1 is a
useful adjuvant intervention modality for modulation of response inhibition and its related
dynamic behavioral changes. The most important limitation of this study was that the
subjects were not clinical patients. Thus, further studies for the development of clinical
applications in mediation of inhibitory control will be needed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research
