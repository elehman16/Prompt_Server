stimulation (NMES) on lip strength and closure function of patients with dysphagia after
stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Eight patients with dysphagia were recruited. NMES was
applied to the orbicularis oris muscle. All the participants received NMES for 30&#x02005;min/d, 5
d/wk, for 4 weeks. Lip strength was measured using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument.
To assess lip closure, the lip closure subitem of the videofluoroscopic dysphagia scale
was used. [Results] Lip strength showed significant improvement and lip closure function
showed a significant decrease. [Conclusion] This study demonstrates that NMES is useful
for improving lip strength and closure function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dysphagia</kwd><kwd>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation</kwd><kwd>Orbicularis oris muscle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a typical remedial method that provides
muscle contraction and sensory input through electrical stimulation to the neck front to
treat dysphagia<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. NMES induces muscle
contraction from depolarization of nerve fibers by transferring electrical stimulation to
the muscle by using surface electrodes. The result is an effective method for strengthening
muscles, preventing atrophy, and re-educating neuromuscular muscles<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies reported that NMES is effective for
increasing muscle activation, and preventing aspiration<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, only few previous
studies have applied NMES to the oral phase, as most of the studies applied NMES to the
pharyngeal phase. Therefore, the effect of NMES on lip muscle and function in the oral phase
is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of NMES on lip strength
and closure function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In this study, 8 patients with dysphagia after stroke were included. The criteria for
participation were as follows: 1) diagnosed as having dysphagia, 2) had difficulty closing
lips, 3) no difficulty in communication, and 4) history of stroke within 6 months. The
purpose of the study was explained to the participants before enrollment, and informed
consent for participation was obtained in accordance with the principles of the Declaration
of Helsinki.</p><p>This study applied NMES by using VitalStime (Chattanooga Group, Hixson, TN, USA). A pair of
electrodes were attached to the orbicularis oris muscle to apply to the lip muscles. The
electrical stimulation unit provided 1 channel of bipolar electrical stimulation at a fixed
80-Hz pulse rate and a biphasic pulse duration of 700&#x02005;&#x000b5;s. The channel could be adjusted
between 0 and 25 mA of stimulation intensity. The intensity was increased until the patients
felt a tolerable stimulation level (known as grabbing sensation) in their lip muscles. All
the participants received NMES for 30&#x02005;min/d, 5 d/wk, for 4 weeks. Evaluation was performed
using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI Medical LLC, Carnation, WA, USA) to measure
muscle strength during lip closure. The pressure bulb was inserted between two disposable
tongue depressors, which were positioned between the centerline of the lips. At this time,
the subjects gently closed their mouth and protruded their lips slightly. They were then
instructed to press the tongue depressors with their lips as hard as possible<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lip closure function was assessed using the
lip closure item of the videofluoroscopic dysphagia scale. Lip closure was scored as 0, 2,
and 4 to indicate intact, inadequate, and none<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk,
NY, USA). To evaluate the intervention effects, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to
compare measurement values before and after the intervention. The significance level was set
at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the post-intervention evaluation, a significant improvement in lip strength, from 15.9 &#x000b1;
3.3 kPa to 20.5 &#x000b1; 4.2 kPa (p&#x0003c;0.05), was observed. Lip closure function showed a
significant decrease from 2.7 &#x000b1; 0.9 to 1.2 &#x000b1; 0.6 (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study demonstrates that NMES is an effective intervention for improving lip strength
and closure function in patients with dysphagia after stroke. Suiter et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that NMES activates the suprahyoid
muscles in patients with dysphagia after stroke. High muscle activation is the recruitment
of many motor units and has a potential to increase muscle strength if repeatedly
applied<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study also applied
intensity at a tolerable stimulation level, this may lead to greater muscle contraction. The
increase in lip muscle strength is related to lip closure function because proper lip
closure of the orbicularis oris requires a strong contraction. Safi et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported an increase in lip strength by
applying NMES in healthy adults, which is consistent with our finding. Our study
demonstrates that NMES is useful for improving lip strength and closure function. Therefore,
we suggest the use of NMES as remedial treatment of dysphagia in the oral phase</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>YW</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>KH</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>HC</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The effects of surface neuromuscular electrical
