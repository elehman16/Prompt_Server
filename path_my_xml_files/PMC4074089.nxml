The design was placebo-controlled within-subject with 4 treatment conditions: MDMA (75 mg), with or without pindolol (20 mg), oxytocin nasal spray (40 IU+16 IU) or placebo. Participants were 20 healthy poly-drug MDMA users, aged between 18&#x02013;26 years. Cognitive and emotional empathy were assessed by means of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Multifaceted Empathy Test. Social interaction, defined as trust and reciprocity, was assessed by means of a Trust Game and a Social Ball Tossing Game. Results showed that MDMA selectively affected emotional empathy and left cognitive empathy, trust and reciprocity unaffected. When combined with pindolol, these effects remained unchanged. Oxytocin did not affect measures of empathy and social interaction. Changes in emotional empathy were not related to oxytocin plasma levels. It was concluded that MDMA (75 mg) selectively enhances emotional empathy in humans. While the underlying neurobiological mechanism is still unknown, it is suggested that peripheral oxytocin does not seem to be the main actor in this; potential candidates are the serotonin 2A and the vasopressin 1A receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>MDMA &#x00026; PSB <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2636">NTR 2636</ext-link>

Since then, more studies have been conducted, mostly by means of self-reports or questionnaires in ecstasy users, either under influence or in a sober or abstinent state (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0100719-Sumnall1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Dumont1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>). Findings showed that MDMA induced subjective feelings of closeness to, and openness towards others, emotional warmth, enhanced well-being, contentment, empathy and euphoria (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bedi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Dumont2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>). Dumont and colleagues (2009) for example used two items from the Bond and Lader Mood Rating Questionnaire to explore &#x02018;prosocial states&#x02019; and showed an MDMA-induced increase in self-rated amicability and gregariousness compared with placebo. Kirkpatrick and colleagues (2014) showed that participants under influence of MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) were more likely to rate socializing with other as more desirable compared to placebo <xref rid="pone.0100719-Kirkpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Only relatively recent, studies are being published using objective measures of social behavior and cognition in addition to subjective measures, to quantify the prosocial effects of MDMA. The first to cover this were Bedi and colleagues (2009) who conducted a pharmaco-imaging study into the effects of MDMA on emotion recognition (defined here as &#x02018;cognitive empathy&#x02019;; to differentiate &#x02018;knowing&#x02019; from &#x02018;feeling&#x02019;). MDMA (0.75 &#x00026; 1.5 mg/kg) increased activation in the ventral striatum in response to happy faces and decreased amygdala activation in response to angry faces (only at 1.5 mg/kg) <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bedi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In another study, Bedi and colleagues (2010) showed a selective reduction in recognition of fearful faces after MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) administration in the &#x02018;Face Emotion Recognition Task&#x02019; (FERT), while recognition of other emotions (angry, happy, neutral, sad) was left unaffected <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bedi2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A few years later, the same group showed that MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) impaired recognition of negative facial expressions (anger and fear) in the &#x02018;Morphed Facial Expression Task&#x02019;, a task comparable to the FERT <xref rid="pone.0100719-Kirkpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In line with Bedi et al. (2010) <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bedi2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, Hysek and colleagues (2012) also showed an absence of MDMA (125 mg) effects on emotion recognition as measured by another task, i.e. the &#x02018;Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test&#x02019; (RMET) <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, when taking valence of the items into account, Hysek et al. (2012) found a dissociation in effects; i.e., MDMA enhanced recognition of positive emotions whereas recognition of negative emotions was impaired <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In another study, Hysek and colleagues (2013) showed absence of MDMA effects on cognitive empathy in one task (Multifaceted Empathy Task, &#x02018;MET&#x02019;) while revealing impairment of recognition of negative emotions in the FERT. This was contrasted with the MDMA-induced increase in emotional empathy (&#x02018;arousal&#x02019;, &#x02018;concern&#x02019;) in the MET <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Taken together, evidence shows that MDMA enhances emotional components of empathy, as assessed by subjective and objective measures, and impairs cognitive empathy (emotion recognition) for negative emotions <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bedi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Kirkpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0100719-Scahill1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The effect of MDMA on cognitive empathy for positive emotions however was less consistent and only shown in one study on one behavioral parameter <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and in another study on a neuronal level <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bedi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Besides the relative dearth of research into the effect of MDMA on empathy, the use of objective measures of social interactions is even scarcer. Knowledge about the effects of MDMA on, for example, levels of trust giving and cooperativeness is important as this might underlie the hypothesized strengthening of the therapeutic alliance in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy <xref rid="pone.0100719-Mithoefer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, thereby facilitating the therapeutic process. To date, only two studies reported about this, i.e. Frye and colleagues (2014) who used a virtual ball tossing game and Hysek and colleagues (2013) who used a social value orientation task (SVO) <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Frye1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. It was shown that MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) decreased the perceived objective level of rejection as experimentally created in the ball tossing game, and that MDMA (125 mg) increased prosocial behavior in the SVO task. Both studies indicate that MDMA enhances social interactions. The present study included a number of measures to assess the effects of MDMA on empathy (emotional and cognitive empathy) and social interaction (trust and reciprocity).</p><p>Another important issue to address is the neurochemical mechanism underlying the acute effects of MDMA on social behavior in humans. Recently, studies have focused on the neuropeptide oxytocin as a mediator in prosocial effects <xref rid="pone.0100719-Dumont1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Emanuele1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Two studies that assessed oxytocin concentrations in blood after MDMA administration, both showed an MDMA-induced increase in those levels <xref rid="pone.0100719-Dumont1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Additionally, these concentrations were positively correlated with positive mood effects <xref rid="pone.0100719-Dumont1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, it was also shown that there was no correlation between plasma oxytocin concentrations and behavioral measures of empathy <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Kirkpatrick and colleagues (2014) compared the effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on mood and social cognition/behavior measures with MDMA effects. They showed that subjective responses after 40 IU oxytocin were not related to MDMA responses whereas those after 20 IU were <xref rid="pone.0100719-Kirkpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Interestingly, oxytocin effects are partly mediated by the serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor <xref rid="pone.0100719-Jrgensen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor is one of the main mediators of the action of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that acts as an intermediary for the main effects of MDMA <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bankson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Activation of this receptor has also been linked to an augmentation in sociability. Recent animal studies suggested that the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor could play a key role in the prosocial effects of MDMA <xref rid="pone.0100719-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. To date, no human research has been conducted into the effects of this receptor in MDMA-induced prosocial effects. However, Hasler and colleagues (2009) showed that pindolol, a beta blocker with 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor affinity has a minor modulating effect on subjective states, induced by MDMA <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hasler1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Although the effects were small, pindolol seems to have the potential to mitigate MDMA-induced effects, and will therefore be used in the present study to study the role of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor in MDMA-induced effects.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of MDMA on different objective and subjective measures of empathy and social interaction, and to investigate the roles of oxytocin and the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor in MDMA-induced prosocial effects. It was hypothesized that oxytocin and the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor are key mediators of MDMA's prosocial effects and that 1) oxytocin would mimic MDMA-induced effects, and 2) blockade of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor would prevent occurrence of these effects when blocking was combined with MDMA intake.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were 20 healthy poly-drug MDMA users, aged between 18&#x02013;26 years, recruited through advertisements in university buildings and a website (digi-prik.nl), and by word of mouth.

Results showed that MDMA selectively affected emotional empathy and left cognitive empathy, trust and reciprocity unaffected. When combined with pindolol, these effects remained unchanged. Oxytocin did not affect objective measures of empathy and social interaction; however, oxytocin increased participants' perception of emotional empathy as measured by the IRI questionnaire. MDMA's effects on control measures (WLT, POMS) were in line with previous findings from the same group (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0100719-vanWel1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-vanWel2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>).</p><p>It was shown that participants under the influence of MDMA, irrespective whether it was combined with pindolol or not, were more concerned and aroused when confronted with pictures of people with a positive or negative emotional expression. Cognitive empathy, defined as inferring complex emotions either for eye-pairs or full body pictures, was not affected by any treatment. Together these results suggest a selective role for MDMA in emotional empathy which is in line with previous findings from Hysek and colleagues (2013) <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The absence of effects of MDMA on cognitive empathy (positive and negative emotions) as measured with the RMET and MET were also in line with previous studies <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bedi2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. When taking Valence into account in the RMET, Hysek and colleagues (2012) revealed dissociative effects of MDMA on cognitive empathy, i.e., increased accuracy in recognition of positive emotions and decreased accuracy in recognition of negative emotions. This finding was not replicated by the present study. Participants in our study were faster and more accurate at identifying positive emotions, compared to negative and neutral emotions; this effect was not influenced by the treatment they received. The performance level in the RMET of participants in the present study was comparable to other studies using healthy controls of comparable age <xref rid="pone.0100719-Domes1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-BaronCohen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Fertuck1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and higher compared to Hysek et al.'s participants (2012) who only reached the same levels under influence of MDMA <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It can be suggested that there was no room for improvement in our participants.</p><p>These findings on objective measures in the present study were only partly supported by the subjective measurement of empathy (IRI). It revealed that participants under influence of oxytocin, and MDMA, when combined with pindolol, rated themselves higher on emotional concern and personal distress compared to placebo. However, as the IRI is actually a trait measure, it was expected that these effects were smaller.</p><p>There were no effects of MDMA with or without pindolol or oxytocin on social interaction measures (trust &#x00026; reciprocity) approximately 2 hours after MDMA administration (1 h15 minutes after oxytocin administration) as measured by a trust game and a virtual social ball tossing game. The latter paradigm was also used by Frye et al (2014) however in another version <xref rid="pone.0100719-Frye1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Whereas they had two games of 3 to 4 minutes in which social acceptance and social rejection were simulated by means of manipulating the number of throws the participant received (acceptance: received more than at chance level; rejection: received less balls than expected at chance level). Their main dependent variables were self-rated mood, self-esteem and perceived number of received throws. They showed MDMA showed decreased the negative effects of social rejection on subjective ratings of mood and self-esteem and increased the perceived percentage of received throws. We used a version of the social ball tossing game, previously designed by Andari and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0100719-Andari1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The game started with 3 virtual characters whose reciprocating behavior towards the participant changed over the course of the game to become either including, excluding or neutral, i.e. throwing more, less or an equal amount to the participant compared to the other (fictitious) participants. Participants were told they were playing online against three other humans, not a computer. The game took approximately 20 minutes and the dependent variable was the number of throws to the three types of players. We showed that participants preferred interaction with the &#x02018;good&#x02019;/including player over the other, which is in line with a previous study using the same paradigm <xref rid="pone.0100719-Andari1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The pattern of interaction was not differently affected by treatment. Subjective ratings of trust in and preference for the good player mirrored the objective parameters, i.e. participants expressed more trust in and preference for the good player; their ratings were unaffected by treatment. In contrast to Frye et al (2014), our participants were not impaired at reading the intention of others (e.g. including or excluding them). This might be due to the fact that they received more contextual information which they could compare (i.e. 3 distinctive profiles) instead of only one type of player in one game (either including or excluding them). Our participants had the choice to interact with the player they preferred and our data suggest that MDMA (or oxytocin) does not influence their primary choice compared to placebo. This situation is contrary to the one in the paradigm of Frye et al. (2014) where participants had no influence over the situation but were subjected to one. In addition, Frye et al. (2014) used indirect measures that concerned the inner state of the participant (i.e. mood, self-esteem) and suggest an inward focus; the current study used an objective measure of interaction (ball tosses), complemented with measures about feelings towards the other (trust/preference) i. e. an outward focus.</p><p>The Trust Game was the second social interaction measure. It was shown that participants did not violate the trust of the other participants when a lot of money was at stake. This higher level of reciprocity in a high-risk context relative to a low-risk context is according to Bos et al. (2011) a reflection of the recognition of the positive intentions of the person giving trust, i.e. a measure of social perspective taking (also cognitive empathy) <xref rid="pone.0100719-vandenBos2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This measure was not affected by treatment (MDMA/oxytocin). Reciprocity of trust is important for social interaction and it depends on individual differences in social value orientation (SVO) <xref rid="pone.0100719-vandenBos3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. SVO is defined as &#x02018;behavior that maximizes the sum of resources of the self and others and minimizes the difference between the two&#x02019;. Hysek and colleagues (2013) assessed SVO and showed that 4 hours after administration of MDMA, especially male participants chose the &#x02018;altruistic&#x02019; option in which more resources were allocated to the other person, compared to placebo. Their behavior was comparable to female behavior in the placebo condition. Their results revealed a sex-specific effect of MDMA on SVO. We did not look into the effects of sex on trust or reciprocity as power did not allow us to conduct this kind of analysis. It can be speculated that any effect of MDMA on trust/reciprocity in the present study was masked by the mixed-sex sample. The results of Hysek and colleagues (2013) indicate that it is very important to address this in any future MDMA study.</p><p>The second part of the aim of the present study was to investigate the roles of oxytocin and the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor in the MDMA-induced &#x02018;prosocial&#x02019; effects. Contrary to our expectations, pindolol did not block MDMA effects, and oxytocin administration did not mimic MDMA effects. First, it cannot be concluded from the present study that the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor does not play a role in the MDMA effects. While pindolol blocks approximately 40% of both auto- and post-synaptic receptors, 60% can still be stimulated by MDMA. Previously, studies have shown the ability of pindolol (20 mg) to affect subjective mood states <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hasler1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-vanWel1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, although limited evidence for pindolol by MDMA interaction effects were demonstrated <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hasler1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-vanWel1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-vanWel2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek3" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The two studies that showed an interaction effect, demonstrated this on subjective and physiological measures, and it was speculated that these effects could perhaps be attributed to the beta-adrenergic effects of pindolol, rather than its effects on the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hasler1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek3" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. They also ascribed this relative absence of interactions to the relatively high dose of MDMA which was possibly more potent than the dose of pindolol. In the present study, pindolol did seem to exert some counteracting effects on the subjective and physiological control measures. It prevented MDMA-induced confusion, and increase in heart rate. It could be suggested that the subjective and physiological effects are caused by the normalization in heart rate and thus perhaps due to beta-adrenergic activity; however, elevated ratings of anxiety, vigor and arousal were still present, i.e. not counteracted by pindolol.</p><p>With regard to oxytocin, it can be determined that our oxytocin concentrations 90&#x02032; after MDMA (75 mg) administration (&#x00394; baseline&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5.6 pg/mL) were approximately 10 times lower than the concentrations Hysek et al (2013) report, 1 to 2 hours after MDMA (125 mg) administration, i.e. 60 pg/mL. They were 3 times lower than the concentrations Dumont and colleagues (2009) report (34.3 pmol/L), 110 minutes after MDMA (100 mg) administration. Despite the low concentrations of oxytocin compared to studies of Dumont and Hysek respectively, we did show an effect of MDMA on emotional empathy. It can be suggested that higher doses of MDMA lead to higher oxytocin concentrations but it is questioned whether these oxytocin concentrations are at the base of behavioral effects. The oxytocin concentrations 45&#x02032; after oxytocin administration in the present study (12.85 pg/mL) were comparable to those after MDMA administration (12.07 pg/mL); while oxytocin administration did not lead to behavioral changes, MDMA did. Correlational analyses were unable to detect a relationship between behavioral effects and oxytocin concentration. This is in line with Hysek and colleagues (2013) who showed that endocrine measures did not correlate with behavioral measures.</p><p>In the present study, the effects of intranasal oxytocin administration were assessed between 45&#x02032; and 120&#x02032; post-administration of the first dose (40 IU). It has been stated that consistent effects of oxytocin can only be expected reliably in a time window of less than 90&#x02032;, and in order to capture the main behavioural effects, testing should start about 20 to 30 minutes after oxytocin administration <xref rid="pone.0100719-Gossen1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. However, in the present study, 2 booster doses of intranasal oxytocin were given to prevent the decline in levels. Apparently these booster doses seem to have helped as the oxytocin concentrations in blood were even higher at the end of the test battery compared to the beginning (16.07 vs 12.85 pg/mL), and higher than those of Gossen et al. <xref rid="pone.0100719-Gossen1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> (C<sub>max</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5.5 pg/mL 30&#x02032;after 26 IU) who suggested this short test interval. Striepens et al. (2013) also showed that there is a lag between oxytocin levels in CSF (significant increases at 75&#x02032;) and those in blood after intranasal application of oxytocin (C<sub>max</sub> at 15&#x02032; after 24 IU). They suggest that there is therefore some support for considering delaying starting tasks following 24 IU a little longer than 45 minutes <xref rid="pone.0100719-Striepens1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In the present study, tests were conducted between 45&#x02032;&#x02013;120&#x02032; post-oxytocin administration. While the presence of an oxytocin effect on the IRI questionnaire approximately 1 h after administration supports this suggestion, alternative explanations besides the interval between administration-tests could explain the lack of oxytocin effects in the present study.</p><p>While animal research previously has shown that both oxytocin administration as well as stimulation of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor can lead to enhanced social behavior, comparable to that produced by MDMA administration <xref rid="pone.0100719-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Ramos1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> findings of the present study do not seem to be in line with those of animal studies. However, some remarks are needed. First, social behavior and cognition are more complex in humans compared to animals. Secondly, the paradigms used in animal research approximate more the natural setting and might be a better indication of &#x02018;natural&#x02019; social behavior than measured with computer paradigms, in humans. Besides the use of the &#x02018;right&#x02019; paradigm, setting is known to play an important role in the subjective experience of MDMA. Outside the lab, MDMA use is associated with a social context and social expectations (e.g. &#x02018;being loved&#x02019;) about the effects and they act on those expectations (interactions with others) <xref rid="pone.0100719-Sumnall1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-McElrath1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. In oxytocin research it is also suggested that the effects of oxytocin administration are very context-dependent <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bartels1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. To illustrate, apparently a salient social context (e.g. contact with the other participant) is essential to elicit behavioural effects of oxytocin in a trust game <xref rid="pone.0100719-Declerck1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In addition, the effects of intranasal oxytocin administration might be relatively small during the experience of emotional stimuli due to internal oxytocin release in the placebo condition, caused by the stimuli <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bartels1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Furthermore, &#x02018;set&#x02019; can also be of influence, i.e. there is a possibility that oxytocin effects depend on the initial emotional state of the individual <xref rid="pone.0100719-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Bartels (2012) put forward that &#x02018;we need to find clever ways to present social stimuli in truly social context if we want to understand the complex ways in which oxytocin shapes the human nature&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bartels1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>Potential underlying mechanisms that are worth looking into in humans are the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor and the V1A receptor (V1<sub>A</sub>Rs). Both receptors have been shown to play a role in prosocial behaviour in animal research. When the V1<sub>A</sub>Rs were blocked, enhancement of social behavior by oxytocin, vasopressin, or MDMA, was prevented <xref rid="pone.0100719-Ramos1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor was shown to be reduced in MDMA-treated animals, which was accompanied by a decrease in social behaviour <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bull1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. In humans, it has been shown that blocking of this receptor prevented MDMA-induced positive affect, suggesting a role for this receptor in prosocial behaviour <xref rid="pone.0100719-vanWel1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The latter is currently being investigated by our group.</p><p>A potential limitation of the present study is that only single doses of the each drug were given and it is known that different doses can produce different subjective and behavioural effects (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bedi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bedi2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>). However, this approach is not unusual (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>) but the information provided is dose-restricted and not generalizable. The dose of MDMA used in the present study, i.e. 75 mg equals a 1.07 mg/kg dose, which lies in the range usually used in this type of research e.g.: 0.75&#x02013;1.89 mg/kg <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bedi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bedi2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Kirkpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> but more to the lower end. It is possible that slightly higher doses result in more pronounced MDMA effects on measures of empathy and social interaction as shown by previous research (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bedi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Bedi2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Hysek2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100719-Kirkpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>). A second potential limitation is the use of peripheral measures of oxytocin as it has been shown recently that there is a substantial lag of 60 minutes between the oxytocin peak at peripheral level and that at central level <xref rid="pone.0100719-Striepens1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The test battery in the present study was conducted between 45&#x02032;&#x02013;120&#x02032; post-oxytocin administration and therefore it is reasonable to assume that the measurements took place at the time when oxytocin concentrations reached their peak at central level. However, although the time frame of behavioural measures was presumably adequate, it has been shown that plasma and CSF oxytocin concentrations do not correlate on coincident sampling moments and that CSF concentrations were higher than plasma concentrations <xref rid="pone.0100719-Striepens1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Therefore, the plasma concentrations in the present study are potentially an underestimation of central levels.</p><p>In sum, it can be concluded that a single dose of 75 mg of MDMA selectively enhances emotional empathy in humans. While the underlying neurobiological mechanism is still unknown, it is suggested that peripheral oxytocin does not seem to be the main actor in this. Future research should take contextual factors into account while assessing MDMA-induced prosocial effects and look into the roles of the serotonin 2A receptor and the vasopressin 1A receptor.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank A.
