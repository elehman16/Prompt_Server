training (ACBT) on postural balance and gait ability in community-dwelling older adults.
[Subjects and Methods] Fifty-four subjects were randomly divided into two groups, with 27
subjects in the ACBT group and 27 subjects in the control group. Subjects in the ACBT
group received ACBT for 60 minutes, twice per week for 4 weeks, and all subjects had
undergone fall prevention education for 60 minutes, once per week for 4 weeks. The main
outcome measures, including the Berg balance scale; the functional reach test and one leg
stance test for postural balance; and the timed up-and-go test and 10-meter walking test
for gait ability, were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks of training. [Results] The
postural balance and gait ability in the ACBT group improved significantly compared to
those in the control group, except BBS. [Conclusion] The results of this study showed
improved postural balance and gait abilities after ACBT and that ACBT is a feasible method
for improving postural balance and gait ability in community-dwelling older adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Postural balance</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gait patterns, which go through changes as aging process prolongs, deliver significant
impacts on the quality of life for the elderly<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that the causes for fall, a major issue for
the elderly, arise from various aspects, including low vision, cognitive impairment,
postural hypotension, environmental problems and deterioration of gait and mobility<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. From the above, since the fall during the
gait is reported to consist 45% of all falls, it is considered as the significant risk
factor for a fall while further closely associated with the aging process<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ten to 15% of those who experienced falls
also suffer substantial deterioration to their quality of life due to fractures or critical
damages<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence, normal gait can be
deemed vital to the life of the elderly.</p><p>Gait patterns of the elderly exhibit several characteristics, such as decreasing stride
length, decline of stride time, decreasing gait velocity, declining cadence, decreasing time
ratio of stand phase, increasing double limb stance and elevating step due to extended
proximal surface<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A major cause for falls during the gait is reported to be the tripping<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the study analyzing the tripping motions, the
motions can be divided into forward movements of the leg for recovery after getting tripped
and motions of supporting foot in order to sustain the body; advancing recovery limb is to
prevent from falling by fully stretching the limb forward<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> while the support limb is to enable holding the position by
appropriately advancing the recovery limb through plantar flexion, knee extension and hip
extension<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it was revealed that the muscle strength of lower limb
is closely associated with the tripping motion, which led to an assertion where the muscle
strength of lower limb needs to be enhanced to prevent such tripping motion; and the control
of ankle centered on plantar flexion was particularly stressed<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. During gait
cycle, ankle joint is involved with shock absorption and momentum. Shock absorption is
controlled through eccentric contraction of tibialis anterior, and the momentum is generated
by push-off motion and achieved by plantar flexor. Ankle strategy, an important means to
postural balance, is deeply involved with the control of ankle joint<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The proper function of ankle joint is required for the
entire body to safely move forward during the gait<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, since flexibility and
muscle strength of ankle joint continuously deteriorates as aging process keeps progressing,
it becomes more difficult to walk safely<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Degradation of muscles surrounding the
ankle and range of motion increase of ankle joint stiffness and causes unstable gait
patterns<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. These causes are bound
to increase the risks of fall for the elderly<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Especially, when postural balance
of the entire body is disrupted such as an occasion of slipping, plantar flexor muscles
plays a pivotal role of controlling center-of-mass<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, degradation of muscle strength of the muscles surrounding
ankles due to aging process may hinder the ability to maintain balance and increase the
possibilities of fall. In conclusion, ankle control is indispensable to prevent a fall.</p><p>Consequently, this study aims to ascertain the effects on balance and gait by applying
ankle control balance training (ACBT) to community-dwelling old adults to prevent a
fall.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Community-dwelling older adults were recruited by the principal author through
advertisements in senior welfare centre, senior sports clubs, and senior society
organizations in South Korea.</p><p>The following inclusion criteria were applied: age &#x02265;65&#x02005;years, either two or more falls
during the previous 12 months or one fall. Participants were excluded if they had any
musculoskeletal impairment, neurological impairment, vision impairment, or vestibular
disease, or dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination score &#x0003c;24/30).</p><p>Participants whose training participation rate was below 80% were excluded from the final
analyses. The goals and procedures of the study were explained to all subjects. Only those
who signed the study participation consent form voluntarily were selected as subjects and
the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sahmyook University.</p><p>Fifty-four subjects who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two groups,
an ACBT group (n=27) and a control group (n=27) using Random Allocation Software (version
1.0) (Saghaei, 2004). No significant differences were observed among the three groups for

To determine the sample size, the
G-Power 3.19 software was used (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &#x00026; Buchner, 2007). To calculate
the sample size, the probability of alpha error and power were set at 0.05 and 0.8,
respectively. In addition, the effect size was set at 0.8, based on Cohen&#x02019;s methods (Cohen,
1977). Therefore, a sample size of 26 patients per group was necessary. By estimating a
drop-out rate of about 10%, 27 participants per group needed to be recruited for
randomization.</p><p>The training was composed of 3 minutes of stretching, 5 minutes of warm-up exercise
including 2 minutes of slow walking, 40 minutes of main exercise, and 10 minutes of
cool-down exercise, totalling 60 minutes. The training was conducted under the supervision
of four therapists, for the safety of the subjects. The subjects wore shoes but did not use
walking aids.</p><p>The ACBT was designed based on exercises previously shown to improve ankle control and
balance<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Warm-up included gentle stretching, forward, backward, and sideways step-ups on foam and
massage with a sensory ball, all performed to light smoothing music. This warm-up was
performed to increase muscle flexibility.</p><p>The ACBT consisted of three parts. The exercise interventions were performed on a
high-elasticity balance-training mat. Static exercise on a training mat comprised heel and
toe raises, one-legged stance for each limb, weight shifting forward, backward, sideward and
diagonally, and turning the head to the left and then to the right keeping the feet
together. This exercise comprised two 10-min sessions each, with eyes opened and eyes
closed, respectively. While performing the second set of exercises, patients were paired for
safety reasons and they performed in turns. Dynamic exercise on the training mat involved
walking, step-ups, and bipedal jumps for 10&#x02005;min. Progressive balance exercises on the
training mat involved narrow walking, walking backward, walking sideward, stepping over
obstacles, stepping on obstacles, passing balls arranged on the training mat in a circle,
and throwing and catching a ball on the training mat for 10&#x02005;min.</p><p>Following balance training, cool-down exercises were performed to prevent muscle fatigue,
to relax tensed muscles, and to help return the heart and respiratory rates to normal. These
exercises included deep breathing, abdominal breathing, and static back extensor exercises
in a reclined position.</p><p>Identical training products were used for all participants (high-elasticity balance
training mat (StimUp, Alfoots, Korea): 46 &#x000d7; 496 &#x000d7; 6&#x02005;cm; polyurethane foam ball (Polyurethan
soft ball; EDUFOAM, Korea): diameter, 17&#x02005;cm; yellow Theraband (Thera-band; Hygenic
Corporation, USA): length, 40&#x02005;cm and resistance, 1&#x02005;kg).</p><p>The both groups received health education on fall prevention. The educational topics
included cause of falling, fall risk factor, home safety evaluation, necessary of fall
prevention exercise, and environment problems.</p><p>Postural balance was measured by the one-leg-standing (OLS) test, the Berg Balance Scale
(BBS), and Functional reach test (FRT). The OLS test is used to assess postural stability.
Participants were instructed to balance on the non-dominant leg with eyes opened and arms
spread for as long as possible. The time elapsed before the contralateral foot touched the
ground was measured in seconds using a stopwatch. This test was performed twice, and the
highest score was recorded. The BBS has been used to evaluate functional balance in a wide
range of subjects, including elderly individuals with a high risk of falling and patients
with acute and chronic diseases. It consists of 14 items common to daily activities; each
item is rated on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating better balance.
The FRT evaluates the limits of physical stability, and measures dynamic balance and
flexibility as subjects perform functional tasks. The FRT measures the maximum distance that
subjects can reach forward as far as possible their own arm&#x02019;s length while maintaining a
fixed base of support in the standing position. The distance was measured in centimeters
using a Laser Range Finder (DLE50, BOSCH, Germany). Results represent the average of 3
consecutive measurements.</p><p>Gait ability was measured by the timed up-and-go (TUG) test and 10-meter walking test
(10MWT). TUG test is used to predict fall risk by examining balance ability and functional
mobility. 36 It measures the time it takes a subject to stand up from an armchair (46&#x02005;cm
height), walk a distance of 3 meters, and then turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit
down again. The total time taken to complete the circuit was measured in seconds with a
stopwatch. The 10MWT is a standard test used to investigate the extent of gait ability. The
test was repeated 3 times, and the results were averaged.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline characteristics data. The
Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test variables for normality. Comparisons of baseline
characteristics between the ACBT group and control group were analysed using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>
test. The independent t-test was used to compare changes in postural balance and gait
ability between the ACBT group and control group. Comparisons between pre-and post-treatment
data within each group were analysed using a paired t-test. SPSS version 18.0 for Windows
was used to perform all analyses, and p values &#x0003c;0.05 were regarded as significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Regarding changes in postural balance, FRT and OLS were significantly improved except BBS

studies also report that the changes in BBS following the intervention fail to show
statistically significant differences<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is also believed to be caused by the
distinction of BBS tools.</p><p>FRS test is designed to evaluate the limits of stability. FRT presented an average of 34&#x02005;cm
for male adults between the age of 70 and 87 and 27&#x02005;cm for females from the same age group.
Lower than 15.20 through 17.78&#x02005;cm of the FRT is treated as limitation of functional balance.
Since the elderly of this study exhibited the 31&#x02005;cm, the study demonstrated the initial
value similar with previous studies when considering the genders<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it presented 7% improvement of static balance
following the intervention.</p><p>OLS may be quite simple yet has been used as quite a useful tool to evaluate the risk of
fall<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite its usefulness, there have been quite a few studies
asserting that it is not associated with a fall. Considering other studies on interventions
to prevent falls of the elderly, one leg stance with eyes open delivered rather a wide range
of results with 3 to 40 seconds<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies reported the time of OLS
based on the age. Old adults, especially in their 80s, showed results of OLS with a
significantly wide range, which made difficult direct comparison<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, because this study was frequently involved with
muscles participating in ankle strategy or hip strategy, where interventional motions are
deeply involved with balance, it is believed that OLS was improved. The motion of one leg
stance is responsible for 40% of all gait motions, and it also enables the swing of the
other limb. Hence, OLS test is closely related to balance ability and mobility including
gait<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. Through the findings from the balance-related indexes, it is
believed that the gait training based on the ACBT is effective in improving the balance, a
key index to the risk of a fall.</p><p>In this study, gait was assessed through TUG and 10MWT. TUG time of the control group was
significantly reduced from 10.48 seconds to 9.42 seconds which means reduced 10% compared
with initial value (p&#x0003c;0.05). The investigation provided 8 to 13.1 seconds for normal male
adults in their 60s<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it reported
that the chance of a fall is high when it takes 14 seconds or longer<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study by Desai et al.<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that TUG time was significantly increased from the
group who have not previously experienced a fall amongst the elderly. TUG time of the
subjects of this study is within the normal range; however, it is believed that it reduced
the risk for the subjects with high risks of falling as they showed 10% decrease following
the intervention. The fact that TUG time is reduced suggests that the functional mobility
has improved since the gait ability and dynamic balance ability were increased. Improving
dynamic balance ability is considered as the foundation to improve mobility while preventing
falls<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>15% of the adults who are 60&#x02005;years old or older showed anomaly in their gait, while
postural imbalance and gait disturbance leads to the risk of falling. With unstable balance,
a subject is prone to widen their stance to compensate the imbalance, lower the center of
gravity by bending the knees and somewhat widen and bend the arms to take a posture
preparing for the risks. Therefore, they walk slowly with short step and maintaining bent
position<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subsequently, it slows down
the gait speed as well as reduces the length of step, which leads to the reduced cadence. It
is originated from an attempt to adapt the body to the discreet gait pattern to enhance gait
stability and reduce the risks of falling<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>. At the same time, preceding studies<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> pointed out that the
strength of ankle plays a key role to walk across geographical features or to safely move
the body forward. During gait, it appeared that elderly is not capable of proving proper
strength to the ankle compared to young people<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because degradation of senses and
motor skills as a part of natural aging process affects mobility, especially the gait
requiring complex movements, most of fall incidents of the elderly occur during the gait,
and the reduced gait ability becomes a risk factor for falls<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Based on the findings of this study, 10MWT was significantly improved by 10% from 10.59 sec
to 9.46 sec.</p><p>The study by Trombetti et al.<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><sup>)</sup> also
reported that gait speed was increased by 5.5&#x02005;cm/s from 104.2&#x02005;cm/s to 109.7&#x02005;cm/s after
having the old adults at an average age of 75 to exercise. Cadence was increased by 2.9 from
108.1 to 111 but not significant. But the number of falls after intervention was decreased,
and the risk of a fall was also reduced; and it delivered a reducing effect to a fall at
54%.</p><p>Gait required balance ability, and there is a significant correlation between gait speed
and balance<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, this study suggests
that the improvement of postural balance improves gait ability as they bring the increase
gait speed.</p><p>The present study verified the beneficial effects of ACBT which are considered an effective
intervention for fall prevention and improving fall-related parameters in community-dwelling
older adults.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Stolze</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Klebe</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Zechlin</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Falls in frequent neurological diseases&#x02014;prevalence, risk
