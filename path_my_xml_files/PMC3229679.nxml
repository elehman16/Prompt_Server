Patients previously examined at the Norwegian Dental Biomaterials Adverse Reaction Unit were included in the study and assigned to a treatment group (<italic>n</italic> = 20) and a reference group (<italic>n</italic> = 20). Participants in the treatment group had all amalgam fillings replaced with other restorative materials. Follow-ups took place 3 months, 1 and 3 years after removal of all amalgam fillings. There was no intervention in the reference group. Subjective health complaints were measured by numeric rating scales in both groups. Analysis of covariance was used to compare changes in health complaints over time in the two groups. In the treatment group, there were significant reductions in intra-oral and general health complaints from inclusion into study to the 3-year follow-up. In the reference group, changes in the same period were not significant. Comparisons between the groups showed that reductions in intra-oral and general health complaints in the treatment group were significantly different from the changes in the reference group. The mechanisms behind this remain to be identified. Reduced exposure to dental amalgam, patient-centred treatment and follow-ups, and elimination of worry are factors that may have influenced the results.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>health complaints</kwd><kwd>amalgam</kwd><kwd>before-and-after study</kwd><kwd>dental</kwd><kwd>restoration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>For decades, dental amalgam has been extensively used in the treatment of caries lesions. Dental amalgam consists of approximately 50% metallic mercury mixed with an alloy mainly consisting of silver, tin and copper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The safety of dental amalgam has been questioned, and it has been discussed to what extent mercury released from amalgam fillings may lead to adverse health effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Generally, no deleterious effects from amalgam are detected in studies on samples of the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), and no adverse reactions could be detected in two randomised controlled studies on school children treated with dental amalgam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Dental amalgam fillings release elemental mercury vapour in the mouth, resulting in elevated concentrations of mercury in blood, plasma and urine, and concentration of inorganic mercury in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The possibility that a small fraction of the population may have predispositions to rare adverse reactions to dental amalgam cannot be ruled out; thus, research on adverse effects associated with exposure to dental amalgam should focus on the possibility of rare outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). People with health complaints attributed to dental amalgam believe their health complaints are caused, or aggravated, by mercury released from their amalgam fillings. It has been established that dental amalgam fillings may lead to local adverse reactions, including oral lichenoid reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), and removal of amalgam fillings in contact with the lesions is generally recommended. However, for a number of patients, no objective signs of adverse reactions to amalgam fillings, or other diseases explaining their complaints, can be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Patients who attribute subjective health complaints to dental amalgam describe a number of health complaints including tiredness, headaches, pain from muscles and joints, and problems with memory and concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). There is a lack of treatment options for patients without objective signs of adverse reactions to amalgam fillings, and removal of sound amalgam fillings is generally not recommended. Some patients nevertheless decide to remove all amalgam fillings at their own initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), and studies have reported significant improvements in subjective health complaints after the removal of amalgam fillings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether removal of all amalgam fillings in a group of patients who attributed subjective health complaints to dental amalgam (treatment group) was associated with long-lasting changes in subjective health complaints. The underlying null hypothesis was that there would be no significant differences in long-term changes in health complaints between the treatment group and a comparable reference group. In addition, secondary analyses of changes in health complaints in the treatment group and the reference group were investigated independently, testing the null hypotheses of no changes in health complaints within each group. Within-group changes in mercury concentration in serum and urine in the treatment group were also investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>The study was designed as a before-and-after study with a comparison group (reference group) comparing changes in health complaints in a treatment group, which had all amalgam fillings replaced with other restorative materials, with changes in health complaints in a comparable reference group, which did not receive any intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from patients (<italic>n</italic> = 368) examined at the Norwegian Dental Biomaterials Adverse Reaction Unit in the period 1993&#x02013;1999 (initial examination; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The majority of the patients had been referred to the unit because of health complaints attributed to amalgam fillings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Generally, either the patient or the referring physician/dentist had raised the question that dental materials could be a causal or contributing factor related to the patient's health problems. In 2000&#x02013;2001, patients with known addresses (<italic>n</italic> = 358) were sent a questionnaire (Questionnaire 1) regarding current health complaints and medical and dental treatment since the initial examination. The questionnaire was returned by 207 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Based on the responses to the questionnaire, 157 patients did not fulfil one or more of the inclusion criteria listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, leaving 50 patients who were randomly allocated into a treatment group (<italic>n</italic> = 20), a reference group (<italic>n</italic> = 20) and a group of reserves (<italic>n</italic> = 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The function random number in Microsoft Excel 97 was used for the allocation. The exclusion criteria listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> were applied to the treatment group in order to increase the probability of participants in this group being able to complete the replacement process. Six participants were excluded from the treatment group according to these criteria. The same exclusion criteria were used in the group of reserves for sequential inclusion into the treatment group, resulting in four participants not being eligible for participation in the treatment group. The remaining six participants from the group of reserves were used to replace the excluded participants from the treatment group. The criteria were applied based on clinical documentation, telephone interviews and a clinical examination (pre-treatment examination). The exclusion criteria were initially not applied to the reference group as no intervention was planned for this group.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Eligibility criteria and number of patients not included.

Patients were also asked to complete questionnaires regarding suspected adverse reactions to dental materials, current and previous health complaints and demographic variables. Participants included in the present study had at the initial examination neither signs of contact allergic reactions to dental materials nor a known history of such reactions and consequently were not recommended removal of amalgam fillings.</p></sec><sec><title>Questionnaire 1 (2000&#x02013;2001)</title><p>Questionnaire 1 included questions regarding current health complaints, treatment since the initial examination and demographic variables. Health complaints were measured by numeric rating scales using numbers from 0 to 10. No information on a planned intervention study was given in the questionnaire. Responses to Questionnaire 1 were used for identifying patients eligible for participation and as baseline values for comparisons of changes in health complaints in the treatment group and the reference group. Questions from Questionnaire 1 were included in all subsequent questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-treatment examination</title><p>In September 2002, participants in the treatment group underwent a pre-treatment examination consisting of medical and dental examinations and collection of samples of blood serum and urine. Blood serum was analysed for mercury concentration by sector field inductively coupled plasma&#x02013;mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), while urine was analysed for mercury concentration by cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Participants also responded to a questionnaire similar to Questionnaire 1. The pre-treatment examination and all subsequent follow-ups took place at the Dental Biomaterials Adverse Reaction Unit. Participants in the reference group were not assigned any treatment and were not asked to go through a pre-treatment examination.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The assigned intervention in the treatment group was removal of all amalgam fillings. The amalgam fillings were replaced with other dental restorative materials (e.g<italic>.</italic> composites, ceramic restorations and metalloceramic crowns). All treatment costs were covered by project funds. Replacement of amalgam fillings is not possible to mask, and thus, no blinding was used. The replacement was carried out by the participants&#x02019; own dentists according to clinical guidelines aiming at minimal exposure to mercury during removal sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The dentists were instructed to use rubber dam, high-volume suction, water cooling and to remove fillings in chunks using a sharp dental bur. Eighteen dentists from 18 different dental practices were involved in the study. One dentist treated three patients; the other dentists treated one patient each. Participants were given written instructions to contact the Dental Biomaterials Adverse Reaction Unit if they experienced increased health complaints like chills, fever, pain and rashes in relation to the amalgam replacement process. These instructions included advice to the patient's physician regarding blood tests to be taken (leucocytes, CRP, IgE and mercury concentration in blood) in case of increased health complaints after dental treatment.</p><p>To compare replacement of amalgam fillings with the standard treatment (i.e<italic>.</italic> no amalgam replacement), no intervention was assigned to the reference group.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><sec><title>Treatment group</title><p>Routines for the follow-ups were similar to the pre-treatment examination. Follow-ups took place 3 months, 1 and 3 years after completed replacement of amalgam fillings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). The follow-ups included control of the new dental restorations by a dentist, questions about experienced side effects like post-operative dental pain and other complications, and collection of serum samples. Urine samples were collected at follow-up after 1 year. No general medical interview or health guidance was included.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Timeline for the study.

Participants were sent Questionnaire 2 in 2004 and Questionnaire 3 in 2007. Questionnaire 2 was given at approximately the same time as the majority of participants in the treatment group went through their 1-year follow-up. Questionnaire 3 was given in parallel with the 3-year follow-up in the treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Based on available information from the initial examination and Questionnaire 1, the exclusion criteria used in the treatment group were applied <italic>post hoc</italic> to the reference group, resulting in two of the initial 20 participants being excluded. Reasons for exclusion were severe food allergy and complicated dental treatment (one patient) and diagnosed contact allergy to substances in resin-based dental materials (one patient). Results from comparisons of changes in health complaints in the treatment group and the reference group were calculated using both the initial reference group and the reference group with the two participants excluded from analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcome variables</title><p>Primary outcome measures were changes in local oro-facial complaints and general health complaints from Questionnaire 1 (inclusion into study) to the 3-year follow-up in the treatment group and to Questionnaire 3 in the reference group. Current health complaints in both groups were measured by numeric rating scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) included in the questionnaires. The questionnaires were given at all measure points. The same scales have previously been used in a similar patient population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) and include 23 items addressing a diverse range of oro-facial and general health complaints frequently reported by patients with subjective health complaints attributed to amalgam fillings. Oro-facial complaints were categorised as either intra-oral (six items: intra-oral burning sensation, intra-oral pain/tenderness, taste disturbances, intra-oral stiffness/paresthesia, dry mouth and increased salivation/mucus) or extra-oral (five items: extra-oral burning sensation, extra-oral pain/tenderness, extra-oral stiffness/paresthesia, extra-oral skin problems and pain from temporomandibular joints). The sum scores for each category were used as index scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Index scores for general health complaints (12 items: musculoskeletal complaints, gastrointestinal complaints, cardiovascular complaints, skin problems, complaints related to eyes/sight, complaints related to ears/hearing/nose/throat, tiredness, dizziness, headaches, memory problems, difficulty concentrating and anxiety/depression) were constructed in the same way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Highest possible index score was 60 for intra-oral index, 50 for extra-oral index and 120 for the general health complaints index. Internal consistency for the indices was estimated by Cronbach's alpha using the entire group of patients randomised (<italic>n</italic> = 50; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) and found to be 0&#x000b7;66, 0&#x000b7;72 and 0&#x000b7;80, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Power calculation</title><p>Number of participants included in this study was limited by available patients. One of the main objectives of the study was to test the null hypothesis that changes in index scores for health complaints were equal in the treatment group and in the reference group. Assuming a mean difference in index score for general health complaints of 10&#x000b7;0 between the groups (corresponding to a mean difference before&#x02013;after of 10&#x000b7;0 in the treatment group versus a mean difference of 0&#x000b7;0 in the reference group) and a common within-group standard deviation of 10&#x000b7;0, a sample size of 20 patients in each group will give the study a power of 87% to yield a statistically significant result. The criterion for significance (alpha) was 0&#x000b7;05, and the test was two-tailed.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Mean values with 95% confidence intervals and analysis of variance were used for comparisons between groups. Paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests and analysis of variance for repeated measures were used to investigate within-group changes over time. Variables for changes in health complaints, from Questionnaire 1 to the 3-year follow-up in the treatment group and from Questionnaire 1 to Questionnaire 3 in the reference group, were constructed by subtracting the most recent scores from the scores from Questionnaire 1. A positive value indicated a reduction in complaints, whereas a negative value indicated increased complaints. The primary hypothesis of changes in reported health complaints in the treatment group compared with the reference group was tested by between-group comparisons of unadjusted pre&#x02013;post per-protocol changes in the two groups using independent-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests. Adjustments for age, gender, and complaint intensity reported in Questionnaire 1 were made by analysis of covariance. We used last value carried forward to replace missing values for intention-to-treat analysis (ITT). SamplePower 2.0<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> was used for power calculations, and SPSS 15.0<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> was used for all other statistical analyses. <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05 were considered statistically significant for all analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval and registration</title><p>The project protocol was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics in Western Norway (REK III, 24.01) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00346944).

The increase in complaints was transient and disappeared within a week or two.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate long-term changes in subjective health complaints after the removal of all amalgam fillings in a group of patients who attributed health complaints to amalgam fillings. The main finding was that the long-lasting reductions in intra-oral and general health complaints in the treatment group were significantly different from the change in the reference group, in which there were no long-lasting reductions.</p><p>In the treatment group, intra-oral and general health complaints were significantly reduced 3 years after completed replacement of amalgam fillings. Reductions in subjective health complaints after replacement of amalgam fillings have also been found in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). The reference group received no intervention, and no improvement in health complaints was found. This is in agreement with data from patients with health complaints attributed to dental restorations, mainly dental amalgam, who did not change the restorations to other materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>It is necessary to consider several factors that may have influenced the results. First, there has been a reduced exposure to mercury in the treatment group. Previous studies have established that people with amalgam fillings have higher concentrations of mercury in blood, plasma, urine and body organs than people without amalgam fillings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). The finding of reduced levels of mercury in serum and urine in the present study is in agreement with data from several studies showing that replacement of amalgam fillings leads to reduced levels of mercury in blood, plasma and urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Despite this, studies investigating the relationship between amalgam fillings and reported health complaints have not found positive correlations between number of amalgam fillings and number of reported complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), indicating that if there is a causal relationship between amalgam fillings and health effects, there is not a simple dose&#x02013;response relationship between exposure to amalgam fillings and reported health complaints. In a recently published study on health effects after removal of amalgam fillings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), correlations between amalgam-filled surfaces and symptom scores were not statistically significant. However, positive moderate correlations were found between mercury levels in both plasma and urine and subjective health complaints, and between reductions in mercury levels in these media and reductions in subjective health complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). In the present study, we found positive but not significant correlations between reduction in mercury concentration in serum and reductions in subjective health complaints, which may be in agreement with the analyses presented in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). It is possible that some individuals are highly sensitive to mercury from dental amalgam and may benefit from reduced exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>).</p><p>The reference group received no treatment and was only followed up by questionnaires sent by post. This makes it difficult to untangle the effects of the general care associated with amalgam replacement and follow-ups in the treatment group from the effects of the amalgam replacement itself. Follow-ups in the treatment group were carried out by health personnel with both time and motivation to listen to and understand the patients&#x02019; experiences. This may have contributed to the reduction in reported subjective health complaints as patient-centred communication has been shown to be associated with improved patient health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). In addition, participants in the treatment group no longer had to worry about possible adverse effects from their amalgam fillings. This may also have played a part in the reduction in health complaints as worry has been found to lead to increased monitoring of complaints, which again may lead to an increased feeling of ill health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Even so, replacement of amalgam fillings will usually take place in a treatment context where factors like these are present and, thus, potentially might influence the treatment results. Participants&#x02019; belief in amalgam replacement as an effective treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) and gratitude in relation to having the replacement covered by project funds could possibly have resulted in a response bias towards reporting reduced health complaints. However, it is not likely that the participants would remember how they responded to the scales in the questionnaires several years ago. Factors mentioned above are linked to components related to placebo (expectations, conditioning, learning, memory, motivation, somatic focus, reward, anxiety reduction and meaning), as defined as a genuine psychobiological event attributable to the overall therapeutic context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). In this context, it is also possible that for some patients, the presence of amalgam fillings has been associated with a nocebo effect. Removal of amalgam fillings could therefore result in a discontinuation of this effect and consequently lead to a reduction in reported health complaints.</p><p>Reduction in intra-oral health complaints may have been influenced by general effects of the dental treatment received during the amalgam replacement process. It does, however, seem unlikely that an effect of a generally improved dental health should be prominent 3 years after completed replacement, given that patients with need for complicated dental rehabilitation were excluded from the treatment group and that the removed amalgam fillings were described as sound and well-functioning.</p><p>Participants included in this study were recruited from patients referred to the Dental Biomaterials Adverse Reaction Unit. Consequently, participants are not representative of all patients with health complaints attributed to amalgam fillings. Not all patients with health complaints attributed to dental amalgam are referred to this unit. Some patients are directly treated by their own dentist or general practitioner or seek help from practitioners of alternative medicine. Despite lack of objective signs of adverse reactions to dental amalgam, some patients nevertheless have all their amalgam fillings removed of their own accord because they are concerned about possible adverse effects of mercury released from amalgam fillings. The participants included in this study had not removed all amalgam fillings, either because they accepted that there were no indications for amalgam removal or because they did not have the financial means necessary for amalgam removal. Thus, the treatment group is not directly comparable with patients who remove amalgam restorations of their own accord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>The study was designed as a before-and-after study with a comparison group (reference group). Comparisons between the reference group and the treatment group must be interpreted with caution. Even though power calculations showed acceptable power of the study, the sample size is small and the results should be considered in context with results from comparable studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). A larger sample size could provide more precise estimates and less-wide confidence intervals. In addition, there may be unknown factors that influence reporting of health complaints over time in the groups. Another limitation could be that as the outcome is based on the participants&#x02019; reporting of health complaints, the study is open for response bias in both the treatment group and the reference group.</p><p>In the treatment group, all 20 participants completed replacement of amalgam fillings, and 19 of the participants were able to attend the 3-year follow-up. In the reference group, seven of the 20 participants were lost to follow-up or excluded because of completed removal of amalgam fillings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The response rate in the reference group was influenced by the fact that only two reminders, by letter, is allowed by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics. This is in line with the standards used by the Norwegian National Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics. As there were no major differences between the results from the per-protocol analyses and the intention-to-treat analyses, we assume the potential bias from non-random dropout of participants or exclusion of &#x02018;protocol violators&#x02019; (participants in the reference group who removed amalgam during the study) had no major impact on the result.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were initially not applied in the reference group. The clinical examination necessary to fully apply these criteria could potentially lead to a renewed focus on amalgam fillings as a possible cause of ill health, thus increasing the risk of participants in the reference group initiating amalgam removal of their own accord. As no intervention was planned for the reference group, the participants were not asked to undergo a clinical examination. The patients excluded from the treatment group were, based on their responses to Questionnaire 1, quite similar to the treatment group and the reference group, with the exception of per cent on sick leave or disability pension. For this variable, exclusion of the 10 patients resulted in a more equal occupational status for the treatment group and the reference group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Changes in health complaints in the treatment group were compared with changes in both the initial reference group and changes in the reference group after <italic>post hoc</italic> application of exclusion criteria. No major differences were found between the two comparisons. However, as there was no clinical pre-treatment examination of patients in the reference group, there could still be differences between the groups. The bias from differences between the groups at study start is expected to be limited.</p><p>Treatment of patients with subjective health complaints attributed to amalgam fillings should only be considered after a thorough medical and dental examination has been carried out and other causes for the complaints have been eliminated or adequately treated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). The results from the present study, and other studies investigating the effects of amalgam replacement, indicate that replacement of amalgam fillings is associated with reductions in subjective health complaints at group level. The mechanisms behind this are not known, and other treatment options than amalgam replacement should also be considered. In a recent randomised clinical trial, all investigated treatments (amalgam removal, amalgam removal plus biological detoxification and health promotion without amalgam removal) resulted in clinically relevant reductions in health complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). When considering replacement of intact amalgam fillings, potential benefits must be balanced with risks associated with the dental treatment (e.g. tooth fractures or endodontic complications). When removing amalgam fillings, measures should be taken in order to minimise exposure to mercury for both patients and dental personnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>).</p><p>The results from the present study indicate that the replacement of amalgam fillings was associated with reductions in subjective health complaints at group level. The mechanisms behind this remain to be identified. Reduced exposure to mercury, patient-centred treatment and follow-ups, and elimination of worry are factors that may have influenced the results. In this study, we investigated changes in index scores. More knowledge is needed about changes in specific complaints included in the index scores after replacement of amalgam fillings, and a characterisation of the treatment group in this respect is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>Associate professor Olav B&#x000f8;e, Department of Clinical Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, is acknowledged for constructive participation in discussions on statistical issues.
