Modulation of the S1P<sub>1</sub> receptor has been previously described to be an effective treatment of autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis).</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the relative bioavailability of two polymorphic forms of ponesimod in capsules (Form A versus Form C; Study 1) and the relative bioavailability of a capsule formulation and a tablet formulation (both polymorphic Form C; Study 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Two open-label, randomized, two-way crossover studies in healthy subjects were performed. In Study 1, 12 male subjects received a single dose of 20&#x000a0;mg of polymorphic Form A or Form C of ponesimod in a capsule. In Study 2, 14 male and female subjects (ratio 1:1) received a single dose of 40&#x000a0;mg of polymorphic Form C of ponesimod in either a capsule or a tablet formulation. Pharmacokinetic and safety variables (clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, and an electrocardiogram) were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Comparison of the exposure to ponesimod following administration of the formulations in Study 1 showed that the 90&#x000a0;% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios for the area under the curve from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>), the area under the curve from time zero to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>), the terminal half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>), and the maximum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) were all within the 0.80&#x02013;1.25 bioequivalence interval. In Study 2, more rapid absorption of ponesimod was observed from the tablet formulation than from the capsule formulation.

S1P effects are mediated by the activation of five G-protein-coupled receptors, S1P<sub>1</sub> to S1P<sub>5</sub>. Among them, the S1P<sub>1</sub> receptors, which are expressed in many cell types (e.g., lymphocytes, cardiomyocytes, and endothelial cells), induce <italic>G</italic><sub>&#x003b1;i</sub> protein-mediated signaling and play a role in the immune and cardiovascular systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recent studies have revealed that functional antagonism of the S1P<sub>1</sub> receptor leads to inhibition of the egress of lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs and a low lymphocyte count in peripheral blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Ponesimod (ACT-128800) is a potent, orally active, selective, reversible S1P<sub>1</sub> receptor modulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] currently in clinical development for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and has successfully reached its study end points in recent phase II trials in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or relapsing&#x02013;remitting multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Single- and multiple-dose administration of ponesimod results in a dose-dependent decrease in circulating lymphocytes in healthy subjects and is associated with heart rate reduction, a delay in atrioventricular conduction, and pulmonary effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The maximum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) is achieved approximately 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h after dosing (<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>), and the terminal half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) is approximately 32&#x000a0;h. Steady-state conditions are attained within 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days when ponesimod is administered once daily at any given dose. Increases in <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> are dose proportional, while increases in the area under the curve (AUC) are slightly greater than dose proportional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] revealed low variability in pharmacokinetic parameters (inter-subject variability &#x0003c;36&#x000a0;%). Previous clinical trials were performed with polymorph Form A (a hydrated crystalline form) of ponesimod capsules. During the development of the drug, solid-state investigations revealed the existence of distinct polymorphic forms of ponesimod. Form C (an anhydrous polymorphic form)&#x02014;the thermodynamically most stable form at room temperature so far known&#x02014;was identified. Moreover, a tablet formulation of Form C with a smaller size, compared with the capsules, was developed.</p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the two polymorphic forms (Form A and Form C in capsules), as well as the capsule and tablet formulations of Form C of ponesimod, in terms of their pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability, in order to bridge the results obtained in early clinical studies using capsules of Form A with those of later studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy male and female subjects aged between 18 and 65&#x000a0;years were included in this study. The health of the subjects was assessed at the screening visit, which included recording of the medical history, medications taken during the 3&#x000a0;months preceding the screening visit, a physical examination, measurement of body weight and height, clinical laboratory tests, recording of vital signs, and a standard electrocardiogram (ECG). Because of the teratogenic potential of ponesimod, women of childbearing potential were required to use two reliable and protocol-approved methods of contraception from screening until 2&#x000a0;months after the last study drug intake. At screening, subjects had to have a PR interval of &#x0003c;200&#x000a0;ms, a heart rate of &#x0003e;55&#x000a0;beats per minute (bpm), and a total lymphocyte count of &#x0003e;1000 lymphocytes/&#x000b5;L. Written informed consent was obtained from each individual participating in the study prior to any study procedure and after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the studies. These studies were conducted at different centers and at different times. The Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes (Paris, France) approved the protocol of Study 1, and the Aspire Institutional Review Board (La Mesa, CA, USA) approved the protocol of Study 2. These studies were performed according to good clinical practice and in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p>This work was performed at two centers, one in France for the comparison of polymorphic Form A and Form C in capsules (Study 1) and one in the USA for the comparison between capsules and tablets of Form C (Study 2). Each study was a single-center, randomized, open-label, two-period, two-treatment, crossover, biocomparison study. A total of 26 subjects (12 healthy male subjects in Study 1: age 31.3 [&#x000b1;12.8] years, body weight 75.4 [&#x000b1;11.3] kg; 14 healthy male and female subjects [ratio 1:1] in Study 2: age 31.1 [&#x000b1;14.9] years, body weight 69.0 [&#x000b1;14.5] kg) were enrolled, and all subjects received active treatment. A power of 80&#x000a0;% was estimated with a sample size of 12 subjects (in Study 1) and 14 subjects (in Study 2), based on an intra-subject coefficient of variation of the tablet formulation of ~12&#x000a0;% observed in previous clinical trials of ponesimod. The treatment consisted of two treatment periods of a single dose of ponesimod 20&#x000a0;mg as one Form A or Form C capsule (in Study 1) or two treatment periods of a single dose of ponesimod 40&#x000a0;mg either as one capsule or one tablet (in Study 2). These doses have been used in phase II trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. All treatments were administered in the morning with approximately 240&#x000a0;mL of water, and the two treatment periods were separated by a wash-out period of 8&#x02013;15&#x000a0;days in Study 1 and 14&#x02013;15&#x000a0;days in Study 2. The subjects remained fasted from at least 10&#x000a0;h prior to drug intake until 4&#x000a0;h afterward. The subjects remained in the clinic from day &#x02212;1 (i.e., the day prior to study drug administration) until day 2, 24&#x000a0;h after study drug administration, and they could then be discharged if this was allowed on the basis of their medical condition at the end of each treatment period. An end-of-study visit comprising the same examinations as those performed at the screening visit was conducted 6&#x000a0;days or 22 (+2) days after the last study drug administration in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Safety and Tolerability Assessments</title><p>Safety and tolerability were evaluated by monitoring of adverse events and vital signs (supine blood pressure and heart rate), a cardiodynamic assessment (a 12-lead ECG recording), pulmonary function tests, clinical laboratory tests, and physical and neurological examinations.</p><p>Vital signs were recorded from subjects in the supine position after they had rested for at least a 5-min period pre-dose and 1, 2.5, 4, 10, 24, 48, and 144&#x000a0;h after study drug administration in both Study 1 and Study 2.

The observed safety profile was comparable between the different formulations. Previous clinical studies were performed with ponesimod polymorphic Form A. This form is a crystalline solid obtained by rapid precipitation, whereas another formulation obtained by slow crystallization has been developed. This Form&#x000a0;C is thermodynamically more stable than Form A. In addition, the slow crystallization of Form C in the final step of the synthesis is easier to control and more reproducible, especially on a large manufacturing scale, than the rapid precipitation that yields Form A. In addition, a tablet formulation has been developed, which is preferred to the capsule formulation, since the tablets are smaller and easier to swallow, which may improve patient compliance. It is worth noting that difficulties in swallowing are relatively frequent in patients with multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. More importantly, tablets are generally more stable than capsules. In the present work, we have shown bioequivalence between the two polymorphic forms of ponesimod, and we observed slightly more rapid absorption of ponesimod when it was administered as tablet formulation. Therefore, ponesimod capsules can be substituted with tablets without any dose adjustment.</p><p>Between Study 1 and Study 2, the increases in <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> were dose proportional and the increases in AUC were slightly greater than dose proportional, which is in line with the findings of previous clinical studies performed with ponesimod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Whereas similar exposure in male and female subjects has been seen previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the findings of a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] are in good agreement with the greater exposure in female subjects that was observed in the present work. This finding could be related to differences in body weight, requiring dose adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>In terms of safety and tolerability, a similar incidence and nature of adverse events was observed in Study 1 and Study 2. No new findings were observed, in comparison with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The incidence of adverse events and the percentage of subjects displaying adverse events were dose dependent. In current phase II studies, an up-titration scheme (a first dose of 10&#x000a0;mg) is applied in patients to improve the safety and tolerability of ponesimod treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The lymphocyte nadir (maximum observed decrease) was higher following administration of ponesimod 20&#x000a0;mg than following 40&#x000a0;mg. This might have been related to the timing of the assessments. Indeed, in Study 2, the lymphocyte count was assessed pre-dose and 144&#x000a0;h after ponesimod administration. In Study 1, additional assessments were performed daily.</p><p>In good agreement with previous studies, we observed transient significant reductions in the heart rate and blood pressure following administration of ponesimod, which were induced by the activation of S1P<sub>1</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The maximum decrease was observed 2.5&#x000a0;h after ponesimod administration, and the heart rate returned to baseline within 10&#x000a0;h, as previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. When comparing Study 1 and Study 2, no clear dose-dependent effect was observed. This was also the case in a previous study, in which the decrease in the heart rate was similar in the 20 and 50&#x000a0;mg dose groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While comparison across studies has limitations, we may assume that the effect on the heart rate reaches a plateau with ponesimod 20&#x000a0;mg. This reduction in the heart rate following ponesimod administration is explained by the internalization of the S1P<sub>1</sub> receptors and their desensitization. This effect has been well characterized for S1P modulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The two polymorphic forms of ponesimod and the tablet and capsule formulations were similar in terms of their pharmacokinetics, except for more rapid absorption of the tablet formulation than the capsule formulation. At the same dose, the strength, safety, and tolerability were similar. Therefore, Form A can be substituted with Form C, and capsules can be substituted with tablets.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to express their thanks to Dr. Andrea Vaclavkova for her contribution to this work.</p><sec id="d30e1310"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd provided funding for these clinical trials.
