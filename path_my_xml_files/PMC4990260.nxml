This study provides Class II evidence to answer this question. Primary efficacy variables were changes in total PSPRS and total UPDRS between baseline and month 12, where change was calculated as the 12-month follow-up score minus the baseline score. Secondary clinical outcome variables included PSP subscales, UPDRS subscales, Schwab and England ADL, MMSE, PDQ-39, and SF-36 scores.</p><p>Baseline demographics and UPDRS and PSPRS scores were compared between CoQ10 and placebo groups. Student <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare continuous variables, with results presented as means and SDs, and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests were used to compare distributions of categorical variables. The mean change from baseline to 12-month values for primary and secondary outcomes was compared between CoQ10 and placebo groups using Student <italic>t</italic> tests. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the distribution of change in CoQ10 between groups because the SDs between groups were different by a factor of approximately10; medians and 25th to 75th percentiles are also presented for change in CoQ10. Since the change from baseline to 12-month values was the a priori&#x02013;defined primary assessment time point, we do not show <italic>p</italic> values comparing CoQ10 and placebo groups at each intermediate follow-up time, although these data are plotted for the primary endpoints together with error bars (mean &#x000b1; 2 standard errors).</p><p>A scatterplot with a least squares regression line was used to assess the relationship between the change from baseline to 12-month CoQ10 and the change from baseline to 12-month PSPRS.

Based on this analysis, there was no treatment difference for either total PSPRS or UPDRS scores.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study demonstrates that 12 months of treatment in patients with PSP with 2,400 mg of CoQ10 daily is safe and tolerable. Sixty-one participants received 2,400 mg/d or placebo for up to 12 months. Compliance rates were high, approximately 92%. Those taking CoQ10 showed less clinical decline in total PSPRS score among those who completed the study, but the difference was not statistically significant. No statistically significant differences were noted between CoQ10 and placebo groups in other clinical assessments.</p><p>Limitations of our study design include small sample size and short follow-up period. A total of 61 participants were enrolled in the study. With an even smaller sample size remaining at 12 months, this study does not have sufficient power to identify a modest therapeutic benefit of CoQ10. The separation between placebo and CoQ10 groups in PSPRS appears more prominent over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>), suggesting that a greater difference might have been noted with longer follow-up. Another issue is that most participants were fairly advanced in disease at the onset of the study, partly because many years of illness often pass before a clear clinical diagnosis of PSP can be made. Intervention with CoQ10 at an earlier stage of disease may be more effective.</p><p>An unanticipated limitation of our study was the high withdrawal rate. This does not appear related to the treatment; rather, it reflects the difficulty of maintaining continued study participation of a cohort of patients with this debilitating disease. The main stated reasons for withdrawal included lack of perceived benefit and travel distance. We compared the demographics of placebo and CoQ10 groups among those who completed the group and saw statistically significant differences in sex only, as with the whole cohort. We also compared demographic and clinical data between those participants who withdrew early and those who completed the trial, and saw that those who withdrew showed a greater rate of decline in total PSPRS, suggesting that those who progressed faster were more likely to withdraw early. To account for the dropout rate, we reanalyzed all patients regardless of withdrawal using pattern mixture model analysis. By this analysis, there was no significant difference in total PSPRS or UPDRS between groups.</p><p>Comparing the CoQ10 group that completed the study to the CoQ10 group that withdrew early, we saw a difference in the progression rate as assessed by change in total PSPRS score at 3 months. The average total PSPRS score declined more rapidly among those in the treatment group who withdrew before 12 months. This raises the concern that the treatment effect we saw among those who completed the trial is skewed by the fact that the patients who withdrew are progressing more quickly. Alternatively, there may be a subgroup among the CoQ10-treated patients that particularly respond to CoQ10, and, as a result, were more likely to continue the study. One possibility is that different clinical subtypes of PSP may respond differentially to CoQ10. Thus, it remains possible that there is a subgroup of patients with PSP in which CoQ10 is a beneficial treatment.</p><p>The high withdrawal rate in this study over the 12-month study period reinforces the fact that clinical trials in PSP are difficult to perform. Because of the difficulty in making the diagnosis of PSP, especially by non&#x02013;movement disorder specialists, patients are often advanced by the time they are diagnosed with PSP. Patients also are usually advanced in the disease process by the time they meet diagnostic criteria for probable PSP,<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> the criteria we used for inclusion in the study. As mobility of the participants becomes more restricted over time, the ability of patients to return for follow-up study visits declines. Indeed, we found that those participates who were declining more rapidly as measured by the change in PSPRS were more likely to drop out of the study. Because of this challenge of maintaining study participation of patients with PSP, the ideal of a longer period of observation beyond 1 year may not be feasible for a fair number of patients with PSP.</p><p>A smaller study evaluated CoQ10 treatment for 6 weeks in 21 patients.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> A small but statistically significant improvement was observed in PSPRS and the Frontal Assessment Battery in CoQ10-treated participants. Similar to our study, no significant differences were observed in UPDRS, MMSE, and ADL scores. Trial differences include length of treatment and the CoQ10 dose and formulation. In the 21-patient study,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> participants were followed for 6 weeks, while participants were followed for 1 year in our study. This raises the possibility that CoQ10 could have a transient but unsustained benefit. In our study, all participants were treated with 2,400 mg daily compared to a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight in the smaller study. Differences in CoQ10 formulations could also account for differences in studies. Average serum CoQ10 levels were higher for the above-mentioned 21-patient study compared to our study; thus, serum CoQ10 level differences could account for the different results between these studies.</p><p>CoQ10 at 2,400 mg daily is safe and well tolerated in patients with PSP. No statistically significant benefits were observed, although a nonsignificant, slower clinical decline in the CoQ10 group was seen in the PSPRS score among those who completed the study. These data suggest that any benefit of CoQ10 in PSP is modest at best, and that demonstrating this benefit would require a much larger trial with longer duration. Such a trial would also need to address the difficulties of maintaining continued trial participation over a long duration in this patient population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors thank Kaneka for providing raw CoQ10 and Vitaline Formulas for manufacturing the CoQ10 and placebo materials for the study duration.
