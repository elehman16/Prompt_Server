Different progestogens component of the OCs have been shown to improve the skin, hair, menstrual cycle related disorders and dysmenorrhoeic pain. Thus, we compared the efficacy of OCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) and chlormadinone acetate (CMA) versus OCs containing EE and drospirenone (DRSP) for the treatment of acne and dysmenorrhea.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This study was an investigator-blinded, randomized, parallel group study conducted at the Family Planning Clinic, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. Women aged between 18 and 45&#x000a0;years were randomly assigned into two treatment groups, either EE/CMA at the dosage of 30 mcg/2&#x000a0;mg once daily (OD) or EE/DRSP at the dosage of 30 mcg/3&#x000a0;mg OD. The subjects were evaluated for the OC&#x02019;s efficacy for the treatment of acne and dysmenorrhea at baseline visit and after 1, 3, and 6&#x000a0;months of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total of 180 women were randomized into the study. Each group had 90 women. Baseline characteristics between both groups were comparable. At Month 6, there was a significantly greater reduction of total acne lesion in the EE/CMA group than EE/DRSP (72.2% vs 64.5%; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.009). As per the investigator&#x02019;s global assessment of acne treatment, a higher proportion of the subjects from the EE/CMA group was rated &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d; than those from the EE/DRSP (75.3% vs 49.4%). More subjects from the EE/CMA group had graded their improvement in acne as &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d; compared to the EE/DRSP group (66.3% vs 48.3%). A higher proportion of the subjects in the EE/CMA group reported a decrease in dysmenorrhoeic pain as &#x0201c;much decrease&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;decrease&#x0201d;. The absence of dysmenorrhea pain was more frequently found in the EE/CMA group and significantly seen as early as Month 1 also in the EE/CMA group compared to EE/DRSP (47.2% vs 27.3%, respectively). The treatments were generally well-tolerated in both groups. There were no significant differences between both groups for adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">EE/CMA is more effective for the treatment of acne and dysmenorrhea in women with mild to moderate acne vulgaris and dysmenorrhea than EE/DRSP.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">Thai Clinical Trial Registry ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.in.th/index.php?tp=regtrials&#x00026;menu=trialsearch&#x00026;smenu=fulltext&#x00026;task=search&#x00026;task2=view1&#x00026;id=2517">TCTR20170518001</ext-link> (date of registration: May 17, 2017; retrospectively registered).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Oral contraceptive</kwd><kwd>Chlormadinone acetate</kwd><kwd>Drospirenone</kwd><kwd>Acne</kwd><kwd>Dysmenorrhea</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par15">Family planning programs have widely used oral contraceptives (OCs) since their introduction in 1960 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Aside from having high contraceptive efficacy and safety profile, OCs also have non-contraceptive benefits such as for the skin, hair and menstrual cycle related disorders.</p><p id="Par16">Nowadays, there are many OCs one can choose from. The different formulations in estrogen and progestogens make each OC unique. Modern OCs contain less ethinyl estradiol (EE) so that there will be fewer serious adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As the estrogen component of EE remains the same among different combined OCs, the progestogen component varies according to the different brands of combined OCs available. Different progestogens contribute to the distinctive and unique non-contraceptive benefits. Particular combined OCs containing weak or no androgenic effects or even with anti-androgenic progestogens were of preferred choices for acne treatment. Among these preferred progestogens are chlormadinone acetate (CMA) and drospirenone (DRSP). Furthermore, a systemic review showed positive effects of combined OCs on dysmenorrhea which is a common problem among women who menstruate. It has been shown that certain combined OCs can reduce the frequency and severity of dysmenorrhoeic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">EE/CMA is a monophasic combined low-dose OC containing CMA 2.0&#x000a0;mg and EE 30 mcg per tablet. In clinical trials, this contraceptive was well tolerated and showed reliable contraceptive efficacy, good cycle control and beneficial anti-androgenic effects on both skin and hair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In a phase III study, there was a 60&#x02013;70% improvement in acne after six cycles of EE/CMA use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, acne was cured in 90% of the subjects after 12&#x000a0;cycles of EE/CMA.</p><p id="Par18">Another distinct property of EE/CMA is its beneficial effect on dysmenorrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In a post marketing surveillance survey, from 1266 subjects, 66% of the subjects were cured of dysmenorrhea and another 14% had reduced symptoms of dysmenorrhea after 12&#x000a0;cycles of EE/CMA use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In another study conducted in 1939 women, they reported a 95% decrease in dysmenorrhea after 4&#x000a0;cycles of EE/CMA use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Another progestogen, DRSP, has anti-androgenic and anti-mineralocorticoid effects but has negligible estrogenic or glucocorticoid activity. EE/DRSP is a monophasic combined OC containing DRSP 3.0&#x000a0;mg and EE 30 mcg per tablet. It has been shown that after 9 treatment cycles of EE/DRSP, the total acne lesion count in women with mild-to-moderate facial acne was reduced by 62.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Number of studies have shown that a combination of EE/DRSP reduces the severity of dysmenorrhea with fewer days of dysmenorrhoeic pain and 60&#x02013;65% of the subjects reported that the severity of dysmenorrhoeic pain has lessened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">One study was recently conducted in adolescents between the ages 14&#x02013;19&#x000a0;years to compare the noncontraceptive benefits of EE/CMA and EE/DRSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The study showed that both EE/CMA and EE/DRSP provided beneficial effects on irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhea, hair and skin disorders but that EE/CMA was shown to be more superior to EE/DRSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The results may be arguable as it is an observational questionnaire-based study and there may have been some bias in the data collection as well as in the interpretation of the results.</p><p id="Par21">Hence, we compared the efficacy of EE/CMA and EE/DRSP for the treatment of acne and dysmenorrhea among women aged between 18 and 45&#x000a0;years in a randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim</title><p id="Par22">The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of EE/CMA and EE/DRSP for the treatment of acne and dysmenorrhea as well as the overall clinical effects and safety profiles, including cycle control, blood pressure and body weight.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par23">This study was an investigator-blinded, randomized, parallel group study conducted from August 2013 to October 2017 at the Family Planning Clinic, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. The investigator was unaware of the type of medication being provided to the subjects and assessed facial acne and dysmenorrhea while blinded in this way. The study medications were dispensed by the study nurse. The investigator remained blinded during data analysis. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatment</title><p id="Par24">Subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to each group based on a computer-generated randomization scheme. Subjects randomized to EE/CMA treatment received EE/CMA at the dosage of 30 mcg/2&#x000a0;mg (Belara&#x000ae;; Gedeon Richter Plc.; Budapest, Hungary - Abbott Laboratories Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand) once daily while subjects randomized to EE/DRSP treatment received EE/DRSP at the dosage of 30 mcg/3&#x000a0;mg (Yasmin&#x000ae;; Bayer, Berlin, Germany) once daily. Both groups received the treatment for 21 consecutive days, starting on the first day of the menstruation, followed by 7&#x000a0;days of medication free before starting the next cycle of treatment. The treatment was self-administered for a total of 6 consecutive cycles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par25">Healthy women between the ages of 18 to 45&#x000a0;years with mild to moderate acne vulgaris and who had dysmenorrhea of any degree of severity were eligible to join the study. Mild acne vulgaris was defined as having comedones as the main type of acne lesion with &#x0003c;&#x02009;10 papules and pustules. Moderate acne was defined as having 10&#x02013;40 papules and pustules, 10&#x02013;40 comedones, and/or mild truncal disease. Subjects who agreed to take the medications as their only treatment for 6&#x000a0;months and signed and dated the informed consent were enrolled into the study. Women who were pregnant, lactating and/or had any hypersensitivity to the study medication were excluded from the study. Subjects with any coexisting medical condition or were taking any concomitant medication that is likely to interfere with the safe administration of EE/CMA or EE/DRSP as per the opinion of the investigator were also excluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria included the use of systemic retinoids within 6&#x000a0;months, systemic antimicrobials within 1&#x000a0;month, topical acne treatment within 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to study enrollment and having a contraindication to OCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Clinical assessments</title><p id="Par26">The subjects were evaluated for the efficacy of the OCs for the treatment of acne and dysmenorrhea at baseline visit and follow-up visits after 1, 3, and 6&#x000a0;months of treatment. The following parameters were recorded at each study visit: body weight, body mass index (BMI), vital signs, acne lesion counts, adverse events, and concomitant medications. Each lesion such as comedones, papules, pustules and nodules was counted individually. The total lesion count was the summation of all lesions. Subjects were provided with a menstrual diary card to record information on treatment compliance and vaginal bleeding. Any unused study medications were returned to the study nurse and documented. The degree of dysmenorrhea severity at each visit was rated by the subjects using a 4-scale assessment (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;absent/no pain, 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;mild, 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;moderate, 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;severe). Subjects also rated severity of dysmenorrhea compared to the baseline level or before study entry (scale from 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;very much decrease, 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;decrease, 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;no change, 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;increase, 5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;very much increase). Physical examination and overall assessment questionnaire were performed at the last visit or after 6&#x000a0;months of treatment. The investigator completed a global assessment of the acne treatment using a five-point scale (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;worse; 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;no change; 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;fair; 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;good; and 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;excellent). Subjects were also required to complete a self-assessment questionnaire which had three questions to evaluate the treatment efficacy and acceptability: 1. How would you rate your acne improvement since you started this study?; 2. How would you compare this acne treatment with other acne treatment you have used in the past?; and 3. Would you continue to take this treatment if your physician prescribes it?</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par27">Continuous variables were presented as mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD. Repeated ANOVA was used to assess the change in acne lesion count from baseline to cycle 6 and between each treatment group, using a significance level of 5%. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to assess any significant difference in the numbers of adverse events and breakthrough bleeding and spotting. The SPSS version 22 was used to analyze the data.</p><p id="Par28">All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of the study medication and fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. All endpoint assessments were analyzed by ITT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p id="Par29">The sample size for this study was determined by the responder rate from a previous study for the treatment of acne [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The proportion of subjects responded to the treatment of acne after 6&#x000a0;cycles of treatment was 0.738 and 0.528 in the EE/CMA group and EE/DRSP group, respectively. The sample size was calculated for a study power of 80% and a significance level of &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5% (two-sided). A dropout rate of 10% was estimated.

Our results showed more favorable benefits of using EE/CMA compared to EE/DRSP. Treatment with EE/CMA for 6&#x000a0;cycles showed a reduction in total acne lesions by 72.2% compared to the baseline level while 64.5% reduction was observed with EE/DRSP. This represents a 11.9% better improvement in acne treatment with EE/CMA over EE/DRSP (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.009). This greater reduction in total acne lesion with EE/CMA was mainly from reductions in comedones and papules, as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">c</xref>.

Moreover, it confirmed the result from a previous observational study that EE/CMA was significantly more beneficial compared to EE/DRSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The difference in the benefits on acne treatment between the two groups may be, in part, due to the unique property of each progestogen when combined with EE.</p><p id="Par37">From the investigator&#x02019;s global assessment on efficacy of treatment for acne vulgaris, markedly significant improvement graded as &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d; response was observed in more proportion of subjects treated with EE/CMA (75.3%) than EE/DRSP (49.4%). When considering the subjects&#x02019; self-assessment on efficacy, similar responses with those of the investigator&#x02019;s assessment was seen. Higher proportion of subjects treated with EE/CMA (66.3%) graded their improvement in acne as &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d; than those treated with EE/DRSP (48.3%). The greater &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d; response rating on efficacy of acne treatment in both investigator&#x02019;s and subjects&#x02019; assessment with EE/CMA over EE/DRSP was consistent with the primary outcome showing statistically greater reduction of total acne lesion counts observed and therefore, reflected a clinically significant efficacy of EE/CMA in acne treatment. Moreover, this is consistent with the subjects&#x02019; self-assessment on intention to continue treatment. More subjects treated with EE/CMA would continue treatment compared to those from the EE/DRSP (83.1% vs 49.4%). This finding may influence the women&#x02019;s treatment compliance to the OC in general.</p><p id="Par38">Dysmenorrhea is one of the most commonly reported menstrual disorder and frequent complaint in women. Although symptoms are usually not serious and typically last within a few days, dysmenorrhea can be severe enough to have a significant impact on daily life functioning, causing work or school absenteeism. In this study, all of the subjects enrolled were women who were suffering with mild to moderate dysmenorrhea. Nearly half (47.2%) of the subjects treated with EE/CMA in this study reported an absence of dysmenorrheic pain as early as 1&#x000a0;month post-treatment while only 27.3% of the subjects treated with EE/DRSP reported an absence of the symptom. After 6&#x000a0;cycles of treatment, the symptom was completely absent in 95.5% of the subjects in the EE/CMA whereas 85.4% of the subjects in the EE/DRSP reported lack of dysmenorrhea. The absence of dysmenorrhea in the EE/CMA group in our study was higher compared to a previous report which had only 66% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. EE/CMA is not only effective in reducing dysmenorrhea but is rapid acting. Women with dysmenorrhea on EE/CMA may have fewer absenteeism from work or school. One possible explanation for the significant difference in the effect between EE/CMA and EE/DRSP has been postulated to be due to the progestogen component. CMA is speculated to have a special pharmacological action in relation to endometrial arachidonic acid metabolism. It binds to glucocorticoid receptor which may inhibit phospholipase A2, and this, combined with inhibition of cyclo-oxygenases, results in reduction of prostaglandin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This consequently may lead to a superior benefit of CMA in improvement of dysmenorrhea.</p><p id="Par39">EE/CMA and EE/DRSP were both generally safe and well-tolerated. Most frequent adverse events during the 6&#x000a0;cycles of treatment were breast pain, dizziness, acne, headache, and nausea. The incidence rates of these events were similar between EE/CMA and EE/DRSP. These adverse events are commonly known OC-associated events. Moreover, no significant weight change was detected in both treatment groups. Previous post-marketing surveillance study has shown the benefits of using EE/CMA on bleeding disorders and cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this study, after 6&#x000a0;cycles of treatment, both OCs provided good cycle control but there were fewer breakthrough bleeding among subjects using EE/CMA.</p><p id="Par40">The strengths of this present study are that it was a randomized controlled trial which prevented selection bias and had an adequate sample size to determine the statistical significance of the primary study endpoint. The important limitation of this study is its single-blinded methodology which may be affected by some bias in the subjects&#x02019; self-assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par41">This study demonstrated that EE/CMA is significantly more effective for the treatment of acne and dysmenorrhea in women with mild to moderate acne vulgaris and dysmenorrhea than EE/DRSP.
