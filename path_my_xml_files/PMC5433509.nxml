Therefore, early determination of clinical, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or biological markers that are prognostic for long-term outcomes would be valuable, to enable management strategies tailored to the needs of individual patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Currently, no baseline or short-term clinical or MRI measures have proven to be consistent prognostic factors.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>The Prevention of Relapses with Interferon beta-1a Subcutaneously in Multiple Sclerosis (PRISMS) study demonstrated the efficacy of interferon (IFN) &#x003b2;-1a, 44 and 22&#x02009;&#x000b5;g administered subcutaneously (sc) three times weekly (tiw), compared with placebo, in reducing relapses, MRI lesion activity and accumulation, and in preventing disability in patients with relapsing&#x02013;remitting MS (RRMS).<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> This population was followed for up to eight years from randomisation,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> with a 77% patient retention rate for sites that participated in the long-term follow-up (LTFU) visit, thus providing a useful cohort within which early clinical and MRI variables could be analysed as predictors for long-term disease status.</p><p>Long-term outcomes were determined seven to eight years after the start of the original randomised clinical trial.

A non-contrast proton-density/T2-weighted brain MRI scan was performed every six or 12 months during the original PRISMS study and extension study, respectively, and again at the LTFU visit using the same imaging protocol. New T2 activity was defined as new or enlarging T2 lesions compared with a previous MRI scan. T2 burden of disease (BOD) was defined as the summed cross-sectional area (in mm<sup>2</sup>) of lesions on T2 scans.

Long-term clinical outcome variables also included a combined negative disability outcome, which was defined as an EDSS score &#x02265;6 and/or SPMS.

Identifying factors that are prognostic for long-term disability outcomes could therefore be useful in identifying patients at high risk of disability progression, and help determine appropriate long-term treatment. Due to the heterogeneity of MS, large and robust long-term data sets are required to identify factors that may be prognostic. The PRISMS LTFU population provides one of the most complete data sets of its type, with data available up to eight years after study initiation. Participating centres had a high average retention rate (77%) and 72% of patients returning for the LTFU visit were still receiving sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a. In addition, assessment and MRI protocols for the LTFU visit were consistent with those used throughout the study.</p><p>Patients enrolled in the PRISMS study represented a relatively homogeneous population (83% had an EDSS score &#x02264;3.5) and whilst this may have limited generalisability to other clinical settings it may have helped to minimise confounding of the analysis of prognostic variables. After eight years, the levels of disability and disability progression were much more heterogeneous, making this a valuable cohort in which to explore early predictors of relatively long-term clinical outcomes. There is a possibility of selection bias among the patients who returned for the LTFU visit, as patients with better disease outcomes at seven to eight years may have been more willing or able to participate.</p><p>The analysis was performed in all patients who had returned for the LTFU visit and also in patients from the early-start sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a cohort only. Separate analysis of the early-start cohort patients allowed evaluation of whether earlier initiation of treatment impacts the predictive value of early variables, especially those referring to changes in MRI and relapse rate during the first two years.</p><p>IFN &#x003b2;-1a start status (early or delayed) was not a significant univariate predictor for any clinical outcomes measured during the eight-year follow-up. However, in such an intention-to-treat analysis, not all early-start patients had a longer duration of active treatment over the follow-up period. MPR, a measure of time on therapy during the eight-year follow-up, was identified as a predictor of clinical outcome in the final multivariate regression models, favouring patients with the highest MPR. Notably, the coefficients calculated for MPR were very small. This is consistent with the high adherence rates observed (mean MPR overall, 78%; for early-starters, 87%). Previous data suggest a potential worsening of relapse rates at lower adherence rates, with relapse rates tending to remain low in patients with higher adherence (objective adherence up to 75% or MPR up to 70%).<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> A recent 15-year follow-up of patients with RRMS indicating that higher levels of cumulative dose exposure and longer time on sc IFN &#x003b2;-1a treatment were associated with better clinical outcomes, further highlights the potential benefits of a longer duration of MS therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Multivariate analysis identified the following variables to be predictors of long-term disability: age, EDSS score and brain volume at baseline, early change in EDSS and MPR.

Baseline brain volume, baseline EDSS and early change in EDSS were the most frequently identified predictors of the various long-term disability outcomes. Assessing a patient's baseline brain volume and early disability status may therefore be important in therapeutic decision making.</p><p>The prognostic value of EDSS observed in the current study is supported by a number of other studies that previously identified baseline EDSS or early change in EDSS as predictive of long-term disability or cognitive outcomes in MS patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr12-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> MRI at baseline, in terms of brain volume and lesion burden, have also been found to correlate with disability outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Other prognostic factors previously identified include age older than 25 years at onset, clinical course during the first two years of disease, and involvement of the pyramidal system at onset.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In a long-term trial of patients on IFN&#x003b2;-1b, measurements at baseline were observed to have a greater prognostic value than on-study measurements, which were found to contribute little to the variance in long-term outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>In the current study, all identified predictors taken together accounted for only approximately one-third of the variability in long-term disability outcome, suggesting that other unidentified factors must play important roles. Similarly, models developed previously accounted for approximately half of the variance in long-term outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In addition, it is possible that the predictive value of the EDSS-related explanatory variables could have been affected by the known low sensitivity and low inter-rater reliability of the EDSS.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Although it is widely considered that poor adherence to treatment can adversely affect disease outcomes in patients with MS,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr18-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> to date few studies have examined this association. Post hoc analyses (separate to the current analysis) of clinical and MRI outcomes in the PRISMS LTFU cohort according to exposure to IFN &#x003b2;-1a treatment (cumulative dose of IFN &#x003b2;-1a, cumulative time on treatment, and continuous vs non-continuous treatment) have also suggested that better adherence leads to better outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2055217316666406" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>In summary, in clinical practice we are still in need of more accurate factors that can predict a successful or poor outcome at up to eight years after starting therapy. In this post hoc analysis of the PRISMS LTFU cohort, higher baseline brain volume predicted better long-term clinical outcomes, while larger increases in EDSS score during the first 24 months predicted worse outcomes. A measure of time on therapy, MPR, was also identified as a predictor for many long-term clinical outcomes, with a longer duration of IFN &#x003b2;-1a treatment associated with better outcomes. Relapse rate and changes in MRI disease measures in the first two years of treatment were also predictors of long-term outcomes, but not as consistently so as change in EDSS score over a similar interval.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Yinshan Zhao, PhD, of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, for analysis of data, as well as Steve Smith and Joanne Tang of Caudex Medical (supported by Merck Serono S.A. &#x02013; Geneva, Switzerland, an affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) for writing assistance.
