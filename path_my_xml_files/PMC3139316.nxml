Opioids in conjunction with local anesthetics improve the quality of intraoperative analgesia and prolong the duration of postoperative analgesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>Local anesthetics such as bupivacaine act mainly by blockade of voltage-gated Na+ channels in the axonal membrane and presynaptic inhibition of calcium channels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The &#x003bc;-agonists sufentanil and butorphanol exert their action by opening the K+ channels and reducing the Ca++ influx, resulting in inhibition of transmitter release.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] A combination of these effects may explain the observed synergism between bupivacaine and sufentanil/butorphanol. The synergism is characterized by enhanced somatic analgesia without an effect on the degree or level of local anesthetic-induced sympathetic or motor blockade.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>The principal findings of this study are that the addition of 10 &#x003bc;g sufentanil or 25 &#x003bc;g butorphanol to spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine intensifies the sensory blockade and increases the duration of sensory blockade without increasing the intensity of motor blockade and requirement of rescue analgesia. These findings are in consistence with the findings of Vinita <italic>et al</italic>. and Dahlgren <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>The onset of sensory block was significantly more rapid in group A (9.17 &#x000b1; 1.64 min) as compared with groups B and group C, which had an onset of 9.90 &#x000b1; 1.88 min and 10.43 &#x000b1; 1.63 min, respectively. This is in accordance with previous studies by Dahlgren <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] who noticed that the group receiving sufentanil 5 &#x003bc;g had a much delayed onset of spinal anesthesia in parturients. The maximum upper level of sensory block achieved was higher in the group of patients administered bupivacaine alone (T6) as compared with the sufentanil&#x02013;bupivacaine (T9) and butorphanol&#x02013;bupivacaine groups (T9).</p><p>Both these adjuvant opioids did not cause any significant increase in motor blockade and their combination with bupivacaine may thus be used for ambulatory analgesia. This was consistent with previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Butorphanol combination causes less-intense motor blockade than sufentanil combination with bupivacaine.</p><p>VAS was significantly of a higher value in group A than in groups B and C. The trend of increase in the median value of VAS was significantly earlier in group A as compared with groups B and C. There was a significant prolonged duration of analgesia in all the patients enrolled in the sufentanil group and the butorphanol group over the bupivacaine-alone group. Our results were similar to Dahlgren <italic>et al</italic>. And Courtney <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] who demonstrated that the addition of sufentanil 5.0 &#x003bc;g and 7.5 &#x003bc;g to hyperbaric bupivacaine significantly prolonged the duration of analgesia compared to bupivacaine alone.</p><p>Regarding side-effects, the incidence of hypotension was observed in group A and not in groups B or C. Endoscopic urological surgeries are carried out in elderly patients wherein hypotension is more hazardous because they may have decreased physiological reserve and compromised blood supply to various vital organs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Also, to avoid procedure-related complications like TURP syndrome, restricted fluid has to be administered, which is unavoidable with ongoing hypotension, which were more prevalent in group A. Opioids delivered by the spinal route decrease the dose of bupivacaine but may produce nausea, vomiting, urinary retention and respiratory depression and pruritus as the side-effects. In this study, the primary side-effects were pruritus with sufentanil combination and bradycardia with butorphanol combination. In other studies, the incidence of pruritus varied from 70.3 to 80% analgesia with 10 &#x003bc;g intrathecal sufentanil combination with bupivacaine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Vinita <italic>et al</italic>. found a 20% incidence of sedation in the butorphanol group, but all the patients were arousable and it was not associated with respiratory depression, which was not present in our study group.</p><p>The practice of low-dose local anesthetic with adjuvant is gaining momentum in ambulatory settings because it is a safe, rapid, inexpensive technique with lower postoperative morbidity. Small-dose bupivacaine provides successful anesthesia and gives better cardiac output stability than a large dose.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Sufentanil or butorphanol use in various endoscopic urological procedures should be promoted in view of reduced incidence of hemodynamic adverse effects in the geriatric population. The sample size in our study was small but had significantly important results, and we suggest future studies to be undertaken with a larger population size.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>To conclude, our study favors the use of sufentanil (10 &#x003bc;g) or butorphanol (25 &#x003bc;g) combination with low-dose hyperbaric bupivacaine (7.5 mg) in elderly patients undergoing endoscopic urological procedures, e.g. TURP in spinal anesthesia, because:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>This combination prolongs the duration of sensory block.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Provides appropriate sensory level for patients undergoing endoscopic urological surgeries. Sensory levels above T9 are undesirable as pain due to perforation of the prostatic capsule (like in TURP, TURBT) will not be apparent to the patient if this complication occurs, so higher levels as in group A are undesirable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intensity and the duration of motor block achieved with this combination favored early ambulation.

</p><p>Hence, this combination of sufentanil and butorphanol with low-dose bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia is equally acceptable clinically in terms of characteristics of sensory block, motor block, duration of analgesia and greater hemodynamic stability as compared with bupivacaine alone. Complications were reduced by the addition of butorphanol, which also has a lower tendency than sufentanil to produce pruritus. Thus, this combination of butorphanol with low-dose bupivacaine is especially beneficial in the geriatric group of patients, who have multiple co-morbid conditions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
