The primary outcome was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of tocilizumab-SC to tocilizumab-IV with regard to the proportion of patients in each group achieving an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 24 using a 12% non-inferiority margin (NIM).

ACR50/70 responses, DAS28 and physical function improvements were comparable between the tocilizumab-SC and tocilizumab-IV groups. The safety profiles of tocilizumab-SC and tocilizumab-IV were similar, and the most common adverse event was infection. Injection-site reactions (ISR) occurred more frequently in the tocilizumab-SC group than in the tocilizumab-IV (placebo-SC) group.

The safety profile of tocilizumab-SC is consistent with the known and well-established safety profile of tocilizumab-IV, with the exception of a higher incidence of ISR, which were more common with tocilizumab-SC administration.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Rheumatoid Arthritis</kwd><kwd>DMARDs (biologic)</kwd><kwd>Disease Activity</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, systemic autoimmune disease associated with joint inflammation. Advances in RA treatments have been made through the introduction of biological therapies, including anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, interleukin (IL)-1 receptor and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonists, an anti-CD20 agent and a T-cell co-stimulation modulator.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Although these treatment options reduce disease activity, none are effective in all patients. While a patient's disease status and overall health should be central when choosing a therapy, differences in the route of administration and safety profiles of the agent can also affect the probability of a favourable response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></p><p>Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanised anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-6 from binding to the soluble and membrane-bound IL-6R and was initially developed as an intravenous (IV) infusion. The efficacy and safety of tocilizumab-IV were previously demonstrated as monotherapy and in combination with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) in adult patients with RA in five phase 3 clinical trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Tocilizumab is currently approved as an IV formulation for the treatment of RA, including in the USA and Europe.</p><p>A subcutaneous (SC) formulation of tocilizumab would offer patients an additional option that may allow self-administration. The tocilizumab-SC dose was selected based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and limited efficacy and safety data from phase 1/2 studies (see supplementary figure S1, available online only).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> To characterise further the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab-SC, the SUMMACTA study compared tocilizumab-SC 162&#x02005;mg weekly versus tocilizumab-IV 8&#x02005;mg/kg every 4&#x02005;weeks in adult patients with RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients (&#x02265;18&#x02005;years of age) with RA (&#x02265;6&#x02005;months, revised 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria) who met the following major criteria were included: swollen joint count of 4 or greater (66-joint count) and tender joint count of 4 or greater (68-joint count) at screening and baseline, C-reactive protein (CRP) 10&#x02005;mg/L or greater and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 28&#x02005;mm/h or greater at screening. Patients must have received one or more traditional DMARD at a stable dose for 8&#x02005;weeks or longer before baseline. Patients were required to have had an inadequate response to DMARD (up to 20% of patients may have failed one or more anti-TNF). Before random assignment, patients discontinued all biological DMARD, including etanercept for 2&#x02005;weeks or longer and infliximab, certolizumab, golimumab or adalimumab for 8&#x02005;weeks or longer. Concomitant oral glucocorticoids (&#x02264;10&#x02005;mg/day prednisone or equivalent) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (up to the maximum recommended dose) were permitted if patients were on a stable dose for 4&#x02005;weeks or longer before baseline.</p><p>Major exclusion criteria included ongoing rheumatic or inflammatory joint diseases other than RA, any active infections, history of malignancy, positive hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody, serious allergies to biological agents, previous treatment with tocilizumab, alkylating agents or cell-depleting therapies or treatment with any investigational agent at less than 4&#x02005;weeks of screening, and intra-articular or parenteral glucocorticoids or immunisation with a live/attenuated vaccine less than 4&#x02005;weeks before baseline. Tuberculosis screening was managed according to local practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>SUMMACTA was a 2-year, randomised, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3 multicentre trial with a double-blind period of 24&#x02005;weeks followed by an open-label period of 72&#x02005;weeks (results presented separately). Patients were stratified by geographical region and body weight category (&#x0003c;60, &#x02265;60 to &#x0003c;100 or &#x02265;100&#x02005;kg). During the double-blind period, patients were randomly assigned 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 to receive 162&#x02005;mg of tocilizumab-SC 162&#x02005;mg per week+placebo-IV every 4&#x02005;weeks or tocilizumab-IV 8&#x02005;mg/kg every 4&#x02005;weeks+placebo-SC weekly for 24&#x02005;weeks (see supplement, available online only). Tocilizumab-SC/placebo injections were administered by prefilled syringe. After the first four treatments, subcutaneous injections could be administered at home by patients or caregivers; home injection information was recorded on diary cards. Dose modification to subcutaneously every 2&#x02005;weeks or intravenously 4&#x02005;mg/kg every 4&#x02005;weeks or dose interruption was permitted for safety concerns.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcomes and assessments</title><p>The primary outcome was to evaluate the non-inferiority of tocilizumab-SC 162&#x02005;mg weekly to tocilizumab-IV 8&#x02005;mg/kg regarding the proportion of patients in each group who achieved an ACR20 response at week 24. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR50/70 response, remission based on the disease activity score using 28 joints (DAS28 &#x0003c;2.6) and a decrease from baseline of 0.3 or greater in the health assessment questionnaire&#x02013;disability index (HAQ-DI) at week 24. Subgroup analyses for ACR responses and DAS28 remission were conducted across the three weight categories. Due to the non-inferiority design, the per-protocol (PP) population was used for the primary, secondary and subgroup analyses. The PP population was a subset of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and excluded patients with major protocol violations that could potentially affect efficacy outcomes. All patients signed informed consent documents, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Safety</title><p>The safety population included patients who received one or more dose of tocilizumab and had one or more post-dose safety assessment. Safety assessments included adverse events (AE), laboratory assessments, physical examination and vital signs. Laboratory monitoring was conducted at weeks 2 and 4 and every 4&#x02005;weeks thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics</title><p>Patients who provided one or more evaluable pharmacokinetic sample were included in the pharmacokinetic population. In the main study, the observed pre-dose tocilizumab concentration (C<sub>trough</sub>) over 24&#x02005;weeks was assessed; in the pharmacokinetic substudy at week 20, the mean area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and C<sub>trough</sub>. pharmacodynamic parameters included CRP and ESR, were assessed as analysed in the safety population.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Immunogenicity</title><p>Blood samples were taken at baseline and throughout the study for anti-drug antibody assessment. Positive samples from the initial screening assay were analysed by a confirmation assay for specificity. The assays were performed as previously described using a bridging ELISA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> If the confirmation assay was positive, an inhibition ELISA was performed to evaluate the neutralising potential of the anti-tocilizumab antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The time point for the primary analysis of the ACR20 response was week 24. To claim non-inferiority, the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference in ACR responses (tocilizumab-SC 162&#x02005;mg weekly minus tocilizumab-IV 8&#x02005;mg/kg) had to be greater than &#x02212;12%.

Tocilizumab-SC demonstrated efficacy and clinical safety profiles comparable with those of tocilizumab-IV, with the exception of a higher incidence of ISR more commonly seen with tocilizumab-SC. The tocilizumab-SC formulation could provide an additional, more convenient administration option and opportunity for home injection for patients with RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-203523-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e972" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank all investigators and patients who participated in the study and all members of the WA22762 study team.
