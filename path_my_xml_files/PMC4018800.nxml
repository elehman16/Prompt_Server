Quality of the initial semen sample and post-processed sperm is a significant predictor of prospective pregnancies following this procedure.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The quality should not refer only to the semen parameters, but sterility of the sample too. Studies on the capacity to eliminate bacteria with routinely used sperm preparation methods (swim-up or density gradient) have produced variable results. Non-specific bacteria were isolated from 23% to 36% of samples processed with swim-up and density gradients methods in our previous study.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Nicholson <italic>et al.</italic> have reported almost bacteria abolished samples using density gradients method with strict aseptic conditions.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Samples with significantly lower bacterial counts were obtained with modified density gradients centrifugation using an inner tube insertion compared with the conventional method by Fourie <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] A similar method employed an inner column of Percoll has been reported by Kaneko <italic>et al.</italic> in 1986 with a greater success.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Sperm preparation methods are not guaranteed options for complete elimination of bacteria.</p><p>Effects of addition of antibiotics into sperm culture media is an unanswered question. Adverse effects of antibiotics on biological functions of gametes and embryo are major concerns. It has been reported that antibiotic supplementation of culture media has an adverse effect on the growth rate of pre-implantation embryos.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Hence, ready to use culture media are available with antibiotics or without antibiotics.</p><p>Our aims of this study were to assess the efficacy of penicillin and streptomycin supplemented culture media in clearing the non-specific bacteria from baceriospermic samples, and to determine the effect of antibiotics on sperm motility, long term survivability and pregnancy rates in a subfertile population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study subjects</title><p>A prospectively controlled study was carried out at the Infertility Unit, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama, Sri Lanka. Ethical clearance for the work was obtained from the ethics committee in the institute. Couples referred for IUI and voluntarily consented to participate to the study were recruited. They had already been clinically assessed and prepared for treatment at the time of recruitment. They were allocated consecutively into two groups; AB+ and AB&#x02212;. Sperm in group AB+ were processed with antibiotic added culture medium (<italic>n</italic> = 33). The same medium without antibiotics was used to prepare the sperm in group AB&#x02212; (<italic>n</italic> = 33). Semen samples were processed using the swim-up method. Samples prepared by the density gradients method for specific indications were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sample collection and preparation</title><p>Semen samples were collected in to sterile, polystyrene, wide mouthed containers with strict aseptic conditions. Men were instructed to pass urine &#x000bd; h before the sample collection. Samples were assessed for initial semen parameters according to the World Health Organization guidelines 2010.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] An aliquot of 0.1 ml was set aside initially for the microbial culture.</p><p>Samples were processed by swim-up method using Ferticult Flushing medium (FertiPro NV, Belgium). Culture medium used for the group AB+ was supplemented with 1% v/v penicillin streptomycin solution (10,000 U/ml penicillin and 10 mg/l streptomycin, Sigma Aldrich). After the final wash procedure sperm pellets in both groups were diluted with antibiotic free culture medium, and final volume was adjusted to 0.8 ml. From the processed sample, 0.1 ml was allotted to bacterial culture, and 0.2 ml was incubated (37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> ) for further 24 h to assess the sperm survivability. Female partners were inseminated with 0.5 ml of processed sperm samples using soft catheters within 1 h of sample preparation. Outcome of the treatment process was obtained over the phone after 4 weeks of insemination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Bacterial culture</title><p>Aliquot of raw semen sample and processed sample was sent immediately to the microbiology laboratory. They were cultured in culture plates containing Blood agar, Nutrient agar and MacConkey agar using calibrated loop method. Plates were incubated aerobically at 37&#x000b0;C and read in 24 h.</p><p>Statistical analysis was done with SPSS 16.0 version (SPSS Inc.) of computer software.

Around 45-100% of samples from infertile males are positive for non-specific bacterial isolates.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In the present study, non-specific gram positive bacteria were isolated from 63% of samples. Majority of them are commensals of skin and mucous membranes, and few of them are rarely pathogenic. The cause-effect relationship between bacteriospermia and male infertility is still being debated. Some of the studies have reported lack of associations between bacteria and ejaculate quality[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and fertilization rate.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Others argue that the simple presence of bacteria in semen samples may compromise the sperm quality even without leukospermia and clinical signs of infection.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The presence of bacteria in semen may be an early warning signal for altered reproductive potential of men.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The harmful effects of bacteria on spermatozoa may depend on the type and species of microorganisms invading, colonizing, or infecting the male genital tract.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Antibiotic treatment of leukocytospermic men without diagnosed genital tract infections reported a significant improvement of ejaculate quality.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Contamination of the post-processed samples with bacteria is another aspect of clinical importance. Originating of bacteria could be from raw semen sample or occur accidentally during the collection process or from instruments in the laboratory. Significance of elimination of these bacteria has been questioned by some authors as lack of effects on fertilization or embryo quality in <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, supportive evidence to the contrary is also available; e.g., Inoculation of E. coli caused adhesion to the sperm membrane and subsequent destruction leading to reducing motility and viability in washed samples.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Study with porcine semen has shown that E. coli caused a reduction of motility, sperm agglutination and spermicidal effects.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In IVF procedures, if embryo culture dishes were contaminated with bacteria the quality of the developing embryos was poor.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Since incubation temperature is a determining factor, incubation at 37&#x000b0;C could have a greater influence on bacterial growth and activity.</p><p>Semen extenders with single or combination of antibiotics such as, kanamycin, ampicillin, gentamicin, linomycin, penicillin streptomycin, terramycin, tylosin, linco spectin have been tried with different success rates in eliminating microbes in animal studies.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Penicillin streptomycin combination or gentamicin is abundantly used antibiotics in human semen culture media. We supplemented the recommended dose of solution for cell culture media (1% v/v containing 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mcg/ml streptomycin) specified by the manufacturer. According to some authors the recommended dose for human semen is 100 IU penicillin and 50 mcg streptomycin.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The long term use of the same antibiotic may lead to emergence antibiotic resistant varieties. The resistance of E. coli to both penicillin and streptomycin used in culture media has been reported.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Cottell <italic>et al.</italic> could only eliminate 95% of bacteria from semen samples using penicillin streptomycin rich media with the swim-up procedure.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, we were able to totally clear the non-specific bacteria from semen without affecting sperm motility, which is a prominent parameter predicting the sperm fertilization capacity.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Some laboratories are reluctant to use penicillin mainly because of its very short half-life.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Furthermore, penicillin allergy has been reported in few cases after IUI.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Hence, sensitivity checking before insemination or complete elimination of antibiotics at the final wash procedure should be employed as a remedy. Allergic reactions were not reported in our study as precautions were taken to remove antibiotics at the final wash.</p><p>There were no clinical signs of infections reported from women inseminated with samples processed with antibiotic free culture medium in this study. Lack of clinical symptoms among women received treatment with microbial positive post-wash samples reported by Karlstr&#x000f6;m <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] We cannot exclude the possibility of infection with contaminated samples. If occurred, the women's fertility would be further compromised.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] An additional advantage observed with antibiotics was the ability to maintain the motility long time <italic>in vitro</italic>. This prolonged survivability can be mainly related to the absence of bacteria and their adverse effects. Similar behavior may me expected within the uterus as well. Because of the pregnancy rates in both groups are comparable between both groups, relating these beneficial effects on fertilization are difficult at this level. Though the two groups used were comparatively similar, smaller population size is hypothesized to produce inconsistent results. Number of studies has been done with animal semen regarding the effectiveness of antibiotics in clearing bacteria and toxicity effects. The extrapolation of those results to human semen is not valid. Additional research including a large cohort of patients would answer this question.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Despite special aseptic precautions carried out before ejaculation, bacteriospermia was found in 63% of samples. Penicillin streptomycin combination could completely eliminate bacteria from post-wash samples in this population. Addition of antibiotics seems to have no adverse effects on sperm motility, harvesting power or long term survival IVF. Laboratories should maintain high standards of hygienic conditions when collecting and preparing the samples. In addition, use of effective antibiotic or cocktails of antibiotics in sperm preparation for IUI may reduce the risk of infection and sequelae in women. Individual laboratories should determine the most suitable antibiotic/s and dosage depending on their experience on the type of bacteria grown and antibiotics sensitivity pattern.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>Financial support by National Research Council of Sri Lanka under the grant No. 09/69 is acknowledged.</p></ack><fn-group><fn
