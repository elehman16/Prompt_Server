Individuals with type 1 diabetes received either glargine and glulisine injected 5 minutes subcutaneously before each meal or premixed insulin lispro injected 5 minutes before breakfast and dinner in a randomized fashion separated by eight weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The incremental systemic insulin AUC, maximal insulin concentration, and rate of rise of systemic insulin (0&#x02013;30 minutes) during all three meal intervals were similar between glargine/glulisine and healthy controls. Incremental glucose AUC with glargine/glulisine was similar to controls at lunch and dinner. With premix 75/25 insulin, insulin AUC was lower and incremental glucose AUC was greater at lunch compared to the healthy and glargine/glulisine. Hypoglycemic events before lunch were greater with premix insulin group than with glargine/glulisine (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Glargine/glulisine pharmacokinetics in type 1 diabetes can closely approximate physiologic insulin responses in healthy individuals during a day in which three standardized meals are consumed. Additionally, when glulisine is dosed only five minutes pre-meal, systemic insulin concentration rises as rapidly as prandial endogenous insulin levels. This present study compared glargine and glulisine administered in an approximate 50/50 proportion. Future studies of alternate meal times, meal content and differing premixed insulin preparations are indicated.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Insulin glargine</kwd><kwd>Insulin glulisine</kwd><kwd>Neutral protamine lispro</kwd><kwd>Insulin lispro</kwd><kwd>Standardized meals</kwd><kwd>Type 1 diabetes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0010"><title>Introduction</title><p>In healthy individuals, low levels of circulating insulin are maintained during interprandial periods, while during a meal, insulin levels rise rapidly and then taper to fasting concentrations as glucose levels return to baseline <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In order to improve glycemic control and reduce microvascular complications in patients with diabetes, substantial effort has been directed toward the development of insulin analog formulations, delivery methods and dosing schedules that more closely match physiologic insulin profiles <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>One common insulin replacement regimen involves multiple daily injections (basal-bolus therapy), consisting of a longer-acting insulin (insulin glargine, degludec, detemir, or NPH insulin injected once or twice daily) and rapid-acting insulin (glulisine, aspart or lispro) injected prior to a meal to provide prandial insulin coverage. Another option for insulin replacement is premixed analog insulin, typically injected twice daily, which contains either neutral protamine lispro and insulin lispro (as a 75:25 ratio) or protamine crystalline aspart and insulin aspart (as a 70:30 ratio). The protamine portion of premix insulin is similar to NPH insulin and functions as intermediate-acting insulin to cover basal insulin requirements. The rapid-acting component is aimed to cover breakfast and dinner prandial insulin requirements <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>While pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharamacodynamic (PD) studies of long-acting and rapid-acting insulin analogs have been published <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, previous studies often involved injection of these insulins under fasting conditions or involved injection prior to only one standardized meal challenge. Comparison groups usually consisted of patients receiving regular human insulin and/or NPH insulin as part of their basal-bolus therapy. To further examine the PK and PD of insulin analogs used in contemporary basal-bolus regimens in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus, the aim of this study was to determine an entire day-long profile of insulin and glucose levels over the course of three standardized meal challenges. Insulin glargine (glargine) was injected prior to breakfast, and insulin glulisine (glulisine) was used as the pre-meal bolus insulin. A comparison group of non-diabetic healthy individuals served as a control group to demonstrate normal physiologic insulin and glucose responses during the three meals. A second comparison group consisted of patients with type 1 diabetes who consumed all three standardized meals and received pre-mixed injections of neutral protamine lispro and insulin lispro prior to breakfast and dinner.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Subjects</title><p>All healthy subjects had normal liver, kidney, electrolyte and blood count values and had a normal response to an oral glucose tolerance test. Individuals with type 1 diabetes also had normal liver, kidney, electrolyte and blood count values. Apart from one subject with mild background retinopathy, all type 1 diabetes patients were free from tissue complications of diabetes.

Upon admission of patients with type 1 diabetes, a retrograde intravenous cannula (I.V.) was inserted under local anesthesia into the back of a hand for blood sample collection, and a second I.V. was inserted in an antegrade fashion in the forearm for infusions. Upon I.V. insertion, patients with type 1 diabetes suspended their usual insulin regimen (long-acting insulin was taken no later than the morning prior to admission), and intravenous regular human insulin was infused to maintain euglycemia (target blood glucose ~5&#x02013;6.7&#x02009;mmol/L).

In the glargine/glulisine group, glargine was dosed at 0.35 units/kg administered subcutaneously at 07:00 (1 hour prior to breakfast). Glulisine was dosed at 1 unit/10&#x02009;g carbohydrate per meal, administered subcutaneously 5 minutes prior to each meal (07:55, 12:55 and 17:55). In the lispro premix group, total lispro premix dose was determined by referencing the total daily dose as calculated for the glargine/glulisine treatment period, with two-thirds administered at 07:55 (5 minutes prior to breakfast) and one-third administered at 17:55 (5 minutes prior to dinner).

All insulin concentration values reported were derived from the human insulin standard curves, irrespective of whether the sample contained human insulin, insulin lispro, insulin glargine, insulin glulisine or some mixture of the aforementioned insulins. The calibration range was 2.15&#x02013;276&#x02009;&#x000b5;U/mL for insulin assays.

Meal-specific analysis was conducted using mean pre-meal baseline-normalized serum insulin and serum glucose data from mealtime intervals. Each meal interval was defined as all samples obtained between the pre-meal baselines through 5 hours postprandial. Therefore, the breakfast, lunch and dinner intervals consisted of samples drawn from 8:00 to 13:00, 13:00 to 18:00, and 18:00 to 23:00, respectively.

There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia in any group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current study examined the effects of three standardized meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) on glucose and systemic insulin levels over a 24 hour period in individuals with type 1 diabetes administered glargine/glulisine basal-bolus therapy or 75/25 lispro premixed insulin twice daily and age and weight matched healthy controls. This study demonstrates that, acutely, glargine/glulisine more closely mimics physiologic insulin responses to meals and that pre-lunch hypoglycemic episodes were less frequent compared to premixed insulin.</p><p>Reviewing the available literature, we identified four other published studies which described the use of three sequential meals over the course of a day while measuring insulin and glucose levels <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In one, responses to standardized test meals were studied in healthy and obese participants <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The other three compared responses in type 1 diabetes subjects following a treatment period with NPH insulin and mealtime insulin lispro, insulin aspart or regular human insulin <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. One of the type 1 diabetes studies also included a non-diabetic comparator group <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The novelty of this study lies in the comparison of a widely used combination of a contemporary basal insulin (insulin glargine) and the rapid acting analog insulin glulisine versus a premixed insulin formulation.</p><p>A number of similarities were observed between the glargine/glulisine and healthy control groups. The incremental AUC<sub>[i]</sub> responses were similar to healthy individuals during all three meal intervals. Moreover, in the glargine/glulisine and healthy controls the peak systemic insulin level (&#x00394;Cmax<sub>[i]</sub>) increased similarly between both groups at each meal. This indicates that the increased endogenous insulin response to the larger carbohydrate load in healthy subjects could be adequately-matched by the larger glulisine dose received by subjects with type 1 diabetes with each successively larger meal. Systemic insulin levels were measured and do not distinguish between insulin components and may not be reflective of the portal concentration of insulin in the healthy controls. In healthy individuals, insulin is secreted into the portal vein and is predominantly cleared by the liver and less so by the kidney. This creates a portal-peripheral gradient whereby portal vein insulin levels in healthy individuals are 3&#x02013;4 fold higher than in the systemic circulation. However, in individuals with type 1 diabetes, the portal vein insulin concentration will be dependent on the release of insulin from the subcutaneous depot. Thus, in type 1 diabetes mellitus the portal-peripheral insulin gradient can be reversed from the physiologic norm with higher peripheral as compared to hepatic vein insulin levels. This of course will depend upon the rate and pattern of insulin release from the subcutaneous depot.</p><p>When glulisine was administered subcutaneously only 5 minutes before each meal, the rate of rise of insulin during the first 30 minutes of each meal appears similar to healthy controls. The rate of rise of insulin data is most germane to the glargine/glulisine group as glargine would not be expected to contribute in a significant manner to the rate of rise. The rate of rise data in the premix groups will be reflective of both the intermediate and rapid acting components. Studies have examined the effects of administering insulin glulisine either 0&#x02013;15 minutes prior to a meal or 15 minutes following a meal <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Pre-meal dosing of glulisine appears to be most advantageous, with regard to reductions in post-meal glucose excursion and 12-week HbA1c levels. Dosing guidelines currently advise that insulin glulisine should be administered 15 minutes prior to or within 20 minutes of beginning a meal <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Surveys indicate that patients tend to inject insulin within 15 minutes prior to a meal and prefer shorter intervals between injection and mealtime as a matter of ease and convenience and as an effort to avoid hypoglycemia and improve glycemic control <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Nearly half of type 1 diabetes patients studied in a recent report did not employ a delay between injection and mealtime <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The findings from the current study suggest that injecting glulisine only 5 minutes prior to a meal is sufficient to produce increases in prandial insulin levels in people with type 1 diabetes that are indistinguishable from age and weight-matched healthy controls.</p><p>Previous work has provided conflicting results regarding whether lispro, aspart, and glulisine have comparable PK and PD <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In some PK/PD studies, absorption of insulin glulisine appeared to be faster than absorption of lispro or aspart. Morrow et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> found that time to 50% of maximal concentration within the first hour was 21 minutes for glulisine versus 31 and 32 minutes for lispro and aspart, respectively. Arnolds et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> found that the time to 10 and 20% of maximum insulin concentration was shorter for glulisine versus aspart, and correspondingly, the AUC for glucose infusion rate (to maintain euglycemia) was 30&#x02009;mg/kg in the glulisine group versus 16&#x02009;mg/kg in the aspart group. Similarly, Heise et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> found that the time to 10% of total AUC insulin was shorter with a 0.2&#x02009;U/kg dose glulisine compared to an equivalent dose of lispro. Additionally, the AUC for the glucose infusion rate in the first hour (102.3&#x02009;mg/kg versus 83.1&#x02009;mg/kg) was greater following glulisine as compared to lispro. The apparent increased rate of absorption of glulisine may be attributable to the fact that glulisine is prepared as a zinc-free injection, whereas the presence of zinc in the aspart and lispro injections may promote hexamer formation at the injection site <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Lispro premix insulin was dosed as two-thirds of the total daily dose injected prior to breakfast in an effort to cover both the breakfast and lunch meals and the final one-third prior to dinner. Thus, while glucose exposure, as measured by incremental AUC<sub>[g]</sub>, was similar in the glargine/glulisine and lispro premix groups during the breakfast period, the lispro premix insulin dose resulted in a significantly larger incremental AUC<sub>[i]</sub> compared to both the healthy group and the glargine/glulisine group. Additionally, in the lispro premix group, blood glucose levels fell below baseline prior to lunch, and all ten of the hypoglycemic events in the lispro premix group occurred in the late breakfast period. Despite the exaggerated breakfast time AUC<sub>[</sub>i<sub>]</sub> in the lispro premix group, insulin concentrations in this group were not sufficient at lunch. The AUC<sub>[i]</sub> following lispro premix was approximately one-quarter of the AUC<sub>[i]</sub> observed in healthy controls and nearly one-fifth of the AUC<sub>[i]</sub> in the glargine/glulisine group. Correspondingly, the lunch interval AUC<sub>[g]</sub> was substantially greater than observed in the healthy and glargine/glulisine groups. Blood glucose also did not return to pre-breakfast levels in the lispro premix after lunch or dinner. Therefore, the lispro premix increased the risk of hypoglycemia between breakfast and lunch and failed to provide lunch time meal coverage, exposing patients to a large, long-duration postprandial glucose excursion.</p><p>For patients with type 1 diabetes, premix insulin is not included as an option within recommendations cited by guidelines provided by the American Diabetes Association or the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, as intensive insulin therapies (basal-bolus therapy with three or more injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy) provide superior glycemic control <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Despite the lack of recommendations, providers may still elect to prescribe this treatment plan, as it negates the need to count carbohydrates at meals and could be advantageous in situations of low literacy or poor adherence <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Furthermore, use of premix insulin for type 1 diabetes is more prevalent in nations outside of the USA <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In an analysis of 75 non-Western countries identified as members of the International Diabetes Federation, 25 countries provided guidelines for use of pharmacotherapy for type 1 diabetes, of which 60% included basal-bolus and premix regimens as first-line therapeutic options <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>A smaller proportion of subjects in the glargine/glulisine treatment group (4/12) experienced hypoglycemic events than in the lispro premix treatment group (9/13). Notably, this difference occurred despite the fact that lunch and dinner time insulin exposure was statistically greater in the glargine/glulisine group compared to the lispro premix group. Because this was a one-day study and the mealtime glulisine:carbohydrate dose was fixed, some subjects may have received a larger insulin:carbohydrate ratio than needed. This may have been the case in two subjects in the glargine/glulisine group who each experienced three hypoglycemic events. Clinically, the basal-bolus regimen allows for flexibility in real time, and the glulisine:carbohydrate ratio could be adjusted for patients' needs at each meal to avoid postprandial hypoglycemia.</p><p>A healthy control group was included as a means of assessing the degree to which the two insulin therapies studied matched physiologic responses to meals. Overall, insulin sensitivity was expected to be similar between the individuals with type 1 diabetes and the healthy controls. The individuals with type 1 diabetes had a normal BMI and good metabolic control with a mean HbA1c value of 7.3%. For control purposes, insulin dosing was standardized by administering a set ratio of insulin to carbohydrates. Glulisine was dosed in a conventional manner of 1 unit for every 10 gm carbohydrate, which approximated the 450-rule (450/total daily insulin) for dosing recommendations for the meal-time insulin to carbohydrate ratio <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This represented an applicable starting ratio typically used in clinical practice. The conventional strategy for dosing with lispro premix insulin is to split the injection into two doses, two-thirds in the morning and one-third in the evening <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, as was done in this study.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the fact that it was a small study that entailed only one day of monitoring for each insulin regimen. As a set ratio of insulin to carbohydrate was used, the effects of a different carbohydrate load or insulin to carbohydrate ratio or the addition of a pre-meal correction scale cannot be predicted based on the current data. Additionally, individualization of insulin dosing parameters (i.e., insulin to carbohydrate ratios or addition of a correction factor) may have further demonstrated the ability of basal bolus therapy to mimic normal healthy physiology to a greater extent. Premix insulin dosing was fixed for the purposes of this study; however, dosing of premix could be adjusted based on the meal content. Other experimental designs such as comparing the PK/PD effects of the two insulin regimens before a single standardized meal (e.g. breakfast) may have been more favorable toward the use of 75:25 premix analog insulin. One could consider that using a 50/50 analog premix formulation would be another comparator to this study's distribution of glulisine to glargine which was approximately 50/50. However, the presence of additional fast-acting pre-prandial insulin before breakfast in the premix insulin might also contribute to a greater prevalence of late morning/pre-lunch hypoglycemia. Our study of individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus provides a very useful model to investigate the PK characteristics of a subcutaneous injected insulin without the confounding effects of changing endogenous insulin leads; however, the study design did not include enough data points to additionally quantify the rate of rise of insulin (i.e. the times to 10%, 20% or 50% max absorption).</p><p>Strengths of the study include the three mixed-meal, day-long design with a controlled observation period that included frequent blood sampling, which provided information about insulin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics throughout the day. The crossover study design prevented discrepancies in insulin sensitivity between the two treatment groups and allowed for equal total insulin doses for each individual during both treatment arms. Total dose and total AUC[i] were similar, demonstrating internal consistency of the study design. The participants with type 1 diabetes were metabolically well controlled (HbA1c 7.3%) and blood glucose was tightly controlled during the night before the study, indicating that glucotoxicity was not a confounding factor in observations.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this study was designed to approximate the typical daily meal intake of a patient with type 1 diabetes who consumes breakfast, lunch and dinner. The PK of the glargine/glulisine treatment mimicked patterns of endogenous insulin levels in healthy controls, as evidenced by similarities in incremental AUC<sub>[i]</sub>, Tmax<sub>[i]</sub>, and &#x00394;Cmax<sub>[i]</sub> in the two groups. Additionally, upon glulisine injection only 5 minutes before a meal, systemic insulin levels showed a similar rate of rise as endogenous insulin in healthy individuals. While premixed analog insulin allows for a simplified dosing regimen, it is at the expense of an increased risk for hypoglycemia and lunch time postprandial hyperglycemia. This study was hypothesis-generating and allows opportunities to further study differing approaches of insulin delivery, meal content and dosing of insulin regimens tailored to an individual patient and his/her daily meal intake. This supports the importance of conducting studies that cover an entire day, and provide additional information beyond that observed with a simple one-meal challenge. We conclude that a regimen of basal insulin (glargine) and glulisine (injected 5 minutes before three standard meals) for people with type 1 diabetes can reproduce physiologic insulin responses observed in age and BMI matched healthy controls.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>EML, LMY and DBT have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
