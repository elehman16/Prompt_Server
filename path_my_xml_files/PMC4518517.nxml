These pathologies may be exacerbated by current standard of care resuscitation protocols. Observational studies suggest early administration of plasma to severely-injured haemorrhaging patients may correct TIC, minimise inflammation, and improve survival. The proposed randomised clinical trial will evaluate the clinical effectiveness of pre-hospital plasma administration compared with standard- of-care crystalloid resuscitation in severely-injured patients with major traumatic haemorrhage.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, non-blinded trial to determine the effect of pre-hospital administration of thawed plasma (TP) on mortality, morbidity, transfusion requirements, coagulation, and inflammatory response in severely-injured bleeding trauma patients.

Main analyses will compare subjects allocated to TP to those allocated to NS, on an intention-to-treat basis. Primary outcome measure is all-cause 30-day mortality.

Massive hemorrhage (MH) requires surgical intervention for definitive hemostasis. However, trauma-related hemorrhagic shock is also a disease of ischemic cellular injury and death, resulting from coagulation disruption and inflammatory precursor activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Approximately 25&#x000a0;% of severely injured patients present with severely abnormal coagulation changes occurring within very few hours of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This so-called trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) is associated with 4-fold increase in mortality, increased rates of late death from sepsis and multiple organ failure (MOF), and worsened outcomes from traumatic brain injury (TBI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Ischemic cellular injury resulting from uncorrected, persistent, and systemic hypoperfusion eventually leads to systemic inflammatory response syndrome and irreversible multi-system organ failure (MSOF). MSOF is a major cause of late mortality and morbidity following severe trauma, with a mortality rate of 50&#x000a0;% to 80&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>To minimize irreversible cell damage and death, it follows that recognition of MH should occur as soon as possible after injury and as far upstream as possible from initiation of coagulopathy/inflammatory cascades. Unfortunately early recognition may not be easily achieved, especially if bleeding is primarily internal. In practice, the extent of hemorrhage and shock during the initial assessment stage is based on vital signs, primarily blood pressure, pulse rate, palpable radial pulses, and mentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However these are extremely variable, non-specific, and very poor indicators of perfusion status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore choice of first-line resuscitation fluids will be essential for preempting some of the negative outcomes of unrecognized MH and shock.</p><p>There is increased interest in reviving prehospital use of plasma transfusions for severely injured hemorrhaging patients, especially if time to definitive care is long. Observational data suggest improved 6-hr outcomes but no overall survival advantage with prehospital blood product administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Better patient 30-d survival was associated with earlier (&#x0003c;4&#x000a0;hr) in-hospital administration of relatively high ratios of plasma to packed red blood cells (pRBC) in both civilian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and military [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] trauma populations; meta-analysis supports early use of plasma but does not conclude that there are additional survival benefits of 1:1 over 1:2 plasma:pRBC transfusion ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] In contrast, plasma transfusions have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in other studies of trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and non-MH patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, interpretations of data from these studies may be confounded by lack of standardization in hospital resuscitation protocols, changes in transfusion practice over the past decade, confounding-by-indication bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and survivor bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>At present there are no data either from systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or from completed, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] to assess the efficacy of plasma transfusion alone. Further, there are no rigorous definitions of how early infusion must occur relative to injury in order to demonstrate benefit. This study will be one of three prehospital trials conducted in parallel that explicitly examines the effect of prehospital plasma transfusion on mortality and morbidity in civilian trauma patient populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a prospective, open-label, non-blinded, randomized clinical trial to quantify the effects of early prehospital administration of plasma on death, coagulation function, transfusion requirements, and other relevant clinical outcomes for seriously-injured trauma patients with massive bleeding.

Definitive analyses will occur after the 30-day observation period for all survivors in each arm has been completed. Data will be assessed on de-identified data by statisticians and data analysts blinded to patient randomization and allocation category. Appropriate analysis strategies to reduce effects of survival and time-dependencies in post-admission treatments will be applied as necessary.</p><p>Planned subgroup analyses will be stratified on: (1) primary mechanism of injury (blunt or penetrating); (2) injury severity (severe ISS 16&#x02013;24, critical ISS&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;25); (3) presence or absence of traumatic brain injury, defined by GCS categories (severe 3&#x02013;8, moderate 9&#x02013;12, mild/absent 13&#x02013;15) or by abbreviated injury score-head (AIS-H) categories (yes &#x02265;3; no &#x0003c;3); (4) presence or absence of severe shock/tissue hypoperfusion (yes defined by base deficit &#x02265;6 and lactate &#x02265;3&#x000a0;mmol/L; no otherwise). Interaction tests will be used to examine the effect of the intervention (if any) across subgroups.</p><p>Interim analyses: there will be three planned analyses. Two interim analyses will be performed following accrual of 70 patients (35 per arm) and 140 patients (70 per arm), respectively. Interim and final data will be submitted to the DSMB for review; stopping criteria are based on safety data (see <italic>Stopping rules</italic>). Records will be assessed for data quality, including completeness (thereby encouraging collection of high-quality data), rates of recruitment and losses to follow up, and rates of protocol compliance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Benefit of early in-hospital use of TP to correct trauma-related coagulation dysfunction is weakly supported by several observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], but unsupported or contradicted by other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, confounding bias inherent to such studies, coupled with elastic definitions of what constitutes early in the critical care timeline, means that these data are not particularly informative with respect to the immediate care of critically injured patients in hemorrhagic shock. This study is designed to assess the efficacy of prehospital plasma resuscitation on clinically relevant endpoints of mortality and short-term coagulation and inflammatory response.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study: TP infusion cannot be blinded to prehospital providers (although subsequent healthcare professionals may not necessarily receive this information), variable scene&#x02013;hospital transport times of 6&#x02013;30 min, so that not all patients allocated to the TP arm will receive the full complement of two units of TP before hospital arrival, and the complexity of patient management in the field, which means that the prehospital period will be most vulnerable to missing data.</p><p>This trial, coupled with those at Pittsburgh and Denver sister institutions, will be among the first to test the hypothesis that prehospital plasma administration to severely injured patients is effective in reducing trauma-related mortality and coagulopathy. Resulting data will be of considerable clinical importance for informing the management of hemorrhagic shock in both civilian and military populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial has begun enrolling patients.
