In light of evidence that motor actions can be prepared and initiated in less than 200 ms, the function of this early activity has remained enigmatic. We hypothesized that the movement-related potential reflects the state of preparation of the planned movement. This was tested by delivering a startling acoustic stimulus during the preparation phase of a load-release task. The cue to release the load was presented either 3.5 seconds after a warning cue (PREDICT condition) or randomly between 4&#x02013;12 seconds (REACT condition). Electroencephalographic, electromyographic and limb and load kinematic signals were recorded. In a subset of trials, a startle stimulus was delivered at &#x02212;1500, &#x02212;1000, &#x02212;500, &#x02212;250, &#x02212;100 or 0 ms before the release cue. A contingent-negative variation (CNV) waveform, with a late phase of slow-rising negativity beginning an average of 1459 ms prior to movement, was observed for the PREDICT condition but not the REACT condition. For both conditions, the startle stimulus frequently evoked the early and unintentional release of the load-release sequence. The incidence of release was significantly (p&#x0003c;0.001) correlated with the late phase of the CNV for the PREDICT condition but not the REACT condition. For the REACT condition, the incidence of movement release was subject-specific, constant across the preparation interval, and uncorrelated with cortical activity. The onset of movement release by the startle stimulus was significantly shorter (p&#x0003c;0.001) for the PREDICT compared to the REACT condition. These findings provide evidence that the late phase of the CNV reflects cortical activity mediating the progressive preparation and storage of the forthcoming movement and that during this phase an intense sensory stimulus can evoke early and unintentional release of the planned action.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding provided by National Institutes of Health Grant RO1 NS054199.

Behaviorally relevant cues often require a reaction to the stimulus (reactive movements) or provide advance information that can be used to proactively plan the timing and content of the forthcoming actions (predictive movements). In the latter context, movements are often preceded by a slow-rising increase in cortical activity beginning as much as 2&#x02013;3 seconds before movement onset <xref rid="pone.0063417-Deecke1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063417-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This early cortical activity can be measured using scalp surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings back-averaged relative to the onset of muscle activity. When the movement is initiated under self-paced conditions, the movement-related EEG waveform is termed the &#x0201c;Readinesss&#x0201d; or Bereitschaftspotential (BP) <xref rid="pone.0063417-Kornhuber1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and when it is initiated in response to an imperative stimulus that is preceded by a warning stimulus, the waveform is termed the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) <xref rid="pone.0063417-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The CNV is characterized by two components: an early period of prolonged negativity that immediately follows the potential evoked by the warning stimulus, followed by a late component that is distinguished by a slow-rising negativity that is time-locked to movement onset with maximal amplitude over motor regions of the frontal cortex. The late component of the CNV is also accompanied by a progressive suppression of oscillations in the alpha (8&#x02013;12 Hz) and beta-bands (13&#x02013;30 Hz), termed event-related desynchronization <xref rid="pone.0063417-Pfurtscheller1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, that is considered to reflect a transition from an idling motor state to a state of readiness to act <xref rid="pone.0063417-Gilbertson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-Jenkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In light of the fact that voluntary movements can normally be initiated in less than 200 ms, the function of this early ramping motor cortical activity has remained enigmatic <xref rid="pone.0063417-Shibasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It has been proposed that early preparatory activity reflects the progressive selection and construction of the spatial and temporal components of the planned movement and thus represents a subthreshold form of the motor output which allows for faster reaction times and reduced movement variability <xref rid="pone.0063417-Cisek1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063417-Tanji1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. More recently, it has been proposed that preparatory activity reflects the initial state of a dynamical system in which the early neuronal population activity does not represent the forthcoming movement parameters <xref rid="pone.0063417-Churchland1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Resolution of this problem is greatly limited by the inability to decode the function of movement-related preparatory activity, whether obtained from single-, multi-unit or local field potential recordings of neuronal activity in behaving non-human primates or scalp surface recordings from humans, and its relationship to the eventual motor output.</p><p>In this paper, we implemented a novel paradigm that uses a startling acoustic stimulus (SAS) to probe the state of preparation of the motor output. This paradigm was derived from the seminal experiments first described by Valls-Sol&#x000e9; et al. <xref rid="pone.0063417-VallsSole1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-VallsSole2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> showing that voluntary movement sequences could be rapidly released, at latencies of less than 100 ms, when an intense acoustic stimulus (130 dB) was presented in conjunction with the imperative cue to initiate movement; a phenomenon termed the &#x0201c;StartReact&#x0201d;. Two salient features of the StartReact are: (1) despite the extraordinarily short reaction times, the spatial and temporal features of the planned movement sequence remain unchanged and (2) the rapid initiation of the intended movement only occurs when the movement to be performed is known in advance <xref rid="pone.0063417-Carlsen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Based on the short latency of these reactions, it has been proposed that the StartReact reflects a reflexive or &#x0201c;involuntary&#x0201d; release of the planned movement via fast conducting pathways <xref rid="pone.0063417-VallsSole1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-Carlsen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063417-VallsSole3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Consistent with this idea, it has been shown that movements can sometimes be released by a startling stimulus presented well before the imperative go-cue, however the incidence of release was related to the timing of presentation of the startle stimulus and temporal resolution of the delay interval between a warning and go-cue <xref rid="pone.0063417-Carlsen2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-MacKinnon1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Since cortical preparation is known to be modulated by the temporal predictability and resolution of the imperative cue <xref rid="pone.0063417-Cui1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063417-McAdam1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, these findings suggest that the capacity of an intense sensory stimulus to evoke a StartReact might be dependent upon the timing and level of motor cortical preparation. Our study tested this hypothesis by recording scalp surface electroencephalographic signals (EEG) during the preparation and execution of a task performed under temporally reactive or predictive conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Nine right-handed neurologically healthy subjects (9 males; average age &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 33, range &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 27 to 49 years) participated in these experiments.

Epochs were subsequently high-pass filtered to remove DC offset and drift (dual-pass 2<sup>nd</sup>-order Butterworth, 1 Hz cut-off). Spectrograms for each filtered epoch of electrode C3 were generated using the Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) with a window length of 0.5 s (i.e., 125 samples) and 124 sample overlap. A mean spectrogram for each subject and condition (PRECICT and REACT) was obtained by averaging across epochs.

The PREDICT condition was also associated with a suppression of movement-related oscillations in the alpha and beta bands over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063417-g003">Figure 3</xref>) during the delay interval between the warning and release cues. Oscillations in the alpha band were significantly suppressed (95% confidence intervals) during the time interval immediately following the warning cue (&#x02212;3 to &#x02212;2 s prior to EMG onset) in 6 of 9 subjects whereas late in the preparation interval (&#x02212;1.5 to &#x02212;0.5 s prior to EMG onset) only 2 subjects showed a significant suppression. In contrast, beta oscillations were significantly suppressed late in the preparation interval (6 of 9 subjects), but less commonly immediately after the warning cue (3 subjects). Oscillations for the REACT task were characterized by little change in the magnitude of alpha oscillations throughout the preparation interval (a significant suppression was observed in only 1 subject) while beta oscillations were suppressed approximately 1500 ms prior to movement onset, but this suppression was significant in only 1 subject.</p><fig id="pone-0063417-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0063417.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Movement-related oscillations were affected by the predictability of the imperative release cue.</title><p>The upper plots show the grand average time-frequency spectrograms at the C3 electrode overlying the contralateral sensorimotor region for the PREDICT (A) and REACT (B) conditions.

However, the two task conditions differed markedly with respect to the incidence and latency of spontaneous release of the load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063417-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

However, the incidence and latency of release of the movement by a SAS was critically dependent on the timing of the startling stimulus, the temporal predictability of the impending imperative go-cue and the associated movement-related potential.</p><p>It has been proposed that preparatory neuronal activity, and the associated scalp surface EEG signal, reflects a progressive facilitation of cortical and subcortical pathways contributing to the kinematic, kinetic and temporal components of the forthcoming movement initiation sequence <xref rid="pone.0063417-Cisek1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063417-Tanji1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-Colebatch1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-Rektor1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> such that the system moves closer to a triggering threshold in expectation of the incoming sensory volleys evoked by the imperative cue (the subthreshold hypothesis). More recently, this idea has been challenged based on data showing that preparatory activity at the neuronal population level does not represent specific biomechanical features of the forthcoming movement, but instead represents the initial state of a dynamical system that is optimized to drive the initiation of movement during the immediate peri-movement phase <xref rid="pone.0063417-Churchland1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In many respects, the results of the present study support the subthreshold hypothesis. The fact that movement sequences could be evoked by a SAS as early as 1.5 s prior to the expected cue, and at latencies of less than 100 ms, demonstrates that the spatial and temporal features of the initial motor response were fully prepared and could be released when an initiating trigger brought the system past threshold. The low incidence of movement release early in preparation could be explained by a high threshold for triggering, but also by an active suppression of motor output at the cortical and spinal motor neuron levels <xref rid="pone.0063417-Duque1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-Duque2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This early suppression of excitability has been proposed as a mechanism of &#x0201c;impulse control&#x0201d; that prevents the premature release of the intended response <xref rid="pone.0063417-Duque1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063417-Confais1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The progressive increase in the incidence of movement release and decrease in the response latency in response to SAS over the preparatory interval is consistent with the idea that impulse control is suppressed, the movement initiation threshold is decreased, the rate of rise to threshold is increased <xref rid="pone.0063417-Hanes1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and variability in the state of preparatory neural activity is decreased <xref rid="pone.0063417-Churchland2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Thus, the slow-rising CNV beginning near 1500 ms prior to movement onset, and accompanying suppression of movement-related oscillations, could best described as a progressive &#x0201c;releasing of the brakes&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0063417-Floeter1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> or &#x0201c;opening of the gates&#x0201d;, rather than activity associated with higher-order aspects of motor preparation such as attention and planning.</p><p>Late in preparation (less than 500 ms), there was little change in the incidence or timing of release of movement by the SAS. During self-initiated (uncued) movements, this phase of preparation is associated with an increase in the negative slope of the movement-related potential and a shift in topography towards the contralateral motor cortex (termed the BP2 or NS' phase) <xref rid="pone.0063417-Deecke1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-Shibasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-Colebatch1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This change is often less prominent in the CNV waveform and could not be objectively distinguished from the early increase in negativity beginning near &#x02212;1500 ms in this study. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that the state of preparation during this interval, in terms of readiness for release, has plateaued. This interpretation is consistent with recent work showing that incidence and timing of release of a simple wrist extension movement were unchanged when the SAS was presented 500 ms or less prior to the go-cue during a fixed foreperiod (3 s) and variable foreperiod (2&#x02013;3) reaction time task <xref rid="pone.0063417-Carlsen2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to the PREDICT condition, the presentation of a SAS prior to the release cue for the REACT condition was associated with a near-constant within-subject probability of movement release by the intense stimulus. Under this condition, movement-related potentials were markedly reduced, the suppression of oscillations was attenuated, and SAS-evoked reaction times of less than 100 ms were significantly less common compared to the PREDICT condition. The grand average movement-related potentials and oscillations did exhibit a shallow slope, suggesting that some subjects were progressively preparing for the imperative cue, despite the temporal uncertainty of the required response. This low level preparatory activity was likely due to the fact that the maximum interval between trials was fixed at 12 s, thus the probability of presentation of the imperative cue increased as the duration of the inter-trial interval increased <xref rid="pone.0063417-Klemmer1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-Niemi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, the relatively stable incidence of SAS-evoked movement release within-subjects suggests that, under conditions of uncertainty about the timing of the imperative cue, the state of motor readiness and the sensorimotor threshold required to release the planned movement was held relatively constant throughout the inter-trial interval.</p><p>Due to the unusually short response times associated with the StartReact, Valls-Sol&#x000e9; and others <xref rid="pone.0063417-VallsSole1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-Carlsen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-VallsSole3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> hypothesized that movements evoked by a SAS were released involuntarily. Yet in those studies, the SAS was presented concurrently with the imperative go-cue, a time point in which the initiation of movement is considered to be intentional <xref rid="pone.0063417-Brass1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Voluntary behavior has been broadly defined as those actions that are conscious and suppressible <xref rid="pone.0063417-Prochazka1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In the present study, we found that movements could be evoked by a SAS as early as 1500 ms prior to the intended onset and the release of movement was often described as &#x0201c;involuntary&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;unintentional&#x0201d;. Late in preparation (less than 500 ms) movement release was predominantly insuppressible. The conscious experience of the intention to act is considered to arise from early processes related to the preparation for movement <xref rid="pone.0063417-Brass1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-Hallett1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063417-Libet1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Libet and colleagues were the first to present evidence that motor preparation begins well in advance of the feeling of the urge to act <xref rid="pone.0063417-Libet1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Although our experiment was not designed to estimate the time point at which the release of movement by a SAS was considered to be intentional, our findings are consistent with the idea that fully formed movement sequences can be rapidly and involuntarily released by a SAS when the stimulus is presented during movement preparation.</p><p>These findings have important ramifications to motor performance. For example, the timing predictability of the starter's pistol discharge and the athlete's capacity to predict its onset will have a significant effect on their reaction times. If the athlete accurately predicts the onset of discharge they are much more likely to initiate movement with a reaction time of less than 100 ms, but if they prepare too late (i.e. the stimulus is presented early in preparation) or merely react to the sound, the reaction time is likely to be much slower. In sports where the difference between medalling and not medalling can be measured in hundredths of a second, the capacity to appropriately prepare can make all the difference.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Di Zhang and Chrystal Johnson for their contributions to the project, Dr. Anthony Carlsen and Jeremy Eagles for their contributions to the figures and discussion of the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0063417-Deecke1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
