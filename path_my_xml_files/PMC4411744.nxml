<italic>Aim:</italic> The use of &#x003b2;-blocker therapy in asymptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is controversial. This study evaluates the effect of lifestyle changes and high-dose &#x003b2;-blocker therapy on their exercise capacity. <italic>Methods and results:</italic> A total of 29 consecutive newly diagnosed asymptomatic patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, median age 15 years (range 7&#x02013;25), were recruited. In all, 16 patients with risk factors for sudden death were treated with propranolol if no contraindications, or equivalent doses of metoprolol; 13 with no risk factors were randomised to metoprolol or no active treatment. Thus, there were three treatment groups, non-selective &#x003b2;-blockade (n=10, propranolol 4.0&#x02013;11.6 mg/kg/day), selective &#x003b2;-blockade (n=9, metoprolol 2.7&#x02013;5.9 mg/kg/day), and randomised controls (n=10). All were given recommendations for lifestyle modifications, and reduced energetic exercise significantly (p=0.002). Before study entry, and after 1 year, all underwent bicycle exercise tests with a ramp protocol. There were no differences in exercise capacity between the groups at entry, or follow-up, when median exercise capacity in the groups were virtually identical (2.4, 2.3, and 2.3 watt/kg and 55, 55, and 55 watt/(height in metre)<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">

No patient developed a pathological blood-pressure response to exercise because of &#x003b2;-blocker therapy. Boys were more frequently risk-factor positive than girls (75% versus 33%, p=0.048) and had higher physical activity scores than girls at study-entry (p=0.011). <italic>Conclusions:</italic> Neither selective nor non-selective &#x003b2;-blockade causes significant reductions in exercise capacity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy above that induced by lifestyle changes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Exercise capacity</kwd><kwd>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</kwd><kwd>&#x003b2;-receptor antagonist</kwd><kwd>propranolol</kwd><kwd>metoprolol</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an inherited cardiac disease with an estimated prevalence in the adult population of 1:500.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Patients who were risk factor positive were recommended treatment with propranolol, a non-selective &#x003b2;-blocker (n=10, &#x0201c;non-selective&#x0201d; group), or if there were contraindications to this, such as bronchial asthma, a selective &#x003b2;-blocker (metoprolol, n=6). Only 1 out of 29 patients had left ventricular outflow obstruction, which was very mild at rest (outflow velocity of 2 m/second), but increased to a Doppler-predicted gradient of 64 mmHg after Valsalva. This, however, did not interfere with exercise capacity, as this patient had among the highest exercise capacity of all patients before treatment was commenced. He was treated with propranolol because of a close family history of sudden death (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1c</xref>). There was one high-risk patient &#x02013; who had additional psychosocial stress &#x02013; who developed central side effects on propanolol, which persisted on metoprolol and was therefore converted to atenolol (3.7mg/kg/day) plus disopyramide. This patient is not analysed in the non-selective group &#x02013; on intention to treat criteria &#x02013; but as he had received a selective &#x003b2;-blocker for the last 9 months before the follow-up study he is analysed together with the metoprolol-treated patients (n=6). Patients with no risk factors (n=13) were randomised either to follow-up, without pharmacological treatment (n=10, control group), or to selective &#x003b2;-blocker therapy with metoprolol (n=3). The two subgroups receiving metoprolol &#x02013; or atenolol &#x02013; were added together to form the &#x0201c;selective&#x0201d; group. High-dose propranolol therapy in children has been defined as a propranolol dose &#x02a7e;5 mg/kg,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref> or equivalent doses of other &#x003b2;-blockers; however, there are not only substantial inter-individual variation in the rates of hepatic metabolism of &#x003b2;-blockers, there are great age-related variations in the dose required to give the same plasma levels, with young children demanding substantially higher dose in mg/kg than teenagers, and teenagers needing higher dose than adults for the same plasma levels.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref> It is therefore scientifically more correct to standardise the dose on the degree of physiological &#x003b2;-blockade than on dose in mg/kg. Thus, although the target dose of &#x003b2;-blocker was 6 mg/kg/day for propanolol, or a minimum of 4.0 mg/kg/day for metoprolol, with sufficient &#x003b2;-blockade on 24-hour Holter monitoring &#x02013; for Holter criteria of adequate &#x003b2;-blockade see references<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>, a few of the young adults needed lower doses for a profound &#x003b2;-receptor blockade to be evident on Holter and exercise testing. The randomised patients were seen 3-monthly during the first year of therapy, with a standardised rate of drug therapy increase, with assessment of patient compliance to both exercise restrictions and drug therapy; 24-hour Holter recordings were always carried out after 9 months therapy on approximately &#x02013; as dictated by tablet/capsule size &#x02013; 4.5 mg/kg propranolol equivalent dose in order to assess whether &#x003b2;-blockade was sufficient, or a last increase to around 6 mg/kg was necessary. High-risk patients had additional earlier Holter recordings to assess &#x003b2;-blockade and absence of arrhythmias, and often required higher doses to achieve a good heart rate control according to criteria.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>In the present study, comparable reductions in maximal exercise heart rate occurred with both selective and non-selective &#x003b2;-blocker therapy indicating equivalent &#x003b2;-blockade. Nevertheless, there was no significant impairment of exercise performance in any of the groups with selective or non-selective &#x003b2;-blocker therapy compared with patients treated with lifestyle changes only. In the control group treated with lifestyle changes only, 8 out of 10 patients had a lower maximal exercise capacity at follow-up, exactly the same proportion as in the selective and non-selective groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1a&#x02013;c</xref>). Thus, there was a significantly lower exercise capacity at follow-up only when all groups were combined. Changes in girls were very small (&#x02212;2.4% median change), and the largest drops were seen in athletically active boys with high fitness levels before imposition of exercise restrictions. Even if it is not possible in this rather small study to reliably separate the effects on exercise capacity of lifestyle modifications from the effects of &#x003b2;-blocker treatment, the differential effect depending on gender suggests that lifestyle modifications, consisting of restricting energetic exercise such as soccer and ice hockey, by themselves inevitably have some effect on aerobic capacity and therefore exercise capacity, and are the main cause of the changes observed. That they did significantly influence the amount of energetic exercise was proven by our questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3" sec-type="general"><title>Possible mechanisms for maintaining cardiac output in spite of &#x003b2;-blockade in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</title><p>There are a few small studies on the effect of short-term &#x003b2;-blocker therapy on exercise performance in patients with mostly symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with conflicting results.

</p><p>The results of this study indicate that high-dose &#x003b2;-blocker therapy by itself does not impair physical exercise capacity to any significant degree in this specific group of patients, in spite of the fact that the maximum heart rates were significantly decreased by 27&#x02013;29%. This finding is clearly not due to &#x003b2;-blocker therapy reducing outflow obstruction, as only one patient had dynamic outflow obstruction before therapy, and he actually had a high exercise capacity with the outflow obstruction untreated. One possible mechanism to explain the maintained exercise capacity could be an improvement in diastolic function leading to an increased stroke volume to compensate for the lower heart rate.</p><p>The majority of adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have an exercise capacity that is lower than predicted.<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">

Therefore, our statistical comparisons have focused on within-patient changes. It cannot be excluded that &#x003b2;-blocker treatment in high doses had a slight negative effect on exercise capacity that was too small to be detected in a study of our size. Owing to the fact that it would be unethical to withhold internationally accepted advice on lifestyle changes to some patients, it was not possible to absolutely separate the effects on exercise capacity of lifestyle modifications from the effects of &#x003b2;-blocker treatment. However, although the patient numbers are limited, it is a uniquely homogeneous patient group, all newly diagnosed, and therefore not previously treated either pharmacologically or with lifestyle modifications. This has given us the opportunity to also assess the effect of training restriction on the exercise capacity of the control patients, and the effect of these restrictions on their activity pattern. Thus, we think this study gives guidance as to the very small size of effects on exercise capacity, if any, to be expected in young patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy treated with &#x003b2;-blockers in a high dose.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Neither selective nor non-selective &#x003b2;-blockade by itself caused a significant reduction in exercise capacity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, above that induced by lifestyle changes, in spite of a significant reduction of maximum heart rate response. One likely mechanism behind this finding is an improvement in diastolic filling resulting in an increase of previously compromised stroke volume during exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors want to thank the participating patients and their parents.</p><p>
