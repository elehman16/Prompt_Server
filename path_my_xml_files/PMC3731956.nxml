Meperidine, an opioid agonist, in combination with hydroxyzine is assumed to be an effective sedative regimen for its euphoric and analgesic properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Compared to adults, higher sedative values are registered in children.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The medication is usually administrated via several routes including oral and submucosal means. Submucosal meperidine is exclusively administered in the field of dentistry and allows a rapid rise in drug's serum level;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] a property that makes it suitable for pediatric dental patients. However, oral administration, in spite of its longer waiting time and bitter taste, may be more preferred by many children.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] A high success rate has been reported for oral and submucous meperidine in children with a mean age of 51 and 54 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Hydroxyzine has been shown to have an analgesic as well as antiemetic and euphoric effects in addition to its sedative potential with fewer hazards.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Midazolam, a relatively short-acting benzodiazepine, has received considerable attention as a safe and effective agent mainly beside nitrous oxide.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Midazolam has gained high popularity over the recent years based on its margin of safety, half-life, amnestic potential and availability of antagonist.

Sequentially numbered containers were used for randomization by operating Pediatric dentist. Blinding was carried out on the rater and operator, as none had any role in the drug administration process. However, behavioral rating was performed after the administration of different regimens; operators were calibrated in advance through the course of treatment. Drug administration was performed along with monitoring physiological parameters by an anesthesiology technician to ensure proper drug administration. A hypothesis was drawn as meperidine to be a superior sedative medication to midazolam in children.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sample</title><p>This study included 30 uncooperative children (23 boys and 7 girls scored as Frankl 1, definitely negative) aged 2-6 years, who were referred to the Pediatric Hospital Dentistry Clinic at Shahid Beheshti Dental School with a history of previous unsuccessful dental appointment by a Pediatric Dentist (Frankle 1).

According to the results of this study, the rate of successful sedation prior to dental treatment with either routes of meperidine administration was three times more than midazolam. Midazolam is widely known as an effective sedative agent for many medical and dental procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] However, midazolam with the recommended dose of 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg has little to no effect in children younger than 3-4 years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Kain (2007) reported that the plasma levels of midazolam and its metabolite 1-hydroxy midazolam; were equivocal in both responders and nonresponders, with responses being quite different in children younger than 4 years of age. Hence this finding should be attributed to pharmacodynamic rather than pharmacokinetic variables. In other words, midazolam is absorbed, distributed and metabolized in a similar manner in both responders and nonresponders, but the interaction between midazolam and the type A GABA receptors, responsible for antianxiety effects, is essentially different in different ages. The ontogeny of these receptors including their expression, distribution and coupling with midazolam is an issue, which is still under investigation in children of various age groups.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Similar results were obtained in this investigation. It was also noted that older children (4-6 years of age) show six times more success for overall behavior than younger ones (2-3 years of age). An overall success rate of 54% has been reported recently by Baygin (2010) with a dose of 0.75 mg/kg midazolam too.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>Despite all expectations, meperidine was not found to be fully beneficial in the current study. Since half of the cases were under the age of 3 years, it seems that minimal sedation even with a drug like meperidine, will not improve child's behavior profoundly in such a young age. From a pharmacological point of view, opioids such as meperidine are subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (a large proportion is broken down in the liver). So if they are administered orally, only 40-50% of the dose reaches the central nervous system.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Hamunen, <italic>et al</italic>. reported that meperidine pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be similar to those of adults, with an average half-life of 3.0 hours.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Obviously what a clinician should primarily achieve is to facilitate the communication and potentiate the effects of behavioral modification expected from the drug's effect, which needs further proof in uncooperative age groups. In cases where no positive drug effect is achieved for sedating children, general anesthesia is offered as an alternative to complete the treatment process.</p><p>Based on the results of the current investigation, both oral and submucosal meperidines were in a similar range of safety and behavioral modification. However, it seems that oral administration is preferred by patients based on its higher acceptance.</p><p>On the other hand it has been found that child temperament is an important issue in responsiveness to midazolam. More emotional and more anxious children[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] may not well cope with treatment by midazolam as well as those with psychosomatic behavior problems and inflexible temperament,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] or impulsivity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] These variables could be the reasons for low compliance observed in this study, as half of the subjects were younger than age 3, with almost all showing extremely uncooperative behavior (rated as Frankl 1).</p><p>An overall decrease in dental fear following the three sedation appointments were observed with only three individuals indicating some degrees of fear remaining afterwards. Isik (2010) has reported significantly better outcomes associated with midazolam sedation in children with temperament characteristics such as in&#x0fb02;exibility and psychosomatic symptoms. It is well evident that a successful sedation is not necessarily guaranteed after oral midazolam premedication.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Rodrigues (2003) reported that the use of midazolam-hydroxyzine combination lead to a poorer result comparing to midazolam alone, since hydroxyzine did not potentiate the effect of midazolam in spite of previous expectations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] as seen by the current results. Injective form of midazolam was used through oral route as a part in combination with aqueous solution of sucrose in this investigation. Since midazolam has a pka of 6.15 (a pH that the ionized and non-ionized forms of drug are in balance), a major part of the medicine is ionized in the presence of gastric fluids; the bioavailability is therefore 15 to 27%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Levine (1993) suggests midazolam may augment transmucosal absorption in viscous syrup, bypassing the portal metabolism and increasing the absorption rate of the drug.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>The rate of acceptable behavior with meperidine was about 46.7% and 50% for oral and submucosal administration, respectively. Higher success rates are reported by Cathers (2005) and Song (2003). It should be noted that the mean age of patients is an important variable in the success rate of sedation as higher values in the aforementioned studies (50, 51 months) compare to 41 months in the present study. In addition, Cathers (2005) believed that the sequence of meperidine administration clearly affects the results, as patients who received oral meperidine in the first session were twice likely to have a more successful sedation compared to those who received the submucosal type first.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Such a correlation was not found in this study.</p><p>Beside the efficacy, safety of the drugs used is an important issue specially for treating children in the dental office. No episodes of desaturation (saturation below 90%) with either of the drug regimens were observed during this study. In the case of transient hypoxemia, oxyhemoglobin level did not come any lower than 93% and was relieved primarily by changing the head position and jaw trust maneuver, although an oxygen source and nose mask was available. Stability of the other physiological parameters was also observed, except the heart rate in the midazolam group, which showed alterations from baseline measurements. This finding is in consistence with Chawdhry (2005)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] and Golpayegani, <italic>et al</italic>. (2012).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] However, these changes were remained in the range of upper natural limits adjustable to behavioral patterns such as crying during midazolam sedation or as natural outcome of sleep.</p><p>Other adverse reactions include mild or moderate inflammatory response and mucosal edema at the injection site of meperidine, in a few cases. Mucosal reaction has been mainly reported in adults due to a larger volume of the medicine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Two cases of nausea and vomiting were also reported following the use of oral meperidine and after the completion of treatment. This phenomenon is a common outcome in outpatient dental care and attributes to stimulation of medullary chemoreceptor with movement.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>It is believed that in addition to the dental fear, other aspects of child's personality and temperament should be evaluated before judging the medicine's effectiveness, two important factors which could have a direct impact on these studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>
