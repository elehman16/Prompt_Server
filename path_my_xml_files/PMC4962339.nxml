Despite rising participation rates, the understanding of basic lacrosse mechanics and their contributions to injury is not widely known. Among the several actions in lacrosse play, a key motion is the shot. Shooting precision and mechanics are dependent on the appropriate muscle activation patterns, adequate rotation of the shoulders over the pelvis, and sequencing of peak body segment rotational velocity.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Like other overhead athletes, lacrosse players develop high ball speeds by generating initial forces at the start of the shot and transferring that energy along the kinetic chain to ball release.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> There are several potential factors that can affect force development and timing of the mechanics, including musculoskeletal or joint pain. Alternatively, the high forces generated by the shooting motion itself may place mechanical stresses on the body and may contribute to the development of musculoskeletal pain or injury. The lumbar spine and associated musculature transfer energy of the throwing motion from the lower to the upper body via rapid rotation, and these structures are involved with the acceleration and deceleration of the upper body during a shot.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> This led to the following question: Are there specific motion characteristics of players with and without low back pain (LBP)?</p><p>Large evidence gaps exist with respect to the potential relationships between mechanical factors of lacrosse shooting and the presence or severity of LBP.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> This is problematic because high school lacrosse surveillance data have revealed that back injuries occur at a rate of 60 to 80 cases per 1000 athletic exposures.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> LBP may adversely affect motion by interfering with the transfer of energy from the lower body to the upper body. Peak angular velocities of the hip, trunk, and shoulders and timing of these peak velocities produced during the throw would be negatively affected by pain. Moreover, if the normal kinematic sequence and coordination is altered in a throwing activity, the forces produced in the throwing motion are transferred to distal body segments, which may lead to injury elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Moreover, restrictions in rotation of body segments engaged in earlier phases of the shot (eg, pelvis or torso) may increase the mechanical demands to segments engaged later in the shot such as the upper arm. The first essential step toward understanding the relationship between LBP and shooting mechanics in lacrosse players is to characterize the difference in mechanics between players with and without LBP.</p><p>Therefore, the purposes of this study were to (1) determine the differences in key kinematic motion parameters of the lacrosse shot between players with and without LBP and (2) quantify the contribution of LBP to the variance of kinematic parameters of the lacrosse shot. We hypothesized that players with LBP would demonstrate differences in shot speed and rotational excursions of the pelvis and shoulder and that LBP would be a significant contributor to rotational range of motion of the shoulders and pelvis and peak angular velocities of the pelvis, trunk, and shoulders.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2325967116657535"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section2-2325967116657535"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study and its procedures were approved by University of Florida&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2325967116657535" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Players were stratified into 2 groups based on the presence of any mild to moderate LBP: no pain and LBP (presence of LBP during shooting movement).

Maximal strength testing consisted of reaching a 1-repetition maximum (1RM) for each of the 3 machines. After a standard warm-up of light repetitions, the resistance was progressively increased until only 1 repetition could be performed with good form. Subjective rating of perceived exertion values from the participant were used to set the resistance loads for each exercise. After conducting the 1RM tests, participants were allowed to rest and recover until they were ready to complete the endurance tests.

The 3 phases include the crank-back, acceleration, and follow-through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2325967116657535">Figure 1</xref>). The crank-back is the preparatory movement that represents the wind-up that precedes the acceleration of the crosse stick. Immediately after crank-back, there is a drive forward with the lead foot. The lead foot plant initiates the acceleration phase. The acceleration phase involves increasing angular velocities of the body segments (pelvis, trunk, shoulders) and crosse to prepare for ball release. The ball release is the event that terminates the acceleration phase and is used to define the end of the shot. The final phase of the lacrosse shot is the follow-through. This phase involves the relative trunk-to-pelvis separation motion and deceleration of the body segment rotations. The maximal shoulder-to-pelvis separation is the final event of the lacrosse shot. For our data analysis, we defined the starting event of the motion as the lead foot plant event (0%) and the final event of ball release as the end of the shot (100%). Follow-through occurred after ball release (&#x0003e;100% of the shot cycle).<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>

Participants used their own crosses. The dominant arm was defined as the arm with which the participant uses to write. The overhead shot was selected because it is a basic skill of the sport and is easily replicated by players. Each player was provided a set of standardized instructions to release the ball with as much speed and accuracy as possible, without compromising form for the sake of speed. Accuracy was defined as the ability of the ball to hit a marked area on a wall net that was the exact size of the goal. If the ball did not land in the goal target, the trial was excluded from analysis. The data from 3 trials were averaged to determine the average shooting motion.</p></sec><sec id="section9-2325967116657535"><title>Kinematic Measures</title><p>Specific kinematic events were expressed as a percent of the shot cycle using available software (MATLAB; Mathworks Inc). The software was used to calculate angular velocities of the pelvis, trunk, and shoulder at key shot cycle events; the relative orientation of the pelvis and trunk; and joint angles at foot contact and ball release. A summary of the kinematic measurements most relevant to back motion are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2325967116657535">Figure 1</xref>.

In preparation for a shot, crank-back occurs, where the throwing arm abducts, and the trunk turns away from the target (phase 1). The crosse is then brought forward for acceleration of the shot (phase 2). Here, the throwing arm moves anteriorly toward the target. After ball release, the shoulder-to-pelvis separation continues into the follow-through (phase 3). This is the point of maximal shoulder-to-pelvis separation. The maximum angular velocity and the time at which the maximum angular velocity occurred were identified for the pelvis, trunk, shoulders, and crosse (expressed as percent of the shot cycle). The range of motion (ROM) values of knee flexion, shoulder rotation in the transverse plane, pelvis tilt in the sagittal plane, and pelvis rotation in the transverse plane were calculated from the difference between the maximal and minimal angular position values, from 0% to 100% of the shot cycle. Trunk anterior lean in the sagittal plane was calculated from the difference between the maximal and minimal angular position values, from &#x02013;50% of the shot cycle to the end of follow-through.

While many kinematic parameters of motion were similar between participants with and without LBP, those with chronic mild to moderate pain shot the lacrosse ball with greater knee flexion and slower peak trunk angular velocities. There was less incremental increase in angular velocities from pelvis to trunk in players with pain. LBP severity significantly contributed to several kinematic variables, including trunk and shoulder peak angular velocities and knee flexion at ball release. There are 2 possible interpretations of these findings: (1) the trigger of back pain may cause players to self-restrict high-speed rotation of segments that may exacerbate pain or (2) the motion itself over time caused the pain to develop. While this study was not able to measure pain onset longitudinally, the first possibility is explored.</p><p>Our findings are in partial agreement with other high-speed rotational sports that involve long lever arm equipment, such as golf or tennis, or that involve similar sequences of angular velocities from the pelvis, trunk, shoulder, and lever arm (eg, golf club, tennis racquet). Studies of golf swing motion demonstrate that players with symptomatic LBP used more lateral side bending on the backswing and had trunk flexion velocities during the downswing that were 2 times slower than players without pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> During neutral stance, the golfers with pain had less trunk rotation during the swing than players without, indicating that the relative spine rotation was elevated during the backswing. Tsai et al<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> reported minimal differences in trunk kinematics. Biomechanical studies of tennis players also revealed minimal motion differences between players with and without LBP. In 1 study of tennis players (N = 21), serving kinematics were characterized by greater lateral pelvic tilt, lower lumbar and pelvic ROM, and anterior pelvic tilt in players with LBP compared with healthy players. Peak knee and hip flexion angles did not differ, but time to peak knee extension was earlier in players with and without LBP.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In contrast, Campbell et al<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> found that mean values of forehand or backhand groundstroke motion parameters did not differ in adolescent players with pain (N = 7) compared with those who had no pain (N = 12).</p><p>Pain may change the normal muscle activation of the muscles of the trunk that control the amount of spine rotation and rotational velocity. For example, LBP causes continual activation of the mulitifidus and longissimus muscles during axial rotation, which allows these muscles to then act as stabilizers.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> LBP may also increase pelvic stiffness and thereby negatively affect the transfer of angular rotational velocities to the trunk further up the kinematic chain.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Our data support this possibility, as the LBP group had smaller incremental velocity from trunk to pelvis compared with the no pain group. Shooting motions require effective coordination of the timing and angular velocities of the proximal to distal segments to optimize ball speed. Variations in the timing or velocities can disrupt coordination and reduce performance.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Here, the timing of these velocities were not different, but the maximal angular velocities of the trunk were significantly lower during a throwing motion in participants with LBP. Additionally, total pelvis and shoulder ROM was significantly lower, suggesting that pain may not disrupt motion timing but rather induce a guarding effect on the lumbopelvic region restricting motion, which subsequently restricts angular velocities.</p><p>A striking finding was that greater low back NRS<sub>pain</sub> scores were related to a greater knee flexion angle (more knee bend). An interpretation of this finding is that bending more at the knee can provide additional stabilization during spine rotation in players with LBP. Limited evidence from lacrosse, softball, and tennis players shows that the coactivation of lower extremity muscle groups (biceps femoris, rectus femoris, gastrocnemius) and the core (rectus abdominis, external obliques, and lumbar erector spinae) is essential for stabilization of the lower body as the upper body rotates over the pelvis.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> LBP-related lumbar muscle strength deficiencies may foster greater knee flexion to improve the base of support during the throw. On the other hand, a secondary proposed reason for greater knee flexion (bend) is to allow a safe dissipation of linear forces. For many overhead sports, trunk flexion allows for the dissipation of forward linear motion, but with restricted lumbopelvic motion, a secondary compensation of knee flexion may allow for these linear forces to safely dissipate, similar to a follow-through. Additional research of the timing and magnitude of the lower extremity and core muscle activation in players with and without LBP would address this issue and provide therapeutic muscle targets for rehabilitation specialists and trainers who work with lacrosse players.</p><sec id="section17-2325967116657535"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>Some limitations and strengths of this study deserve comment. It is not yet clear whether mechanical deficiencies caused LBP or whether preexisting LBP changes the mechanics of the lacrosse throw. Dynamic strength values or endurance did not differ between the 2 groups, but we cannot rule out possible differences in muscle activation patterns that could overload the low back. Additional study of the electromyography patterns of the core and lower extremity muscles during the shot would be insightful. Other research groups indicate that sport motions that involve segmental rotations at the end of the ROM at high velocities may be an underlying mechanism for pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Epidemiological evidence suggests that exposure to high-velocity throwing or asymmetric loading sports over a lifetime or amount of practice contributes to the development of LBP.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-2325967116657535" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Additional prospective injury tracking simultaneous motion analysis would help address this question. A larger sample size of lacrosse players would permit stratification of LBP presence and severity among positions and training volume. An important point is that these motions were captured in a laboratory setting without the presence of game conditions such as defenders, time pressure, or throwing on the run. These real-time factors may increase the &#x0201c;stakes&#x0201d; of each shot and may increase the risk for injuries to occur.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section18-2325967116657535"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Lacrosse players with LBP have slower peak trunk angular velocities and greater knee flexion during a shot motion than players with no pain. Training and prehabilitation programs may be targeted to the lumbopelvic and core regions to help players with LBP maintain lacrosse shot motions and minimize or abolish pain. Future research should include prospective longitudinal research tracking LBP and throwing motion through a season to determine the relationship of pain onset to mechanics in this population.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-2325967116657535"><p>The authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest in the authorship and publication of this contribution.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2325967116657535"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
