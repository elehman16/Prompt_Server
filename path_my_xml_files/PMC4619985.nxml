The study also sought to determine if the intervention was effective in improving child dietary intake and increasing child physical activity levels while attending childcare.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A parallel group, randomised controlled trial was conducted in a sample of 128 childcare services. Intervention strategies included provision of implementation support staff, securing executive support, staff training, consensus processes, academic detailing visits, tools and resources, performance monitoring and feedback and a communications strategy. The primary outcome of the trial was the proportion of services implementing all seven healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices targeted by the intervention. Outcome data were collected via telephone surveys with nominated supervisors and room leaders at baseline and immediately post-intervention. Secondary trial outcomes included the differences between groups in the number of serves consumed by children for each food group within the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and in the proportion of children engaged in sedentary, walking or very active physical activity assessed via observation in a random subsample of 36 services at follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference between groups for the primary trial outcome (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.44). Relative to the control group, a significantly larger proportion of intervention group services reported having a written nutrition and physical activity policy (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) and providing adult-guided activities to develop fundamental movement skills (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01). There were no significant differences between groups at follow-up on measures of child dietary intake or physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of the trial were equivocal. While there was no significant difference between groups for the primary trial outcome, the intervention did significantly increase the proportion of intervention group services implementing two of the seven healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices. High levels of implementation of a number of policies and practices at baseline, significant obesity prevention activity in the study region and higher than previously reported intra-class correlation of child behaviours may, in part, explain the trial findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian Clinical Trials Registry (reference <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12612000927820">ACTRN12612000927820</ext-link>).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Obesity prevention</kwd><kwd>Healthy eating</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Childcare</kwd><kwd>Implementation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Overweight and obesity in childhood increases the likelihood of adult obesity and its comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes and certain cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Inadequate physical activity and poor nutrition are key risk factors for overweight and obesity, with such risk behaviours beginning to develop in the early years of a child&#x02019;s life, prior to commencing formal schooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As such, population-level interventions that aim to increase physical activity and improve diet quality during early childhood have been recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Childcare services are an important setting for the delivery of obesity prevention interventions, given their potential to support population-level improvements in child diet and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In countries such as Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom, over half of all children aged 0 to 5&#x000a0;years spend a large proportion of their waking hours each day in centre-based childcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Best practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] as well as standards for licensing and accreditation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] recommend that childcare services implement policies and practices known to improve the quality of children&#x02019;s diet and increase the time children spend being physically active while in care. Specifically, such guidelines recommend that services develop centre-based nutrition and physical activity policies, implement guidelines for foods brought from home or provided by the service, provide structured fundamental movement skill activities, ensure staff role model healthy eating and physical activity behaviours, limit the provision of sweetened drinks and limit opportunities for screen time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Such recommendations are supported by empirical research which suggests that implementation of such policies and practices improve child diet and physical activity while in care and can prevent excessive weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Despite evidence to support the effectiveness of such guidelines, research suggests that their implementation by childcare services is substandard. Studies from the United States found that less than 60&#x000a0;% of childcare services had a written physical activity policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] with some services providing food which contributed less than 17&#x000a0;% of children&#x02019;s recommended dietary intake for vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Similarly, Australian research suggests that less than 50&#x000a0;% of childcare services have a written physical activity policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], only 46&#x02013;60&#x000a0;% of services program time each day for fundamental movement skill development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and less than 5&#x000a0;% of childcare services provide adequate serves of vegetables, as recommended by national dietary guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Further, 25&#x000a0;% of Australian childcare services provide daily opportunities for sedentary screen time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], 48&#x000a0;% provide sweetened drinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and 60&#x000a0;% allow children to bring lunchboxes containing more than one serve of high fat, salt or sugary foods or drinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The authors are aware of three randomised controlled trials that have been conducted with the aim of increasing the implementation of healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices in childcare services. The trials were conducted from 2008 to 2014 in the United States and Australia and involved between 17 and 82 childcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Two of the trials sought to implement the United States Nutrition and Physical Activity Self-Assessment for Child Care program using a variety of implementation strategies including environmental self-assessment, selection of areas for change, educational workshops for childcare service staff and parents, targeted technical assistance, consultation visits and printed resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Evaluated using an environmental observation score, both failed to significantly increase service implementation of nutrition and physical activity practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], but one significantly improved the quantity and quality of service nutrition and physical activity policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The third trial delivered an intervention comprising of professional development for childcare staff, resources and access to health promotion staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Hardy and colleagues significantly increased the frequency of fundamental movement skill sessions, yet there were no between-group differences on five other measures of the physical activity environment nor was the intervention successful in achieving change to service food policies or in-service food activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>While several frameworks exist to guide the development and implementation of interventions to more effectively increase the implementation of policies and practices in childcare (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]), few randomised trials have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of implementation strategies in this setting. Implementation research conducted in clinical settings has found that trials utilising multiple intervention strategies and guided by theory are more likely to be effective in changing practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. More extended periods of intervention support have been recommended to increase effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, previous trials conducted in the childcare setting have either utilised a limited number of such strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] trialled interventions without the guidance of theoretical frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] or were delivered over a short period of time (less than 7&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Further two of the three studies delivered interventions to only a small number of childcare services (15 services or less), limiting their capacity to guide approaches aimed at achieving population-level service improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim of the trial was to assess whether a multicomponent intervention, delivered over 12&#x000a0;months was effective in increasing the proportion of centre-based childcare services implementing healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices. The study also sought to determine if the intervention was effective in improving child dietary intake and increasing child physical activity levels while attending childcare and, as a potential adverse effect, if it increased the occurrence of injury among staff or children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial was funded by the Australian National Preventive Health Agency (reference 95WOL2011) and was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (reference ACTRN12612000927820). Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Hunter New England (reference 12/08/15/5.01) and the University of Newcastle (reference H-2012-0321) human research ethics committees.

Services in the region were ineligible if they: catered exclusively for children requiring specialist care (less than 1&#x000a0;% of services), provided all on-site meals to children (approximately 30&#x000a0;% of services) or were fully government funded (approximately 3&#x000a0;% of services), as the ethical clearance and intervention design were not appropriate for such services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment procedures</title><p>Nominated supervisors (service managers) at all eligible services were contacted by a research assistant and invited to provide consent: (1) for their service to participate in the study, (2) for their own participation in a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) survey and (3) for one of their room leaders (head teacher caring for 3 to 5 year-old children) to be contacted and invited to participate in a CATI survey. A subsample of nominated supervisors were randomly selected by a research assistant using a random number function and invited to provide consent for their service to participate in a 1-day, post-intervention observation to assess child dietary intake and physical activity behaviours.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomisation and allocation</title><p>Following the completion of baseline data collection, childcare services were randomly allocated to either the intervention or control condition by a research assistant using a random number function in a 1:1 (intervention: control) ratio.

The 1-day observation was conducted during core service hours (9&#x000a0;am&#x02013;3&#x000a0;pm) in a random subsample of intervention and control group childcare services at follow-up. One of four trained observers attended each service to observe both child dietary intake and physical activity during the 1-day observation. Observers did not participate in the delivery of the intervention and were blind to service group allocation.</p><sec id="FPar2"><title>Child dietary intake</title><p>Secondary trial outcomes included the differences between groups at follow-up in the mean number of serves consumed by children for each food group within the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (vegetables, fruit, grains, meat and meat alternatives, milk, yoghurt and cheese and discretionary foods). Child dietary intake was assessed during the 1-day observation using a modified version of the Dietary Observation for Child Care protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The Dietary Observation for Child Care is a validated method for recording child-level dietary intake in 2 to 5 year-olds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and has been used extensively in the childcare setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].

This was recorded for every food or drink item supplied by parents in the child&#x02019;s lunchbox and offered to the child during the observation period. The children were randomly selected by asking the room leader at each service to identify the three children with the most recent birthdays. Following the completion of the observation, the numbers of serves for each of the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating food groups was generated by a qualified dietitian. The number of serves consumed for each food group was calculated using the weight of the food according to a nutrient database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and the standard serve size of the food according to the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].

Child physical activity levels were assessed at the same 1-day observation by the same observer, using a modified version of the System for Observing Play and Leisure in Youth (SOPLAY) tool and protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. SOPLAY is a standardised instrument for assessing physical activity levels in recreational settings using systematic, momentary time sampling of a predetermined area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. SOPLAY has been found to be both valid and reliable in school-aged children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and has been previously used to assess physical activity in the childcare setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The observer coded all structured physical activity and outdoor free play sessions that occurred between 9&#x000a0;am and 3&#x000a0;pm at each service. Prior to the commencement of each physical activity session, observers recorded key aspects of the physical environment including location (inside or outside), type of session (structured physical activity or free play), scan start time and any equipment available for use. During each scan, the observers assessed the level of child physical activity by counting the number of children engaged in sedentary, walking or very active physical activity in 10-min intervals for the duration of each session.</p><p>Observers were trained according to the standardised SOPLAY protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The SOPLAY assessment DVD was used to assess each observer&#x02019;s ability to independently scan and code physical activity levels quickly and accurately. Of the 28 video clips in the assessment, observers must have correctly counted the number of people engaged in either sedentary, walking or very active activity in each clip to receive one point.

First, the Australian Dietary Guidelines (including the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating) were revised and released in February 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Second, the National Accreditation Standards for the childcare sector (The National Quality Framework) came into effect in the 12&#x000a0;months prior to intervention delivery (January 2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition to government guidelines, two government-sponsored funded programs were identified. The first, a state-based program known as &#x0201c;Munch &#x00026; Move&#x0201d;, was implemented during the study period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Project records show that 80&#x000a0;% of intervention group services and 12&#x000a0;% of control group services attended training in healthy eating and physical activity provided by the &#x0201c;Munch &#x00026; Move&#x0201d; program during the study period. Secondly, Australia&#x02019;s largest community-based obesity prevention program, known as &#x0201c;Good for Kids.

The study did not find a significant intervention effect on the primary trial outcome, the proportion of intervention group services implementing all seven policies and practices. However, the intervention significantly increased the proportion of intervention group services implementing two of these policies and practices (written nutrition and physical activity policy and provision of adult-guided activities to develop fundamental movement skills) and the mean number of policies and practices implemented.</p><p>The study findings are similar to that of the previously conducted randomised controlled trials in the childcare setting. Ward and colleagues found a non-significant improvement of 11&#x000a0;% in service nutrition and physical activity environments, policies and practices; Hardy and colleagues demonstrated a significant improvement in the provision of one of the six physical activity practices targeted by the intervention (frequency of fundamental movement skills sessions per week increased from 1.3 to 3.2), and Alkon and colleagues found significant improvements in the quantity of service policies (mean policy score increased from 0.89 to 5.17 (nutrition) and 0 to 2.82 (physical activity)) but no improvement in any of the 14 nutrition and physical activity practices targeted by the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It was anticipated that the current trial would yield an improvement of at least 20&#x000a0;% in the primary trial outcome, given the substantial increase in the number of intervention components, the duration of intervention support relative to past interventions, and evidence of similar effects sizes for implementation interventions of similar intensities in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p><p>There are several factors that may have limited the effectiveness of the intervention on the primary trial outcome. First, the primary outcome was a composite measure, requiring implementation of all seven targeted policies and practices by services. However, five of the seven policies and practices were being implemented by 80&#x000a0;% or more of intervention group services at baseline, limiting scope for further improvements. Second, the trial did not exclude services who were already implementing all policies and practices at baseline (24&#x000a0;% of intervention services). For these services, the benefit of further intervention is likely to be minimal. Third, at follow-up, the proportion of control services implementing all policies and practices increased by 17&#x000a0;%. Such substantial improvement in implementation in control groups has not been reported by other trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Context evaluation suggests that co-intervention in the control group and other important contextual factors such as the introduction of national dietary guidelines and the National Accreditation Standards occurring at the time of the trial may have facilitated policy and practice implementation in the control group, reducing the likelihood of an intervention effect. Finally, some policies and practices were particularly difficult for some services to implement. Anecdotally, for example, implementation support staff reported that most services that were not providing feedback to parents when non-compliant foods were packed found this practice to be particularly challenging, citing concerns about adverse reactions from parents.</p><p>In the context of the limited impact of the intervention on implementation of policies and practices, it is perhaps unsurprising that the intervention did not yield significant improvements in child dietary intake or physical activity levels in care. However, while non-significant, the effect size achieved for child very active physical activity (&#x0003e;4&#x000a0;%) and fruit intake (&#x0003e;1/3 of a serve) was consistent with the effect size on which the study had been powered to detect a priori. However, the ICC found in this study was far higher (0.34 for physical activity and 0.11 for fruit) than that which was predicted for the study (0.02) on which sample size calculations were based. The high ICC substantially reduced the effective sample size of the current study. Future studies using similar observational procedures to assess child diet and physical activity may require larger samples in order to detect clinically meaningful effects.</p><p>Strengths of the study include the trial&#x02019;s randomised design, delivery of the intervention to a large population of childcare services, high study retention and the inclusion of child behavioural measurements at follow-up. The inclusion of a comprehensive set of process measures also provided a rich source of information to interpret the study findings. However, a number of study limitations are worth noting. First, the study relied on the self-report of nominated supervisors and room leaders for the measurement of service policies and practices, which may have introduced biases such as social desirability bias. While the survey items have been validated in a sample of Australian childcare services, a number of practices had only slight, fair or moderate agreement (kappa &#x0003c;0.6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Future studies should look to conduct a more rigorous assessment of implementation, such as direct observation of service policies and practices. Second, the trial did not measure change in perceived barriers and enablers to implementing the policies and practices and, as such, any mechanisms that may have facilitated the outcome of the intervention could not be investigated. Third, the intervention was multi-component and the effectiveness of the individual intervention strategies was unable to be determined. Future studies could examine the effectiveness of individual intervention strategies. Fourth, process evaluation did not include an assessment of the timing of when childcare services implemented each policy or practice. As such, the exposure of individual children to each policy and practice is unknown, preventing any assessment of the impact of such exposure on child healthy eating and physical activity. Fifth, the study assessed child dietary intake and physical activity levels on one&#x000a0;day at follow-up. Repeated dietary intake and physical activity observations conducted over multiple days may provide a more robust measure of these behaviours during attendance at childcare. Sixth, the study did not include services that provide on-site meals to children. Future research may consider evaluating the impact of an intervention targeting food-provision practices specific to such childcare services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite the limitations, the study represents an important contribution to the limited literature regarding the implementation of obesity prevention interventions in the childcare setting. The findings demonstrate that, among a group of services where policy and practice implementation was generally high at baseline, the investment of significant implementation support to achieve &#x0201c;best practice&#x0201d; implementation may not yield significant improvements in the proportion of services achieving this goal. Investment in implementation support, therefore, may be better directed at services where policies and practice implementation is poorer initially, and where they may be greater scope for improvement. Future research to test the effectiveness of the intervention on such services is warranted. Given the high acceptability of the intervention strategies, prospective interventions may consider utilising strategies that best address the reported barriers to policy and practice implementation. For example, the addition of intervention strategies to garner the support for healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices by parents and carers may improve the effectiveness of future interventions, given their influence on service operation and activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Finally, the intervention did improve some policies and practices, including the implementation of adult-guided activities to develop fundamental movement skills in children. An improvement in the implementation of fundamental movement skills activities was also noted in a randomised trial by Hardy and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Common to both interventions was staff training, resources and the use of implementation support staff. Such findings suggest that these intervention strategies may be particularly effective in supporting the implementation of this practice and should be retained in future interventions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>The first author JJ led the development of this manuscript.
