All game-related injuries and hours of game participation were recorded.

The lower limb was the most frequent body region injured, accounting for 50% of injuries overall, 96 (12%) of which were knee injuries.

While not statistically significant, reducing the knee injury rate by 50% and the LLI rate by 22% is still a clinically important outcome. Further injury reductions could be achieved with improved training attendance and participation in the programme.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Team-based exercise training programmes have become a popular method for delivering injury prevention at the club level in many sports. Until recently, evaluation of the benefits of such programmes has largely been undertaken in efficacy studies involving highly controlled or laboratory-based settings, thereby providing limited knowledge of real-world benefits.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Since the gap in research demonstrating the effectiveness of these programmes was recognised, there has been an increase in the number of investigations directly in the non-elite, community sport setting.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Recent systematic reviews summarising the effectiveness of training programmes for reducing injuries in team sport have identified varying outcomes for injury reduction.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;6</xref> The variation is attributed to a range of factors, including participant age and sex, level of competition, the type of components included in the programme and compliance with the programme. As such, specific investigations towards understanding the effectiveness of injury prevention training programmes for different sports settings is now required.</p><p>Australian football (AF) is one of the most popular team sports in Australia. At the community sport level, AF is played by all age groups, men and women. Adult male participants (generally between 18 years and 30&#x02005;years old) commonly play in a weekend game, with training sessions once or twice weekly over 5&#x02013;6&#x02005;months of the year. The game is played at a fast pace, with players subject to continuous running, bursts of sprinting, sudden changes of direction, frequent jumping/landing and heavy physical contact. These characteristic movements of AF also present players with a high risk of injury.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Although the collection and quality of injury data in community AF is limited,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> the burden of AF injury is large, it being ranked one of the highest of all team sports leading to hospital treated injury.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The lower limb is the most common body region injured in AF with the knee consistently reported as one of the most frequently injured body parts.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> These injuries have high personal costs, leading to reduced or ceased participation, long-term degenerative joint damage and ongoing pain.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> Interventions aimed at preventing all lower limb injuries (LLIs) are needed to support the long-term health and well-being of players and enable promotion of the positive health benefits gained from participation.</p><p>The Preventing Australian Football Injuries through eXercise (PAFIX) study was a clustered randomised controlled trial (cRCT) in community AF aimed at reducing the number of LLIs, particularly knee injuries.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Players from clubs assigned to the intervention arm undertook a programme of progressive, targeted exercises as part of their regular training sessions (a neuromuscular control (NMC) programme), beginning in the preseason and continuing throughout the competition-season. The second group (control) of clubs/players was provided with a sham exercise programme that replicated common training practices in community AF.</p><p>This paper presents the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the cRCT results in relation to whether the training programme led to a reduction in the rate of knee injuries or LLIs in games.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was designed according to the CONSORT statement (refer to online supplementary appendix 1).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The study rationale, design and full protocol have been previously published.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The specific content and delivery of the trialled exercise training programme content have also been published.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Minor amendments to the original study protocol<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> were needed to adjust for procedural challenges that were encountered when implementing the trial. These amendments, structured around the CONSORT statement components,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> are outlined in online supplementary appendix 2 and all published and procedural documents are available online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pafixproject.wordpress.com">http://www.pafixproject.wordpress.com</ext-link>).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Community male AF clubs from two Australian states participated in the PAFIX trial over an 8-week preseason period and an 18-week playing season (26&#x02005;weeks total), in 2007 or 2008.

In short, players were included if they were registered to play for one of the participating teams, were at least 18&#x02005;years of age and attended at least one training session in the first 13&#x02005;weeks of the programme. Players from either group who did not train in the first 13&#x02005;weeks (the point of transition from early season to mid-season) were excluded from analyses as they had not been exposed to a sufficient degree of the intervention; this was determined to be a reasonable failure-to-start exclusion that still met the criteria of an ITT analysis.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The total number of players recruited into PAFIX was 1691. Of these, 751 were allocated to the NMC group with 679 retained for analysis (ie, met all inclusion criteria) and 940 players were allocated to the control group, from which 885 were retained. The total number of players included for analysis was 1564 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="INJURYPREV2015041667F1">figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention</title><p>Players from the NMC and control groups participated in a set of training exercises as part of their regular training programme twice per week.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The researchers trained team-based primary data collectors (PDCs) to deliver the prescribed exercises to the participating players. The NMC group received a programme of evidence-based neuromuscular and biomechanical exercises specifically targeted at reducing LLI, while the control group was provided with a &#x02018;sham&#x02019; programme of exercises similar to those regularly undertaken at training.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Neither the players, clubs nor PDCs were aware of what programme those in the other study condition received.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data collection and coding</title><p>Each player participated over a 26-week period in 2007 or 2008. In this time, the PDC recorded the number of training sessions attended, the number of games played, the number of game hours played and the number of injuries sustained. An injury was defined as something that caused a player to seek medical attention (on or off the field) or to leave the field of play. Injury details were recorded by the PDC from observation and later confirmed with the player and medical staff where available. The injury definition and data collection procedures have been described elsewhere and shown to be reliable.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Training sessions in AF last for around 1.5&#x02005;h with both programmes designed to take no more than the first 20&#x02005;min of that time.</p><p>Consistent with the CONSORT statement,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> an ITT analysis was performed. Injury incidence rates (IIRs) for all injury, all LLI and knee injury only were calculated for all players combined, as well as separately for the NMC and control groups. The estimated IIR was calculated as the number of injuries sustained divided by the exposure measure (game hours played.) For each IIR, a 95% CI was calculated assuming Poisson errors. The IIRs in the NMC (IIR-NMC) and control (IIR-CONTROL) groups were compared by calculating the IRR as IRR=IIR-NMC/IIR-CONTROL and the 95% CI as , where SE(ln(IRR)) is the IRR's SD.</p><p>To adjust for clustering effects (measured by the intraclass correlation (ICC)) associated with the sampling of teams within the clubs or states that may have influenced injury rates, a Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE) with Poisson distribution, log link function and an exchangeable autocorrelation structure was fitted to the injury rate data. The GEE assessed the effectiveness of the training programme in reducing the rate of injuries in games. Specifically, assessment of reduction in knee injuries sustained during games was undertaken as that was how the study was initially powered. Since the data were somewhat zero-inflated, a GEE with negative binomial distribution and exchangeable correlation structure was also fitted to account for overdispersion. As this obtained similar results to the first GEE model its results are not presented. The dependent variable was the player-specific IIR, with the trial arm included as an indicator factor and the football club effect nested within the state factor to account for clustering effects. Results for the GEE models are expressed as IRRs with 95% CIs and interpreted as the percentage change in IIR between the NMC and the control groups. To further confirm the modelling results, bootstrapping (which used repeated draws with replacement from the observed sample to create simulated samples) was undertaken and no significant difference to the main GEE results was found. Post hoc power calculations were based on Hayes&#x02019; method.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>All data were originally double-entered into a database.

The cluster-adjusted knee injury IRR was marginally not significant and indicated that knee injury rates were 50% lower in the NMC group, compared with control players.</p><p>For each injury category, the cluster adjustment led to smaller IIRs, in favour of the NMC intervention.

A lower, but not statistically significant, rate of knee injury and LLI overall was observed in players allocated to a specific programme of NMC training exercises compared with those allocated to a standard-practice sham exercise programme. Players who undertook the NMC programme had a 22% reduction in LLI rates and a 50% reduction in knee injury rates, when adjusted for exposure and clustering. These are important and highly clinically relevant outcomes given the frequency and associated costs of LLI arising from AF games, and the priority needs for prevention.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> With growing evidence of the effectiveness of targeted exercise training programmes for injury prevention in other sports, this study provides the first support for such programmes in men's community AF.</p><p>The NMC programme was associated with improved LLI and knee injury rates. There was no significant difference in the all-injury rate across the two trial arms. This was to be expected as the exercise components and the PAFIX trial were specifically designed to address knee injury rather than all types of injury.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Since the PAFIX trial was first designed, it has become apparent that the same intervention exercise programme components could potentially reduce the risk of all LLIs, not just knee injuries.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> For this reason, this paper considers the rate reductions in both groups of injury types.</p><p>The injury patterns reported in this study are generally consistent with those reported in previous studies of men's AF with the most frequent injured body parts being the upper leg/thigh and knee.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, the proportion of all injuries to the knee was lower than that expected when the study sample size calculations were made (12% of all observed injuries, compared with the anticipated 33%). Post hoc power calculations indicate that the study was underpowered for all comparisons, but least so for the comparison of knee injury rates. Nonetheless, the observed reductions in knee injuries are highly significant from a clinical sports medicine point of view and have important implications for the design of future exercise training programmes in AF.</p><p>A number of features of injury prevention programmes influence injury outcomes and these can vary according to the participants of the study (eg, sex, age, level of play).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Most previous trials of the benefits of injury prevention exercise programmes in sport have been undertaken in female youth participating in soccer,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> with just a few focused on adult male participants at a community (non-elite) level.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> It is important to establish effectiveness in specific participant populations such as men as they comprise the majority of participants in many sports and certainly in AF. The current study adds new evidence about the effectiveness of injury prevention programmes in male community sports participants.</p><p>It is important for players to be compliant with prevention programmes for them to reduce injury rates.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Given that many players in PAFIX did not train regularly and most did not attend the two weekly sessions intended as part of the programme,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> the ITT assessment of reduction in LLI rates in games is likely to have underestimated the true effect of the NMC programme. It is possible that a stronger intervention effect might have been identified if we had employed a per-protocol analysis<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and this will be of interest in future work. While the frequency of exposure to the training programme could be quantified,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> the quality of the actual exercise performance and programme fidelity were not formally measured. Ideally, frequency and quality of training should be captured, and linked to the injury outcomes, to provide stronger evidence of a connection between players who train, those who train well and players who do or do not get injured.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Injury prevention programmes should have specific components or exercises that effectively target LLI, including knee injuries, commonly seen in the sport.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Our NMC programme was designed based on detailed knowledge of the LLIs sustained in men in AF,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The developed NMC programme also has the potential to be transferable to other sports requiring change of direction, balance and landing tasks as skills to reduce injury risk.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39&#x02013;41</xref></p><p>In addition to high reliability and completeness of data collection,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> this cRCT has a number of other strengths. The group randomisation covered multiple clubs in different geographical locations that are representative of players in community AF. Injury rates are known to vary at different times of the season so data were collected over the entire preseason and playing season. Community AF players often join or leave a club at any stage so our criteria allowed inclusion up to 13&#x02005;weeks, covering the preseason and start of the competition season, to enable time for players to be included in the trial, whether it was the NMC or the control arm. Injury rates were calculated on a per exposure basis, thereby accounting for players who were not present at every game or training session and, as such, did not contribute to the group of players at risk of injury. Allocation to the NMC and the control trial arms was blinded to PDCs, players, data coders and data analysts. This means that the PAFIX cRCT was as close as possible to a true double-blind trial, which is seldom reported in sports injury prevention studies. Finally, this study has adopted a very high standard of methodological reporting and analysis, which demonstrates the need to cluster-adjust results and report post hoc power calculations.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that the preseason baseline survey, aimed at collecting player characteristic information (eg, playing history, level of play, age and previous injury history), was only administered to, and completed by, around 50% of players. This was the only time where date of birth was recorded, so players' were excluded from the analysis when their age could not be confirmed. Likewise, comparison of pre-existing injuries was available only for the same, non-random subset of players. Although there is a lack of baseline data concerning the players' general health and injury history, the wide sampling of players from 18 teams in two different states means that the included players are likely to be an accurate representation of AF players in community leagues across Australia.</p><p>In conclusion, this ITT analysis indicates that clinically relevant reduced knee injury and LLI rates can be achieved through targeted exercise training programmes in men's community AF. The results should be considered alongside a range of additional issues including player compliance with the programme, since the preventive effect of the current programme was probably affected by low rates of programme reach and adoption.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> However, this study adds value to the growing evidence in support of targeted exercise training programmes for injury reductions in community level sport.
