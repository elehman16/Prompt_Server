Worldwide, injuries are a leading cause of death and disability for youth (Peden, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), with 20 million children suffering unintentional injuries annually in the United States alone (Grossman, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Countless children across the globe also experience illnesses that involve disruptive, painful, and potentially traumatic disease episodes and treatment procedures (Marks &#x00026; McQueen, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). For many children, it is not physical recovery but psychosocial sequelae that determine functioning after acute traumatic events. A meta-analysis of medical traumatic stress studies found that an average of 19% children with injuries and 12% children with illness experience significant posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following their medical event (Kahana, Feeny, Youngstrom, &#x00026; Drotar, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). PTSS are a key predictor of functional outcome and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), may interfere with adherence to medical regimens, and have been linked to poorer health outcomes (Graham-Bermann &#x00026; Seng, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Holbrook et al., <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Landolt, Buehlmann, Maag, &#x00026; Schiestl, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Landolt, Vollrath, Gnehm, &#x00026; Sennhauser, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Zatzick et al., <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Thus, PTSS resulting from medical events are a major health concern for children.</p><p>While research has suggested risk and protective factors and mechanisms involved in the development of psychological symptoms following medical trauma, this knowledge has not been translated into widely available preventive interventions (Sabin, Zatzick, Jurkovich, &#x00026; Rivara, <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ziegler, Greenwald, DeGuzman, &#x00026; Simon, <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The Internet provides a low-cost, accessible method for delivery of psychological and health information and interventions. More than 75% of US and European children have Internet access at home (Child Trends DataBank, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Livingstone &#x00026; Haddon, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Furthermore, there is growing empirical support for the efficacy of using the Internet to deliver cognitive behavior interventions to children and parents (Magee, Ritterband, Thorndike, Cox, &#x00026; Borowitz, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; March, Spence, &#x00026; Donovan, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Ruzek et al., <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Spence et al., <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Spence, Holmes, March, &#x00026; Lipp, <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In particular, Internet interventions have demonstrated efficacy in delivering education and intervention to large numbers of individuals exposed to traumatic events (e.g., military service members; Ruzek et al., <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Beyond their broad accessibility, Internet-facilitated interventions may also represent a potentially cost-efficient avenue for the delivery of preventive psychosocial care in the acute phase posttrauma (Mouthaan, Sijbrandij, Reitsma, Gersons, &#x00026; Olff, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Web-based preventive interventions have the potential to provide children and parents with accessible, just-in-time psycho-education and practical tools for coping with the aftermath of a traumatic medical event.</p><p>Coping Coach is an innovative and interactive e-health application that aims to prevent persistent traumatic stress and promote emotional recovery in school-age children after an acute traumatic event. Content and interactive activities were developed for the intervention based on evidence regarding the etiology of traumatic stress, risk and protective pathways, and effective interventions for trauma and anxiety in children.</p><sec id="S0001"><title>Targets for preventive intervention</title><p>Risk and etiological variables associated with children's psychological reactions after exposure to acute traumatic events include pretrauma factors (pre-existing trauma exposure or psychological symptoms); peri-trauma factors (perceived life threat, acute heart rate, and physiological arousal), and posttrauma factors (acute stress reactions, maladaptive cognitive appraisals, types of coping Bryant, Salmon, Sinclair, &#x00026; Davidson, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2007a</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Ehlers, Mayou, &#x00026; Bryant, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Kahana et al., <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Kassam-Adams, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Landolt, Vollrath, &#x00026; Ribi, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Salmon, Sinclair, &#x00026; Bryant, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Zehnder, Prchal, Vollrath, &#x00026; Landolt, <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). While pre-existing factors are not amenable to change, malleable posttrauma etiological factors provide an opportunity for secondary prevention programs to enhance adjustment (i.e., improve HRQOL) and reduce the development or escalation of psychological symptoms (Graham-Bermann &#x00026; Seng, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Holbrook et al., <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Landolt, Vollrath, Gnehm, &#x00026; Sennhauser, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Zatzick et al., <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Potential malleable targets for the prevention of posttraumatic stress in children that are supported by research evidence include negative appraisals about safety and vulnerability to future harm (Bryant et al., <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2007a</xref>; Ehlers et al., <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Meiser-Stedman, Dalgleish, Glucksman, Yule, &#x00026; Smith, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), the coping strategy of seeking social support (Stallard, Velleman, Langsford, &#x00026; Baldwin, <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), and early avoidance behaviors (Ebata &#x00026; Moos, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Given the strong support for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral theory (CBT) interventions to treat mood and anxiety symptoms in children and teens (Cohen &#x00026; Mannarino, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Kenardy, Spence, &#x00026; Macleod, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; March et al., <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; O'Kearney, Kang, Christensen, &#x00026; Griffiths, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Spence et al., <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), secondary prevention may also benefit from a CBT approach. Coping Coach uses CBT principles, integrating interactive activities and content, to address each malleable intervention target (i.e., appraisals, social support, avoidance behaviors) in the early posttrauma period.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Web-based health interventions</title><p>Web-based programs have improved symptom management and adherence to medical regimens for asthma, pain, encopresis, and obesity in children (Stinson, Wilson, Gill, Yamada, &#x00026; Holt, <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, children, and adolescents (Kenardy et al., <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; O'Kearney et al., <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). For example, BRAVE-Online, a cognitive-behavioral intervention for children with anxiety disorders, has shown efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms in up to 75% of youth users at follow-up (March et al., <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Spence et al., <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Spence et al., <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). To date, the only web-based preventive intervention that has shown promise in preventing psychological symptoms in children exposed to medical trauma is &#x0201c;Kids and Accidents,&#x0201d; designed by Kenardy and colleagues (Cox &#x00026; Kenardy, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). This intervention combined print information for parents with a basic, informational website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kidsaccident.psy.uq.edu.au">kidsaccident.psy.uq.edu.au</ext-link>) for youth. An initial randomized controlled trial (RCT) (<italic>N=</italic>56) showed not only a reduction of anxiety and a trend for reduced PTS symptoms among higher risk children but also suggested a need for greater engagement of children with site activities (Cox &#x00026; Kenardy, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Given the success of BRAVE-online with its interactive features, it may be that increasing the interactive nature of Kids and Accidents could improve its effectiveness. Much remains unknown about optimizing content and implementing web-based preventive interventions for youth exposed to acute medical trauma. A thorough evaluation of web-based interventions, such as Coping Coach, can help improve understanding about the most potent intervention targets.</p></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Current study</title><p>We created the Coping Coach intervention to address the unmet need of supporting children emotionally following acute traumatic events. In this paper, we describe the design of a RCT evaluating the impact of the Coping Coach intervention on proximal targets (coping, appraisals) and later child health outcomes (PTSS, HRQOL). Specific objectives for the RCT are three-fold: (1) to determine whether the intervention will be used as intended; (2) to examine the feasibility of study procedures; and (3) to estimate efficacy to determine the sample size needed for an outcome evaluation study. In this paper, we share the design of this RCT, including strengths and limitations, with the intention of informing future study designs for web-based intervention research.</p></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Coping Coach intervention description</title><p>Coping Coach utilizes an interactive, developmentally appropriate, game-like format to provide practical information and teach children adaptive coping strategies. The intervention is developed for the early posttrauma period and will be implemented as a novel, cost-effective, and widely accessible delivery mechanism&#x02014;the Internet. Children are primary users of the intervention, with parents providing supervision. Coping Coach contains three modules (focusing on feelings identification, appraisals, and avoidance) that are used sequentially, and an adventure log that spans all modules. Identifying and using social support is folded throughout the intervention, as children engage with characters and provide and receive help and support. Each module can be completed in 20&#x02013;30 min and can be repeated to solidify skills and learning. The feelings module targets recognition and communication of emotions after potentially traumatic experiences. The appraisals module teaches the &#x0201c;cognitive triad&#x0201d; including the relationship of helpful or unhelpful thoughts to feelings and behavior. The avoidance module aims to reduce reliance on avoidance as a coping response. The adventure log encourages children to personalize their learning to their own experience and reinforces the skills in each module. Every module of Coping Coach requires the child to interact with the game content, going beyond information provision, with the aim of children learning through experience. While children are primary users of Coping Coach, parents are encouraged to support their child's engagement in Coping Coach. The website which presents the game for children also provides information for parents about how and when to seek professional help for their child.

We define an acute medical event as a sudden, unexpected, and new medical event for a child (i.e., new injury or illness diagnosis, or a sudden exacerbation of a chronic condition). Inclusion criteria for this study are the following: (1) child is aged 8&#x02013;12 years; (2) child has experienced an acute medical event within the past 2 weeks; (3) child perceives the event as potentially traumatic, based on a brief set of validated screening questions administered prior to enrollment (i.e., meeting DSM-IV A2 criteria; <italic>see Assessments</italic>); (4) child's Glasgow Coma Score is greater than 12; (5) child speaks English well enough to complete measures and understand the intervention; and (6) child has access at home to the Internet and telephone. Exclusion criteria are the following: (1) child's current medical condition or cognitive limitations preclude participating; (2) child's acute medical event is due to family violence or suspected child abuse; (3) child or parent has been arrested or is subject to legal proceedings related to the medical event; and (4) in the index event, child or parent was a perpetrator of violence.</p></sec><sec id="S20007"><title>Study design</title><p>Once eligibility is established and consent and assent are obtained, participants will complete baseline measures and then be randomized to either the intervention or waitlist control condition. At the beginning of the study, a random number generator will be used to determine the order of the randomization (intervention condition=35; waitlist control condition=35). Research staff (who will not be enrolling participants) will prepare sealed envelopes, which will only be opened upon the completion of the baseline measures. Those in the intervention condition will complete an initial Coping Coach activity and receive log-in instructions to complete the remaining activities online over the next month. Those in the waitlist control condition will receive log-in instructions for Coping Coach following the 12-week assessment. Follow-up assessments will be conducted with all participants over the phone at 6, 12, and 18 weeks post-baseline.

Children who meet initial eligibility criteria and their caregivers will be approached by a member of the research team who will explain the study and invite participation in screening. After verbal consent and assent are obtained to participate in the screening phase of the study, we will collect basic demographic information and the child will complete four questions (subjective rating of the event as potentially traumatic). If the child's responses indicate that the event is perceived as potentially traumatic, the child is eligible for the RCT portion of the study (see <italic>Assessments</italic>). Those eligible will be offered participation in the full study, will provide written consent and assent, and will complete baseline measures (i.e., demographics, child trauma history, coping and coping assistance, cognitions and appraisals, HRQOL, and PTSS). Subsequently, participants will be randomized to one of two study conditions: 35 to the intervention and 35 to waitlist control.</p><p>Those in the intervention condition will complete the first module of Coping Coach (i.e., feelings identification) and will receive log-in instructions to complete the intervention online over the following month. After the 12-week assessment, those in the waitlist control condition will receive log-in instructions. Between baseline and 6 weeks, parents and children in the intervention group will receive tailored weekly reminders via email, text, or phone to encourage children to complete the remaining Coping Coach activities. Between 12 and 18 weeks, participants in the waitlist control condition will receive these reminders. Follow-ups will be conducted with all participants at approximately 6, 12, and 18 weeks post-baseline assessment via the telephone, by research assistants blinded to the child's study condition. Follow-up assessments include measures of coping and coping assistance, cognitions and appraisals, HRQOL, and PTSS. Measures of intervention satisfaction and engagement will be administered separately at either 6 or 18 weeks, depending on the intervention condition.

Within the constraints of a pilot study, there will be reasonable power to detect a clinically meaningful effect for proximal outcomes (appraisals and coping at 6 weeks) and child health outcomes (PTSS and HRQOL at 12 and 18 weeks). With a sample of 70 participants (35 randomized to each condition), we project that we will have 60 (85%) retained to all follow-up assessments. With this sample size, a difference of 0.5 SD between conditions [based on an Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)] with 80% power, while controlling for <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> =0.05, can be detected.</p></sec><sec id="S20031"><title>Data analysis</title><p>ANCOVA is the primary analytic approach for examining outcomes and for initial estimation of effect sizes. ANCOVA can adjust for baseline differences between groups (intervention vs. waitlist control), as imbalances may occur despite randomization. The dependent variable in each ANCOVA will be a 6-week proximal outcome or a 12- or 18-week child health outcome, the corresponding baseline score of the outcome measure will be the covariate, and group (condition) will be the qualitative factor. Other covariates that may help explain variation in intervention effects (e.g., age, gender, prior trauma, and parent PTSS) will be considered for inclusion in these analyses. Multivariable regression analysis will also be used to examine the hypothesized role of proximal outcomes in predicting each health outcome. An intent-to-treat approach will be applied to help handle missing data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S0032"><title>Discussion</title><p>The high prevalence and significant impact of acute traumas on children's functioning warrant innovative approaches of delivering effective secondary prevention of psychosocial sequelae. Coping Coach translates research on etiology and malleable risk and protective factors into a novel web-based intervention. The intervention integrates evidence-based components of CBT techniques and Internet interventions, applying these to prevention by targeting early appraisals, coping, and support-seeking. Coping Coach is designed to require interaction with the game content to facilitate engagement and learning. The current RCT will provide us with pilot data to prepare for a larger-scale evaluation of Coping Coach. Specifically, this study will examine the feasibility of the Coping Coach intervention as well as the study procedures. In addition, the current RCT represents a unique opportunity to estimate the efficacy of Coping Coach in promoting positive child health outcomes and preventing or reducing negative psychological sequelae. Toward this goal we will examine proximal outcomes of appraisals and coping along with long-term child health outcomes, PTSS and HRQOL. We expect that the results of this RCT will augment the existing literature by producing new information (pilot data) on the effectiveness of web-based preventive interventions for children after acute medical trauma.</p><p>Among the strengths of this study is its incorporation of assessments with both children and parents to evaluate clinically meaningful short- and long-term effects of Coping Coach. Data from this RCT will help to refine our program theory and potentially modify existing conceptual models for the development of psychological symptoms after an acute medical event (i.e., hypothesized etiological mechanisms). This RCT will also enable us to estimate effect sizes for proximal and child health outcomes and inform modifications of Coping Coach prior to a larger scale trial. The electronic tracking built into the study design allows us to examine actual completion of the intervention modules to determine if there is a necessary minimum intervention &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; and allows us to evaluate how children interact with game content. Finally, this RCT will allow us to evaluate factors that may impact child engagement and adherence and to identify ways to increase potency of intervention effects.</p><p>Possible limitations of this RCT include technical difficulties that may be experienced by participants. To meet this challenge, we have worked to ensure accessibility and functionality of the intervention. Another potential limitation is that some participants may not finish all intervention modules after discharge from the hospital. We will attempt to minimize this by sending tailored, weekly reminders to children and families and providing a small incentive for children who complete all Coping Coach modules. In addition, we will track the completion of the intervention electronically, so that we will be able to determine what intervention components were completed by each participant. Other potential limitations include recruitment challenges or possible sampling bias. We will attempt to prevent this by closely monitoring weekly recruitment and retention rates. We will adjust strategies as needed to achieve recruitment targets, and address any significant deviations of sample demographics from the pool of eligible patients.</p><p>If results suggest that Coping Coach can prevent emotional sequelae and improve child health outcomes, the intervention would provide a promising avenue to help children cope in the aftermath of a traumatic medical event. Given its web-based modality, Coping Coach can provide widely accessible tools to promote positive child health outcomes. In addition, Coping Coach could be provided as a resource that physicians, mental health professionals, social workers, and teachers could recommend for children at risk for PTSS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge Aimee Hildenbrand and Melissa Morrison for their contributions to this manuscript.</p></ack><sec id="S0033"><title>Conflict of interest and funding</title><p>There is no conflict of interest in the present study for any of the authors.
