We evaluated whether decolonization was similarly effective in a lower risk hospitalized population.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a 2 arm cluster-randomized trial involving a 1-year baseline period (April 2013&#x02013;March 2014)&#x000a0;and a 21-month intervention period (June 2014&#x02013;February 2016). All noncritical care units in a hospital were assigned to the same strategy. These were (1) Routine Care: routine bathing product and frequency and (2) Decolonization: CHG for routine daily bathing (2% leave-on CHG) or showering (4% rinse-off CHG) for all patients plus mupirocin for 5&#x000a0;days for known MRSA. Universal ICU decolonization was in place in both arms by September 2013. Differences between the arms in the outcome rates between the baseline and intervention periods were assessed with proportional hazards models, using shared frailties to account for clustering by hospital. The primary analysis was as-randomized and unadjusted. Primary outcome was any MRSA or VRE clinical isolate attributable to the unit. Secondary outcome was all-cause bloodstream infections. Additional analyses adjusted for age, gender, race, Medicaid insurer, surgery, and comorbidities.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>We randomized 53 hospitals in 15 states. There were 194 adult units with 189,616 admissions in the baseline period and 340,350 in the intervention period. Common unit types included mixed medical surgical (30%), cardiac (20%), step-down (11%), medical (10%), surgical (10%), and oncology (4%). There were no significant differences between arms in the relative hazards for intervention vs. baseline for either outcome (Table and Figure). Adjusted analyses yielded similar results.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx162_IF0063"/></fig><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx162_IF0064"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Universal daily CHG bathing or showering plus targeted mupirocin for MRSA+ patients in non-critical care units did not reduce the combination of positive MRSA and VRE clinical cultures or bloodstream infections due to all pathogens. Further analyses to assess for any differential effects in high-risk subpopulations will be important.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Disclosures</title><p>
