Denosumab reduces bone resorption by targeting the receptor activator of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B ligand. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of denosumab in Indian postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this double-blind, multicenter, phase 3 study, 250 Indian postmenopausal women aged 55 to 75 years (T-score &#x0003c;-2.5 and &#x0003e;-4.0 at the lumbar spine or total hip; serum 25(OH) D levels &#x02265;20 ng/mL) were randomized to receive one subcutaneous dose of denosumab 60 mg or placebo. All subjects received oral calcium &#x02265;1000 mg and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> &#x02265; 400 IU daily. The primary end point was mean percent change in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine from baseline to Month 6. Secondary end points included mean percent change from baseline in BMD at total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter at Month 6 and median percent change from baseline in bone turnover markers at Months 1, 3, and 6.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Total 225 subjects (denosumab = 111, placebo = 114) completed the six-month study. Baseline demographics were similar between groups. A 3.1% (95% confidence interval, 1.9%, 4.2%) increase favoring denosumab versus placebo was seen for the primary end point (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Denosumab demonstrated a significant treatment benefit over placebo for the secondary end points. There were no fractures or withdrawals due to adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Consistent with results from studies conducted in other parts of the world, denosumab was well tolerated and effective in increasing BMD and decreasing bone turnover markers over a six-month period in Indian postmenopausal women.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bone mineral density</kwd><kwd>bone turnover markers</kwd><kwd>denosumab</kwd><kwd>India</kwd><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>postmenopausal</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that prevents receptor activator of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B ligand (RANKL) from binding to its receptor.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] By this mechanism, denosumab reduces bone resorption and increases bone mineral density (BMD).

Exclusion criteria included bone metabolic diseases other than osteoporosis, current hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, malabsorption syndrome, or prior treatment with drugs that alter bone metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency also precluded entry into the study; subjects with vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25(OH) D&#x0003c;20 ng/mL in this study) could be repleted and rescreened prior to study entry. Medications known or suspected to have activity on bone metabolism (other than calcium and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>), such as bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone, systemic hormone replacement therapy, calcitriol, or calcitonin were prohibited during the study. Other concomitant treatment could be prescribed if deemed necessary by the investigator to provide adequate supportive care. Subjects could withdraw from the study at any time, either by decision of the subject or at the discretion of the investigator, and withdrawn subjects were not replaced.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>After a screening phase of up to 2.5 months, subjects were randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of either denosumab 60 mg (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) or matching placebo and assessed for six months. Subjects received study treatment at baseline, and follow-up visits were scheduled at Months 1, 3, and 6 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

Fracture probabilities at baseline were computed using FRAX, a computer-based algorithm designed to estimate 10-year fracture probability (hip, clinical spine, humerus, or wrist fracture) based on clinical risk factors (body mass index [BMI], prior history of fracture, parental history of hip fracture, use of oral glucocorticoids, rheumatoid arthritis and other secondary causes of osteoporosis, current smoking, and alcohol intake [&#x02265;3 units]) alone or in combination with BMD.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The FRAX model used in this study was calibrated for India (version 3.7) and included baseline BMD.</p><p>Changes in BMD and bone turnover markers over the course of six months were assessed. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were performed using Hologic and GE Lunar DXA scanners to determine T-scores and BMD equivalents. Measurements for an individual subject were all performed using the same scanner. To maintain blinding, the DXA scan was recorded at investigational sites and analyzed at a central reading facility (Synarc Inc., Portland, OR), with the exception of the screening DXA scans, which were analyzed locally to determine subject eligibility. Levels of serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (s-CTX) and serum procollagen type I N propeptide (s-PINP) were measured from blood samples collected from fasted subjects. Subjects, investigators, and the sponsor were also blinded to the results of BMD, bone turnover markers, and other laboratory analyses throughout the duration of the study.</p><p>The study protocol, protocol amendments, and informed consent were approved by ethics committees and institutional review boards, in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and country-specific requirements. The study was conducted according to GCP guidelines from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, Ministry of Health, Government of India, and ICH GCP, as well as the Declaration of Helsinki 2008. Each subject provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study end points</title><p>The primary end point was the mean percent change in BMD at the lumbar spine from baseline to Month 6. Secondary end points included the mean percent change in BMD at total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter from baseline to Month 6 and median percent change in bone turnover markers from baseline to Months 1, 3, and 6.</p><p>Safety end points consisted of adverse events (AEs), including serious AEs (SAEs), AE withdrawals, AEs of special interest, vital signs, laboratory tests, and the incidence of anti-denosumab antibody formation. The serum of subjects was screened for anti-denosumab binding antibody using an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) bridging immunoassay. AEs of special interest included hypocalcemia, hypersensitivity, skin infection, new primary malignancy, delayed fracture healing, serious infection, osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), and atypical femoral fracture (AFF). Potential events of ONJ and AFF were adjudicated by respective committees of experts who were blinded to treatment group assignment. Safety laboratory tests consisted of a complete blood count and chemistry panel including albumin-adjusted serum calcium and liver function tests.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary efficacy analysis for BMD used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for treatment and baseline BMD (as a continuous covariate), with the significance level set at 0.05. For subjects who withdrew after one month in the study, last observation carried forward was used for BMD analyses. Geographic region and region-by-treatment interaction were investigated but were not included in the final statistical model because of nonsignificance of region-by-treatment interaction (<italic>P</italic> = 0.95) at the 0.10 level. The analysis of the secondary efficacy end points of BMD used an ANCOVA model similar to the primary efficacy analysis. For the bone turnover markers at Months 1, 3, and 6, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests with Hodges-Lehman estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare percent changes between the two treatment groups.</p><p>For safety, continuous measures (laboratory evaluations, vital sign changes) were summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. Discrete measures (AEs and withdrawal rates) were summarized by the number and percentage of subjects by treatment group.</p><p>Exploratory analyses were performed for the primary efficacy end point (BMD at lumbar spine at Month 6) for subgroups based on baseline demographics. The study population was subsequently divided into subgroups by age (&#x0003c;65, &#x02265;65 years), baseline BMI category (tertiles), baseline s-CTX (tertiles), machine type (Hologic, GE Lunar), 10-year probability of hip fracture (&#x0003c;3%, &#x02265;3%), 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture (&#x0003c;20%, &#x02265;20%), geographic region (North, West, Central, South), and previous use of osteoporotic medication (Yes, No). Least square estimates and 95% CIs for the treatment differences for each subgroup category were obtained via an ANCOVA model adjusting for baseline BMD, treatment, subgroup, and treatment by subgroup interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Subject disposition and demographics</title><p>Total 551 subjects were screened, and 250 subjects were randomized and entered the study (denosumab = 124, placebo = 126) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].

Denosumab showed a benefit over placebo in increasing BMD at the lumbar spine, as well as at the total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter and decreasing bone turnover markers, s-CTX and s-PINP.</p><p>The high prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia in India, estimated at 50 million in 2013,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] may be the result of low dietary intake of calcium, calories, protein, lack of exercise,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and vitamin D insufficiency (defined in the study as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels 10-20 ng/mL) and deficiency (levels &#x0003c;10 ng/mL).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In Jammu (N = 158), 20% of women aged 25 to 65 years had osteoporosis (T-score &#x0003c;-2.5) and 37% had osteopenia (T-score &#x02264;-1 and &#x02265;-2.5), both of which were found to increase in incidence with age and menopause.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Of 538 women of all ages attending medical camps in north Kerala, 44% had osteoporosis and 41% had osteopenia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In both Jammu and north Kerala, almost all women older than age 65 years had either osteoporosis or osteopenia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In a study of 200 peri- and postmenopausal women from Chandigarh, low BMD (osteopenia or osteoporosis) was found in 53% of the participants.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The severity of this condition is emphasized by the large number (440,000) of hip fractures experienced by the Indian population annually; 75% of these fractures occur in women.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In the Rohtak district of northern India, the annual incidences of hip fractures in women and men aged 50 years or older were 159 and 105 per 100,000, respectively, in 2009.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Despite the study not being powered to conduct subgroup analyses, results of the exploratory analyses were consistent with the primary analysis. Denosumab demonstrated a positive treatment benefit over placebo on lumbar spine BMD at Month 6 in all subgroups. Although concerns may exist about decreased bone resorption resulting in AFF and ONJ, none of these events were reported during this short-term study. There were no fractures, fatalities, or occurrences of unanticipated AEs during this six-month period in either treatment arm. There were no AEs of hypocalcemia or shifts of clinical significance in laboratory values in serum levels of calcium, phosphorous, or alkaline phosphatase reported in the study population; all subjects were instructed to take calcium and vitamin D throughout the study.</p><p>The present study was designed based on the pivotal multinational Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Months (FREEDOM) study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01457950; study number: 20030216),[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] which first assessed the efficacy and safety of denosumab. In the FREEDOM study, subjects were enrolled from Europe, North America, and Australia and were predominantly of European ancestry. Subjects were randomized to receive subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg or placebo every six months for 36 months. A few differences in study methods between the FREEDOM and Indian study should be noted, including variations in the inclusion/exclusion criteria, vitamin D entry criteria (discussed below), and study end points. Although both study populations consisted of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, there was a slight difference in the age range of the inclusion criteria: 55 to 75 years in the Indian study versus 60 to 90 years in the FREEDOM study. The multinational study evaluated the effect of denosumab on reducing fracture risk, with new vertebral fractures as the primary end point, whereas the current study in the Indian population was not designed to evaluate fractures and had a primary end point of mean percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to Month 6. Both studies measured BMD by DXA and bone turnover markers, but in the FREEDOM study, measurements were taken at more long-term time points (up to 36 months). The safety and clinical data from the current study are limited to six months of treatment. A few differences in the study population and design were also seen, including sample size, mean BMI, and placebo response. As expected, the average BMI in the Indian population (25.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was slightly lower than the BMI of the multinational population (26.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). A greater placebo response was observed in the Indian study, which could be attributed to the calcium and vitamin D supplementation in a population with diets normally absent of foods rich or fortified with calcium and vitamin D.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Despite the aforementioned differences, denosumab demonstrated a similar effect on BMD overall in both the Indian and multinational populations.</p><p>Because of the differences in osteoporosis management guidelines at the time of study design,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] the minimum vitamin D entry criteria in the Indian study (20 ng/mL) was higher than in the FREEDOM study (12 ng/mL). A relatively high proportion of subjects in the Indian study underwent vitamin D repletion prior to study entry, possibly because of the higher vitamin D threshold requirement, which may explain the small increase in lumbar spine BMD in the placebo group. Of the 250 randomized subjects in the current study, 35% had vitamin D deficiency at screening and required repletion (34% and 37% in the denosumab and placebo groups, respectively). Data on vitamin D repletion were not recorded in the FREEDOM study. The prevalence of low vitamin D levels in the Indian study corresponds with previous reports that have shown that vitamin D deficiency is a health issue in the Indian postmenopausal population.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Limitations of the study include the small sample size and short duration as mentioned previously. This study was conducted with a placebo control rather than an active comparator, therefore, data are limited on the use of denosumab compared with other available therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis in this population.</p><p>Consistent with the results of the pivotal multinational study, denosumab compared with placebo was effective in increasing BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter and decreasing bone turnover markers in Indian postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The observed safety profile was consistent with the known adverse-effect profile of denosumab. Denosumab can be an option for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in the Indian population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENTS</sc></title><p>Grace H.
