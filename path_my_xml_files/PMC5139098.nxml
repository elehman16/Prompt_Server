Internationally, research suggests that the majority of schools do not implement these policies. In New South Wales (NSW), Australia, the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy requires that school canteens prohibit the sale of &#x02018;red&#x02019; foods (i.e. foods that are typically nutrient poor and high in energy, such as confectionary and deep-fried foods) and &#x02018;banned&#x02019;drinks (i.e. soft drinks); and that the majority of items on the menu are &#x02018;green&#x02019; (i.e. foods that are good sources of nutrients, such fruits, vegetables and lean meats). This study examined the impact of a multicomponent audit and feedback intervention on schools&#x02019; implementation of the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy. A secondary aim was to assess the impact of the intervention on menu composition.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a parallel group randomised controlled trial with 72 rural and remote primary schools (36 interventions, 36 controls) located in one region within NSW, Australia. Intervention schools received an initial face to face contact and up to four cycles of audit and feedback (consisting of a menu audit, written feedback report and telephone feedback) over a 12-month period. The primary trial outcomes were the proportion of schools with a canteen menu that had: i) no &#x02018;red&#x02019; foods or &#x02018;banned&#x02019; drinks; and ii) &#x0003e;50% &#x02018;green&#x02019; items, as assessed via standardised menu audits undertaken by trained dietitians. For each primary outcome, between-group differences were assessed using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test under an intention to treat approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was insufficient evidence to conclude the intervention had a positive impact on the proportion of intervention schools with no &#x02018;red&#x02019; or &#x02018;banned&#x02019; items on their menu (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.8; 95% CI: 0.9 to 8.9; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0895), or on the proportion of intervention schools with more than 50% &#x02018;green&#x02019; items (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.5; 95% CI: 0.7 to 3.2; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.2568). These findings remained non-significant in the multiple imputation analyses. Intervention schools were significantly more likely to have a lower percentage of &#x02018;red&#x02019; items (<italic>p</italic>-value: 0.007) and a higher percentage of &#x02018;green&#x02019; items on the menu (<italic>p</italic>-value: 0.014). This remained statistically significant in the multiple imputation analyses for &#x02018;red items&#x02019; (<italic>p</italic>-value: 0.0081) but not for &#x02018;green&#x02019; items (<italic>p</italic>-value: 0.0910).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>While there was insufficient statistical evidence to suggest that this multicomponent audit and feedback intervention was effective in improving primary schools&#x02019; compliance with a healthy canteen policy, the intervention demonstrated some positive impact in reducing the availability of &#x02018;red&#x02019; items on the menu.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=364216&#x00026;isReview=true">ACTRN12613000543785</ext-link>).

Internationally, between 1999 and 2010, a rapid increase in the consumption of foods low in nutritional value has been reported, particularly in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Studies conducted with children from high income countries also indicate inadequate consumption of fruit and vegetables, well below that recommended in national guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As dietary behaviours and patterns that are developed in childhood persist into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], interventions to improve children&#x02019;s dietary intake have been recommended to reduce the burden from dietary risk factors.</p><p>Leading health organisations including the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and the United States (U.S.) Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] have recommended the implementation of nutrition policies in schools to modify the availability of healthy and unhealthy foods. Such recommendations are supported by systematic review evidence that these food-service based strategies improve child dietary behaviours, particularly the consumption of healthier foods and reduce the purchasing of unhealthy foods from school kiosks and vending machines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Many countries including the U.S., UK, and Australia have introduced nutrition policies requiring schools to provide healthier food options to students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Despite this, research suggests that the implementation of such nutrition policies is limited. For example in the U.S., the 2012 School Health Policies and Practices Study found that more than half of the surveyed schools across all states sold high energy, nutrient poor foods, despite nutrition policies restricting the availability of such foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A national study of 263 Australian primary and high schools found low rates of implementation of healthy nutrition policies in schools canteens across all states (prevalence of between 5 and 35%) except for Western Australia (where 62% were implementing the policy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A study of 318 New Zealand schools found that 66% reported implementing changes after the introduction of the 2008 Guidelines on Food and Nutrition that required schools to provide only healthy menu options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Of those schools that made changes, 12% reported modifying their food policies, 5.7% reported removing fruit juices and sweetened drinks, and 5.7% introduced healthier food choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Differences in the implementation of nutrition policies are also apparent by a number of school factors. In Australia for example, rural school canteens had significantly poorer implementation of a mandatory school canteen policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While such findings suggest that additional efforts to support policy implementation in rural schools may be required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], providing such support across a population of schools that are geographically dispersed represents a considerable challenge to health policy makers and practitioners.</p><p>A number of barriers to the implementation of canteen policies are frequently reported, including inadequate resources and a lack of knowledge and skills to appropriately identify and classify healthy foods consistent with policy requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Interventions that address such barriers are required to facilitate policy implementation and maximise the potential benefits to child nutrition that the policy was intended to deliver to the community. However, an updated Agency for Health and Quality Research review published in 2012 found only one quasi-experimental controlled trial that sought to improve nutrition policy implementation in schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This trial involved the provision of training, financial support for staff relief, and evidence-based resources to eight elementary schools located in a low socioeconomic region in U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The study found no significant difference in the nutritional content of school meals provided between intervention and control schools post-intervention, providing limited guidance to support future implementation of nutrition policies in schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Applied theoretical frameworks for implementation science suggest that audit and feedback may be an effective strategy in overcoming the primary impediments reported by school staff (lack of knowledge and skill in food classification) in nutrition policy implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The Cochrane Effective Practice of Care review group defines audit and feedback as &#x0201c;a summary of an individual&#x02019;s performance over a period of time, provided in written, electronic or verbal format&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Similarly, evidence from observational studies in schools suggest that audit and feedback can effectively support school curriculum planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; and improve teaching quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and student learning outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, systematic review evidence from health care settings consistently reports that audit and feedback is an effective strategy to support guideline implementation and can maintain its effectiveness when delivered across non-face to face modalities (including telephone and written) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Importantly, non-face to face modalities represent particularly attractive methods of providing support in rural and remote locations and overcome significant geographic restrictions associated with the provision of face to face support.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>Given the limited available literature to support healthy canteen policy implementation in schools, and the potential of audit and feedback as a strategy to support implementation, particularly in rural and remote schools, this study (the Canteen Audit and Feedback Effectiveness study &#x02013; CAF&#x000c9;) aimed to assess the impact of an audit and feedback intervention on improving the proportion of rural and remote schools that were compliant with the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy. In Australian primary schools, food and beverages are typically pre-packaged or made on site and sold over the counter for children to eat at lunch and/or recess (a shorter break time either before or after lunch). All foods sold in the canteen are listed on the menu and no standard meal service is provided by the school. As such, the policy focuses specifically on the types of foods that are made available for sale via school canteens and vending machines. The policy requires that school canteens prohibit the sale of &#x02018;red&#x02019; foods (i.e. foods that are typically nutrient poor and high in energy, such as confectionary and deep-fried foods), limit the sale of &#x02018;amber&#x02019; foods (i.e. foods considered to have some nutritional value, but may contribute to excess energy, such as processed meats and full fat dairy) and that the majority of foods sold on the menu are &#x02018;green&#x02019; (i.e. foods that are good sources of nutrients, such fruit, vegetables and lean meats).</p><p>A secondary aim was to assess the impact of the intervention on menu composition (i.e. the percentage of &#x02018;red&#x02019;, &#x02018;amber&#x02019; and &#x02018;green&#x02019; items on the menu). The study also assessed the acceptability of the intervention components, schools&#x02019; receipt of other support to improve policy compliance, and examined the association between the number of audit and feedback cycles provided and canteen compliance to the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) (ACTRN12613000543785).

The Hunter New England Local Health District covers a large geographic region (more than 130,000km<sup>2</sup>) and consists of a socioeconomically and demographically diverse population of approximately 112,000 children aged 5&#x02013;12 years.</p><p>Only the outcome assessors, which included CATI Interviewers and dietitians undertaking menu audits, were blinded to the intervention, as the nature of the intervention meant that schools were unable to be blinded to group allocation.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>All primary schools (i.e. those enrolling children aged 5&#x02013;12 years) in rural or remote areas within the study region (i.e. school postcode was classed as corresponding to an outer regional, rural or remote area according to the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA) score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]), that had previously reported having a canteen (in a 2012 telephone interview conducted by the research team with school Principals) were assessed for eligibility to participate in the study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;150). Schools were eligible to participate if they: i) had a canteen open at least one day per week; AND ii) were not compliant with the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy, defined as either having at least one canteen menu item restricted for sale (&#x02018;red&#x02019; or &#x02018;banned&#x02019; item) or having less than 50% of menu items classified as healthy (&#x02018;green&#x02019; items) (based on dietitian assessment of the supplied canteen menu). Schools enrolling both primary and secondary students (i.e. central schools) and schools catering exclusively for children requiring specialist care were excluded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomisation and allocation</title><p>All eligible schools were randomised into the intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio by an independent investigator using a computer-generated randomisation schedule in Microsoft Excel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Policy context</title><p>As part of the New South Wales obesity prevention strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], in 2005 the State government introduced the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy (henceforth known as &#x02018;Fresh Tastes @ School&#x02019;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The policy was based on the 2003 Australian Dietary Guidelines and utilises a traffic light system to classify menu items as &#x02018;red&#x02019;, &#x02018;amber&#x02019; or &#x02018;green&#x02019; based on their nutritional profile (including energy, saturated fat, and/or salt). &#x02018;Red&#x02019; items are typically nutrient poor, high energy foods; &#x02018;amber&#x02019; items are considered to have some nutritional value, however if consumed in large amounts can contribute to excess energy intake, and &#x02018;green&#x02019; items are those that are considered to be good sources of nutrients, such as fruit, vegetables and lean meats. Sugar-sweetened drinks that are &#x0003e;300 kJ/serve and/or have &#x0003e;100mg of sodium/serve are classed as &#x02018;banned&#x02019; items, and are not to be sold in school canteens. The &#x02018;Fresh Tastes @ School&#x02019; policy requires that schools: i) provide primarily &#x02018;green&#x02019; items (&#x0003e;50% of the menu) and ii) restrict the sale of &#x02018;red&#x02019; foods and remove &#x02018;banned&#x02019; drinks. Government primary schools are mandated to implement the policy, while implementation amongst non-government schools is strongly encouraged. Supporting the implementation of &#x02018;Fresh Tastes @ School&#x02019; is the responsibility of local health promotion service delivery teams across the state. The intervention (consisting of up to four menu audits together with verbal and/or written feedback) was delivered by Health Promotion Officers as part of routine service delivery in the study region. It specifically involved the provision of implementation support to canteen managers to exclude &#x02018;red&#x02019; foods and &#x02018;banned&#x02019; drinks and to increase the proportion of &#x02018;green&#x02019; items provided on menus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data collection procedures</title><p>At baseline (Feb&#x02013;Oct 2013) and follow-up (Sept 2014&#x02013;Jan 2015), Canteen Managers and school Principals completed a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI). The CATI was administered by trained interviewers using a standardised script and assessed items related to school and canteen characteristics, perceived usefulness of the intervention, and exposure to other nutrition interventions. As part of the CATI, Canteen Managers were also asked to supply their current canteen menu and participate in follow-up telephone calls from dietitians to collect additional information required to assess menu compliance. Menu audits undertaken by two trained dietitians blinded to group allocation (described in detail in a previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]) were used to assess the primary trial outcome (compliance with the &#x02018;Fresh Tastes @ School&#x02019; policy). If additional information was required to classify a menu item according to the policy, dietitians collected additional product information from Canteen Managers via phone or email using a standard data collection template. A percentage agreement of over 90% was achieved between the menu reviews of two independent dietitians, in relation to policy compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p>The selection of specific Canteen Manager behaviour change techniques was based on Control Theory, which has previously been applied to audit and feedback interventions in healthcare settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The theory suggests that the key behaviour change techniques to target knowledge gaps and skill barriers include: feedback on current performance, goal setting to allow comparison between current and target performance, and development of action plans to support target attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Intervention design</title><p>The main intervention components included a menu audit, and subsequent provision of feedback via a written report and telephone call. This cycle of audit and feedback was delivered each school term (four times) over a 12-month period. The specific intervention components related to the frequency of feedback and the design of the feedback report were based on systematic review evidence of effective components of audit and feedback interventions in health care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This included provision of: i) feedback more than once in a 12-month period (up to 4 times); ii) feedback in both written and verbal formats; iii) feedback from a reputable source (e.g. health promotion team known to schools); iv) specific feedback on how to address key targets for change (e.g. the removal of &#x02018;red&#x02019; foods and &#x02018;banned&#x02019; drinks, and suggestions for alternatives, as well as strategies to improve the provision of &#x02018;green&#x02019; items); and v) efforts to obtain institutional support for the delivery of feedback (e.g. holding an initial face to face meeting with the Principal and Canteen Manager to obtain their support, where possible). The specific number of menu audits, feedback reports and calls provided was tailored depending on each school&#x02019;s compliance with the guidelines and whether menu changes had occurred between the previous and planned menu audit; and the responsiveness of the Canteen Manager to the feedback (e.g. whether they declined to take feedback calls).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Menu audit</title><p>A dietitian who was blind to group allocation and not involved in the delivery of the intervention undertook audits of the canteen menus using a standardised template based on the &#x02018;Fresh Tastes @ School&#x02019; policy. Canteen Managers were requested to provide a copy of their menu and additional information needed to assess menu compliance with the &#x02018;Fresh Tastes @ School&#x02019; policy (as described above). Additional phone contact was made by the dietitian as needed to obtain all necessary information to classify menu items as &#x02018;red&#x02019;, &#x02018;banned&#x02019;, &#x02018;amber&#x02019; and &#x02018;green&#x02019; according to the policy. Subsequent menu audits were planned for each term (four over a 12-month period) with verbal and written feedback (described below) provided after each audit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Feedback report</title><p>Dietitians developed a standard feedback report template which summarised whether or not the school menu complied with the &#x02018;Fresh Tastes @ School&#x02019; policy. The feedback report was delivered via email or mail by a member of the health promotion team, depending on individual school preference. The report graphically displayed the proportion of &#x02018;red&#x02019;, &#x02018;banned&#x02019;, &#x02018;amber&#x02019; and &#x02018;green&#x02019; items on the menu and outlined the school&#x02019;s compliance with the &#x02018;Fresh Tastes @ School&#x02019; policy. Specific suggestions on how to change canteen menus to meet the requirements of the &#x02018;Fresh Tastes @ School&#x02019; policy were provided including: healthy recipes, ideas about how to increase the number of &#x02018;green&#x02019; items on their menu, and alternative food options to replace specific &#x02018;red&#x02019; foods or &#x02018;banned&#x02019; drinks. The health promotion staff also provided other useful resources based on Canteen Managers&#x02019; reported requirements, as assessed during the feedback calls (described below in &#x02018;Resources&#x02019;).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Feedback calls</title><p>During the initial feedback call, the Health Promotion Officer reiterated the purpose of the report, discussed the results, clarified any unclear components, supported the Canteen Manager to undertake a goal setting process to identify key areas for improvement in order to improve compliance with the &#x02018;Fresh Tastes @ School&#x02019; policy, and developed an action plan to overcome existing barriers to policy compliance. In all subsequent calls (two to four), the Health Promotion Officer tailored the discussion to the needs of the Canteen Manager based on previous contact; and monitored their actions and progress toward their goals, set new goals where required, or monitored compliance. Where possible, the same Health Promotion Officer provided support to the same school throughout the intervention period. Two of the five Health Promotion Officers had qualifications in nutrition and dietetics, however all support officers received the same training in implementing strategies to support organisational change processes and intervention delivery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Resources</title><p>All intervention schools were provided with &#x02018;Fresh Tastes @ School&#x02019; resources (including a Canteen Menu Planning guide, recipes, and a manual on financial management and food safety), healthy food guidelines, a menu planning template, sample policies and menus, pricing guides and a local suppliers buyer&#x02019;s guide which lists foods that meet the &#x02018;amber&#x02019; and &#x02018;green&#x02019; criteria, developed by a state nutrition agency which provides canteen support to their member schools (Healthy Kids Association).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Control group</title><p>Schools in the control group received the standard offer of professional development opportunities provided through the NSW Government&#x02019;s <italic>Live Life Well @ School</italic> initiative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.healthykids.nsw.gov.au/teachers-childcare/live-life-well-@-school/workshops-and-conferences.aspx">https://www.healthykids.nsw.gov.au/teachers-childcare/live-life-well-@-school/workshops-and-conferences.aspx</ext-link>).

School and canteen characteristics are presented for intervention and control groups using means and standard deviations for continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables. School and canteen characteristics were compared between schools that did and did not complete follow-up menu audits using Pearson Chi-square tests or student&#x02019;s t-tests. The primary aim was assessed by comparing group differences at 12-month follow-up under an intention to treat approach. First, the primary trial outcomes were compared between groups using all available data. For each primary outcome (proportion of schools with no &#x02018;red&#x02019; and &#x02018;banned&#x02019; items; and the proportion with &#x0003e;50% &#x02018;green&#x02019; items), between-group differences were examined using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, and <italic>p</italic>-values and 95% confidence intervals for the relative difference in the proportion of schools complying with the policy were presented. This was also reported according to whether schools reported receiving other support to implement the policy. For the secondary outcomes of menu composition (percentage of &#x02018;red&#x02019; and &#x02018;green&#x02019; items on the menu), linear regression models were used to assess between-group differences at follow-up on the absolute scale (adjusting for the baseline value of the outcome), and corresponding Wald test <italic>p</italic>-values and 95% CIs are presented. Only schools that provided their menus and any additional information to the dietitian for menu review were included in this primary analysis. Sensitivity analyses was undertaken for all outcomes using multiple imputation methods to assess the impact of missing data as specified by White et al. for intention to treat analysis for trials with missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Specifically, we used the chained equations method of generating complete datasets at random assumption. The imputation models were fitted separately by treatment group. We explored including a range of auxiliary school characteristics in the imputation model (including school socioeconomic status, education sector, type of Canteen Manager, days of operation, school size and number of volunteers). To reduce the risk of overfitting due to small sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], these were not included as they did not appear to be associated with either the outcome or the missing status of the outcome. The Cochran Armitage test was used to assess the association between the number of audit and feedback cycles delivered (defined as one menu audit and provision of at least one modality of feedback i.e. written and/or verbal) and the proportion of schools with menus that had no &#x02018;red&#x02019; and &#x02018;banned&#x02019; items; or that had &#x0003e;50% &#x02018;green&#x02019; items.

Despite this, an absolute difference of 22% was achieved in the proportion of schools that had removed all &#x02018;red&#x02019; and &#x02018;banned&#x02019; items and this finding approached significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0895). There was also a significant change in the percentage of &#x02018;red&#x02019; foods on the menus, suggesting that the intervention resulted in an positive change in menu composition in terms of a reduction in the availability of unhealthy foods. The complete-case analyses found that the intervention was significant in increasing the percentage of &#x02018;green&#x02019; foods on the menu (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.014). However in the multiple imputation analyses, this finding was no longer significant. While the use of multiple imputation increased the overall analytic sample size, it also introduced imputation variability to the study findings, as there were no variables that were strongly predictive of the outcome or missing status of the outcome. As such, the impact of the intervention on percentage &#x02018;green&#x02019; foods on the menu remains uncertain.</p><p>The results of our study are comparable to the other implementation trial in this setting, which found no impact of a multicomponent intervention which included provision of training, financial support and resources on the nutrition composition of schools cafeteria meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. While the current study achieved higher absolute effect sizes for the primary outcomes compared to the median effect size of 4.3% reported in audit and feedback interventions in clinical settings (interquartile range 0.5 to 16%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]), it was lower than the anticipated effect size specified for this study. We anticipated that this study would achieve a greater effect size compared to previous studies as the intervention protocol attempted to incorporate characteristics suggested to enhance the effectiveness of audit and feedback interventions. The intervention effect observed in our study could however have been diminished by a smaller than intended number of feedback rounds provided to schools across the intervention group. For example, while all schools received at least one menu audit and written report, only 72% of schools received two or more audit and feedback cycles. Systematic review evidence indicates that more than one contact is needed to maximise the effectiveness of audit and feedback interventions. Interestingly, findings from the Cochran-Armitage test found that increased intervention dose (i.e. number of audit and feedback cycles) was associated with increased policy compliance. Such findings are consistent with previous findings which report that more frequent feedback is likely to predict intervention effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>While the impact of audit and feedback on clinical practice has been extensively examined in other settings, this study is the first to examine the impact of such intervention in schools. Findings from this study suggest that audit and feedback interventions delivered in isolation may not be effective in improving school compliance with a healthy canteen policy. Despite findings of non-significance for the primary outcome, promising outcomes in relation to overall menu composition and the findings of an association between the number of cycles delivered and policy compliance suggest that future studies should explore reasons for lack of uptake of such interventions amongst school staff. Anecdotal discussions with Health Promotion Officers indicated that the key reasons for non-engagement was the time required by canteen managers to engage in the intervention and the multiple cycles of audit and feedback offered in a relatively short time frame. Incorporating strategies to support intervention uptake, such as reducing the time burden on Canteen Managers for the menu audit process and refining the number of audit and feedback cycles delivered, could increase the impact of future audit and feedback interventions on school nutrition policy compliance. Further, the majority of Canteen Managers reported finding the feedback reports &#x02018;very&#x02019; or &#x02018;extremely helpful&#x02019;, suggesting that there is potential to reduce the number of feedback calls delivered as part of future interventions. While the current study was powered to detect a 30% difference in the primary outcomes, closer consideration of what constitutes a meaningful effect size for the setting is needed, given the potential health impact of implementation of healthy canteen policies on the diets of hundreds of thousands of children that attend NSW schools. Future trials could be powered to detect a smaller but clinically meaningful change given the potential for this intervention to be delivered to a large number of schools, across a wide geographical area.</p><sec id="Sec38"><title>Limitations</title><p>A limitation of this study is that the intervention was not delivered as intended to all schools, with only 72% of schools receiving more than one round of the intervention. However, Health Promotion Officers responsible for delivering the intervention attempted to make multiple contacts with Canteen Managers and on most occasions were unable to deliver intervention support due to a lack of time or resistance from the Canteen Manager. The subgroup analyses examining exposure to other intervention support should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size. Future studies with larger sample sizes should pre-specify subgroup analyses by school characteristics (i.e. socioeconomic status, school size) to allow examination of whether intervention effects might differ by these subgroups. Another limitation is that the study had a moderate loss to follow up (30%). However, as our sensitivity analysis involving multiple imputation of missing data revealed similar results for the primary outcome, we have confidence in the study findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, this study found that a multicomponent audit and feedback intervention did not significantly improve rural and remote schools&#x02019; compliance with the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy. The intervention was effective in reducing the number of &#x02018;red&#x02019; items, suggesting an overall reduction in availability of unhealthy items. Future trials testing the impact of a more comprehensive range of strategies to improve the implementation of healthy canteen policies may be warranted given the lack of known effective implementation interventions in this setting.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ARIA</term><def><p>Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CATI</term><def><p>Computer Assisted Telephone Interview</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HNELHD</term><def><p>Hunter New England Local Health District</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSW</term><def><p>New South Wales</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p>Relative risk</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge Joshua Cohen, Renee Reynolds and Todd Edwards for support implementing the intervention and undertaking menu review.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>In-kind funding was received by Hunter New England Population Health to support conduct of the trial.
