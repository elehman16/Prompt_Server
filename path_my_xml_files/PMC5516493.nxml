However, because of its important anatomical surroundings, it needs an expert pain physician (that did 400 or more lumbar epidural injections), health-care team, and equipment such as fluoroscopy. This setting causes wasting of time, more workforce recruitment, prolonged learning time, and high running cost.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Acoustic puncture assist device (APAD) has been tested and used successfully over the past decade. It has shown reliable results to detect epidural space in both lumbar and thoracic area.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] It provides an objective end point using both visual and auditory senses. Furthermore, it allows the usage of both hands for needle insertion. In this study, we assume that APAD if used probably in cervical epidural injection, it will be safe, reliable, training tool and will decrease the running cost.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>This is an observational study, 32 patients were scheduled.

The full length of the tubes was filled with a continuous column of saline with no air bubbles. The APAD system performance was checked for high and low pressure by occlusion and release of its tubing with reflection on the sound pitch.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Acoustic puncture assist device machine connections and setting</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-11-305-g003"/></fig><p>After the skin was prepared with ChloraPrep, local anesthetic (lidocaine 1%) was infiltrated then a Tuohy needle 17 gauge was advanced in C7&#x02013;T1 space, then the stylet was removed. The needle was flushed with saline and connected to the APAD system, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Then, it was advanced gradually guided by fluoroscopy, APAD sounds (objective monitoring), and by feeling the loss of resistance sensation (the pop) (subjective monitoring) to detect entry to the epidural space. The pressure inside the needle and the APAD tube was related only to tissue resistance as the saline infusion in the needle was constant (100 ml/h), as the needle was advanced. On entering the epidural space, a sudden decrease in the pressure occurred and a subsequent sudden decrease in the sound intensity. Entry to the epidural space was further confirmed by injecting radiopaque dye under fluoroscopy. The medications were injected, and the patient was kept monitored for the next 3 h for his or her vital signs, motor power, and conscious level.</p><p>The primary outcome is the reliability and accuracy of the APAD system in detecting the cervical epidural space.</p><p>The secondary outcomes are a reduction of exposure to X-ray fluoroscopy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Data collected</title><p>Age, weight, height, APAD graphs and pressures, APAD-fluoroscopy correlation, time of exposure to fluoroscopy before and after entry to epidural space, and the number of X-ray shots before and after location of epidural space.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>In this study, 32 cases were included [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>] in the study, their mean body mass index was 35.43 &#x000b1; 5.1 (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation [SD]), their mean age was 40 &#x000b1; 10.397 (mean &#x000b1; SD), and 25 of them were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) II and 7 of them were ASA III (two chronic renal failures, three stable angina, one controlled congestive heart failure, and one morbidly obese patient).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-11-305-g004"/></fig><p>In all of the cases, the epidural space was detected using both fluoroscopy and APAD with 100% correlation.</p><p>Total time of C-arm fluoroscopy (including setting up and positioning) was 15.83 &#x000b1; 3.75 min (mean &#x000b1; SD) with an actual exposure time of 62.978 &#x000b1; 0.53 s. Fluoroscopy time of 4.82 &#x000b1; 1.73 min with an actual exposure time of 21.7148 &#x000b1; 0.69 s (30.448%) was consumed to confirm the level and to confirm the epidural space; this time is considered mandatory exposure time to confirm procedure.</p><p>On the other hand, 11.01 &#x000b1; 1.25 min of time was used to follow up needle advancement by fluoroscopy with an actual exposure time of 41.263 &#x000b1; 0.161 s (69.551%) which is considered nonmandatory and can be omitted from the procedure to decrease the time of exposure to the fluoroscopy.</p><p>The usage of APAD greatly reduced the exposure time to fluoroscopy by around 70% (69.55%), despite that in this study, we used the fluoroscopy all through the procedure to show the correlation with the APAD system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, APAD has shown a great reliability and accuracy. It has a simple setup and objective hearing and visual end point.</p><p>Because of the graph that appears on the screen, it adds another advantage as it gives double documentation by the pressure graph and fluoroscopy image.</p><p>APAD is reliable and safe. The pain physician can use both hands and concentrate on the technique while hearing the tone of the machine. It also allows triple checking of entry of epidural space using hearing, loss of resistance sensation, and fluoroscopy. Moreover, it decreased markedly the need of fluoroscopy and the time of exposure which subsequently will decrease the effects of the hazard of X-ray exposure and will decrease the running cost.</p><p>The APAD machine was tested in many studies before and it has proved a great efficacy. It was tested first in the lumber area then in the thoracic area[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] which has a greater risk than the lumber area. Furthermore, it was tested in the insertion of an epidural catheter in women in labor.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Up to our knowledge, APAD has not been used before in detecting cervical epidural space.</p><p>Although APAD showed a great success, it has some limitations. APAD cannot be used alone; it still needs the usage of fluoroscopy to confirm final needle position and to rule out the intravascular injection. If pain physicians master APAD to become a standard practice, there is a hope it can replace fluoroscopy in the future. Obviously, this needs further research and studies.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of
