However, excessive inflation of ETT cuff frequently causes tracheal mucosal damage, which can increase the incidence of sore throat, hoarseness, and coughing after surgery. When a sealing cuff pressure is &#x0003e;30&#x0200a;cmH<sub>2</sub>O, insufficient perfusion of tracheal mucosa occurs. Therefore, a sealing cuff pressure of 20&#x02013;30&#x0200a;cmH<sub>2</sub>O is clinically important for a proper seal and prevention of tracheal injury in tracheally intubated patients.</p><p>A cuff pressure is affected by several factors such as the physiological character of an ETT, the use of nitrous gas, and positional change during general anesthesia<sup>.</sup><sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> In the tracheal cartilages, the cricoids cartilage is the only round shape, followed by C-shaped tracheal cartilages. Therefore, a positional change causes displacement of an ETT in the trachea, which may affect the cuff pressure.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> The physical characteristics of the ETT cuff may also affect the cuff pressure.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> The shape of a classic ETT cuff is cylindrical, whereas that of a newly developed TaperGuard ETT is distally tapered. It was demonstrated that a newly developed TaperGuard ETT is more effective in providing a sealing effect than a cylindrical ETT in an in vitro study.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> However, recently, it was reported that the cuff pressure of a TaperGaurd ETT significantly increased after a positional change from the supine to the lateral flank position, compared to that of a cylindrical ETT.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>The previous study showed that lateral rotation of head resulted in a greater increase of a tracheal mucosa pressure than the extended or flexed position.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> In addition, lateral rotation of head toward the side of ETT fixation caused displacement of the ETT away from the carina in adult patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the effect of lateral rotation of head on the cuff pressure of TaperGaurd ETT, compared to a cylindrical ETT during middle ear surgery.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients and exclusion criteria</title><p>The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kyungpook National University Hospital (KNUH 2016-02-017-001) and an informed written consent was obtained from all patients. This study was registered in the ClinicalTrials.GOV (NCT02797938). A total of 52 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification I&#x02013;III and aged 18&#x02013;70 years for a tympanomastoidectomy under general anesthesia were included. Exclusion criteria were history of difficult intubation, limited neck movement, respiratory diseases, and body mass index &#x0003e;35&#x0200a;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The written informed consent from all patients was obtained.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Anesthesia and data collection</title><p>Patients were allocated into two groups using computer-generated randomization assed by a physician who was not involved for perioperative care (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The patient in group C (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;26) were intubated with a cylindrical-shaped ETT (Unomedical, Kedah, Malaysia) and the patient in group T (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;26) was intubated with a TaperGuard ETT (Covidien, Mansfield, OH). The group allocations were informed to the attending anesthesiologist before anesthesia. Tracheal intubation was performed with a size of inner diameter 7.5&#x0200a;mm ETT for males and 7.0&#x0200a;mm ETT for females by the same anesthesiologist. The anesthesiologist measured cuff pressure and distance from the ETT tip to the carina during the study period.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e6257-g001"/></fig><p>Premedication was not administered. In the operating room, the patients were monitored with noninvasive arterial blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and electrocardiography. General anesthesia was induced with propofol 2&#x0200a;mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.8&#x0200a;mg/kg. Endotracheal intubation was done with a direct laryngoscope and the tip of the ETT was placed at 4&#x0200a;cm above carina using a fiberoptic bronchoscope. The ETT was fixed with tape on the contralateral side to operation. The cuff of the ETT was inflated with air and the cuff pressure was initially adjusted at 22&#x0200a;cmH<sub>2</sub>O using a manometer (Mallinckrodt Medical, Hennef, Germany). Head was laterally rotated to the opposite side of the surgical site and set at 45&#x000b0;. After rotation of head the cuff pressure was measured again and readjusted to 22&#x0200a;cmH<sub>2</sub>O. The distance from the ETT tip to the carina was recorded again using a fiberoptic bronchoscope. Anesthesia was maintained with 1.5&#x02013;3.0 sevoflurane with 50% oxygen in air and with a target concentration of remifentanil set at 2&#x02013;3&#x0200a;ng/mL. Volume-controlled ventilation was set at a tidal volume of 8&#x0200a;mL/kg and respiratory rate of 10&#x02013;12&#x0200a;cycle/min to maintain the end-tidal carbon dioxide tension from 30 to 35 mm Hg.</p><p>The incidence of hoarseness, sore throat, and cough was assessed at 30&#x0200a;minutes, 6 hours, and 24 hours after surgery by a study-blinded anesthesiologist. The primary outcome was the cuff pressure after rotation of head. The secondary outcomes were the displacement of the ETT tip from the carina after lateral rotation of head and incidence of airway morbidity after surgery.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Sample size</title><p>A preliminary study using 15 volunteers showed that an increase of the cuff pressure of the TaperGuard ETT in the rotation of head was 9&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;2.3&#x0200a;cmH<sub>2</sub>O (mean&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;standard deviation). In this study, a 30% difference in the mean cuff pressure with the lateral rotation of head between the two ETTs was considered to be significant. Therefore, the minimum sample size of 23 patients per group was needed with a significance level of 0.01 (&#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01) and a power of 90% (&#x003b2;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.10).

In addition, the extent of displacement of the ETT was greater in the TaperGuard ETT than in the cylindrical ETT after a positional change.</p><p>The excessive pressure of the ETT cuff caused the airway complications including rupture of trachea during mechanical ventilation, sore throat, hoarseness, and coughing after surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> It was demonstrated that the ETT cuff pressure &#x0003e;30&#x0200a;cmH<sub>2</sub>O resulted in impairment of blood flow and histological lesions of the tracheal mucosa in the preclinical and the clinical studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> The ETT cuff pressure can be influenced by several factors such as patient factors (tracheal diameter), anesthetic factors (nitrous oxide), factor associated with a ETT (compliance and shape of a ETT cuff), and surgical factors (position and laparoscopic surgery).<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>The diameter of the cylindrical ETT cuff is 120%&#x02013;150% of the internal tracheal diameter. When inflated in the trachea, longitudinal folds or channels can be formed, leading to leakage of air or fluid.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> However, a TaperGuard ETT cuff has a diameter lesser than a cylindrical ETT cuff. Therefore, a cylindrical ETT has more folds or channels to ensure air seal than a TaperGuard ETT. It was demonstrated that a TaperGuard ETT is more effective for prevention of microaspiration and pneumonia during mechanical ventilation than a cylindrical ETT.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup></p><p>In the present study, a cuff pressure in the lateral rotation of head significantly increased in the TaperGuard ETT compared with the cylindrical ETT. In addition, the incidence of a cuff pressure &#x0003e;30&#x0200a;cmH<sub>2</sub>O significantly increased in the TaperGuard ETT compared with the cylindrical ETT. In the previous study, it was demonstrated that the cuff pressure was higher in the TaperGuard ETT than in the cylindrical ETT after a positional change from neutral to lateral flank position although there was no difference in the degree of tube displacement between them.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Therefore, it was suggested that the geometry of the ETT may be responsive for the significant difference in the intracuff pressure between TaperGuard and cylindrical ETTs because there is no difference of cuff compliance between them.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>The previous study demonstrated that the head rotation toward the tube fixation side significantly displaced the tube tip away from the carina, whereas head rotation to the non-fixation side resulted in a migration of the ETT in an unpredictable manner.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> In the present study, the ETT was fixed with a tape on the contralateral side to operation and after lateral rotation of head toward the tube fixation side proximal migration of the ETT occurred, which is consistent with the previous study.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Boyle's law is a gas law stating that the pressure and volume of a gas have an inverse relationship at a constant temperature. In the present study, the cephalad migration of the ETT occurred after a positional change, which may place the ETT cuff adjacent to a less compliant airway structure including cricoids cartilage. The extent of the cephalad migration of the ETT is greater in the TaperGuard ETT than in the cylindrical ETT, which may be partly responsible for an significant elevation of the cuff pressure in the TaperGuard ETT compared with the cylindrical ETT.</p><p>In this study, there are several limitations. First, this is a single-blinded randomized study. Blinding was impossible. Therefore, a study unblinded anesthesiologist performed tracheal intubation and collected data during anesthesia, which can be a source of bias. Second, it was reported that inner diameter of the subglottis and upper trachea is less in a south Indian population than in a western population.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> The present study was conducted in an only Asian population at a single center, which limited the ability to extrapolate the results beyond the selected population. A multicenter study is needed to verify the utility of a TaperGuard ETT in the surgeries requiring a positional change of head and neck. Third, in this study, there were no differences in the incidences of postoperative airway complications such as sore throat, hoarseness, and cough between two groups. The cuff pressure in the TaperGuard ETT significantly increased in the lateral rotation of head, compared with the cylindrical ETT. After a positional change, we adjusted the cuff pressure to 22&#x0200a;cmH<sub>2</sub>O, which can explain the reason that the incidences of postoperative airway morbidity were comparable between two groups. However, our findings regarding the incidence of postoperative airway complications should be considered within the context of this study because the sample size was relatively small to detect a difference in airway morbidity. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of the shape of the ETT cuff on airway morbidity after surgery.</p><p>In conclusion, the head movement from neutral to lateral rotation can lead to a greater increase of the cuff pressure in the TaperGuard ETT than in the cylindrical ETT. In addition, the proximal migration of the ETT is higher in the TaperGuard ETT than in the cylindrical ETT.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ETT = endotracheal tube.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding: This research was supported by Kyungpook National University Bokhyeon Research Fund, 2015.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>CY</given-names></name><name><surname>Yeh</surname><given-names>YC</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
