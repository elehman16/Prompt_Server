These interventions are aiming at the cultivation of an open-minded and non-judgmental awareness of whatever is happening at each successive moment of perception. The objects of perception, which is direct and pre-reflexive, include the whole range of possible phenomena, from internal psychological states and processes (thoughts, feelings, images, etc.), proprioceptive information from the body, to external stimuli entering the senses. Phenomena are approached in an open, nonjudgmental and accepting way. It is &#x0201c;the clear and single-minded awareness of what actually happens to us and in us at the successive moments of perception&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The approach is rooted in the core Buddhist notion that all psychological suffering is the result of the judgmental mind, dividing experiences into good and bad, which should be either strived for or avoided, inevitably leading to some level of frustration, distress, anxiety, and depression.</p><p>Several studies have been performed, especially in recent years, that have examined the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction interventions, mainly in the form of the original MBSR protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] or derivatives thereof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

Although results regarding symptoms of depression and anxiety have sometimes been equivocal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], in general, MBSR has shown positive effects in different groups, such as chronic pain patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], medical and premedical students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], health care professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], patients with fibromyalgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], patients with heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and cancer outpatients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A meta-analysis on the available randomized controlled trials has shown a mean medium-sized (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.54) effect on a composite score of psychological well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Although the effects of MBSR on psychological well-being is beginning to get well established, the central assumption stating that the effects are attributable to increases in mindfulness skills induced by the training has hardly been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Since the recent introduction of instruments assessing various aspects of mindfulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the first published studies on this topic have not been able to illuminate this issue.

Results of studies examining this issue have been inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Methodological differences between the studies, including the outcome variables used, and varying power to detect effects may have been responsible for the inconsistencies.</p><p>In the present study, our main aim was to examine the extent to which effects of the mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention protocol may be attributable to increases in mindfulness skills induced by the training. Various measures of psychological well-being and quality of life were included, from general positive and negative affect and perceived stress to aspects of quality of life. We expected that, in general, change in mindfulness would statistically mediate the beneficial effects of the intervention on study outcomes. In addition, the association of the amount of home practice and attendance to the intervention sessions with outcome was examined, which was expected to be positive and significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited in September 2005 by an advertisement in local papers around the city of Tilburg, The Netherlands, including the following solicitation: &#x0201c;In fall, a mindfulness-based training aiming at reducing feelings of distress will start at Tilburg University. [&#x02026;] Because this training is linked to an investigation into its precise effectiveness, the training is offered for free.&#x0201d; When participants applied (by phone), we verified if they had symptoms of distress by asking the question &#x0201c;how often would you say do you feel distressed?&#x0201d; Participants were eligible if they replied that they felt this way at least &#x0201c;regularly&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;often.&#x0201d; They were also asked if they had a psychological disorder that was present for at least 2&#x000a0;months. Serious psychopathology (e.g., suicidal ideation) and insufficient understanding of the Dutch language were the exclusion criteria. All people that were interested in participating complied with these criteria.</p><p>The power analysis was based upon a previous meta-analysis on the effects of MBSR on psychological well-being variables, showing a mean medium-sized effect size (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5). With an alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, a total of 50 participants were needed. Sixty participants with symptoms of distress volunteered and met the criteria for inclusion in the trial. They were randomized into an intervention group that would receive the MBSR training and a waiting-list control group that would receive MBSR after the intervention group finished their training. Random selection of the MBSR participants without stratification was performed using the SPSS software procedure &#x02018;random selection of cases&#x02019; applied to numbers representing the participants. The performer of this procedure (second author) did not know which number represented which participant. After randomization, there was no blinding to group assignment, except for assessment of the outcomes, which was done by sending questionnaires to the participants by post.</p><p>The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the St. Elisabeth Hospital at Tilburg, The Netherlands.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Demographic Data</title><p>The questionnaire set included sociodemographic and medical questions regarding the participants&#x02019; age, sex, education, job status, current treatment, and medication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Psychological Well-being</title><p>Psychological well-being was assessed by using the following four constructs: perceived stress, vital exhaustion, positive affect, and negative affect. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] assesses the degree to which situations in one&#x02019;s life are appraised as stressful. The PSS consists of 14 items, which are scored by using five-point Likert scales ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The PSS has an internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) coefficient of 0.85 and well-established validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This was our primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes were vital exhaustion, positive and negative affect, quality of life, and mindfulness skills.</p><p>Vital exhaustion, a mental state characterized by unusual fatigue, a feeling of being dejected or defeated, and increased irritability was assessed by means of the Maastricht Questionnaire (MQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], &#x02018;form B.&#x02019; This questionnaire consists of 21 items that can be answered with yes, do not know, or no, and has a Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> of 0.89 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It has been shown to have adequate concurrent validity as reflected by a substantial correlation with a validated interview-derived assessment of vital exhaustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] as well as predictive validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The Global Mood Scale (GMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] was used to measure negative affect (characterized by fatigue and malaise) and positive affect (characterized by energy and sociability). This questionnaire comprises 20 items, of which ten are positive and ten reflect negative mood. By using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), respondents are asked to indicate to what extent they experienced each emotion lately. The GMS has been found to be an internally consistent scale (Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.90), and correlations with existing measures of emotional functioning and self-deception indicated its convergent and discriminant validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Quality of Life</title><p>The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) group has designed the WHOQoL-Bref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], which is a shortened version of the WHOQoL-100 quality of life questionnaire. In this study, the WHOQoL-Bref was used to obtain contentment in five domains of quality of life: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, environment, and general quality of life. The WHOQoL-Bref consists of 26 items and has been reported to show satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> ranging from 0.66 for the social domain to 0.82 for physical health).

It consists of 15 items. Respondents have to indicate how frequently they currently experienced each condition, using a six-point Likert scale from 1 (almost always) to 6 (almost never). The MAAS is a reliable instrument with a Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> of 0.87. Adequate test&#x02013;retest reliability, convergent, and discriminant validity have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The KIMS measures four components of being mindful in daily life: Observe (12 items), Describe (eight items), Act With Awareness (ten items), and Accept Without Judgment (nine items). Each of the 39 items is scored on five-point Likert scales ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (almost always or always true). The subscale Act With Awareness was not included in the present study because its content is largely overlapping with the content of the MAAS and the subscale Describe was omitted because describing one&#x02019;s emotions and feelings is not a primary focus of MBSR, while observing whatever happens in the present moment (reflected by the subscale Observe) and especially a nonjudgmental and nonevaluative attitude (reflected by the subscale Accept Without Judgment) are important aspects of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> coefficients for the subscales Observe and Accept Without Judgment have been found to be 0.91 and 0.87, respectively, which reflects a high internal consistency.

After randomization into the intervention and the waiting-list control group, the intervention group started the MBSR training at a meditation center in Tilburg. The current intervention completely followed the standard MBSR protocol as developed by Kabat-Zinn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The training consisted of eight weekly group (15 persons) sessions with a duration of 150&#x000a0;min. In the sixth week, an additional session of practice in silence with a duration of 6&#x000a0;h was included. The intervention consisted of three primary components: (1) theoretical material related to relaxation, meditation, and body&#x02013;mind connections; (2) experiential practice of meditation and yoga both during group meetings and at home on a daily basis, and (3) a group process focused on problem solving related to impediments to effective practice, day-to-day applications of mindfulness, and supportive interaction. In addition, a booklet was provided containing information relevant to each week&#x02019;s instruction. Participants were instructed to practice daily for at least 40&#x000a0;min.</p><p>After 8&#x000a0;weeks at the end of the training, both participants in the MBSR group and those in the waiting-list control group were asked again to complete the questionnaire set assessing mindfulness, psychological well-being, and quality of life (follow-up).

All analyses were according to the conservative intention-to-treat approach.</p><p>First, we examined if there were significant differences between the intervention and the control group regarding background characteristics: sex, age, education, job status, and the use of psychotropics. Education was dichotomized into high (degree from high professional education or college) and low education. A chi-square test for independence was performed on the variables sex, education, and the use of psychotropics, while for age, an independent sample <italic>t</italic> test was conducted.</p><p>Multivariate repeated measures analyses of covariance (MANCOVAs) including the questionnaire scores at baseline and follow-up as dependent variables were performed to test the effects of the intervention. Three analyses were performed for the three sets of variables: psychological well-being (perceived stress, vital exhaustion, positive, and negative affect), quality of life (including the five domains), and mindfulness (the three mindfulness scales). The factors in these analyses were group (intervention or control), time (baseline and follow-up), and potential categorical variables to correct for, while potentially confounding continuous variables were entered as covariates.</p><p>Bivariate correlations based on all participants were computed between change in mindfulness scores and change in well-being and quality of life. Mediation analyses were based on the approach of Baron and Kenny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The following conditions have to be met for a test of potential mediation effects by mindfulness: (a) The independent variable (group) has a significant effect on the outcome variables, (b) the independent variable (group) has a significant effect on the mediator (mindfulness skills), and (c) the mediator is associated with the outcome variables. If all of these conditions are met, a final analysis involves a mutivariable model including both the independent variable and the mediator predicting change in the outcome variable. In this analysis, a drop of predictive power of the independent variable (group) suggests the existence of a mediation effect. Because we had a repeated measures design, we applied the repeated measures MANCOVA also to the test of the mediation effect. This approach is fundamentally equivalent to a series of regression analyses, as MANCOVA includes regression models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Participants Flow</title><p>After randomization of the 60 individuals, one man that was randomized into the control group declined participation (loss of interest), leaving a total of 59 participants.

Except for the inclusion of the potential mediator as covariate, this analysis was identical to the original ANCOVA described above. In contrast to the results of the original analysis, in this final analysis the time &#x000d7; group interaction failed to reach significance [<italic>F</italic>(1,53)&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.58, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.064, partial <italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06], suggesting that the effect of the intervention may have been mediated by a change in general mindfulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. A similar analysis on vital exhaustion revealed a still significant effect of time &#x000d7; group [<italic>F</italic>(1,53)&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.91, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.011, partial <italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.12), albeit considerably smaller than in the original unmediated analysis (partial <italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20).</p><p>Regarding the omnibus test-derived index of overall quality of life, the MANCOVA including general mindfulness as potential mediator reduced the previously significant time &#x000d7; group interaction effect to nonsignificance [<italic>F</italic>(1,52)&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.73, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.10, partial <italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05). However, when accept without judgment was included as a predictor instead of general mindfulness, the time &#x000d7; group interaction remained significant [<italic>F</italic>(1,52)&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.20, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045, partial <italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our main aim was to examine whether the expected beneficial effects of a mindfulness-based stress-reduction intervention (MBSR) (1) are attributable to actual changes in mindfulness skills.</p><p>First, it had to be shown that MBSR had the hypothesized effects in our sample of distressed individuals from the general population. We did replicate previous findings regarding the effectiveness of MBSR on decrease of feelings of distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and increase of quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and extended previous results to other measures of distress (vital exhaustion), mood, and quality of life than those applied earlier. The general convergence of findings underscores the fact that previous results are not limited to the specific measures used. Some nuances should be acknowledged, however. In our study, quality of life seems less sensitive to change than measures of psychological distress and positive affect. This is in line with research on temporal changes in quality of life in patient populations, indicating fairly stable levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In addition, decrease in negative affect showed no difference between the groups, probably because the control group decreased significantly as well. This may have been due either to natural improvement in mood over the course of time, to the expectancy of the participants of coming improvement as the intervention would start soon, or even just to the statistical effect of regression to the mean.</p><p>Regarding the main aim of our investigation, support was obtained for at least a partial mediation effect by mindfulness. This is the first study to show such an effect in a controlled study. Only few previous investigations have examined a mediation effect by mindfulness skills. While several studies reported correlations between change in mindfulness skills and decrease in feelings of distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], a mediation effect of mindfulness could not be obtained due to the lack of a control group. The only study on the mediation issue that did apply a randomized controlled design did not find a correlation between change in mindfulness skills and change in outcome variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, this was probably due to the fact that their sample consisted of students without any psychological symptoms. Perhaps because of our use of a truly distressed sample in a randomized study, we have been able to demonstrate an at least partial mediation effect of mindfulness in the case of some outcome variables.</p><p>We found evidence for a mediation effect of general mindfulness in the case of perceived stress, quality of life, and partially on vital exhaustion. For the facet accepting without judgment and observing mainly sensory phenomena, no mediation effects were found, although change in accepting without judgment did correlate with improvement in quality of life over time. A potential explanation of these findings may be that the focus of the intervention is on enhancing mindfulness in general, which is more strongly tapped by the MAAS, than on the specific aspects of accepting ones feelings and thoughts, and observing bodily and physical sensations, although these aspect are also addressed during the intervention.</p><p>Regarding relationships between outcome and home practice or attendance of sessions, we found no effects. The results concerning attendance are in line with three out of five studies that have examined this effect and found none [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Two other studies did report a positive effect of attendance on outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Ceiling or floor effects cannot explain this inconsistency as the number of attended sessions ranged from relatively low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] to high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Also the power to detect effects did not differ systematically between the studies. One may speculate that practice is more important for achieving positive effects than session attendance, which however, we did not observe either.</p><p>Previous studies on mindfulness-related interventions have reported mixed results regarding the relation between the amount of home practice and outcome. Clear consistent associations have been obtained in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], while in most studies, no or inconsistent associations were found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Some but not all null findings may have been due to either relatively low initial levels of distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or ceiling effects of the amount of practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, studies reporting significant associations were based on larger samples (61&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;121 in the treatment group) than studies finding no or inconsistent associations (14&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;59), suggesting a power problem in many studies, including ours, to detect an effect of probably modest magnitude. Although it cannot be ruled out, a more fine-grained assessment of the amount of minutes spent in practice may not have produced stronger associations in our study, as most studies finding no or inconsistent associations did assess the number of minutes practicing.</p><p>One limitation of the present investigation is the relatively small sample size, which prevents the detection of small effects. Importantly, our results are restricted to immediate effects post-intervention. The investigation of potentially mediating effects of mindfulness skills on long-term outcome is very much needed. Furthermore, although we attempted for neutral wording in our advertisements, emphasizing the stress reduction aspect, our recruitment procedure by means of advertisements may have partially attracted a subset of people interested in this form of intervention, limiting the generalizability to the general population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kabat-Zinn</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><source>Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness</source><year>1990</year><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Delacourt</publisher-name></citation><citation citation-type="display-unstructured">Kabat-Zinn J.
