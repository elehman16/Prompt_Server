Cognitive behavioral therapy has demonstrated efficacy in reducing anxiety and worry in older adults, but the generalizability of these findings to community-dwelling older adults is unknown. The aim of the current study is to examine the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral intervention delivered by telephone in reducing anxiety and worry in rural community-dwelling older adults with GAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We propose a randomized controlled trial comparing telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-T) with nondirective supportive therapy (NST-T). One hundred seventy six adults 60&#x000a0;years and older diagnosed with GAD will be randomized to one of the two treatment conditions. The primary outcomes are self-report worry and clinician-rated anxiety. Secondary outcomes include depressive symptoms, sleep, quality of life, and functional status.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It is hypothesized that CBT-T will be superior to NST-T in reducing anxiety and worry among older adults with GAD. Further, CBT-T is hypothesized to be superior to NST-T in reducing problems with depressive symptoms, sleep, functional status and quality of life. If this program is successful, it could be implemented as a low-cost program to treat late-life anxiety, especially in rural areas or in circumstances where older adults may not have access to qualified mental health providers.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01259596?term=nct01259596&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01259596</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Generalized anxiety disorder</kwd><kwd>Older adults</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Rural mental health</kwd><kwd>Telephone-delivered psychotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Among older adults, anxiety is more common than depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; yet research on the nature and treatment of anxiety has lagged far behind that of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry and somatic symptoms and is one of the most common anxiety disorders in older adults, with prevalence rates in community-dwelling older adults ranging up to 7.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The effects of GAD extend beyond mental health. GAD is associated with significant economic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], poorer quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], increased comorbidity and disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], sleep disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and increased health services use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most efficacious nonpharmacological treatment for GAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of late-life GAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, limitations of these studies may reduce the generalizability of their findings. Most importantly, attrition rates are high (up to 33%) which may reflect dissatisfaction or difficulty overcoming barriers, such as transportation, financial difficulties, and stigma. Additionally, most studies have been conducted in academic settings and required up to 15 face-to-face sessions. Treatment has often been provided in a group format, producing even more constraints. Anxious older adults face many barriers to treatment that have not been addressed in prior studies. Therefore, it is not known if previous findings will generalize to community-dwelling older adults. Studies are needed that apply to community-dwelling elders, both by reducing their barriers to treatment and increasing their access to treatment.</p><p>Conducting treatment using telephone therapy and written materials reduces barriers that older adults face, including stigma associated with mental health treatment, as treatment can be conducted within the privacy of one&#x02019;s home. No face-to-face visits are required, eliminating potential transportation barriers. Bibliotherapy with telephone therapy also increases the accessibility to mental health services for the many people who live in underserved areas and lack access to a trained geriatric cognitive-behavioral therapist. This format is particularly appropriate for older adults because there are fewer time constraints. In a typical CBT intervention, patients attend 8 to 16 weekly 50-minute psychotherapy sessions. Participants are taught CBT principles and techniques and are instructed on how to apply them to their daily lives. Therefore, sessions must be very structured to complete the treatment. However, older adults tend to need more time to process information in psychotherapy, especially since those with GAD often have impairments in short-term memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, an intervention that provides a variety of approaches and additional time to process information may be particularly beneficial for older adults. The combination of telephone therapy and written materials allows older adults to process information both visually and verbally. The written format provides older adults with an easy opportunity to read and review the materials as often as needed and at their own pace. In our pilot study, older adults report that they frequently reread and highlight information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. By presenting written information beforehand, the telephone session can be used to briefly review materials and answer questions and then place a greater emphasis on the application of anxiety management techniques in the participant&#x02019;s daily life.</p><sec><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of telephone-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-T) with nondirective supportive therapy (NST-T; an active comparison condition) for reducing anxiety and worry. We hypothesize that CBT-T will be superior to NST-T in reducing anxiety and worry. Our secondary hypotheses are that CBT-T will be superior to NST-T in improving coexistent symptoms (depressive symptoms and sleep) and functional status (disability and quality of life). The hypotheses will be tested on outcome measures assessed immediately upon completion of the intervention (i.e., the 4-month post-randomization visit).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study design is a single-site randomized controlled trial comparing telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-T) with nondirective supportive therapy (NST-T) for the treatment of late-life GAD in a sample of rural-dwelling older adults (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Participants will be recruited from the 41 counties in North Carolina with an urban population of &#x0003c;20,000 people. CBT-T consists of up to 10 workbook chapters accompanied by 8 to 12 weekly 45&#x02013;50&#x000a0;minute psychotherapeutic telephone calls. NST-T consists of 10 weekly 45&#x02013;50&#x000a0;minute nondirective supportive therapy telephone calls for 10&#x000a0;weeks. Upon completion of the weekly sessions, all participants will receive an additional 4 telephone booster sessions over the next 3&#x000a0;months. Assessments will be conducted by telephone pre-randomization and at approximately 2&#x000a0;months post-randomization (abbreviated assessment), 4&#x000a0;months post-randomization, 9&#x000a0;months post-randomization, and 15&#x000a0;months post-randomization. Participants will be compensated $25 for each of the pre-randomization, 4-month, 9-month, and 15-month interviews.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-244X-14-34-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>We propose multiple recruitment strategies, including mailing a flyer describing the study to adults aged 60&#x000a0;years and older residing in the targeted recruitment counties using three strategies: (1) a commercial mailing company; (2) mailing letters to local physicians and medical centers, churches, and community agencies, and (3) sending flyers to older adults receiving Meals on Wheels. The recruitment flyer and letters will briefly describe the study and instruct interested persons to call our toll-free telephone number. Using a standardized script, staff will describe the study in greater detail and screen these persons by telephone. After providing verbal consent, Stage 1 of the screening process consists of basic demographic information (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, county of residence and plans to move within 6&#x000a0;months), hearing impairment, current self-reported worry symptoms, current psychotherapy use, psychotropic medication use and changes in dosage within the last month, current alcohol or drug problems, presence of auditory or visual hallucinations, diagnosis of dementia, general cognitive functioning, and privacy to talk by telephone. Screening will be stopped if any responses indicate study ineligibility. Participants who score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;16 on the worry measure and meet the other inclusion/exclusion criteria will progress to Stage 2 of the screening process where they will complete a second lengthier telephone eligibility interview. During the second interview, the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID), an interviewer-rated anxiety measure, and a health services utilization measure will be administered. Participants will also be mailed a battery of self-report measures to complete. Upon completion of both the interview and self-report measures, potential participants will be informed of their eligibility status.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Inclusion criteria include: 1) age&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;years, 2) a principal or co-principal DSM-IV diagnosis of GAD as assessed by the SCID-IV, 3) residency in a county with an urban population of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20,000 people, and 4) proficiency in English. Principal diagnosis is defined as the disorder with the highest global severity rating. When 2 diagnoses meet this criterion, co-principal diagnoses will be assigned. Exclusion criteria include: 1) current psychotherapy; 2) a DSM-IV diagnosis of active alcohol or substance abuse within the last month; 3) a diagnosis of dementia or global cognitive impairment based on the education-adjusted scores on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified (TICS-m); 4) psychotic symptoms assessed by the endorsement of hallucinations or delusions; 5) active suicidal ideation with plan and intent; 6) any change in psychotropic medications within the last 1&#x000a0;month and 7) any hearing loss that would prevent a person from participating in telephone sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization to therapist and treatment will be stratified on baseline current depression diagnosis (major depression/dysthymia vs. no depression diagnosis) and baseline psychotropic medication use. We will use a permuted block algorithm with random block lengths to generate the randomization assignments. Randomization will be executed via a secure web-based data management system. To ensure masking of the assessment staff to intervention assignment, the randomization procedures will be performed by staff members not involved in the assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>We used data from a pilot study trial comparing CBT-T with usual care with referral for reducing anxiety and worry in older adults with anxiety disorders (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;55; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29 in usual care with referral and n&#x02009;=&#x02009;26 in CBT-T) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] to determine the sample size for the current study. Analyses of these pilot data provided estimates of the standard deviation (SD) for the Penn State Worry Questionnaire-A (PSWQ-A) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scores: values were 6.7 and 7.2, respectively. The correlation between baseline and post-intervention PSWQ-A scores was 0.45 for the PSWQ-A and 0.40 for the HAM-A. We considered a 0.5 SD difference on the PSWQ-A (3.35 units) and the HAM-A (3.5 units) in the post-intervention means as the minimally important detectable difference. A mixed effects analysis appropriate for repeated measures analysis of covariance will be used to test the primary hypotheses, with a contrast to test the hypothesis of no intervention effect at the post-randomization visit. Using the pilot data estimates of SD and correlation and assuming that each co-primary outcome will be tested at the 0.025 two-sided significance level, power calculations for analysis of covariance on the PSWQ-A outcome indicated the need for a total of 80 participants per group to attain 90% power, 70 participants per group to provide 85% power, and 60 participants per group to attain 78% power. We plan to recruit 88 participants per group to account for an expected drop-out rate of approximately 10%.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>This study was approved by Institutional Review Board at Wake Forest School of Medicine.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention descriptions</title><sec><title>Cognitive behavioral therapy-telephone (CBT-T)</title><p>Telephone therapy. Weekly telephone sessions with the randomly assigned therapist will last 45 to 50&#x000a0;minutes. In order to ensure privacy, every participant will be asked if he/she has adequate privacy for the session, and if not, will be offered an opportunity to reschedule the appointment. All sessions will start with a review of homework and any problems or stressors they have encountered with the homework. The therapist and the participant will discuss whether anxiety coping skills were used and were effective. If so, use of the coping techniques will be reinforced. If the anxiety was not adequately managed, coping skills will be reviewed and ways to incorporate or improve their use will be identified. The therapist will then review the assigned chapter and accompanying exercise with the participant. The participant will be encouraged to ask questions about the reading materials and discuss any difficulties in implementing the anxiety technique. If a participant reports difficulty with a particular chapter or technique, he/she will be instructed to continue to work on that chapter and technique for another week and another call will be scheduled. Upon completion of the workbook, booster sessions will be used to reinforce anxiety management skills and problem-solve issues that arise as needed. Booster sessions will be provided at 2&#x000a0;weeks, 4&#x000a0;weeks, 8&#x000a0;weeks, and 16&#x000a0;weeks after completion of the treatment.</p><sec><title>Workbook</title><p>The principal investigator adapted the 10-chapter workbook from the standardized Controlling Anxiety in Later-Life Medical Patients workbook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The techniques in this CBT intervention have demonstrated efficacy in treating adults with GAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and older adults with GAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Chapter 1 describes the treatment and presents a cognitive behavioral model of anxiety. Chapters 2 through 9 each address a specific anxiety management technique or a specific problem that may be comorbid with anxiety. Chapters are approximately 5 to 10 pages long and are written in lay terms. They are presented in a large font, and key points are highlighted and reiterated simply to aid readers in fully understanding the content. Each chapter contains multiple examples of specific situations that an older adult might experience. Chapters are also focused on techniques that are more relevant to older adults, such as sleep and pain, rather than assertiveness skills and time management. The sleep and pain chapters are optional. There are 3 ways to trigger the use of the pain and sleep modules: 1) the participant mentions problems with pain or sleep during the course of the telephone sessions with the therapist; 2) the participant requests the pain and/or sleep modules; 3) the participant scores below the mean (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;67.5) for older adults on the pain scale from the SF-36 as lower scores indicate greater pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] or&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;7 on the Insomnia Severity Index indicating at least subthreshold insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Each chapter is followed by a homework exercise to practice the technique described in that chapter. A completed example is provided followed by blank copies to be completed by the participant. The homework is used to encourage the application of the techniques to the participant&#x02019;s daily life.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Nondirective supportive therapy-telephone (NST-T)</title><p>Nondirective supportive therapy (the active control group) will follow Borkovec&#x02019;s protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. NST-T provides a &#x0201c;high-quality therapeutic relationship that provides a warm, genuine, and accepting atmosphere through the use of supportive and reflective communications&#x0201d; (p. 9); it does not provide advice, suggestions, or coping methods. Borkovec reports high levels of treatment credibility and therapeutic relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. NST-T will be conducted by telephone via weekly 45&#x02013;50&#x000a0;minute sessions with the randomly assigned therapist. Participants in the NST-T condition will receive 10 sessions. This number was chosen because it is the average number of sessions a participant in the CBT-T condition can receive (minimum of 8 sessions and maximum of 12 sessions). They will also receive 4 booster sessions. The NST-T condition matches the CBT-T condition in terms of amount of therapist contact (equivalent session length, number of sessions, and frequency of sessions) and delivery of treatment (via telephone).</p></sec><sec><title>Therapist fidelity</title><p>At least two therapists will deliver both treatments and supervision for each condition will be conducted weekly.

Each co-primary outcome will be tested at the two-sided, 0.025 significance level (i.e. using a Bonferroni adjustment). Comparisons of outcome measures (or transformations thereof) between intervention groups will be made by mixed-model repeated measures analysis of covariance with an unstructured covariance matrix to account for the fact that multiple measurements (at approximately 2&#x000a0;months post-randomization, 4&#x000a0;months post-randomization, 9&#x000a0;months post-randomization, and 15&#x000a0;months post-randomization) from participants are not independent. Each primary hypothesis will be tested at the 4-month visit using a contrast within the framework of this mixed-effects, repeated measures analysis. In the primary analysis, all randomized subjects will be included in their original study group regardless of the final mode of intervention or the extent of compliance with the study protocol; that is, the primary analysis will follow an &#x0201c;intent to treat&#x0201d; philosophy. The analysis of covariance model for the primary outcomes will contain terms for the baseline value of the outcome, therapist (a factor to which participants are randomized), baseline current depressive disorder (used to stratify randomization), use of psychotropic medications at baseline (used to stratify randomization), the intervention effect, a time effect, and the time by intervention interaction term. The interaction term is necessary in the model to allow the test of the primary hypothesis on the 4-month post-intervention measurement. Additional secondary analyses will be performed to test between intervention groups for measurements at approximately 2&#x000a0;months post-randomization, 9&#x000a0;months post-randomization, and 15&#x000a0;months post-randomization. We will also perform a test of interaction between the therapist and intervention effect to explore if the therapist effect moderates the effect of the intervention.</p><p>Secondary outcomes, including the BDI-II, PAT-D, SF-36, and ISI will be analyzed using mixed models repeated measures analysis of covariance using techniques like those described for the primary outcomes. We will perform hypothesis tests at the 0.05 level for these outcomes and following the recommendations of Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], we will report the overall probability of Type I error within published manuscripts.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this RCT, we compare telephone-delivered CBT with NST as a treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder in rural older adults. We hypothesize that CBT-T will be superior to NST-T in reducing anxiety and worry. We also hypothesize that CBT-T will be superior in reducing depressive symptoms and sleep problems, and improving functional status.</p><p>We have chosen NST as a comparison condition because it provides a structurally equivalent comparison group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and has similar levels of outcome expectations and credibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] as CBT. We have designed the interventions such that all participants get the same number and length of sessions. Thus, NST as a comparison group allows for the demonstration of the superiority of CBT to a structurally equivalent comparison. It also provides all participants with an opportunity to receive treatment.</p><sec><title>Implications for practice</title><p>Telephone-delivered psychotherapy is one method of providing treatment to individuals limited by practical barriers. This method may be particularly appropriate for older adults living in rural settings as they are less likely to have access to the internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Further, patient satisfaction with telephone delivered psychotherapy is high and comparable to face-to-face psychotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Should we demonstrate the efficacy of the CBT-T intervention over NST-T, this low-cost treatment could be implemented widely and could potentially reach large numbers of patients in rural areas, primary care settings, and specialty settings, or in circumstances when older adults have barriers to seeking care.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BDI-II: Beck depression inventory; CBT-T: Cognitive behavioral therapy-telephone; GAD: Generalized anxiety disorder; HAM-A: Hamilton anxiety rating scale; ISI: Insomnia severity index; NST-T: Nondirective supportive therapy-telephone; PAT-D: Pepper assessment tool for disability; PSWQ-A: Penn state worry questionnaire-abbreviated; SCID: Structured clinical interview for the dsm-IV; SD: Standard deviation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors participated in the design of the study.
