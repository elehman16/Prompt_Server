This research sought to iteratively develop a theory-driven mobile app, <italic>Vegethon</italic>, to increase vegetable consumption.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Development of Vegethon followed phases outlined by the IDEAS framework: 1) empathize with users (qualitative interviews, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18); 2) specify target behavior; 3) ground in behavioral theory; 4) ideate implementation strategies; 5) prototype potential products; 6) gather user feedback (qualitative interviews, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14; questionnaire, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;41); 7) build minimum viable product; and 8) pilot potential efficacy and usability (pilot RCT, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17). Findings from each phase informed subsequent phases. The target population that informed intervention development was 18&#x02013;50 years of age, had BMIs of 28&#x02013;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and lived in the geographical area surrounding Stanford University. A full description of the final version of Vegethon is included in the paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Qualitative findings that shaped initial intervention conception were: participants&#x02019; interests in accountability without judgment; their desire for simple and efficient dietary self-monitoring; and the importance of planning meals in advance. Qualitative findings identified during intervention refinement were the need for a focus on vegetable self-monitoring; inclusion of vegetable challenges; simplification of features; advice and inspiration for eating vegetables; reminder notifications; and peer comparison. Pilot RCT findings suggested the initial efficacy, acceptance, and feasibility of the intervention. The final version of Vegethon enabled easy self-monitoring of vegetable consumption and included a range of features designed to engage the user (e.g., surprise challenges; leaderboard; weekly reports). Vegethon was coded for its inclusion of 18 behavior change techniques (BCTs) (e.g., goal setting; feedback; social comparison; prompts/cues; framing/reframing; identity).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Vegethon is a theory-based, user-informed mobile intervention that was systematically developed using the IDEAS framework. Vegethon targets increased vegetable consumption among overweight adults and is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01826591?term=NCT01826591&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01826591</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>mHealth</kwd><kwd>Smartphone</kwd><kwd>Mobile</kwd><kwd>Diet</kwd><kwd>Vegetables</kwd><kwd>Process motivators</kwd><kwd>Persuasive design</kwd><kwd>Behavior&#x000a0;design</kwd><kwd>User-centered design</kwd><kwd>Design thinking</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005370</institution-id><institution>Gates Cambridge Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK0091831</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sutton</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Nutrition Science Initiative</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Poor diet is among the leading causes of death in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and is responsible for cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, and certain cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Healthier eating behaviors such as increased fruit and vegetable consumption are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and certain cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Interventions to increase healthier eating behaviors such as reducing saturated fat consumption have led to significant improvements in health outcomes such as reducing coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Mobile technology may enable the delivery of such dietary interventions in a cost-effective and scalable manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] given its increasing ubiquity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], ability to reach individuals at nearly any time or place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and potential to deliver timely feedback, personalization, and interactivity to maximize intervention effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. An explosion of health-promoting mobile apps has occurred in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] including those to promote healthier eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, most mobile apps are yet to incorporate an integrated set of theory-based strategies known to cause and sustain changes in health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The process of developing such mobile health (mHealth) interventions is complex, requiring numerous decisions that integrate behavioral theory, user feedback, and technical and practical feasibility considerations. As a result, investigators have called for the thorough reporting of the mHealth intervention development process so that researchers may learn from each other&#x02019;s experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Moreover, the CONSORT guidelines recommend publishing a precise description of the final intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], for which standardized language and descriptors may be useful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. While some researchers have notably published accounts of the iterative development and final versions of their mobile health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the relative lack of such reporting impedes advancements in mHealth research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Several approaches to guide the development of more effective mHealth interventions have been proposed, including grounding interventions in behavioral theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; incorporating brainstorming, rapid prototyping, and multiple stages of user feedback (i.e., user-centered design and design thinking) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; and subjecting interventions to rigorous evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. While numerous frameworks have been introduced to guide mHealth intervention development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the IDEAS framework [manuscript under review] incorporates these approaches into a comprehensive, step-by-step process, and thus was used to guide the iterative development of Vegethon.</p><p>This research sought to do the following: a) develop an mHealth intervention to increase healthier eating behaviors among overweight adults; b) describe the iterative development of Vegethon, as guided by the IDEAS framework; and c) characterize the final intervention, including a detailed description of its components and theoretical grounding using standardized terminology specified by the taxonomy of behavior change techniques.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and results</title><p>The intervention development process took the form of a collaborative academia-industry partnership in which researchers, product designers, engineers, and dietitians worked collaboratively throughout all phases. <italic>IDEAS</italic> [manuscript under review], a framework for developing digital behavioral health interventions, guided the process and was used for its integration of behavioral theory, user-centered design and design thinking, and evaluation. The first eight of ten IDEAS phases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) were undertaken: 1) empathize with target users (i.e., qualitative interviews); 2) specify target behavior; 3) ground in behavioral theory; 4) ideate implementation strategies; 5) prototype potential products; 6) gather user feedback (i.e., qualitative interviews; questionnaire); 7) build minimum viable product; and 8) pilot potential efficacy and usability (i.e., pilot RCT). As in other published accounts of mHealth intervention development, each phase was used to inform the next; therefore, the methods and results of each phase are presented sequentially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Application of the IDEAS framework to the development of Vegethon mobile app. <italic>Empathize:</italic> gather qualitative insights from users (e.g., in-depth interviews, focus groups). <italic>Specify:</italic> translate broad behavioural goals into a highly specific target behaviour, taking into consideration actionability, health impact, and user acceptability. <italic>Ground:</italic> ground intervention in behavioural theory and evidence and incorporate relevant behavioral strategies. <italic>Ideate:</italic> brainstorm creative strategies for translating theory and user insights into features, using inspiration from wide and varied sources. <italic>Prototype:</italic> develop rough prototypes of ideas rapidly and iteratively, sharing, discussing, and improving prototypes as a cross-sector team. <italic>Gather:</italic> gather user feedback on prototypes (e.g., interviews, questionnaires), and uncover insights to inform product improvement. <italic>Build:</italic> build a fully functional minimum viable product, and incorporate app analytics to collect data on app usage patterns. <italic>Pilot:</italic> conduct a small-scale evaluation of the intervention to test potential efficacy, feasibility, and usability, analyze usage behaviour, and refine study protocol</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12966_2016_400_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Phase 1. Empathize with users</title><p>To inform the development of the intervention, in-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with an aim to better understand participants&#x02019; eating behaviors, mobile app usage, and challenges to eating more healthily. It has been asserted that participants have a limited understanding of what types of interventions would be most useful to them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thus, rather than set out to gather participants&#x02019; explicit ideas for mHealth interventions, this phase sought to equip our interdisciplinary team with a rich understanding of the beliefs, circumstances, and thought processes of our target population in order to facilitate the later ideation of more empathetic design solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>A target population of overweight adults enrolled in an ongoing 12-month weight loss study at Stanford University (parent trial) was selected due to participants&#x02019; motivation to eat more healthily and the practical feasibility of piggybacking onto a parent trial to assess the efficacy of an mHealth intervention using rigorously-collected parent trial data (e.g., BMI; 24-h dietary recalls). Participants were 18&#x02013;50 years of age, had BMIs of 28&#x02013;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and lived in the geographical area surrounding Stanford University. As part of the parent trial, participants were randomly assigned to a low-fat or low-carbohydrate (carb) diet and encouraged to attend nutrition education classes every 1&#x02013;4 weeks. Those interested in informing the design of an mHealth intervention were invited for interviews. In-depth interviews were conducted by one of the authors (SAM) and three research assistants. The interviews were audio-recorded and then transcribed verbatim. An applied thematic analysis strategy was applied to the interview transcripts by one of the authors (SAM) using NVivo, and findings were validated with all data collectors.</p><p>Eighteen adults (women/men: 9/9) aged 42.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.9&#x000a0;years (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD) with body mass indices (BMIs) of 33.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.0&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were interviewed. Several themes emerged, including participants&#x02019; desire to be held accountable in a manner that would be more motivating, non-judgmental, and not overly time-consuming. When asked what type of mobile technology might help support healthier eating, participants almost always discussed an improved tool for self-monitoring. They cited self-monitoring as essential to eating more healthily but emphasized its time-consuming nature, their desire for it to be faster and more effortless, and their willingness to compromise on accuracy for simplicity.<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;The most important thing to stay on the rails is the tracking. But the goal for me, in tracking, is two minutes per day, not if it is more than 10&#x000a0;minutes&#x02026;With tracking food, I don&#x02019;t need to be very precise, and if I have to be very precise each time, it is a lot of pain and is not efficient.&#x0201d; (P7)</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p>Participants&#x02019; broader goals were to build a healthier lifestyle and lay the foundation for long-term health, wellbeing, and behavior change. Many reported the practice of planning meals in advance as central to following their diets given their busy lives. Participants who struggled to plan their meals noted the drawbacks: &#x0201c;I&#x02019;m a modern person. I don&#x02019;t plan for anything, and that is the problem.&#x0201d; These qualitative findings informed subsequent phases and indicated that possible intervention routes might include enabling simple and efficient self-monitoring of food intake, and supporting the rehearsal or formation of healthier meal planning routines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Phase 2. Specify target behavior</title><p>We next sought to select a specific target behavior that the intervention would aim to modify. A review of the existing evidence was conducted to identify potential target eating behaviors with significant health benefits. It was determined the target behavior would center around a whole food (e.g., vegetable) rather than nutrient (e.g., sugar) to increase the ease with which users could monitor their intake and therefore take action. This approach was consistent with recommendations to focus on whole foods rather than reductionist dietary patterns when seeking to modify dietary behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A review of the evidence for holistic dietary patterns suggested that the following behaviors offered significant health benefits: increased intake of fruits and vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; reduced intake of sugar-sweetened beverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]; and reduced intake of animal products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Reduced intake of animal products was considered incompatible with the low-carb diet of the parent trial and was therefore discarded. Increased intake of fruits and vegetables was determined to be preferable to reduced intake of sugar-sweetened beverages due to its positive framing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and its potential to have a cascade effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], positively influencing other dietary behaviors by replacing the consumption of more caloric foods. To reinforce the potential cascade effect and weight loss goals of the parent trial, the target behavior was further specified to focus only on non-starchy vegetables, excluding fruits and starchy vegetables for their greater sugar and caloric content and comparatively weaker evidence base for a health benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>Phases 1 and 2 were conducted concurrently to confirm the selected target behavior with user feedback. Participants&#x02019; self-reported usual vegetable consumption ranged from 1 to 10 servings daily (1 serving&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 fist size), and participants were either open to increasing their consumption or satisfied with their current consumption. One user noted, &#x0201c;I am happy with the amount [of vegetables I am eating],&#x0201d; while another said, &#x0201c;I wasn&#x02019;t a huge vegetable eater before this study&#x02026;and I would love to increase [the amount of vegetables I eat].&#x0201d; These findings confirmed the decision to select <italic>increased consumption of non-starchy vegetables</italic> as the target behavior.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Phase 3. Ground in behavioral theory</title><p>Numerous theory-based strategies were identified for possible inclusion. Goal-setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and self-monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] were considered due to their suitability for mobile technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and alignment with user feedback. Habit formation was considered due to its demonstrated efficacy in changing dietary behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and alignment with user insights. To enhance the intrinsic motivation of increasing vegetable consumption, process motivators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] that focused on making the processes of self-monitoring and vegetable eating rewarding were considered, including elements of fun, challenge, choice, control, curiosity, context, and personalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Several other strategies were considered, including, but not limited to: reframing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], social comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], gamification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], growth mindset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], and identity revision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Phase 4. Ideate creative implementation strategies</title><p>With potential behavioral strategies identified, the team engaged in a series of group brainstorming sessions, also known as ideation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], to conceive of creative ways in which these techniques might be implemented. Brainstorming centered around potential mobile app features and was inspired by a collection of highly rated apps on the App Store. A multidisciplinary team enabled the ideation of a wide range of diverse ideas taking behavioral theory, user insights, and product experience into account.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Phase 5. Prototype potential products</title><p>From these ideas, potential versions of an app were sketched, shared, and discussed to identify the most promising prototypes. Benefits of creating early-stage prototypes include the ability to quickly and cheaply gather feedback on many different possible intervention approaches prior to investing significant resources in any one particular approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p>Two core prototypes emerged, <italic>vegetable tracking</italic> and <italic>habit challenges</italic>, which were developed into roughly-sketched, digital clickable prototypes with which participants could interact. The vegetable tracking prototype enabled simple and efficient self-monitoring of vegetable consumption, while the habit challenges prototype enabled the selection and rehearsal of new vegetable consumption habits. A constellation of secondary features (<italic>goal setting</italic>; <italic>daily inspiration</italic>; <italic>leaderboard</italic>; <italic>progress</italic>; <italic>push notifications</italic>) were also prototyped to further engage users and increase intervention potency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Phase 6.

A <italic>vegetable pictures</italic> sharing feature was added in response to a user&#x02019;s suggestion and overall feedback indicating a desire to be inspired. Forty-one adults (women/men: 23/18) aged 44.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.4&#x000a0;years (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD) with body mass indices (BMIs) of 33.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.2&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> completed the questionnaire. Participants were largely interested in all features. The only feature in which more were uninterested (i.e., responding &#x0201c;probably not&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d;: 46&#x000a0;%) than interested (i.e., responding &#x0201c;absolutely&#x0201d; or likely&#x0201d;: 29&#x000a0;%) was <italic>vegetable pictures</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>App refinements</title><p>Based on these findings, several decisions and adjustments were made. The prototype enabling vegetable self-monitoring was selected. A mechanism for marking &#x0201c;favorite&#x0201d; vegetable types was added to allow users to more quickly log the vegetables they most frequently consumed. The habit challenges, which participants had found to be useful but secondary to self-monitoring, were redesigned to support the primary self-monitoring feature. Rather than new habits requiring additional self-monitoring (e.g., packing snack baggies of carrots every morning), the new challenges focused on behaviors already reflected by self-monitoring (e.g., eat 2 servings of broccoli). This design adjustment enabled challenges to be fulfilled automatically via self-monitoring, requiring no additional effort by the user. <italic>Progress</italic> graphs were simplified and explained more explicitly to avoid confusion. <italic>Daily inspiration</italic> was renamed <italic>advice and tips</italic> and further developed. <italic>Push notifications</italic> were designed to nudge the user nightly but reduce in frequency if participants stopped using the app, to limit annoyance. The <italic>leaderboard</italic> was further developed to: compare users to other parent trial participants; display users&#x02019; first names to increase accountability; and match users according to their baseline vegetable consumption to reduce potential discouragement. As with all technologies, it was not possible or advantageous to include all features suggested by users. Omitted suggestions included the ability to adjust the timing of notifications and the ability to share <italic>vegetable pictures</italic>, a feature which was not supported by the questionnaire findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Phase 7. Build minimum viable product</title><p>A single fully functional mobile app prototype was developed. This stage focused on a further level of design detail, including: a) user experience; b) visual design; c) logic (e.g., for graphs, notifications); and d) content. User experience and visual design were informed by product designers, logic by researchers and statisticians, and nutritional content by dieticians. Numerous small and large decisions were made to translate a rough prototype into a product suitable for mainstream delivery. Decisions were made together by the cross-sector team at every point to ensure that user experience and theoretical grounding were maximized throughout. For example, an image (i.e., a stack of vegetables) was selected for the splash page for both its visual appeal and its ability to help reframe the goal to consume a minimum number of vegetables as a positive and exciting endeavor rather than an unpleasant chore. In addition, the messages sent via notifications were written to be friendly and positive in tone while incorporating appropriate behavior change techniques, such as referring to users as &#x02018;Vegethoners&#x02019; to help them begin to construct a new self-identify as vegetable eaters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Phase 8. Pilot test</title><p>A pilot RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] was conducted to assess the potential efficacy, usability, and acceptability of the first complete version of the app. Parent trial participants were re-randomized to the use of <italic>Vegethon</italic> or a waiting-list control condition. Differences in vegetable consumption were assessed using an adapted Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline and 12&#x000a0;weeks post-randomization. App usability and satisfaction were measured with a post-intervention questionnaire.

When registering for an app account, participants complete an in-app tutorial that frames the intervention using process motivators including challenge and taste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] to enhance the intrinsic motivation of increasing vegetable consumption. Participants are called &#x0201c;Vegethoners&#x0201d; to foster a process of identity revision towards one who is a vegetable eater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and to create a sense of community and conformity around the challenge to eat more vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. This approach aligns with user feedback to challenge users by inspiring them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Goals</title><p>Users are initially prompted to set <italic>goals</italic> for the quantity (i.e., servings) and variety (i.e., types) of their vegetable consumption using two visual analog scales. A daily time frame is used to align with national recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] and enable more proximal goals shown to more highly motivate behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. To increase perceived choice and control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], participants are prompted to personalize their goals within a range of 1&#x02013;10 and are able to adjust these at any time. Default values requiring no action, which are known to influence decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], are set to 5 to align with USDA recommendations and labeled &#x0201c;recommended.&#x0201d; Anchoring, also known to influence decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], is used to indicate: a) &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; as &#x0201c;average,&#x0201d; to encourage low vegetable consumers to set realistic goals that support self-efficacy in goal attainment; and b) &#x0201c;8&#x0201d; as &#x0201c;superstar&#x0201d; to encourage high consumers to set more ambitious goals, to maintain an appropriate level of challenge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Select veggies</title><p><italic>Select veggies</italic> is the central app feature and enables self-monitoring of vegetable consumption. To minimize the time and effort involved while maximizing opportunities for fun and visual appeal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], a single tap on a vegetable icon (e.g., eggplant, carrots) causes it to light up and increase its recorded quantity in increments of &#x000bd; servings. Vegetable logging is easily accessible via a large white &#x0201c;+&#x0201d; icon located on every screen. Users are instructed to estimate one serving as approximately the size of their fist; this approach sacrifices a degree of accuracy for simplicity, to encourage sustained self-monitoring. Qualitative findings suggested users are interested in recording their food consumption as effortlessly and efficiently as possible, and that this approach is acceptable to them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Challenges</title><p>To integrate elements of gamification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], seven ongoing <italic>challenges</italic> reward users with points and in-app notifications upon fulfillment.

In addition, <italic>surprise challenges</italic> are pushed to users every four days and designed to encourage consumption of new vegetable types. Each surprise challenge enables perceived choice and control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] through the selection of a preferred vegetable type and the ability to accept (&#x0201c;I&#x02019;m in!&#x0201d;) or decline (&#x0201c;Not today&#x0201d;) the resulting challenge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Advice and tips</title><p><italic>Advice and tips</italic> are displayed on the home page, to provide inspiration in line with user feedback.

Positive and non-judgmental language is used to build self-efficacy and avoid adverse effects on mood that may cause discontinued app use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. To maximize notification relevance, each message aligns with recent self-monitoring behavior. To minimize annoyance and the interruption of daily activities, notifications are sent during lunchtime and evening hours no more than once per day. Nine o&#x02019;clock p.m. is used as the usual reminder time, as it is late enough that the majority of food for the day has likely been consumed, but early enough that there is still enough time to log before bed. This approach aligns with findings suggesting behavior change can be facilitated via apps that generate positively framed alerts that are relevant and timely but not overly frequent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Weekly report</title><p>To increase user engagement, a personalized weekly report, <italic>Your Vegethon report</italic>, informs participants how their vegetable consumption compares to: a) other Vegethoners; and b) the top 20&#x000a0;% of Vegethoners.

Vegethon targets increased vegetable consumption among overweight adults who are trying to lose weight and was coded for its inclusion of 18 behavior change techniques (BCTs) as specified by the taxonomy of 93 BCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Self-monitoring, which was desired by users and supported by theory, emerged as the core component of the mobile app and was complemented by a constellation of theory-driven features to increase user engagement and intervention potency. A focus on process motivation guided overall intervention development to increase intrinsic motivation for self-monitoring and increasing vegetable consumption. The development of Vegethon involved numerous decisions throughout the process to integrate theoretical grounding, user feedback, and feasibility constraints; the way in which we combined these perspectives may be useful to researchers in the development of their own mHealth interventions. Vegethon demonstrated efficacy in a pilot RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and is currently being evaluated in a larger-scale RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Strengths</title><p>Among the strengths of this work is a description of the complete intervention development process, including a detailed characterization of the final intervention using standardized terminology. It demonstrates the integration of behavioral theory, user-centered design, design thinking, and pilot evaluation in the development and refinement of an mHealth intervention. The approach we used is a departure from traditional methods in which a technology is initially designed by researchers and subsequently developed by third-party contractors; the use of a cross-sector team throughout the process comprised of both researchers and technical developers has been called for by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and may present an improvement on prior approaches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Limitations</title><p>It has been proposed that traditional behavioral theories may be too static in nature to inform the use of the dynamic just-in-time capabilities of mobile technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] that allow interaction based on data gathered through sensing technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. While the use of theory-driven behavioral strategies was sufficient to guide the development of Vegethon, future intervention iterations may benefit from the use of more complex intervention development processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. In addition, the users who informed the development of Vegethon were concurrently enrolled in a weight loss trial, were an average of 43&#x000a0;years old, and were interested in helping with the development of mobile technology. It is therefore possible that the resulting intervention may not be as suitable to other samples that are not enrolled in a weight loss trial, are younger and potentially interested in different types of engagement with mobile technology, and/or are not as highly interested or motivated to use a mobile app to increase their vegetable consumption. Future studies may investigate whether behavior changes are observed among other populations and/or whether these changes are sustained once the intervention has ended.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The development of Vegethon was guided by the IDEAS framework and a cross-sector team, and involved numerous stages pursued iteratively and in quick succession. The resulting mHealth intervention is theory-grounded, user-informed, and supported by user feedback and findings from a pilot trial.
