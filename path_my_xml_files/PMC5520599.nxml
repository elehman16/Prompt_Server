Premedication facilitates overcoming these difficulties, with midazolam being the most commonly used agent. However, midazolam is associated with the risk of respiratory depression and has no analgesic action. Contrastingly, dexmedetomidine, a selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist, has analgesic and sedative action with no risk of respiratory depression and has been used as premedication.</p><p>However, few studies have reported on the intranasal use of dexmedetomidine in radiological procedures. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, we compared intranasal midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) and intranasal dexmedetomidine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) in terms of hemodynamics; parental separation anxiety; and onset, level, and sedation quality at the time of patient induction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>After obtaining approval from the institutions&#x02019; Ethics Committee, written, informed, and valid consent was obtained from the parents of the patients after explaining the study protocol to them. This study included 60 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grades I and II patients who were aged 1&#x02013;8 years and were scheduled for brain MRI.</p><p>Patients aged &#x0003c;1 and &#x0003e;8 years, with parents&#x02019; refusal, ASA Grades III and IV, congenital heart disease, upper respiratory tract infection, and body mass index &#x0003e;35; being administered digoxin or beta blockers; and requiring emergency MRI were excluded from the study.</p><p>Preanesthetic assessment included medical and surgical history; general and systemic examination; airway examination; and investigations, such as complete hemogram and renal function tests, conducted on an outpatient basis. On the day of MRI, the nil by mouth status was confirmed, and parental consent was obtained.</p><p>Baseline saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and heart rate (HR) were monitored using a pulse oximeter. Electrocardiogram and respiratory rate (RR) were monitored using a respiration strap, and blood pressure (BP) was measured using a noninvasive BP cuff. The sedation level was assessed using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale, a 6-point sedation scale. The patients were randomly allocated to two groups. To avoid bias, observers and attending anesthesiologists were blinded to the study drug. Group M received intranasal midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) and Group D received intranasal dexmedetomidine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg). The intranasal drug was dripped into both nostrils using a 1-mL syringe, with the patients in the recumbent position. The time of dosage was noted, and the observer recorded SpO<sub>2</sub>, HR, systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), RR, and the sedation level at 5-min intervals for 30 min following drug administration.</p><p>The onset of sedation was defined as an increase in the sedation level compared with the baseline &#x02212;1 (change in the OAA/S score from 6 to 5). Adequate sedation was defined as the time taken to achieve an OAA/S score of 4 and was the time when the patients allowed intravenous cannulation without crying.</p><p>Within 15 min of cannulation, the patients underwent MRI. The behavior of the patients while entering the MRI room was monitored, and the OAA/S score at the time of induction was noted.</p><p>At the time of induction, an OAA/S score between 1 and 4 represented satisfactory sedation and of 5 or 6 represented unsatisfactory sedation. Time of induction was noted, and whether parental separation at the time of induction was successful was recorded. Sedation was considered successful when the patients were calm and sedated, were not crying and agitated, and allowed smooth induction. For induction, an intravenous bolus of 0.5 mg/kg propofol was administered for 2&#x02013;3 min, and the infusion was started at 100 &#x003bc;g/kg/min and increased to a maximum of 350 &#x003bc;g/kg/min, provided HR &#x0003e;60 beats/min, fall in SBP was &#x0003c;20% of the baseline value, and respiratory depression was absent (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;95). SpO<sub>2</sub>, HR, BP, and RR were noted at the time of induction, for every 5 min for the first 15 min and then for every 15 min until the end of brain MRI, which lasted for a maximum of 60 min.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size was calculated based on the results of a previous study[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] using the formula for quantitative statistical analysis with confidence level of 95% and an allowable error of 5%.

In addition, premedication has analgesic, amnesic, antisialagogue, antiemetic, and vagolytic effects. Various drugs are available for premedication, with midazolam being the most commonly used. However, midazolam is associated with respiratory depression and an increased incidence of adverse postoperative behavioral changes, hiccups, and paradoxical reactions.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Clonidine, a &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist, has also been suggested for premedication, but it has a slow onset of action (1&#x02013;3 h). Dexmedetomidine is a newer &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist with more selective action on &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors and a shorter half-life. Increasing evidence has shown that dexmedetomidine is an effective and safe sedative in children scheduled for radiological procedures.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Dexmedetomidine has analgesic and antishivering properties and does not cause respiratory depression.</p><p>Intranasal application is a relatively noninvasive, convenient, and easy route of administration and results in a faster onset of action as well as reduces first-pass metabolism.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Hence, we administered midazolam intranasally. Dexmedetomidine is only available in an intravenous formulation; intravenous preparation has been used through oral, transmucosal, and intranasal routes. Dexmedetomidine has been extensively studied intranasally in both children and adults. Investigations conducted by Yuen <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that intranasal dexmedetomidine produces significant sedation in healthy adults and in children aged between 2 and 12 years.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the time of onset of sedation is 8.7 &#x000b1; 3.7 min (5&#x02013;15 min) in Group M compared with 14.3 &#x000b1; 3 min (10&#x02013;20 min) in Group D.

In another study by Mostafa and Morsy comparing the use of dexmedetomidine, midazolam, and ketamine as intranasal premedication, the percentage of children who achieved child&#x02013;parent separation score Grade 1 was 93.8%, 87.5%, and 68%, respectively.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Sundaram and Mathian reported similar results.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>No significant change was observed in SpO<sub>2</sub> between the groups until the end of 30 min. None of the patients in both groups had SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003c; 95% at any point of time during patient monitoring. Similarly, SpO<sub>2</sub> was comparable in two studies comparing intranasal dexmedetomidine and midazolam, and none of the patients had SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003c; 95% at any point of time.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The baseline HR was comparable between the groups [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Dexmedetomidine is known to decrease sympathetic outflow and circulating catecholamine levels. HR, SBP, and DBP decreased from baseline after premedication, as expected. Sundaram and Mathian reported similar results.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>None of the children in both groups had untoward complications, such as bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, and respiratory depression, after premedication. Similar findings regarding side effects were noted in other studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Nasal irritation and stinging in addition to paradoxical reactions, such as restlessness and euphoria, are major disadvantages of the intranasal administration of midazolam and could be deterrents in its use as premedication. Several studies have reported these unwanted side effects in children.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Our study did not specifically observe the concerns of patients&#x02019; acceptance of the drug.</p><p>Contrastingly, dexmedetomidine does not cause any transient nasal burning or irritation, paradoxical reaction, hiccups, and respiratory depression. It acts on the locus coeruleus and produces an unusually cooperative form of sedation, in which the patient is calmly and easily aroused from sleep to wakefulness and subsequently quickly falls back asleep when not stimulated, which is similar to natural sleep. Therefore, children who had received dexmedetomidine had a tendency to awaken during transfer from parents&#x02019; lap to the MRI table but were quiet, calm, and cooperative.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We observed that intranasal dexmedetomidine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) results in more successful parental separation, better hemodynamics, higher sedation level, and more satisfactory sedation at the time of induction than intranasal midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) as premedication, with negligible side effects in MRI.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bisset</surname><given-names>GS</given-names><suffix>3rd</suffix></name><name><surname>Ball</surname><given-names>WS</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></person-group><article-title>Preparation, sedation, and monitoring of the pediatric patient in the magnetic resonance suite</article-title><source>Semin Ultrasound CT MR</source><year>1991</year><volume>12</volume><fpage>376</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1742052</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sundaram</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name><name><surname>Mathian</surname><given-names>VM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A comparative evaluation of intranasal dexmedetomidine and intranasal midazolam for premedication in children: A double blind RCT</article-title><source>JIDA</source><year>2011</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>777</fpage><lpage>81</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bergendahl</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>L&#x000f6;nnqvist</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name><name><surname>Eksborg</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clonidine: An alternative to benzodiazepines for premedication in children</article-title><source>Curr Opin Anaesthesiol</source><year>2005</year><volume>18</volume><fpage>608</fpage><lpage>13</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16534300</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mason</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name><name><surname>Zgleszewski</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Dearden</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Dumont</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name><name><surname>Pirich</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Stark</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Dexmedetomidine for pediatric sedation for computed tomography imaging studies</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2006</year><volume>103</volume><fpage>57</fpage><lpage>62</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16790626</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mason</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name><name><surname>Lubisch</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Roskos</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Epstein</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Intramuscular dexmedetomidine: An effective route of sedation preserves background activity for pediatric electroencephalograms</article-title><source>J Pediatr</source><year>2012</year><volume>161</volume><fpage>927</fpage><lpage>32</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22704249</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Malinovsky</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Populaire</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Cozian</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Lepage</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Lejus</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Pinaud</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Premedication with midazolam in children.
