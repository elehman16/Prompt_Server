Tafenoquine must be coadministered with a blood schizonticide, either chloroquine or artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). This open-label, randomized, parallel-group study evaluated potential drug interactions between tafenoquine and two ACTs: dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and artemether-lumefantrine. Healthy volunteers of either sex aged 18 to 65 years without glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency were randomized into five cohorts (<italic>n</italic> = 24 per cohort) to receive tafenoquine on day 1 (300 mg) plus once-daily dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine on days 1, 2, and 3 (120 mg/960 mg for 36 to &#x0003c;75 kg of body weight and 160 mg/1,280 mg for &#x02265;75 to 100 kg of body weight), or plus artemether-lumefantrine (80 mg/480 mg) in two doses 8 h apart on day 1 and then twice daily on days 2 and 3, or each drug alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters of tafenoquine, piperaquine, lumefantrine, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin were determined by using noncompartmental methods. Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals were calculated for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum observed plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) comparisons of tafenoquine plus ACT versus tafenoquine or ACT. All subjects receiving dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine experienced QTc prolongation (a known risk with this drug), but tafenoquine coadministration had no clinically relevant additional effect. Tafenoquine coadministration had no clinically relevant effects on dihydroartemisinin, piperaquine, artemether, or lumefantrine pharmacokinetics. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine coadministration increased the tafenoquine <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> by 38% (90% confidence interval, 25 to 52%), the AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>) by 12% (1 to 26%), and the half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) by 29% (19 to 40%), with no effect on the AUC from time zero to the time of the last nonzero concentration (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub>). Artemether-lumefantrine coadministration had no effect on tafenoquine pharmacokinetics. Tafenoquine can be coadministered with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or artemether-lumefantrine without dose adjustment for any of these compounds.

The hypnozoite stage allows <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> to survive in the host following antimalarial therapy, eventually reemerging to cause repeated clinical malaria episodes (relapses), weeks, months, or even years later. Not only do relapses represent a significant burden of morbidity, they also maintain <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> transmission, allowing the parasite to evade conventional malaria control measures.</p><p>The only treatment available for the prevention of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> relapse is the 8-aminoquinoline antihypnozoite agent primaquine. Primaquine is given in combination with the schizonticide chloroquine, which is required to clear acute blood-stage infection and to potentiate the antihypnozoite effect of primaquine. Chloroquine is given over 3 days, but primaquine dosing recommendations require 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg of body weight daily for 14 days (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), and treatment effectiveness is compromised by the lack of adherence to this regimen (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Tafenoquine is a long-acting synthetic analogue of primaquine currently in phase III clinical development for the prevention of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> relapse. In phase II studies, 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77 to 95%) of patients receiving a single 300-mg dose of tafenoquine in combination with standard 3-day chloroquine treatment were relapse-free at 6 months, compared with 77% (63 to 87%) of those receiving 15 mg/day primaquine for 14 days plus chloroquine and 38% (23 to 52%) of those who received chloroquine alone (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>The most significant risk for both primaquine and tafenoquine treatment is hemolysis in individuals who are glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). G6PD deficiency is an X-linked inherited condition widespread in areas where malaria is endemic, with an estimated overall prevalence of 8%, although this may be much higher in some populations (up to 33%) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Therefore, the most recent malaria treatment guidelines recommend pretreatment G6PD testing to exclude patients at the highest risk for hemolysis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Additionally, 8-aminoquinolines are known to increase methemoglobin levels when given at high doses, although clinical signs of methemoglobinemia are rare (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium vivax</named-content> malaria is treated with chloroquine in areas where this medicine remains effective. However, high-grade chloroquine resistance has been confirmed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Evidence of declining chloroquine efficacy in other areas where <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> is endemic is also accumulating, although surveillance is inadequate (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In areas where chloroquine-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> has been identified, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been adopted as first-line therapy for all malaria species. Thus, for the prevention of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> relapse, tafenoquine will need to be given in combination with either chloroquine or ACTs, depending on the resistance situation and local guidelines.</p><p>In a previous drug interaction study, no clinically significant safety or pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions were observed for tafenoquine coadministered with chloroquine in healthy subjects (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The present study aimed to characterize any pharmacokinetic drug interactions between tafenoquine and two widely used first-line ACTs, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP) and artemether-lumefantrine, in healthy subjects. These data will support clinical trials of tafenoquine plus ACTs in regions where chloroquine-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> has been identified or in countries where the first-line treatment for <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> is an ACT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design.</title><p>This was an open-label, randomized, five-cohort, parallel-group study conducted with healthy volunteers at a single study center (Parexel Early Phase Unit, Baltimore, MD, USA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

Female subjects had to be nonlactating and either without childbearing potential or with agreement to use approved methods of contraception and undergo a pregnancy test at screening and at enrollment, before drug treatment.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were G6PD deficiency (determined as G6PD activity of &#x0003c;70% of a locally defined median, i.e., 10.7 IU/g hemoglobin); history of thalassemia or methemoglobinemia; blood pressure outside the range of 80 to 140 mm Hg for systolic or 45 to 90 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure; hemoglobin levels outside the normal range; potassium levels of &#x0003c;4.0 mmol/liter; magnesium levels of &#x0003c;1.6 mg/dl (amended during the study from &#x0003c;1.8 mg/dl); positive hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening; positive HIV antibody test; history of liver disease, known hepatic or biliary abnormalities, or regular alcohol consumption; cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history of regular tobacco use; history of heparin sensitivity or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; history of sensitivity to study drugs; participation in a clinical trial or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the start of the study, exposure to more than four new chemical entities within the previous 12 months; consumption of citrus fruits for 7 days prior to the start of the study; use of other prescription or nonprescription drugs (except oral contraceptives); and use of herbal and dietary supplements within 7 days (14 days if the product is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives of the start of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study drug administration.</title><p>Study treatments were tafenoquine (150 mg per tablet) (GlaxoSmithKline), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine tetraphosphate (40 mg/320 mg per tablet) (Eurartesim; Sigma-Tau Industrie Farmaceutiche Riunite SPA), and artemether-lumefantrine (20 mg/120 mg per tablet) (Coartem; Novartis Pharmaceuticals). Subjects were randomized into five cohorts (<italic>n</italic> = 24 per cohort) to receive tafenoquine on day 1 (300 mg) plus once-daily dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine on days 1, 2, and 3 (120 mg/960 mg for subjects with a body weight of 36 to &#x0003c;75 kg and 160 mg/1,280 mg for subjects with a body weight of &#x02265;75 to 100 kg), or plus artemether-lumefantrine (80 mg/480 mg) with the second dose administered 8 h after the first dose on day 1 and then twice daily on days 2 and 3, or each drug given alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). No dose adjustments were allowed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Study procedures.</title><p>Subjects were screened for eligibility from 28 days to 2 days before enrollment and observed as inpatients from day 1 until 72 h post-first dose (day 3). Outpatient visits were scheduled for days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56. On days 1, 2, and 3, subjects were given a standard breakfast at a time that allowed them to finish eating just prior to study drug administration. Note that taking dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with food does not comply with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine tetraphosphate dosing recommendations (i.e., in order to reduce the potential for QT interval prolongation, each dose should be taken no less than 3 h after the last food intake, and no food should be taken within 3 h after each dose). However, based on previous clinical trials, tafenoquine has been administered with food to avoid any gastrointestinal tolerability issues. Thus, a low-fat meal was chosen for this study to provide a dietary recommendation that would be feasible for use in the clinical-trial setting and to anticipate real-world drug administration where medications may be taken with food despite recommendations. Lunch and dinner were provided only after any scheduled pharmacokinetic blood samples were obtained. All meal times during the 72-h-post-first-dose inpatient phase were consistent across cohorts. Subjects had to abstain from ingesting caffeine- or xanthine-containing products or alcohol for 24 h prior to the start of dosing until 72 h post-first dose and citrus fruits for 7 days before the first dose until 72 h post-first dose. Tobacco use was not allowed from screening until the final follow-up visit (day 56). Subjects were to abstain from strenuous exercise for 48 h prior to each blood sample collection. Dried blood spots were collected for G6PD genotyping.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Adverse events and laboratory assessments.</title><p>Physical examination was performed, medical history was taken at screening, and physical examination was repeated at days 4 and 56. Adverse events and serious adverse events were noted during screening, at the start of drug treatment on day 1, and at all subsequent visits and coded by using the MedDRA dictionary version 12.0 for all entries plus version 17.1 for four individual entries. Serious adverse events were those resulting in death, that were life-threatening, that resulted in disability/incapacity, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, congenital abnormality, or liver injury plus impaired liver function, or that were considered serious by the investigator. In addition, any hemoglobin decline of &#x02265;3.0 g/dl or 30% from the baseline (mean of predose and day &#x02212;1 results) associated with clinical evidence of hemolysis and no other explanation was recorded as a serious adverse event, and the subject was monitored until resolution.</p><p>Hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis testing were performed at screening and at predosing on day 1; on days 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, and 28; and where clinically indicated. Hematology testing included a full blood count, reticulocyte count, hemoglobin level determination, hematocrit determination, and percent methemoglobin determination. Clinical chemistry included liver function tests (the ULN values were 41 IU/liter for alanine aminotransferase, 34 IU/liter for aspartate aminotransferase, and 308 IU/liter for males and 192 IU/liter for females for creatine kinase) and determination of levels of total and direct bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine, blood glucose, electrolytes, CO<sub>2</sub>, uric acid, albumin, and total protein. Study treatment was stopped if the alanine aminotransferase level was &#x02265;3&#x000d7; the ULN.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Pharmacodynamic evaluation.</title><p>Triplicate 12-lead ECGs and vital signs were taken at screening; at predosing on day 1; and then singly at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h post-first dose plus at 52 h post-first dose for cohorts 1 and 3 and at days 7, 14, 28, and 56. Continuous cardiac telemetry was performed for cohorts 1 to 4 for at least 15 min prior to the first dose until 72 h post-first dose. If a subject had a QTcF of &#x0003e;480 ms at any time, the subject was to be monitored by telemetry until resolution. If an ECG demonstrated a prolonged QT interval, two more ECGs were obtained over a brief period, and study withdrawal was triggered by a QTcF of &#x0003e;500 ms or a change compared to the baseline QTcF of &#x0003e;60 ms with an absolute value of &#x0003e;480 ms, based on the average for triplicate ECGs. The change in the QTcF from the baseline over time was analyzed by mixed-effect models, with treatment, time, and the time-by-treatment interaction as fixed effects and subject as a random effect. The baseline QTcF was fitted as a covariate, and an unstructured covariance structure was used for repeated measures. Models were fitted separately to assess the interaction of tafenoquine with each ACT and point estimates of treatment differences, and corresponding two-sided 90% confidence intervals were determined for each ACT. The maximum change in the QTcF from the baseline was evaluated for each cohort and for cohorts receiving piperaquine; the change from the baseline at 52 h post-first dose was also analyzed. The baseline measurement was the average of triplicate measurements taken predose on day 1. The maximum change in QTcF from the baseline was analyzed by using an analysis-of-covariance model using the baseline QTcF as a covariate.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Pharmacokinetic assessments.</title><p>Blood samples (2 ml) for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected into tubes containing K3EDTA anticoagulant at time points relevant for the concentration-time curves of the experimental drugs (see Table SA1 in the supplemental material).

Validated analytical methods were used based on protein precipitation or liquid-liquid extraction, followed by-high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and tandem mass spectrometry with a Turbolonspray interface with positive-ion multiple-reaction monitoring. The lower limit of quantification (LLQ) and the higher limit of quantification (HLQ) for tafenoquine, dihydroartemisinin, artemether, piperaquine, and lumefantrine were 2 and 3,000 ng/ml, 1 and 2,000 ng/ml, 5 and 2,000 ng/ml, 2 and 2,000 ng/ml, and 4 and 4,000 ng/ml, respectively, using 25-&#x003bc;l, 125-&#x003bc;l, 125-&#x003bc;l, 100-&#x003bc;l, and 50-&#x003bc;l aliquots of K3EDTA-treated plasma, respectively.</p><p>For each analytical method, quality control (QC) samples that contained tafenoquine, piperaquine, dihydroartemisinin, artemether, or lumefantrine at concentrations spanning the calibration range of the method and that were stored with study samples were analyzed with each batch of samples against separately prepared calibration standards. The analysis was acceptable when no more than one-third of the QC results deviated from the nominal concentration by &#x0003e;15%, and at least 50% of the results from each QC concentration had to be within 15% of nominal value. Concentrations in the plasma samples were then calculated from the calibration plots. A weighted 1/<italic>x</italic><sup>2</sup> linear regression was applied in each case over the range of the lower to higher limits of quantification detailed above.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Pharmacokinetic analysis.</title><p>Plasma concentration-time data were analyzed by noncompartmental methods using linear up-log down interpolation with Phoenix WinNonlin v.6.2.1 (Certara, Princeton, NJ), based on observed data. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were determined: maximum observed plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>), time to <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) (total exposure during the dosing interval [AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x003c4;</sub>], predicted AUC from time zero to infinity [AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>], and AUC from time zero to the time of the last nonzero concentration [AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub>]), and apparent terminal-phase half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>). The AUCs were calculated over the following time windows: 28 days (672 h) for artemether, dihydroartemisinin (metabolite), and lumefantrine and 56 days (1,344 h) for dihydroartemisinin, piperaquine, and tafenoquine.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was the ratio of the geometric mean changes in <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x003c4;</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, or AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub>) for treatment comparisons of tafenoquine plus ACT (dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or artemether-lumefantrine) versus tafenoquine and of tafenoquine plus ACT versus ACT, determined as follows. Following log<sub><italic>e</italic></sub> transformation, the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC were determined separately for tafenoquine, piperaquine, artemether, dihydroartemisinin, and lumefantrine. Analysis-of-variance models with a single term for treatment were fitted separately for each analyte. Point estimates and their associated 90% CIs were constructed for differences between tafenoquine plus ACT (test) and either tafenoquine or ACT (reference). The point estimates and their associated 90% CIs were then exponentially back-transformed to provide point estimates and 90% CIs for the ratios of geometric means for the treatment comparisons.

Drug-related adverse events occurred in 33.3% (8/24) of subjects receiving dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (all mild except for one case of moderate headache) and in 16.7% (4/24) of subjects receiving tafenoquine plus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (all mild). Drug-related headache was more common with tafenoquine plus artemether-lumefantrine (16.7%; 4/24) than with artemether-lumefantrine (4.2%; 1/24), and this explained the increased rate of drug-related adverse events in the cohort that received tafenoquine plus artemether-lumefantrine (33.3%; 8/24) versus the artemether-lumefantrine cohort (25.0%; 6/24). In the cohort treated with tafenoquine plus artemether-lumefantrine, three subjects had drug-related adverse events of moderate severity (nausea/abdominal pain, headache/joint stiffness, and headache/dysuria), and the remainder were of mild severity. In the artemether-lumefantrine cohort, two subjects had drug-related adverse events of moderate severity (increased levels of hepatic enzymes and rhabdomyolysis), and the remainder were of mild severity.</p><p>There were no deaths in the study. In total, there were four treatment withdrawals caused by adverse events. Two subjects experienced serious adverse events and were withdrawn from the study. There was one serious adverse event of cardiac arrest in a 36-year-old male subject in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group, which was considered drug related. Two days after receiving the first dose of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, during a meal, the subject developed severe (grade 3) asystole. Upon cardiac telemetry, the subject had irregular bradycardia followed by asystole for 43 s, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated. Postarrest, vital signs included a blood pressure of 118/62 mm Hg and a heart rate of 66 beats per min. The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm and was essentially a normal ECG. Review of the baseline ECG revealed bradycardia of 50 beats per min with no other cardiac abnormalities. Retrospectively, the subject stated that he had diarrhea, but there was no other signs of infection. This was assessed by a local cardiologist at the time of the event as being most likely caused by high vagal tone, nausea, and diarrhea or a combination of a reaction to the study drug and his resting bradycardia. There was one serious adverse event in the artemether-lumefantrine group of moderate ventricular tachycardia in a subject with undisclosed preexisting palpitations upon exertion, which was not considered drug related. The remaining two treatment withdrawals were one case of dry eyes, classified as mild, in the artemether-lumefantrine group (not drug related) and one case of mild vomiting/fever/anorexia/dysuria and moderate headache in the group that received tafenoquine plus artemether-lumefantrine (drug related). There was an additional serious adverse event that did not lead to study withdrawal: a subject with undisclosed smoking and asthma who received dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine had pneumonia that was not thought to be treatment related. All of the above-described five subjects completed the study and recovered fully. There were no serious adverse events in any subject receiving tafenoquine.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Laboratory assessments.</title><p>There was no apparent effect of tafenoquine coadministration with ACTs on any indicators of liver function.

Additionally, in this subject, the creatine kinase level reached a peak of 50,115 IU/liter on day 8 (grade 4) but had decreased to 430 IU/liter by day 21. The subject was diagnosed with asymptomatic exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis, and this subject's laboratory values returned to normal, with no clinical sequelae.

Piperaquine plasma concentrations may be increased when it is coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors, with a potential exacerbation of the effect on QTc prolongation. Significant decreases in artemether, dihydroartemisinin (metabolite), and lumefantrine concentrations are observed with the coadministration of CYP3A4 inducers (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, based on all the available <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data, tafenoquine is unlikely to perpetrate any drug-drug interaction by CYP inhibition (CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and also CYP2D6) or as a result of the induction of CYP3A4 (tafenoquine investigator's brochure, document reference GM2007/00152/09 version 13, 7 December 2015; GlaxoSmithKline). This clinical study confirms the predicted lack of clinically significant drug interactions of tafenoquine coadministration with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or artemether-lumefantrine.</p><p>The study enrolled an adequate number of subjects based on between-subject coefficients of variation in the pharmacokinetic parameters for the analytes. For the analytes with high variability, the confidence intervals may be very wide and thus include 1.0, even though the point estimates indicate modest changes. For example, a 29% increase in the lumefantrine AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> was seen when artemether-lumefantrine was coadministered with tafenoquine. There is high variability in the bioavailability and, thus, the systemic concentrations of lumefantrine, as reported in literature (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Greater lumefantrine exposures than those obtained in the present study were reported previously, for example, a mean <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> of 25,700 ng/ml (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), compared to a geometric mean <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> of 20,445 ng/ml in the present study. With the short treatment duration, these minor increases in exposure are therefore not thought to be clinically relevant.</p><p>The frequency of adverse events with tafenoquine alone in this study was low (12.5%; 3/24). The frequency of headache was increased when tafenoquine was coadministered with artemether-lumefantrine, and headache was the most common adverse event with tafenoquine in this study across all cohorts (11.1%; 8/72). Headache was also the most common adverse event with 300 mg tafenoquine in a phase IIb clinical trial (18%; 10/57) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Otherwise, tafenoquine coadministration with ACT compared to administration of ACT alone did not result in an increase in the number of adverse events and did not affect the nature of the adverse events experienced. There were no serious adverse events experienced by any subject across the three cohorts that received tafenoquine.</p><p>Elevations in methemoglobin levels are known to occur with tafenoquine, and mild increases in methemoglobin levels (maximum, 4.1%) were observed in this study. However, methemoglobin levels were not increased with the coadministration of tafenoquine plus ACT. In a study of tafenoquine with or without chloroquine in healthy volunteers, all three subjects who received the combination had methemoglobin values of &#x0003e;10% (11.0 to 13.2%), with no clinical symptoms (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, in a phase IIb dose-ranging clinical trial, there were no cases of methemoglobinemia with tafenoquine at doses of up to 600 mg in combination with chloroquine (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Thus, it appears that the elevations of methemoglobin levels are not a clinical concern for the coadministration of tafenoquine with chloroquine or the ACTs tested in this study. Notably, there was no decline in hemoglobin levels of &#x0003e;2 g/dl in any cohort.</p><p>Tafenoquine alone had no effect on QTcF prolongation in this study, and these findings are consistent with data from preclinical studies and a formal thorough QT study and with clinical data for <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> patients, which show that tafenoquine has a low potential for QTcF prolongation (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). A previous drug interaction study demonstrated no additional effect of tafenoquine on QTcF when tafenoquine was coadministered with chloroquine (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and this has been supported by clinical evidence from a large phase IIb study including tafenoquine doses of up to 600 mg (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In the present study, there was no clinically relevant effect of artemether-lumefantrine with or without tafenoquine coadministration on QTcF.</p><p>Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is known to cause a prolongation of the QT interval (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), although there have been no reported cases of Torsades de Pointes. In this study, one subject receiving dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine experienced cardiac arrest, possibly caused by high vagal tone, nausea, and diarrhea. The principal investigator and local cardiologist felt that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine could also have contributed to this event. QTcF prolongation was observed for subjects receiving dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in this study, although changes in QTcF were not clinically significant. The pharmacokinetics observed for piperaquine in this study were similar to those previously reported for multiple dosing in healthy volunteers (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Piperaquine exposure is known to be increased with the consumption of a high-fat, high-calorie meal (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, the low-fat food provided in the present study did not appear to have any noticeable effect on piperaquine pharmacokinetics compared to data from previous studies of unfed healthy volunteers (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In the present study, no subject receiving dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine had a QTcF prolongation of &#x0003e;480 ms or had a difference from the baseline of &#x0003e;60 ms, and this is consistent with data from previous studies of unfed healthy volunteers (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). With tafenoquine plus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, there were small increases in the QTcF (4.55 to 5.63 ms) at 12, 24, and 48 h post-first dose versus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine alone but no difference at 52 h post-first dose, which is when any effect might have been expected given the pharmacodynamics of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Thus, coadministration of tafenoquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine had no additional clinically important effect on QTcF prolongation, and no dose adjustment is necessary. There are no reported data for QTc prolongation following dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment in patients with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> malaria. However, for <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium falciparum</named-content> malaria, QTc prolongation is more severe and more frequent in patients than in healthy volunteers, possibly because of increased piperaquine exposure in malaria patients (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The potential for QTc prolongation will therefore be closely monitored in planned larger studies of tafenoquine plus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in malaria patients in Asia.</p><p>The observed pharmacokinetics for tafenoquine administered alone in this study were similar to those reported previously in studies of volunteers (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Coadministration of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine increased tafenoquine exposure modestly, with the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> being increased by 38%. However, the tafenoquine geometric mean <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (274.7 ng/ml) observed following dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine coadministration in this study was still well below that observed for treatment with 600 mg tafenoquine (422 ng/ml) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) in <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> malaria patients (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), so this increased exposure to tafenoquine is of no clinical concern in individuals with normal G6PD levels. In G6PD-deficient individuals, the risk of hemolysis appears to increase with the tafenoquine dose (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), although such patients should be excluded from tafenoquine treatment.</p><p>In a previous study, coadministration of chloroquine (a 4-aminoquinoline, like piperaquine) also increased the tafenoquine <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> by 38% versus tafenoquine alone (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Studies with primaquine (an 8-aminoquinline, like tafenoquine) also showed increases in the primaquine <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> with coadministration with chloroquine (63% increase) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (48% increase) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Thus, the coadministration of 8-aminoquinolines (tafenoquine and primaquine) with 4-aminoquinolines (chloroquine and piperaquine) appears to produce a consistent increase in exposure for the 8-aminoquinoline without a reciprocal effect on the pharmacokinetics of the 4-aminoquinoline. One explanation could be competition between the two molecular classes for monoamine oxidase or cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism, with elimination of the 8-aminoquinolines being decreased, thus boosting exposure. However, this does not explain the effect of piperaquine on the increase in the tafenoquine <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, given the very slow elimination of tafenoquine. Notably, exposure to the primaquine metabolite carboxyprimaquine is also enhanced by 21% in combination with chloroquine and by 33% with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, reflecting the multiple metabolic pathways and metabolites associated with primaquine (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). There are no major metabolites of tafenoquine.</p><p>Tafenoquine coadministration increased the artemether AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x003c4;</sub> by 81%. However, in subjects receiving artemether-lumefantrine alone or with tafenoquine, the exposure parameter AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x003c4;</sub> was calculated for only a limited number of subjects after the last dose of artemether-lumefantrine. This was clearly attributable to the short <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of artemether (&#x0223c;2 h). Thus, the exposure comparisons were based primarily on AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> values. The <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> estimates for artemether were in complete agreement with historically reported values (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This lends further support for the use of AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> to compare exposures upon coadministration. There was no impact of tafenoquine coadministration on the artemether AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub>. Thus, no dose adjustment is deemed necessary for artemether-lumefantrine coadministered with tafenoquine. There was no effect of tafenoquine (8-aminoquinline) on lumefantrine (aryl-amino-alcohol) pharmacokinetics, and this is consistent with the lack of an effect of primaquine (8-aminoquinoline) on mefloquine (aryl-amino-alcohol) pharmacokinetics (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>Tafenoquine is being investigated as a single-dose therapy for the prevention of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> relapse and will need to be coadministered with a blood schizonticide drug, either chloroquine or an ACT, depending on parasite drug resistance. This study demonstrates that there were no clinically significant drug interactions between tafenoquine and the first-line ACTs dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and artemether-lumefantrine. Thus, no dosing adjustment is deemed necessary for the coadministration of these drugs with tafenoquine. There was no evidence of any increased safety risk, and known safety issues with each of the drugs tested were not exacerbated by their coadministration. Further clinical studies will investigate the combination of tafenoquine plus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in regions with chloroquine-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content>.</p></sec>
