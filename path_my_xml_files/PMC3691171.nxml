Users report buying them to help quit smoking, to reduce cigarette consumption, to relieve tobacco withdrawal symptoms, and to continue having a &#x02018;smoking&#x02019; experience, but with reduced health risks. Research on e-cigarettes is urgently needed in order to ensure that the decisions of regulators, healthcare providers and consumers are based on science.</p><p>
<italic>Methods</italic> ECLAT is a prospective 12-month randomized, controlled trial that evaluates smoking reduction/abstinence in 300 smokers not intending to quit experimenting two different nicotine strengths of a popular e-cigarette model (&#x02018;Categoria&#x02019;; Arbi Group Srl, Italy) compared to its non-nicotine choice. GroupA (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;100) received 7.2 mg nicotine cartridges for 12 weeks; GroupB (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;100), a 6-week 7.2 mg nicotine cartridges followed by a further 6-week 5.4 mg nicotine cartridges; GroupC (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;100) received no-nicotine cartridges for 12 weeks. The study consisted of nine visits during which cig/day use and exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) levels were measured. Smoking reduction and abstinence rates were calculated. Adverse events and product preferences were also reviewed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Declines in cig/day use and eCO levels were observed at each study visits in all three study groups (p&#x0003c;0.001 vs baseline), with no consistent differences among study groups. Smoking reduction was documented in 22.3% and 10.3% at week-12 and week-52 respectively. Complete abstinence from tobacco smoking was documented in 10.7% and 8.7% at week-12 and week-52 respectively. A substantial decrease in adverse events from baseline was observed and withdrawal symptoms were infrequently reported during the study. Participants&#x02019; perception and acceptance of the product under investigation was satisfactory.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In smokers not intending to quit, the use of e-cigarettes<monospace>, </monospace>with or without nicotine, decreased cigarette consumption and elicited enduring tobacco abstinence without causing significant side effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01164072 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01164072">NCT01164072</ext-link>

The World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) advises that the key to reducing the health burden of tobacco is to encourage abstinence among smokers <xref rid="pone.0066317-World2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Currently available smoking-cessation medications (including nicotine replacement therapy - NRT, buproprion and varenicline) are known to increase the likelihood of quitting smoking, particularly if combined with counseling programs <xref rid="pone.0066317-Fiore1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, they lack high levels of efficacy in real-life settings [reviewed in 5]. Consequently, more effective approaches are needed to reduce the burden of cigarette smoking.</p><p>E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices designed to vaporize a liquid solution of propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerin in which nicotine or other aromas may be dissolved <xref rid="pone.0066317-Hon1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Puffing activates a battery-operated heating element in the atomizer and the liquid in the cartridge is vaporized as a plume of mist that is inhaled. As e-cigarettes do not burn tobacco, these products may be considered a lower risk substitute for factory-made cigarettes <xref rid="pone.0066317-Caponnetto1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Most e-cigarettes are designed to look like traditional cigarettes and simulate the visual, sensory, and behavioural aspects of smoking traditional cigarettes <xref rid="pone.0066317-Caponnetto1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Moreover a recent internet survey on the satisfaction of e-cigarette use has reported that the device helped in smoking abstinence and improved smoking-related symptoms <xref rid="pone.0066317-EtterJFElectronic1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These factors indicate that the e-cigarettes may be an effective and safe cigarette substitute, and therefore merits further evaluation for this purpose.</p><p>In two recent case series, we reported objective measures of long-term smoking abstinence in inveterate smokers with severe nicotine dependence and/or major depression who quit after taking up an e-cigarette <xref rid="pone.0066317-Caponnetto2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066317-Caponnetto3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Moreover, in a prospective 6-month proof-of-concept study, e-cigarettes were shown to substantially decrease cigarette consumption without causing significant side effects in 40 smokers not intending to quit <xref rid="pone.0066317-Polosa1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Obviously, these products need to be adequately regulated. Thus far, there have been heterogeneous regulatory responses ranging from no regulation to complete bans. In Italy, &#x02018;Categoria&#x02019; e-cigarettes (&#x02018;Categoria&#x02019;; Arbi Group Srl, Italy) have been approved for marketing in 2010 by the Italian Institutes of Health (ISS &#x02013; Istituto Superiore di Sanit&#x000e0;). However, the WHO&#x02019;s Study Group on Tobacco Product Regulation advised a negative approach to e-cigarettes <xref rid="pone.0066317-World3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The basis for this regulatory conclusion is uncertain, and more research on e-cigarettes must be conducted in order to ensure that the decisions of regulators, healthcare providers and consumers are based on science <xref rid="pone.0066317-Etter1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Consequently, formal appraisal of regular e-cigarette use in relation to reducing tobacco smoking consumption and the possibility of adverse events is now required to confirm and expand preliminary positive findings <xref rid="pone.0066317-Caponnetto2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0066317-Polosa1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066317-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>With this in mind, we designed ECLAT, the first randomized controlled trial investigating the EffiCacy and safety of an eLectronic cigAreTte. ECLAT is a prospective 12-month double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical study to evaluate smoking reduction, smoking abstinence and adverse events in smokers not intending to quit experimenting two different nicotine strengths of a very popular e-cigarette brand (&#x02018;Categoria&#x02019;; Arbi Group Srl, Italy). As it was unrealistic to also have a control group specifically for e-cigarette use given the &#x0201c;naturalistic&#x0201d; setting and study population, ECLAT was &#x02018;controlled&#x02019; only in relation to the comparison among different nicotine strengths.

Once again, no significant difference was observed among the three study groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The e-cigarette is a very controversial topic, which calls for a balanced analysis of the risks and benefits of these products. Currently, only limited evidence is available and rigorous research on e-Cigarettes is required to guide the decisions of regulators, healthcare providers and consumers. Here, we present the results of ECLAT, the first randomized controlled trial addressing the impact of e-Cigarette use in relation to smoking reduction, smoking abstinence and safety long-term. ECLAT reveals important and persistent modifications in the smoking habits of 300 smokers (not intending to quit) using e-cigarettes, resulting in significant smoking reduction and smoking abstinence. These positive findings were associated with a substantial decrease in adverse events. Moreover, a limited evaluation of withdrawal symptoms indicates that they were reported only occasionally.</p><p>Based on our previous experience with smoking cessation media campaigns, the large participation in ECLAT following placement of advertisements in a local newspaper was unexpected. This was driven by an important factor: curiosity. Please note that advertisements were promoted in 2010 when &#x02013; at least in Italy &#x02013; the level of awareness of e-cigarettes was very low. Thus, it is more plausible that subjects took interest in the study because they were simply curious about a new electronic product looking like a cigarette and wanted to try it on. For this reason, we are confident that participants enrolled in ECLAT were not interested in quitting.</p><p>Soon after inclusion in the study, smokers substantially reduced cig/day use from baseline by more than 50% in all three study groups and this was coupled by reductions in eCO levels. The level of reduction in cig/day use reported here is in agreement with those reported in surveys of e-cigarette users <xref rid="pone.0066317-EtterJFElectronic1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066317-Etter2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066317-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and in our earlier work with the same product <xref rid="pone.0066317-Polosa1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The observed reduction in cig/day use appears to be unrelated to the nicotine content in the cartridges, the non-nicotine study group (C) behaving like both nicotine groups (A and B) at most time-points. This was unpredicted, bringing into question the key function of nicotine in cigarette dependence and suggesting that other factors such as the rituals associated with cigarette handling and manipulation may also play an important role <xref rid="pone.0066317-Fagerstrom2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066317-Caponnetto4" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>The percentage decrease in cig/day use from baseline was greater that the percentage decrease in eCO. Besides the obvious element of compensation (i.e. more intense puffing) when smoking fewer cig/day, there is also the possibility that a variability in the time lapse from the last cigarette smoked before eCO measurements may introduce inconsistency (i.e. higher than expected eCO values).</p><p>Switching to e-cigarettes resulted in significant smoking reduction and smoking abstinence with a substantial number of quitters (26.9%) still using these products by week-52.</p><p>Of note, those who abstained completely from tobacco from the beginning of the study were more likely to stay quit at subsequent follow-ups, whereas those who at first became reducers (dual users) were more likely to relapse later on in the study. Quit rates in the control group (C) were consistently lower at each visit, with a difference that was statistically significant for the most part of the intervention phase of the study. This seems to be in contrast with the earlier interpretation of the observed reduction in cig/day use being unrelated to the nicotine content (discussed earlier). Indeed, saliva cotinine levels in those who had completely switched to the e-cigarette were measurable only in those belonging to groups A and B (and markedly correlates with the number of cartridges/day), however with the exception of a handful of participants, saliva cotinine levels were well below the concentration threshold considered to be representative for regular smokers <xref rid="pone.0066317-Wall1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> or experienced e-cigarette users <xref rid="pone.0066317-Etter3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This is not surprising considering that the model under investigation is not very efficient at delivering nicotine <xref rid="pone.0066317-Goniewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, this product is equipped with a small 90 mAh lithium-ion battery that allows (on a full charge) only about 50&#x02013;70 puffs. Newer models are now equipped with much higher voltage batteries, thus allowing thicker vapour and up to 500 puffs. Last but not least, technical issues (es. malfunctions) were not uncommon with the model under investigation<monospace>.</monospace> In our opinion, it is likely that with this underperforming model all three study groups were similarly behaving as controls, with a minor advantage in quit/reduction rates seen in study group A and B is essentially due to other factors mainly associated to participants&#x02019; satisfaction/pleasure such as product&#x02019;s taste/flavour. In the present investigation, the &#x0201c;sweet tobacco&#x0201d; aroma of the cartridges used in study group C was considered unpleasant by a large number of respondents (18/25; 72%) compared to the other 2 groups (37.8% and 26.7% in group B and A, respectively). To this end, it is interesting to note that smoking reduction/cessation failures used significantly less cartridges with respect to reducers and quitters at each visit.</p><p>Given that all smokers were - by inclusion criteria - not interested in quitting, and that the model under investigation was underperforming the rates reported in the present study are impressive. It is possible that for some participants, satisfaction from e-cigarette use was good enough to compensate for their need of own brand cigarette. Indeed the replacement of the ritual of smoking gestures and cigarette handling, the opportunity to use the product in public places and to reduce bad smell, as well as the perception of an improved general sense of wellbeing might have been the cause for the substantial success rates of the ECLAT study.</p><p>Although ECLAT findings are not directly comparable with classic cessation and/or reduction studies because of its design (unlike these studies, the ECLAT study sample was characterized by participants selected specifically for their lack of interest in quitting and the subjects were not encouraged to quit smoking, nor provided any help), the observed 52-week abstinence rate appears to be similar to that published in the medical literature with first-line medications for nicotine dependence <xref rid="pone.0066317-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066317-Nides1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, it cannot be excluded that some of the participants were in fact unintentionally ready to quit given that no formal assessment of their readiness to quit was carried out.</p><p>ECLAT is also the first study to address the impact of e-cigarette use in relation to long-term safety. At study outset, typical smokers&#x02019; symptoms were documented, but use of &#x0201c;Categoria&#x0201d; e-cigarettes resulted in significant progressive health improvements with no difference among study groups. Specifically, of all symptoms that progressively decreased throughout the study with the use of the product, shortness of breath was substantially reduced (from 20 to 4%) already by week-2.</p><p>Although withdrawal symptoms were determined as part of the AEs adverse events assessment, hunger, insomnia, irritability, anxiety, and dysphoric or depressed mood) were uncommon. Withdrawal symptoms are know to be responsible for the impaired ability to achieve and sustain abstinence <xref rid="pone.0066317-Tobacco1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. It is possible that the e-cigarette by providing a coping mechanism for conditioned smoking cues could mitigate withdrawal symptoms and the desire to smoke associated with smoking reduction and smoking abstinence <xref rid="pone.0066317-Bullen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0066317-Dawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Moreover, e-cigarettes appear to improve cognitive effects during tobacco abstinence <xref rid="pone.0066317-Dawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Taken together these mechanisms suggest that e-cigarettes may act as an efficient relapse prevention tool thus providing a plausible explanation for the reduction/cessation rates observed in ECLAT. However, although assessment of symptoms in ECLAT was meticulous, we cannot exclude some degree of recall bias and the reported lack of withdrawal symptoms in the study participants should be considered with caution.</p><p>Objective assessment of vital signs were recorded at baseline and at each subsequent study visit. In the ECLAT study, we reported no changes in resting heart rate, and systolic/diastolic blood pressure. Moreover, no serious adverse events (i.e. major depression, abnormal behaviour or any event requiring unscheduled visit to the family practitioner or hospitalisation) occurred during the study.</p><p>Notably, no weight gain was observed in the ECLAT sample. This is somewhat surprising given that smoking cessation is typically associated with significant increase in body weight <xref rid="pone.0066317-Aubin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Thus, the &#x02018;Categoria&#x02019; e-cigarette might not only be a safer alternative to smoking tobacco, but can also reduce cigarette consumption with no weight concern.</p><p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic gas and high concentrations are known to be generated during cigarette combustion. Hence, exhaled CO has been universally adopted as a biomarker of exposure to cigarette smoke. Thus, it was not surprising to observe that the smoking reduction/abstinence achieved with use of &#x02018;Categoria&#x02019; e-cigarette was associated with a significant decrease in exhaled CO level from baseline. This is in agreement with previous acute studies with a number of different models <xref rid="pone.0066317-Bullen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066317-Vansickel1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and in net contrast with other electronic nicotine delivery devices (ENDDs) such as Eclipse (which has been shown to generate substantial levels of eCO) <xref rid="pone.0066317-Fagerstrom3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>By the end of the study, 26.9% of quitters were still using e-cigarettes; consequently 73.1% of the quitters were completely freed from their smoking dependence. Thus the large majority of smokers who were successful in quitting using the e-cigarette were successful not only in quitting smoking, but in eventually stopping use of the e-cigarette as well. This is surprising and contradicts the popular conception that the e-cigarette is not effective because people are substituting one addiction for another. In trying to provide an explanation, we noticed that once smokers who were successful in quitting using the e-cigarette realized that they did not need tobacco smoking anymore, they could choose not to smoke and/or use the product. Hence, e-cigarette use played a role by boosting smokers confidence in their ability to quit. However, it must be also noted that, participants who later discontinued the use of e-cigarette went back to smoking their own brand, suggesting that dynamic changes in motivation levels may have occurred in both directions in ECLAT with smokers losing or acquiring confidence in their ability to quit at different time points.</p><p>Collectively, the evidence that e-cigarettes helps reducing cigarette consumption and elicits enduring tobacco abstinence without causing significant side effects in individuals unable or not wishing to quit can be seen as an emerging novel approach to tobacco harm reduction <xref rid="pone.0066317-Cahn1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Cigarette smokers, who consider their tobacco use a recreational habit that they wish to maintain in a more benign form, rather than a problem to be medically treated, may have the option of switching to a less harmful source of nicotine. In addition, the current findings of ECLAT and recent research with e-cigarettes <xref rid="pone.0066317-Caponnetto2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0066317-Polosa1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> indicates that these products may also be attractive in managing smokers who are not ready to repeat a quit attempt and decline further assistance after relapse <xref rid="pone.0066317-Caponnetto5" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>The model under investigation sufficiently well rated on a range of subjective indicators of users&#x02019; perception and satisfaction among all study groups. Satisfaction level, in particular, indicates that room for improvement is needed and that the product was not performing adequately as cigarette substitute. Many respondents complained of the frequent failures, lack of durability, difficulty of use (it takes time to familiarize with the puffing technique), and poor taste of the product tested. This is likely to have affected the level of satisfaction with the product and consequently might have been the cause for the number of lost to follow-up and reduction/smoking failures. Nonetheless, participants were prone to recommend the &#x0201c;Categoria&#x0201d; e-cigarette to friends and/or relatives.</p><p>When interpreting the outcomes of the ECLAT study, we need to take into considerations some factors. First, because of its unusual design (e.g. smokers not wishing to quit) it is not an ordinary cessation study, hence direct comparison with other smoking cessation products cannot be made.</p><p>Second, study design was mainly based on the concept that nicotine is of main importance in dictating smoking addiction, but lacked of a control group specifically for e-cigarette use, We considered unrealistic to have a control for e-cigarette use <italic>per se</italic> in a study in which smokers were not interested in quitting. However, to provide an idea of the size of the effect, please consider that the quit rate of up to 8.7% at 1-year follow up in ECLAT compares very favorably with the national average cessation rate of 0.02% on an yearly basis over the 2001&#x02013;2011 period in the general population (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.istat.it">www.istat.it</ext-link>). We are confident that these findings cannot simply relate to participants self-selection; a genuine effect in term of reduction in tobacco consumption is shown with regular use of these products. Third approximately 40% of the participants failed to attend their final follow-up visit, however this is not unexpected in a smoking cessation study <xref rid="pone.0066317-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Fourth, failure to complete the study and several smoking cessation failures could be due to the frequency of technical issues (e.g. e-cigarette malfunctions). Fifth, at time of writing the product tested in ECLAT (model &#x0201c;401&#x0201d;) has become obsolete and is underperforming compared with current models. This model is now discontinued from production. However, when the study was first designed in 2009, it was the only option available to us to investigate an e-cigarette. In future, it will be interesting to compare present findings with those obtained with newer models. Sixth, findings with the product tested in ECLAT cannot be extended to other models and in particular to those belonging to higher quality range. Last but not least, the findings reported from urban Sicilian residents in ECLAT may not be valid for other population samples as it must take into account specific socio-cultural conditions (e.g. the so-called &#x0201c;coffee puff-break&#x0201d; is still considered norm despite the antismoking legislation in Italy).</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study demonstrate that e-cigarettes hold promise in serving as a means for reducing the number of cigarettes smoked, and can lead to enduring tobacco abstinence as has also been shown with the use of FDA-approved smoking-cessation medications <xref rid="pone.0066317-Fiore1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066317-Bolliger1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In view of the fact that subjects in this study had no immediate intention of quitting, the reported overall abstinence rate of 8.7% at 52-week was remarkable. In comparison, in a study of varenicline in smokers that were motivated to quit, the group treated with 1.0 mg twice per day experienced a 52-week quit rate of 14.4% versus 4.9% in the control group <xref rid="pone.0066317-Nides1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Moreover, these positive results were obtained together with an important reduction in frequency of reported symptoms. Although, these data are promising, they are not definitive and more research about long term safety of these products is still required.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Arbi Group Srl for the free supplies of &#x02018;Categoria&#x02019; e-cigarette kits and cartridges and for the technical support.
