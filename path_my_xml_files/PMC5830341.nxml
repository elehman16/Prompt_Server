Postoperative ileus (POI) can occur as a common complication of anesthesia and surgery after various types of abdominal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The neuronal reflex required for gastrointestinal motility can be temporarily inhibited during surgery, causing nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and delaying the postoperative time to first flatus and defecation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Numerous clinical research studies have shown that failure to restore adequate bowel function can result in a series of complications, including infection and intestinal adhesion, leading to prolonged hospital stay, and increased costs and readmission rates. The incidence of POI after abdominal surgery is 10&#x02013;30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Reliable data demonstrate that the total cost of surgery can double for patients with, compared with those without, POI ($16,612 vs. $8316; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The Chinese herbal medicine <italic>Xiangbin</italic> prescription (XBP) has been proven to accelerate the recovery of bowel function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; however, its use lacks compliance with Good Clinical Practice standards. To extend and ensure the appropriate use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), rigorous studies are needed to ensure the safe and effective use of Chinese herbal medicines for the improvement of gastrointestinal motility.</p><p id="Par20">XBP is prescribed as standard in our hospital to promote recovery of gastrointestinal function after abdominal surgery. The function of XBP has been determined based on previous clinical practice, which has demonstrated that the prescription can safely and effectively restore gastrointestinal motility after abdominal surgery. We have conducted numerous research studies into gastrointestinal motility in recent years, and we consider that anesthesia and surgery lead to the POI, referred to as the syndromes, <italic>Qi</italic> deficiency and <italic>Qi</italic> stagnation, in Chinese medicine.
