Failure to screen for retinopathy exposes primary care patients with diabetes to risk of eye complications. Screening is initiated by referral from family practitioners but adherence to guidelines is suboptimal. We aimed to evaluate the ability of printed educational messages aimed at family doctors to increase retinal screening of primary care patients with diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Design: Pragmatic 2&#x000d7;3 factorial cluster trial randomized by physician practice, involving 5,048 general practitioners (with 179,833 patients with diabetes). Setting: Ontario family practitioners. Interventions: Reminders (that retinal screening helps prevent diabetes-related vision loss and is covered by provincial health insurance for patients with diabetes) with prompts to encourage screening were mailed to each physician in conjunction with a widely-read professional newsletter. Alternative printed materials formats were an &#x02018;outsert&#x02019; (short, directive message stapled to the outside of the newsletter), and/or a two-page, evidence-based article (&#x02018;insert&#x02019;) and a pre-printed sticky note reminder for patients. Main outcome measure: A successful outcome was an eye examination (which includes retinal screening) provided to a patient with diabetes, not screened in the previous 12&#x000a0;months, within 90&#x000a0;days after visiting a family practitioner. Analysis accounted for clustering of doctors within practice groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No intervention effect was detected (eye exam rates were 31.6% for patients of control physicians, 31.3% for the insert, 32.8% for the outsert, 32.3% for those who received both, and 31.2% for those who received both plus the patient reminder with the largest 95% confidence interval around any effect extending from &#x02212;1.3% to 1.1%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This large trial conclusively failed to demonstrate any impact of printed educational messages on screening uptake. Despite their low cost, printed educational messages should not be routinely used in attempting to close evidence-practice gaps relating to diabetic retinopathy screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN72772651">ISRCTN72772651</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1748-5908-9-87) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Gaps between evidence-based ideal clinical practice and what doctors actually do can be responsible for substantial harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For example, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering drugs have been shown to reduce re-hospitalizations and mortality following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), yet these drugs are underprescribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Printed educational messages (PEMs) directed to doctors may be one way to address such gaps. PEMs have the considerable advantage of low cost and easy dissemination, so even small improvements may be efficiently obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, the evidence on their effectiveness is contradictory. Freemantle <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a systematic review of the effects of PEMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. None of the small number of included trials found statistically significant improvements in practice, leading to the conclusion that PEMs were ineffective. When Farmer <italic>et al.</italic> updated this review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] using a superior analytic approach (summarising observed effect sizes instead of vote counting studies with statistically significant effects), they observed a median absolute improvement of care of 4.9% (range &#x02212;8.0% to +9.6%), on par with other much more expensive interventions like audit and feedback, or academic outreach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A further updated review by Gigu&#x000e8;re <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] observed smaller improvements in care (median absolute improvement of care of 2.0%, range 0 to +11.0%), and argued for the need for additional primary research and further investigation of different characteristics of PEMS in head-to-head comparisons. These contradictory findings leave policy makers uncertain about the role of PEMs, at a time when closing evidence-to-practice gaps may offer a more cost-effective investment of health system resources than developing new interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Reviews cannot overcome limitations of the primary evidence. There are few trials of PEMs, often small in size with methodological weaknesses (for example unit of analysis errors in cluster randomized trials). To clarify the usefulness of PEMs, large, pragmatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and well-designed randomized controlled trials on the effect of PEMs on guideline adherence, conducted in real world settings, amongst typical practitioners are needed. The Ontario Printed Education Materials (OPEM) trial on retinopathy screening was such a trial: a large pragmatic cluster randomised trial powered to be able to detect small effects.</p><p>In Ontario, diabetes mellitus (diabetes) affects over 15% of women and 19% of men aged 65&#x000a0;years and older. Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication, affecting about 70% of persons with type 1 diabetes and 40% of persons with type 2 diabetes, and is the leading cause of preventable blindness in Canadians aged 30 to 69 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Most vision loss related to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented through retinal screening examinations and appropriate treatment. Early treatment has been shown to decrease the risk of severe vision loss from proliferative diabetic retinopathy by 90% and the risk of vision loss from macular oedema by 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Evidence-based practice guidelines in Canada call for screening for retinopathy at the time of diagnosis and every two years thereafter for everyone with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Under the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) Ontario residents have universal public health insurance, including free at point of service access to family practitioner (FP) care. Eye examinations (which include retinal screening), performed by an optometrist, FP, or ophthalmologist, are also an insured service, and thus are free at point of service to patients without any out-of-pocket payment, for all adults aged 65&#x000a0;years and older and also for those under age 65 who have been diagnosed with diabetes.</p><p>Yet in Ontario, the observed screening rates within the first year of diabetes diagnosis falls far below recommended levels (43% and 50% for diabetes patients aged 30 to 49 and 50 to 64 respectively).</p><p>If the impact on screening uptake of PEMs was indeed 5% improvement, then at the trivial cost of a letter to each FP, Ontario&#x02019;s rate of screening and treatment, especially among younger patients, could be substantially increased, averting blindness in more than 100 Ontarians per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>We report here a trial of PEMs, evaluating their impact on screening rates for diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the study was to determine whether sending a PEM to FPs (and the format of the PEM) would affect the likelihood that a patient visiting their doctor would receive an eye exam within 90&#x000a0;days of their visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>These are presented in detail in our published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and randomisation</title><p>The study was a pragmatic, factorial, cluster-randomized controlled trial (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Thus, the estimate of effect for the presumably strongest &#x02018;dose&#x02019; of intervention is of trivial clinical value, is not statistically significantly superior compared no intervention, and the confidence interval does not contain values of clinical importance.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>

Group practices were not taken into account for this crude analysis.</p><p>
<sup>&#x02020;</sup>The model was adjusted for these patient variables: age, gender, length of time diagnosed with diabetes, and whether the patient had an eye examination at any time in the two years prior to the office visit. The model was adjusted for these physician variables: year of graduation, gender, place of training, type of practice (solo/group), place of practice (rural/urban), and elapsed time between the mail-out and the office visit.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>While the probability of having an eye examination depended on patient age and rises sharply at age 65, there was no indication that intervention effectiveness varied with patient age.</p><p>The intracluster correlation coefficient was 0.024 (95% confidence interval 0.022 to 0.025).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the face of the previous uncertainty about the effectiveness of printed educational materials in changing physician behaviour, this study, with sufficient power to detect even a small effect, failed to change practitioner behaviour, as measured by retinal screening rates among patients with diabetes. The intervention was a faithful operationalisation of the sort of printed educational materials that are routinely used and explored both long and short formats; this can be regarded as an evaluation of a realistic intervention.</p><p>The effectiveness of printed educational materials depends on the message being received by the physicians at whom the PEMs were aimed, read, judged credible, transmitted to (and acted on by) patients who might benefit from screening. The first three steps appear likely to have occurred: The reliability of the postal services in Canada are such that we can be confident that the materials were successfully delivered. They are also likely to have been read and judged credible: In 1997, The Strategic Council Inc., a market research organisation, contacted 500 Ontario physicians by phone to determine readership and recall of <italic>informed</italic>. They found that 71% of the respondents recalled receiving <italic>informed</italic> and that of these, 89% found it useful or very useful and 53% read most or every issue (internal report, personal communication, Dianne Kelsall, editor of <italic>informed</italic>).</p><p>It is possible that the physicians did recommend screening but did not make a referral or that patients did not keep their ophthalmology appointments. However, given that eye examinations are free for Ontario patients with diabetes and for all people aged 65 and over (in which group eye examination among patients with diabetes rises to 89% coverage within one year of diagnosis), it seems unlikely that patients with diabetes would fail to take up their physician&#x02019;s recommendation simply because they are not yet 65. Thus patient failure to respond to the physician recommendation seems to be an unlikely explanation for the lack of impact of our intervention. We believe that the message was likely received, read, and judged credible by physicians, and would not have been ignored by patients. Yet PEMs were not successful at improving patient screening rates.</p><p>This suggests that PEMs simply failed to improve physician knowledge regarding the availability of free tests for patients with diabetes who were aged under 65; alternatively the PEMs failed to either influence the transmission of this message to patients or to lead to referral.</p><p>The content of our PEMs was not based on a prior assessment of barriers to screening and so it is possible that these are not the relevant barriers. Perhaps the actual barriers to improved screening lie elsewhere, with possibilities including the organisation of screening or patient factors such as motivation or geographical access. These potential barriers are indicated by the process study conducted in parallel with this RCT on a subsample of practitioners, and reported alongside [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>This study is reliable and was conducted under realistic conditions to mimic typical programme delivery. The use of administrative data as the source of our outcome measure allowed us to include nearly the complete population of family practitioners and all of their eligible patients, to be able to provide a definitive result. This trial is one of the largest published randomised trials of knowledge translation or implementation to date, and given its power a false negative result is unlikely.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This real-world study supports the conclusion that PEMs, whether long and discursive or short and directive, and with or without patient reminder notes, do not change physician behaviour as measured by adherence to evidence based screening recommendations for diabetic retinopathy. These results strongly suggest that the use of PEMs alone is not a useful strategy for closing this evidence-practice gap, and underline the importance of continuing to explore complementary or alternative behaviour change interventions. We have replicated these results for two prescribing behaviours (in preparation) and further replication for diagnostic and other therapeutic behaviours would be informative.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Authors&#x02019; information</title><p>Retired: Pamela M.
