visual restriction and unstable base dual-task training (VUDT), the visual restriction
dual-task training (VDT), and the unstable base dual-task training (UDT) on the balance
and attention of chronic stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 38
chronic stroke patients, who were divided into two groups of 13 patients each and one
group of 12 patients. They were given dual-task training for 30 minutes per session, three
times a week, for eight weeks. Their balance was measured using the center of pressure
(COP) migration distances, functional reach test (FRT), and Berg balance scale (BBS), and
attention was measured with the Trail Making Tests and the Stroop test. [Results] In
comparisons within each group, all the three groups showed significant differences before
and after the training (p&#x0003c;0.05), and in the comparisons among the three groups, the
VUDT group showed more significant differences compared with the other two groups in all
tests (p&#x0003c;0.05). [Conclusion] Dual-task training applied with visual restriction and an
unstable base in which the subjects attempted to maintain their balance was effective in
improving the balance and attention of stroke patients, and the VUDT was more effective
than VDT or UDT.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Dual task</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stoke is a central nervous system disease caused by partial loss of brain function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It causes loss of positional control that
leads to instability, which in turn brings about reduced balancing ability, concentration
difficulty, and decreased independence in activities of daily living (ADLs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. One of the goals for rehabilitation of
stroke patient is to improve balance and functional movement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance is a complicated process that includes recognition and
structuralization of sensory information to achieve a good standing posture, which is
necessary for performance of ADLs. Weight support ratio in the static stand-up position is
highly correlated with center of pressure in the static standing position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, balance consists of a mix of
various factors, which is why it is hard to improve a stroke patient&#x02019;s balance ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Attention difficulty is one of the other most frequently reported disabilities caused by
stroke in addition to balance problems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
patient with decreased recognition ability after stroke is unable to participate actively in
physical training in a rehabilitation setting. And the patient temporarily or permanently
loses automatically processed normal posture control mechanism such as maintaining stand-up
posture or dual-task performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, research has been performed on dual-task training for rehabilitation of balance
and concentration ability in stroke patients. Dual-task training is a training in which two
or more tasks are performed at the same time continuously. These days, the roles of
recognition and attention ability are emphasized in the dual-task method by including
recognition tasks in posture and walking control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to task coordination and learning theory, single-task
training has less processing requirements compared with dual-task training, and one cannot
perform two tasks at the same time. However, dual-task training allows coordination of
various tasks, as one can perform more than two tasks at the same time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. A group that performed recognition tasks and movement tasks
at the same time showed improved ability in recognition tasks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. A recognition task influenced balance and walking ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, which tells us that concurrent
performance of movement tasks and recognition tasks affects one or both performances<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A previous study was performed on stroke patients with dual-task training under various
conditions. Among the different tasks, they found that speaking tasks had a great impact on
walking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research related to unstable
supporting plane. In it, the researchers conducted an 8-week experiment on chronic stroke
patients with movement dual task, recognition dual task, movement and recognition dual task.
The results indicated that the movement and recognition dual task group showed significant
improvement in balance and walking ability compared with the other group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research related to restriction of vision
has also been performed. In it, dual-task training was performed after blocking the eyesight
of normal people and stroke patients, and their balance abilities were compared. The results
indicated that the stroke patients showed a decrease in balance ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, there are insufficient numbers of studies on balance and attention in stroke
patients that have considered both vision control and supporting plane at the same time,
which are related to factors affecting posture control when performing dual-task training.
The aim of this study was to examine the effects of dual-task training on stroke patients
under vision control and unstable supporting plane conditions to investigate changes in
balance and attention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Originally, this study recruited 45 patients from two rehabilitation hospitals in Korea
(randomized with inclusion criteria). The subjects were diagnosed with stroke more than six
months previously. The inclusion criteria were as follows: no musculoskeletal impairments
that affect standing balance, no degenerative conditions, and no aphasia that deteriorates
communication. Finally, the subjects were grouped as follows: 12 subjects were included in
the vision control and unstable supporting plane dual-task group (VUDT), 13 subjects were
included in the vision control dual-task group (VDT), and 13 subjects were included in the
unstable supporting plane dual-task group (UDT). They were trained for 30 minutes three
times a week for eight weeks.</p><p>The VUDT group performed two sets of the following 15-minute training session; firstly, the
subjects stood on a stable surface with their eyes covered with an eye patch to prevent
receipt of visual information (visual restriction) and were then told to maintain that
posture and perform a recognition task (speaking a random number, spelling numbers or
characters backward, remembering the names of objects, sentence completion, talking, and
mimicking sentences); secondly, they were told to maintain a posture on an unstable
supporting plane (somatosensory control) while performing the recognition task. The VDT
group performed two sets of the following 15-minute training session; they were told to
maintain a posture on a stable supporting plane with their eyes covered with an eye patch to
prevent receipt of visual information (visual restriction) and perform the previously
mentioned recognition task at the same time. The UDT group performed two sets of the
following 15-minute training session; they were told to maintain their balance on an
unstable supporting plane (somatosensory control) and perform the previously mentioned
recognition task at the same time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. All
subjects received the same treatment, except for the intervention.</p><p>To observe the changes in balance ability in the subjects, this study used the center of
pressure (COP) moving distance, functional reach test (FRT), and Berg balance scale (BBS).
For attention, the present study used the Trail Making Test and Stroop test. For measuring
COP, we used a BioRecue system (an analysis system with biofeedback, AP1153 BioRescue,
France). COP moving distance was measured as the subjects were maintaining an upright
position while spreading their legs at 30 degrees and keeping their eyes forward. FRT was
used to measure the maximum reachable distance when the subjects stretched their arms
horizontally while maintaining their base of support in a comfortable upright position. It
is a simple and reliable testing tool that measures limits of stability relatively well<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BBS consists of 14 items that can be
categorized into three categories such as sitting down, standing up, and postural change.
Each item is scored on a scale ranging from 0 (min) to 4 (max). The total score for the 14
items is 56. All balance tests were performed three times, and the mean score was
recorded.</p><p>This study used the Trail Making Test (TMT) to test the dichotomy of attention, recognition
stage, and trails of complex concepts that affect the ability to cope with various
stimulations. We used the Stroop test to test selective attention. The evaluation items were
total time taken and number of wrong answers. All attention tests were conducted three
times, and the mean values were recorded.</p><p>This study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all the subjects received
explanations about the purposes and procedures of the study and voluntarily agreed to
participate in it<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. All subjects signed
an informed consent from before taking part in the study.</p><p>This study used PASW Statistics 18.0 for all statistical analyses. General characteristics
such as sex, paralyzed side, and types of stroke were verified using the Chi-square test.
Age and homogeneity of dependent variables before the training were verified using one-way
ANOVA. Differences between before and after the training within each group were tested by
Paired t-test, and ANCOVA was used to compare the differences between the groups. The
significance level for all statistical data was &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>General characteristics of the subjects are displayed in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of the subjects (N=38)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VUDT (n=12)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VDT (n=13)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">UDT (n=13)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.4 &#x000b1; 2.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.9 &#x000b1; 3.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.4 &#x000b1; 3.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Gender</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (58.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (38.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (30.8%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (41.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (61.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (69.2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Diagnosis</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Infarction</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (50)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (62.9)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (53.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemorrhage</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (50)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (30.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (46.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Affected side</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (50)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (46.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (38.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (50)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (53.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (61.5)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are numbers (%) or mean &#x000b1; SD; VUDT, vision restriction and unstable base

with these signals, it creates an exaggerated postural reaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it seems that dual-task training decrease
postural sway by preventing the tipping effect. Decreased COP distance in a static standing
position indicates decreased body sway and can be seen as stability improvement in a static
standing position.</p><p>Regarding the FRT, the VUDT group showed the biggest improvement among the three groups.
This was similar to the results of the study conducted by Smania, Picelli, Gandolfi, Fiaschi
and Tinazzi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, which showed that chronic
stroke patients exhibited significant differences in balance and walking speed before and
after balance training on an unstable supporting surface. The result was also similar to
that of a study conducted by Bonan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, which
showed that chronic stroke patients exhibited significantly improved balance ability after
going through vision restricted training. Since FRT is not only related to lower body
stability strategy but is also related to upper body flexibility, an improved FRT score can
mean improvement of a patient&#x02019;s functional activities of daily living.</p><p>In the case of the BBS, the VUDT group showed the biggest improvement among the three
groups. This result is similar to that in the study of Her et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup> which showed significant improvement in the BBS score
after training in VDT, UDT, and VUDT groups. Improved BBS score indicates improvement of a
stroke patient&#x02019;s balance ability, as it tests balance ability within many different
tasks.</p><p>The Trail Making Test and Stroop test are used to evaluate attention, and the VUDT group
showed the biggest improvement among the three groups. This result corresponds with the
findings of Hiyamizu et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The VUDT
group used various balancing conditions in turn considering factors such as strong
attention, rotational attention, and separated attention as a direct treatment for attention
among various approaches of treating a patient&#x02019;s attention loss. It is considered that
intensive task training improved attention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Improvement in the result of Trail Making Test, which tests the
dichotomy of attention, recognition stages, and trails of complex concepts and Stroop test,
which tests selective attention, reflect improvement of attention in stroke patients.</p><p>This study has some limitations in generalization because we cannot say this is the same
case for all stroke patients. Also, we could not completely control the daily lives of the
subjects, so we cannot exclude the possibility that other factors might have affected
balance and attention in the subjects. In the future, it will be necessary to conduct
various studies on such things as dual-task training methods, differences caused by level of
difficulty, and brainwave tests when evaluating attention-related items.</p><p>In summary, it would be more effective to conduct dual-task training under both vision
controlled and unstable supporting surface conditions compared with either vision control or
unstable supporting plane conditions alone as a rehabilitation training program to improve
balance and attention in chronic stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Prange</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><name><surname>Jannink</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Groothuis-Oudshoorn</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Systematic review of the effect of robot-aided therapy on
