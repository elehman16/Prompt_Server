Patients with predicted difficult airway were excluded from the study. These patients were randomly divided into two groups of 50 patients each on the basis of type of LMA device used for exchange, using random computerized tables. The two groups were as follows:</p><p>Group I: CLMA&#x02122; was used for ETT/LM exchange, CLMA&#x02122; was placed by the index finger method</p><p>Group II: ALM&#x02122; was used for ETT/LM exchange (ALM&#x02122; was placed unaided, pencil technique).</p><p>Pre-medication included injection midazolam 0.025 mg/kg IV, injection fentanyl 2 mcg/kg IV, injection ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg IV 15 min prior to induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with injection propofol 2 mg/kg IV and neuromuscular blockade was achieved with vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg IV. After achieving adequate relaxation, trachea was intubated and anaesthesia was maintained with a step-down technique of propofol infusion (10 mg/kg/h for 1<sup>st</sup> 15 min, 8 mg/kg/h for the next 15 min, and thereafter 5 mg/kg/h IV via syringe pump, till the conclusion of surgery). In addition, all patients received 66% N<sub>2</sub>O in O<sub>2</sub> and muscle relaxant top-up doses as per peripheral nerve stimulator. After the conclusion of surgery, N<sub>2</sub>O was discontinued, but propofol was continued to run at the rate of 5 mg/kg/h. In Group I and II, CLMA&#x02122; and ALM&#x02122; (size 3, both) were placed respectively, but the cuff remained un-inflated. The number of insertion attempts was recorded.</p><p>Residual neuromuscular block was now reversed using a mixture of neostigmine (2.5 mg) and glycopyrrolate (0.4 mg). Adequate reversal of neuromuscular block was confirmed by a train-of-four ratio &#x0003e;0.9 and return of adequate tidal volume. ETT was now removed keeping LMA device in place. The cuff of LM (CLMA&#x02122; or ALM&#x02122;) was now inflated with 20 ml air and the breathing system connected to LM. An adequate and smooth spontaneous respiration was re-confirmed clinically and by capnography. If inadequate, LM was removed and reinserted. Number of insertion attempts was again noted. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy was then performed via diaphragm of the swivel port to record the correct placement of CLMA&#x02122; /ALM&#x02122;. Propofol was now discontinued and the patient continued to breathe 100% O<sub>2</sub> until full awakening. The cuff of CLMA&#x02122; and ALM&#x02122; was now deflated and the device was extubated. Patient's response to LM removal was recorded. During this period of exchange ETT/LM exchange, patient's heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were recorded just prior to LM placement, post-LM placement, pre-extubation, post-extubation and thereafter at 3 and 5 min and immediately after LM removal and after 3 and 5 min.</p><p>Ease of placement was graded as Grade I if CLMA&#x02122; /ALM&#x02122; placement was successful in the first attempt, Grade II, if more than one attempt was required to place it, Grade III, if we failed to place the CLMA&#x02122; /ALM&#x02122;. Attempt was considered unsuccessful if it took greater than 20 s or if the LM was removed from the patient's mouth.</p><p>If complete glottis was visualised through fiberscope, it was graded as Grade I, partial glottis with or without seeing epiglottis was Grade II, and if only epiglottis was visualised, it was labelled as Grade III.</p><p>Any episode of coughing/bucking during LM placement, ETT and LM removal was recorded. Coughing was graded as Grade I if there was no coughing/bucking, Grade II, if there was mild coughing/bucking (&#x0003c;5 cough) and Grade III if there was severe bout of coughing/bucking/laryngospasm (&#x0003e;5 cough).</p><p>Sore throat was noted by an independent blind observer post-operatively after 1 h. Absence of sore throat was recorded as Grade I. Sore throat, which was less severe than common cold/mild sore throat was Grade II, and which was similar to that noted with common cold/moderate sore throat was Grade III. Sore throat, which was more severe than common cold/severe sore throat was graded as Grade IV.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary outcome measured was change in haemodynamic parameters in both groups. We conducted a pilot study with seven patients in each group and presuming the difference in the haemodynamic parameters and effect size obtained to be true, calculated that 41 patients in each group would be required for the study with power of 0.8 and significance of 0.05.

Similarly, cough is a normal protective response during emergence from anaesthesia, but can be harmful in cases of eye surgery or neurosurgery.</p><p>Extubation of trachea in deeper planes of anaesthesia is a common method to avoid this stress response. This can be achieved by the use of inhalational agents or opioids, but they may cause loss of the airway and prolonged sedation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Pharmacological agents such as Lidocaine, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and dexmeditomedine are effective in controlling the haemodynamic response during extubation,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] but they do not prevent coughing over the tube. Moreover, their adequate dosage is still not exactly established.</p><p>One of the safe techniques for smooth extubation is to replace the ETT with LMA prior to emergence from anaesthesia. It effectively reduces coughing, bucking, sore throat, and haemodynamic response associated with extubation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Stix <italic>et al</italic>. in 2001,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] had used CLMA&#x02122; as &#x02018;safe extubation device&#x02019; before extubation of ETT and thereafter maintenance of airway till patient was awake fully. When patient regained consciousness, CLMA&#x02122; was removed and patient was shifted to post-operative room.</p><p>The CLMA&#x02122; is a supraglottic airway device, which provides an &#x02018;oval seal around the laryngeal inlet&#x02019; and maintains the airway. It is made of silicon. It is reusable, but discarded after 40 autoclaving cycles. It provides better haemodynamic stability as it avoids stimulating infraglottic structures during insertion as well as during extubation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] It is introduced using the index finger method or thumb insertion technique.</p><p>The ALM&#x02122; is single use airway device made of polyvinyl chloride, moulded in one piece, featuring a special build-in curve that replicates natural human anatomy. It has reinforced tip, which facilitates insertion of the mask with soft cuff. In addition, internal ribs are built into this curve, which gives the airway tube flexibility needed to adapt to individual anatomical variances and a wide range of head positions. It is introduced by pencil technique and there is no need of finger while introducing this airway equipment. All these features make its insertion easier than CLMA&#x02122;.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Furthermore, unlike CLMA&#x02122; it lacks epiglottic aperture bars.</p><p>We had chosen ALM&#x02122; for comparison with CLMA&#x02122; as they are the most commonly used LM devices. Most of studies have used CLMA&#x02122; for ETT/LM exchange. With an increasing concern for transmission of prion diseases, use of single devices like ALM&#x02122; is being advocated.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Furthermore, we wanted to investigate that whether unaided placement of ALM&#x02122; would have any advantage over finger aided placement of CLMA&#x02122; in terms of post-ETT/LM exchange haemodynamic response, ease of placement, fibre-optic view, coughing/bucking, and post-operative sore throat.</p><p>Immediately after placement of LM, there was a significant rise of SBP and HR only in Group I (CLMA&#x02122;). This can be attributed to the standard technique of finger support during CLMA&#x02122; insertion, resulting in overcrowding of hypopharynx and stretching of oropharyngeal structures. This is known to produce a vasopressor response.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] The preformed curved shape of ALM&#x02122; allows its insertion without any finger support. These factors may have been responsible for the attenuated rise of SBP and HR during placement of ALM&#x02122; as compared to CLMA.&#x02122;</p><p>In Group I and Group II patients, the SBP and HR started declining with a modest, but insignificant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) rise as the tracheal tube was removed. Thereafter, the fall in both parameters continued towards control value.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there has been no reported study on haemodynamic changes during ETT/LMA exchange manoeuvre, so far. We have shown that between CLMA&#x02122; and ALM&#x02122;, though both provide good haemodynamic control during ETT/LMA exchange, still latter has significantly better haemodynamic control during LMA insertion.</p><p>Minimal changes in SBP and HR following removal of CLMA&#x02122; or ALM&#x02122; in this study is in accordance to previous findings that removal of an LMA is associated with significantly reduced cardiovascular responses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>We graded ease of LM placement based on the number of attempts at insertion. There was no significant difference in ease of placement between the two devices. Sudhir <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] and Ng <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] also reported insignificant difference in first attempt insertion between these two devices. L&#x003c3;pez <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] studied 200 patients and compared four different LMA regarding ease of insertion and placement. They concluded that ALM&#x02122; and LMA Unique&#x02122; were easier to insert by inexperienced residents and were less traumatic for patients. However Shariffuddin and Wang,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] found that first insertion attempt was significantly better with the ALM&#x02122; compared than with CLMA&#x02122;.</p><p>ALM&#x02122;'s design unlike CLMA&#x02122; does not have epiglottic bars, which allow easier access for flexible fibreoptic examination. A significantly superior glottic view (Grade I) with ALM&#x02122; (96%) as compared to CLMA&#x02122; (76%) may be attributed to its in-built curved shape that allowed its bowl to take a better periglottic position after tracheal extubation. None of the patients in these two groups showed epiglottis through fiberscope. Shariffuddin and Wang,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] reported comparable fibreoptic view with both devices.</p><p>Though ALM&#x02122; had significantly superior glottic view as compared with CLMA&#x02122;, yet all the patients had adequate spontaneous respiration on LM and none required reinsertion of LM. It has been seen that even when the epiglottis blocks fibreoptic visualization of the glottis (as seen from the airway tube), a satisfactory clinical airway is usually established.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>None of the patients in both the study groups had coughing or bucking during placement of LMAs. This might be due to use of propofol for maintenance of anaesthesia in our study, which has known ability to suppress the cough reflex during upper airway manipulation. In contrast, Takita <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] recorded 33.3% incidence of coughing/bucking during placement of CLMA&#x02122;, using variable concentration of sevoflurane for maintenance of anaesthesia.</p><p>The incidence of smooth removal of CLMA&#x02122; and ALM&#x02122; was 72% and 84% respectively. It was observed that 28% patients of Group I and 16% patients of Group II had mild coughing and bucking during removal of CLMA&#x02122;. None of the patients in both the groups presented with airway obstruction or laryngospasm. Koga <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] reported that out of 20 patients, one patient had difficulty in ventilation via LM after extubation and three patients coughed during emergence from anaesthesia. Dob <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] reported one case of coughing out of 26 patients in LMA group during emergence. Costa e Silva and Brimacombe,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] reported that no patient out of 10 coughed during emergence or removal of LMA. The findings of this study are in agreement with the above observations that an occasional patient may cough during removal of LM. However, the present study noted that removal of CLMA&#x02122; was more prone to coughing as compared to ALM&#x02122;. This could possibly be secondary to a more anatomical design and a softer cuff material of ALM&#x02122; compared to CLMA&#x02122;.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Incidence of post-operative sore throat was similar in both groups. There was no case of moderate/severe post-operative sore throat. ETT is known to cause more post-operative sore throat than LM. In our series, both ETT and LM were used in all patients yet the incidence of post-operative sore throat was less than what has been reported for ETT alone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] This might be attributed to the fact that extubation of ETT was performed over LM and thus avoided straining on the tube, which is most often cause of post-operative sore throat. Ng <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] reported lower incidence of sore throat with ALM&#x02122; as compared to CLMA&#x02122;. Post-operative sore throat is also dependent upon the number of attempts taken to place LM, duration of insertion and cuff pressure. In our study, there was no significant difference in number of attempts for LM placement between both groups, but we didn&#x02019;t measure duration of insertion and cuff pressure in our study.</p><p>Pharmacological agents though are effective in controlling haemodynamic changes are costly and are unable to suppress the cough reflex during extubation. On the other hand, CLMA&#x02122; which is reusable after autoclaving is an economical solution to the problem. However, there is risk of infection with prion disease in reusable devices, which has promoted the use of ALM&#x02122;.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>There were certain limitations in our study. The effect was seen in ASA I/II patients, but the usefulness will be of immense help in high-risk cardiac patients, whom we could not study due to the absence of advanced cardiac set-up at our institute. Effect of ETT/LM exchange can be further studied in ASA III/IV cardiac or neurosurgical patients, where good haemodynamic control is required. We did not measure duration of insertion and cuff pressure in our study, which may have a bearing on post-operative sore throat.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Placement of ALM&#x02122; prior to tracheal extubation is associated with reduced haemodynamic changes and better glottic view through fibrescope. Thus, ALM&#x02122; should be considered superior to CLMA&#x02122; for ETT/LM exchange.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Asai</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Koga</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Vaughan</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Respiratory complications associated with tracheal intubation and extubation</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>1998</year><volume>80</volume><fpage>767</fpage><lpage>75</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9771306</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stix</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Borromeo</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Sciortino</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Teague</surname><given-names>PD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Learning to exchange an endotracheal tube for a laryngeal mask prior to emergence</article-title><source>Can J Anaesth</source><year>2001</year><volume>48</volume><fpage>795</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11546722</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Takita</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamane</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Morimoto</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Kemmotsu</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The ED (95) of end-tidal sevoflurane concentration for the smooth exchange of the tracheal tube for a laryngeal mask airway is 2.97%</article-title><source>Can J Anaesth</source><year>2003</year><volume>50</volume><fpage>184</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12560312</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sasano</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Sasano</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Hattori</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsubouchi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsuda</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Katsuya</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Tracheal tube/laryngeal mask exchange to prevent coughing in lung volume reduction surgery</article-title><source>Masui</source><year>2000</year><volume>49</volume><fpage>278</fpage><lpage>81</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10752321</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Koga</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Asai</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Vaughan</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name><name><surname>Latto</surname><given-names>IP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Respiratory complications associated with tracheal extubation.
