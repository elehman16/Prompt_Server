A total of 59 overweight or mildly obese subjects were enrolled upon screening to confirm fasting cholesterol level at or above 220 mg/dL (5.7 mmol/dL). After giving informed consent, subjects were randomized to consume PTE (3 g/day) or placebo for 20 weeks. At baseline and at 4-week intervals, blood lipids, C-reactive protein, and fasting blood glucose were evaluated. A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan was performed at baseline and at study exit to evaluate changes to body composition. Appetite and physical and mental energy were scored at each visit using visual analog scales (0&#x02013;100).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Consumption of PTE was associated with statistically significant weight loss when compared to placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Fat loss was seen for arms, legs, and the gynoid region (hip/belly), as well as for total fat mass. The fat reduction reached significance on within-group analysis, but did not reach between-group significance. Consumption of PTE was associated with improvements to lipid profile, including a mild reduction in cholesterol and the cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein ratio after only 4 weeks, as well as a reduction in triglycerides and very small-density lipoproteins, where average blood levels reached normal range at 8 weeks and remained within normal range for the duration of the study (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.08). No significant changes between the PTE group and the placebo group were seen for fasting glucose or C-reactive protein.

A total of 59 overweight or mildly obese adult men and women were enrolled in the study after screening for cholesterol level at 220 mg/dL or higher and signing written informed consent. This study was approved by the ethical committee of Sky Lakes Medical Center. The study population comprised of 58 Caucasians and one Hispanic. An even sex distribution was not a criteria for the study, and a female:male ratio of 2:1 reflected the higher interest and availability of women to participate in this type of clinical trial. Inclusion criteria were 35&#x02013;75 years of age, BMI 25&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; waist circumference higher than 80 cm for women and higher than 96 cm for men, and fasting cholesterol level of 220 mg/dL or higher. Exclusion criteria were: treated with statin hyperlipidemia medication for the past month; treated with other medication specifically for hyperlipidemia; daily alcohol use of four or more standard units/day (or 28 or more per week); screening blood results of complete blood count and liver and renal function judged to be of clinical significance; currently treated with insulin (other forms of diabetic medication were allowed); pregnancy (a pregnancy test was provided at screening for pre- and perimenopausal women); unwilling to maintain a constant regimen of medication and supplements for the duration of the study (based on their habitual consumption during the past 2 months prior to entering this study), with the exception of changes to medication needed for the optimal care of each person; blood donation during the 2 weeks prior to study start; participation in other clinical trials during the last month; and food allergies or sensitivities related to the test product.</p></sec><sec><title>Consumables</title><p>The Puer tea and placebo powders were prepared in a serving-size sachet, boxed, and labeled with instructions at Tasly Pharmaceuticals Inc. The placebo powder was prepared from dextrin produced from cornstarch. Packages of a 4-week (56 servings for 28 days) supply were prepared. Subjects were randomized to receive either placebo or Puer tea for the duration of the study. At the baseline visit and visits at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks, subjects were provided with a 4-week supply of their assigned consumable. Subjects were instructed to consume two 1.5 g portions daily with meals, with instructions to dissolve the content of one sachet in approximately one cup warm water (250 mL) immediately before consuming. Subjects were allowed to add a small amount of milk and/or sugar. Adherence to the study protocol was evaluated at each visit by documentation of the returned product, an interview with the study coordinator, and review of the diary.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood pressure measurements</title><p>Blood pressure was recorded at each visit using an Omron BP 742 monitor, after the subject had sat quietly for 3 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood testing</title><p>Blood was drawn using venipuncture at each visit and tested for lipid profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fasting blood glucose.</p></sec><sec><title>Body measurements</title><p>Body height was measured at the study start. Weight measurements were performed at each visit using a mechanical scale. A fabric tape was used to perform measurements of the waist, hip, thigh, and upper arms. The waist measurement was performed at the smallest area of the trunk for women, and at the navel line for women without an apparent waist. The waist measurement for men was always taken at the navel line. Subjects were instructed to relax and not flex the abdominal muscles during the waist measurement. Upper-arm measurements were performed on the dominant side of the body, with the arm held outstretched and parallel to the floor while the largest point above the elbow was measured. Hip measurements were performed around the largest circumference of the body below the waist and above the thigh. Thigh measurements were performed on the dominant side of the body, at the largest point above the knee, with the subject standing with the legs a shoulder width apart.</p></sec><sec><title>Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry</title><p>Body-fat composition was performed by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning, using a Lunar DEXA scanner (Prodigy series X-ray; GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). A quality-assurance calibration scan was performed once a day prior to scanning the subjects. Subjects were positioned in the center of the table with their arms separated from the sides of the body and their hands placed with the palms against their thighs and the elbows tucked into their sides. Their knees and ankles were strapped into place. Their head was adjusted so the midline of the table was aligned with the middle of the head, and the subject&#x02019;s legs were adjusted so the midline of the table was between the legs. The scan lasted 6&#x02013;11 minutes, depending on the size of the volunteer. If the volunteer moved during the scan, the scan was aborted, the person was then repositioned, and the scan was restarted. The resulting data from the DEXA scan were analyzed using Encore 2011 software, where regional analysis includes lean and fat mass for arms, legs, trunk, android (belt area), gynoid (hip area), and total body.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Questionnaire-based data collection</title><p>At each visit, questions pertaining to appetite and satiety were scored using unmarked visual analog scales.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Average and standard deviation for each data set were calculated using Microsoft Excel.

However, within the PTE group, data showed that consumption of PTE was associated with a significant reduction in cholesterol levels, starting at week 4 and remaining significantly lower than baseline throughout the study. In contrast, the changes within the placebo group showed only a transient lowering of cholesterol levels at weeks 4 and 8, likely due to a transient increase in awareness of diet and lifestyle in the early phase of study participation, and returning almost to baseline levels at weeks 12, 16, and 20.</p><p>There was no significant difference in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels between the two groups at any time during the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cia-11-367">Figure 4B</xref>).

A transient reduction in low-density lipoprotein levels was seen in both the PTE and placebo groups, suggesting that the awareness of being in a weight-management study with a focus on cholesterol/weight management may have affected fat intake.</p><p>When compared to the placebo group at week 20, reduced triglyceride levels in the PTE group showed a trend (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cia-11-367">Figure 4D</xref>). The average percentage change showed a trend for reduced triglyceride levels in the PTE group when compared to the placebo group at week 8. Under within-group analysis, consumption of PTE was associated with a significant reduction in triglyceride levels at week 8 and continued to decrease throughout the 20-week study, with the exception of a mild transient increase at week 12. A transient increase in triglyceride levels was seen in both groups at week 12; this transient increase reached a statistical trend for the placebo group, but was not significant in the PTE group.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood pressure</title><p>There was no change in blood pressure in either group, despite the content of stimulants in PTE. There were no statistically significant differences between average systolic or diastolic blood pressure at baseline or during the study in either the female or male subpopulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-cia-11-367">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>C-reactive protein</title><p>Blood samples were tested for CRP levels at each visit. At baseline, the average CRP level in the PTE group was 0.25&#x000b1;0.04 mg/dL, and in the placebo group was 0.22&#x000b1;0.04 mg/dL. Over the course of the 20-week study, average high-sensitivity CRP levels remained well within the normal range (below 3.0 mg/dL), and the group averages for each time point were similar for both product and placebo across the 20-week study.</p></sec><sec><title>Fasting blood glucose</title><p>Subjects were examined for fasting blood glucose levels at each visit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-cia-11-367">Figure 5</xref>). There was no significant change in fasting glucose over the course of the 20-week study.

This was seen for both sexes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Preserving good metabolic and cardiovascular health is important, and is related to many dietary and lifestyle factors, including maintenance of healthy body weight and healthy levels of blood lipids. Obesity is a critical worldwide health concern, a major risk factor for many high-profile chronic diseases, and is of increasing global concern and impact on health-service systems. Lifestyle options, such as the daily consumption of health-promoting beverages, are practical tools to help sustain a healthy cardiovascular system, with personal and societal benefits.</p><p>Tea consumption represents a simple choice to substitute for other beverages on a daily basis, and is associated with decreased mortality, as well as specific decrease in mortality from cardiovascular and cancerous illnesses.<xref rid="b34-cia-11-367" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Tea polyphenols have neuroprotective effects beyond their antioxidant properties, and it has been suggested that tea consumption should be considered a lifestyle choice in the prevention of neurodegenerative disorders.<xref rid="b35-cia-11-367" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The different content of tea polyphenols in various types of tea is associated with different biological effects, and specifically Puer tea has been associated with downregulation of enzymes involved in fat storage.<xref rid="b36-cia-11-367" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>Previous clinical studies on Puer tea have been performed in Asia, where the genetic predisposition to obesity and hyperlipidemia, as well as diet and lifestyle, are distinctly different from Western regions, including Europe and North America. The data reported here are to the best of our knowledge the result of the first controlled trial on Puer tea performed outside Asia.</p><p>In line with previously published evidence, we observed a reduction in body fat in the group consuming PTE. It is important to note that the fat loss and improved blood lipids happened with no diet restrictions. Regional analysis of the DEXA data showed that the fat loss was seen for multiple regions, including the arms, legs, trunk, and the gynoid region. This is particularly interesting, since abdominal fat is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.</p><p>Lipoproteins are important and necessary for the transport of lipid nutrients and hormones in the bloodstream. However, elevated levels are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Previous studies in animals that were fed a high-fat diet showed that Puer tea consumption helped maintain healthy cholesterol levels.<xref rid="b12-cia-11-367" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b25-cia-11-367" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30-cia-11-367" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Two previous clinical trials were performed in Asia, and confirmed reduced cholesterol in people consuming Puer tea.<xref rid="b32-cia-11-367" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33-cia-11-367" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The aqueous extract of Puer tea has been shown to have specific effects on enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, and acts as a competitive inhibitor for HMGCR and pancreatic lipase and as a noncompetitive inhibitor for Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub>.<xref rid="b37-cia-11-367" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In the study reported here, we observed only minor changes to cholesterol and HDLs.

The data from this study suggest that daily consumption of PTE supports improved cardiovascular health in several ways, including weight management through loss of body fat and beneficial changes to blood lipids, specifically with respect to reduced triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein. One limitation of the study reported here is that it was conducted in a hyperlipidemic population but not hyperglycemic. It is highly recommended that further studies be performed. These should aim at documenting reduction of body fat in people who are not hyperlipidemic, and should also examine the effects of consuming Puer tea in conjunction with a weight-loss program, improved glucose tolerance, and overall metabolic health through regulation of adipokines.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was conducted at NIS Labs, an independent contract research laboratory specializing in natural-product research.
