Among the various uterotonics, oxytocin is most commonly used. Prophylactic routine use of oxytocin has been shown to reduce the incidence of PPH by up to 40%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, oxytocin causes hypotension and reflex tachycardia as an adverse effect due to action on oxytocin receptors found in the heart and large vessels.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] To treat this hypotension, various vasopressors such as ephedrine, mephentermine and phenylephrine can be used. Among this phenylephrine is shown to have a quicker control of blood pressure (BP) during spinal anaesthesia-induced hypotension.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Phenylephrine, a short-acting alpha agonist, can be administered by bolus as well as by infusion,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] in titrated doses to treat oxytocin-induced hypotension. It has been observed that co-administration of phenylephrine obtunds oxytocin-induced decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and increase in heart rate and cardiac output.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, phenylephrine at higher doses is known to cause reflex bradycardia with decreased cardiac output.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Studies recommending a minimum effective dose of phenylephrine required for co-administration with oxytocin to obtund cardiovascular effects of oxytocin are sparse.</p><p>Hence, the present study was undertaken to compare the two different doses of phenylephrine required to prevent adverse haemodynamic changes due to oxytocin infusion in parturients undergoing caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia.</p><p>The primary objective of the study was to compare the effects of co-administration of oxytocin with phenylephrine 50 or 75 &#x003bc;g on the incidence of oxytocin-induced hypotension during caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. Rescue vasopressor requirement, magnitude of haemodynamic changes and the incidence of side effects were the secondary objectives. We hypothesised that a higher dose of phenylephrine would result in lower incidence of hypotension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This prospective double-blind study was carried out after obtaining Ethical Committee approval. The study was conducted from March to June 2016.</p><p>Parturients posted for elective and emergency lower segment caesarean section (LSCS) and all parturients with uncomplicated singleton pregnancy were included in the study.</p><p>Parturients with an increased risk of atony or excessive bleeding (known placenta praevia, multiple gestation, abnormal presentations, prolonged labour, more than 2 previous LSCS, PPH), cardiovascular instability, pre-eclampsia, essential hypertension, gestational diabetes, those with systemic illnesses such as severe anaemia, bleeding diathesis and cardiovascular disease, parturients with height &#x0003c;150 cm were excluded from the study. We also excluded those parturients who had a fall in BP &#x0003e;20% of basal mean arterial pressure (MAP) following spinal anaesthesia but before oxytocin infusion.</p><p>A total of 104 parturients were randomised into three Groups using numbers generated from randomisation table[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and allocation concealment was made by envelope method. The envelope was opened by the principal investigator just before the administration of subarachnoid block (SAB) to the patient. Group A patients received oxytocin 3U and phenylephrine 50 &#x003bc;g diluted to 10cc with normal saline as an infusion over 5 min, Group B patients received oxytocin 3U and phenylephrine 75 &#x003bc;g diluted to 10cc infusion over 5 min and Group C patients received oxytocin 3U and normal saline diluted to 10cc infusion over 5 min.</p><p>The operation theatre technician who was not involved in the care of the parturient prepared the drug solution based on the instructions from the principal investigator. The parturient and the anaesthesiologist involved in the anaesthetic management of the parturient were unaware of the contents of the solution administered.</p><p>Pre-anaesthetic evaluation of all the parturients was done and an informed written consent was taken. In the operation theatre, electrocardiogram, non-invasive BP and pulse oximeter were connected and basal parameters recorded. Intravenous (IV) access with 18G cannula was established. Parturients were pre-medicated with ranitidine 50 mg IV and metoclopramide 10 mg IV half an hour before the administration of SAB and pre-loaded with 500 mL Ringer lactate just before the administration of SAB.</p><p>The SAB was performed at L<sub>3</sub>-L<sub>4</sub>/L<sub>4</sub>-L<sub>5</sub> interspace using 25G Quincke Babcock needle in the left lateral decubitus position and bupivacaine hyperbaric (0.5%) 9 mg with fentanyl 12.5 &#x003bc;g was administered. Immediately after the SAB, the patient was repositioned supine with 15&#x000b0; wedge below the right buttock to achieve left uterine tilt. Oxygen was administered through simple face mask at 4 L/min.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] IV fluid infusion was continued at a rate of 200 mL/10 min throughout the surgery. Heart rate (HR), systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), MAP and peripheral oxygen saturation was monitored every 2 min till baby extraction and up to 10 min after administration of the test drug solution, then every 5 min till the end of surgery.</p><p>After baby extraction, test drug solutions (10 mL) were administered based on group allocation over a period of 5 min using a syringe infusion pump (Sino medical systems, China) through a separate IV line. Following this oxytocin infusion at 10U/h was continued up to 4 h. The level of sensory blockade was assessed using cold swab test at 20 min. The APGAR score was recorded for all the neonates at 1 and 5 min.</p><p>Uterine tone was assessed by obstetricians at the end of uterine closure and noted as either &#x02018;adequate&#x02019; or &#x02018;inadequate&#x02019;. If uterus was not adequately contracted methylergometrine 0.2 mg intramuscular (IM) or prostaglandin F2&#x003b1; 250 &#x003bc;g IM was given and noted.</p><p>Hypotension was defined as a fall in MAP &#x0003e;20% from baseline and treated with 100 mL IV fluid bolus and rescue dose of phenylephrine 50 &#x003bc;g IV over 2 min. Phenylephrine IV was repeated every 2 min till the MAP increased to within 20% of baseline. A maximum of 4 doses of phenylephrine were administered after which rescue vasopressor was changed to ephedrine 6 mg IV. The requirement of rescue vasopressors was noted. Bradycardia was defined as heart rate &#x0003c;60 beats/min (bpm) and treated with atropine 0.6 mg IV. Adverse effects such as desaturation, nausea, vomiting, headache, bronchospasm, flushing and dysrhythmias if any, during intraoperative period were noted and treated accordingly. The patient was monitored in the postoperative care unit for 6 h.</p><p>The initial power analysis assumed that 70% of patients require a vasopressor, based on previous studies.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] To detect a minimum of 50% reduction in the incidence of hypotension between the groups, a minimum of 30 parturients would be required in each group, to attain a power of 80% at alpha error of 0.05, assuming normal distribution of values in all the groups and using Chi-square test for comparison of proportions.</p><p>Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS (statistics package for socialistic sciences) version 20 software. Haemodynamic values recorded just before extraction of the baby was considered as baseline value for assessing the effect of oxytocin on haemodynamic parameters. Shapiro Wilk test was done to assess for the normality of the distribution of continuous variables. For values showing normal distribution, Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to find the significance between three groups of parturients for continuous variables and paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used for intragroup comparison. <italic>Post hoc</italic> analysis with Bonferroni correction was applied for intergroup comparison of continuous variables. Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was done for intergroup comparison when values showed skewed distribution. Chi-square/Fisher's exact test was used to find the significance of study parameters on categorical scale. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 104 parturients were enrolled and randomly allocated into three groups (Group A <italic>n</italic> = 35, Group B <italic>n</italic> = 35 and Group C <italic>n</italic> = 34) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

The exogenous form of the drug (Pitocin, Syntocinon) is a synthetic preparation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The uterotonic effect of oxytocin is important in reducing blood loss from the site of placental attachment and decreasing the risk of postpartum haemorrhage, thus making it the primary choice among uterotonics.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Oxytocin causes hypotension and reflex tachycardia as an adverse effect because oxytocin receptors are also found in the heart and large vessels. The principal effect of oxytocin seems to be on SVR, and hence a drug which directly increases SVR would counteract the effect of oxytocin.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Some studies have shown that slower injection of oxytocin can effectively minimise the cardiovascular side-effects of a bolus dose without compromising the therapeutic benefits.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>There is no uniformity in the dose of oxytocin that is given for adequate uterine contraction. The routine use of 5U oxytocin during elective caesarean delivery can no longer be recommended, as adequate uterine tone can occur with lower doses of oxytocin (0.5&#x02013;3 units).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Some have compared haemodynamic effects of oxytocin 3 U IV bolus over 15 s and 3 U infusion over 5 min on women undergoing caesarean section and concluded that 3 U infusion is superior to 3 U IV bolus.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In our study, we have used 3U oxytocin over 5 min and found that uterine contraction was adequate in all the cases and no additional doses of uterotonic agent were needed.</p><p>Few authors have noted that phenylephrine (100 &#x003bc;g) had quicker control of BP compared to mephentermine (6 mg) and ephedrine (6 mg) groups.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There are studies which have observed that the minimum vasopressor dose for preventing post-spinal hypotension in caesarean section was 532 &#x003bc;g for phenylephrine and 43 mg for ephedrine. Hence, they concluded that phenylephrine is more potent than ephedrine by a factor of 80 for equivalent maternal BP control.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Studies have compared the efficacy of different doses of phenylephrine i.e. 100 &#x003bc;g, 125 &#x003bc;g and 150 &#x003bc;g to treat post-spinal hypotension in elective caesarean section and concluded that there was no significant difference in all the 3 groups.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>IV phenylephrine 50 &#x003bc;g administered immediately before 3 U oxytocin during elective caesarean section did not prevent maternal hypotension and tachycardia,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] whereas co-administration of phenylephrine 80 &#x003bc;g with oxytocin 2.5 U obtunded oxytocin-induced decreases in SVR and increases in heart rate and cardiac output.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>However, there are no studies suggesting the optimal dose for co-administration with oxytocin, hence the present study was undertaken to compare co-administration of two lower doses in an effort to minimise phenylephrine-induced side effects. We found that the co-administration of phenylephrine 75 &#x003bc;g with oxytocin 3U had better efficacy compared to phenylephrine 50 &#x003bc;g with oxytocin 3U and was associated with the minimal adverse effect.</p><p>We considered the haemodynamic recordings just before baby extraction as the baseline to avoid confounding by SAB-induced hypotension, and they were found to be comparable. We also excluded parturients developing hypotension before oxytocin administration so that effect of phenylephrine on oxytocin-induced hypotension could be studied, presuming that hypotension caused after oxytocin administration would be due to the effect of oxytocin.</p><p>Phenylephrine causes a significant reduction in heart rate after the bolus dose.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] There was no incidence of bradycardia in the present study which may be attributed to the administration of phenylephrine as infusion rather than bolus. There is evidence that phenylephrine delivered as an infusion is the most effective method for preventing maternal hypotension and intraoperative nausea or vomiting.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Estimation of intraoperative blood loss was not done and hence the effect of phenylephrine co-administration on blood loss could not be studied. We have not done pulse waveform analysis (perfusion index) and cardiac output monitoring for our cases which can be a limitation. Cardiac output monitoring is used as a marker of oxygen delivery to tissues. It is used in guiding treatment for fluid resuscitation, and the use of vasoactive and inotropic drugs and hence may require further studies.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p></sec><sec
