Acute PE is a potentially life-threatening medical emergency that requires urgent intervention. In the United States, most patients with PE are admitted to the hospital, whereas patients with acute DVT are often managed as outpatients with coordinated care through a primary provider. Current standard therapy for most patients with acute PE or DVT is the same: anticoagulation therapy with a parenteral agent (e.g., subcutaneous administration of low-molecular-weight heparin) overlapping with and followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA).<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>The Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) and simplified PESI are extensively validated prognostic tools for predicting death and adverse outcome events in patients with PE.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The simplified PESI score has proven useful to physicians and allows risk stratification of patients with PE. Patients found to be at low risk using this measure may be able to be discharged safely from the emergency department (ED).<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The standard dual-drug anticoagulation therapy is effective but complex. Non-VKA direct oral anticoagulants, given as fixed-dose regimens, have been shown to have similar efficacy and safety profiles to standard therapy in phase III studies. The advantage of these agents is their potential to improve patients' quality of life by simplifying patient management and offering the therapeutic flexibility of oral administration without the need for routine coagulation monitoring (a limitation of the VKAs). Results from the phase III EINSTEIN PE study showed that rivaroxaban was noninferior to enoxaparin/VKA for the efficacy endpoint of recurrent VTE and the safety outcome of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Given the similar safety profile of rivaroxaban to enoxaparin/VKA therapy, the identification of a cohort of PE patients (e.g., those with low simplified PESI scores) with very few short-term (within 7 to 14&#x000a0;days) adverse events could support the consideration of direct discharge from the ED. Therefore, the results of this analysis provide a framework for an informed discussion with the patient regarding his or her prognosis and management pathway.</p><p>This post hoc analysis assessed adverse outcomes in relation to the simplified PESI score in patients with symptomatic PE who were treated with rivaroxaban or standard therapy in the phase III EINSTEIN PE study and evaluated the use of the simplified PESI score to identify low-risk patients with acute PE who could be considered for treatment with rivaroxaban or standard therapy out of the hospital setting.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The EINSTEIN PE study was an open-label, randomized, phase III study (trial registration number NCT00439777) comparing oral rivaroxaban (15&#x000a0;mg twice daily for 3&#x000a0;weeks, followed by 20&#x000a0;mg once daily thereafter) with subcutaneous enoxaparin overlapping with and followed by a VKA (warfarin or acenocoumarol; target international normalized ratio&#x000a0;= 2.0 to 3.0) for 3, 6, or 12&#x000a0;months.

and simplified PESI are prognostic assessment tools for the management of patients with acute PE that have been proposed as tools to select patients for outpatient therapy. The accuracy of these two scoring systems has been assessed and compared in a meta-analysis<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and the results indicate that the PESI has discriminative power to predict death and adverse outcome events in patients with acute PE. The PESI (consisting of 11 variables) and the simplified PESI (consisting of six of the 11 variables in the PESI) have similar accuracy, but the simplified PESI is easier to use.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Most of the studies in the meta-analysis had follow-up periods of 30&#x000a0;days (although in some studies this was 3 or 6&#x000a0;months, or in hospital) but the most relevant data come from the 7- and 14-day outcomes because decisions to treat in the outpatient setting will not be influenced by 30-day outcomes. The results of the meta-analysis showed that low-risk PESI scores were significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality, lower PE-related mortality, and fewer serious adverse events.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The pooled all-cause mortality was 1.8% in patients with low-risk simplified PESI scores, compared with 25.2% in patients with high-risk simplified PESI scores. The incidence of PE-related mortality was 0.4% in the low-risk patients and 5.1% in the high-risk patients, based on the simplified PESI.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In this post hoc analysis of the EINSTEIN PE study, the all-cause mortality rates were notably lower than those reported in the high-risk patients in the meta-analysis.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Similarly, the incidences of fatal PE were lower in this post hoc analysis than those reported in the meta-analysis in both low- and high-risk patient groups. Given the differences between the PESI meta-analysis and this EINSTEIN PE post hoc analysis, a closer examination of the risk profile of the study population is warranted.</p><p>A valid consideration in evaluating the outcomes of the EINSTEIN PE data set is whether or not the study cohort is representative of the overall population of ED patients presenting for evaluation for VTE. Several registries have described the demographics, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and outcomes of acute PE.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The age and sex of patients in the EINSTEIN PE group resembles those enrolled in the EMPEROR (Emergency Medicine Pulmonary Embolism in the Real World Registry<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), registry of patients presenting to EDs in the United States.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> With respect to mortality, the EINSTEIN PE data set resembles the EMPEROR cohort rather than those of the ICOPER (International Cooperative Pulmonary Embolism Registry<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) or RIETE (Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad ThromboEmbolica<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) registries. In EMPEROR, the PE-attributed and all-cause mortality rates at 30&#x000a0;days were 1.1 and 5.4%, respectively.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In EINSTEIN PE, the overall incidences of PE-related deaths and all-cause mortality up to 30&#x000a0;days were 0.2 and 0.7%, respectively; in patients with simplified PESI scores of &#x02265;2, these were 0.6 and 3.6%, respectively. In the EINSTEIN PE analysis, 2.3% to 2.7% of patients were hypotensive (sBP &#x0003c; 100&#x000a0;mm Hg) and 2.7% to 2.9% were hypoxic (arterial oxygen saturation &#x0003c; 90%), whereas in EMPEROR, 3.0% of the cohort were hypotensive (sBP &#x0003c; 90&#x000a0;mm Hg).<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Conversely, the ICOPER registry enrolled a higher risk, inpatient cohort of patients whose 14-day mortality rate was 11.2%.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The RIETE group reported a 3.3% rate of 30-day PE-related mortality.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Given the available registry data on patients presenting to EDs in the United States, EINSTEIN PE appears to have enrolled patients with marginally lower risk profiles than those enrolled in EMPEROR and much lower risk profiles than those enrolled in ICOPER and RIETE.</p><p>This analysis showed that there was a close relationship between the major clinical outcomes (recurrent VTE, fatal PE, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality) and the simplified PESI score of the patients. Patients with simplified PESI scores of 0 or 1 experienced fewer major clinical outcome events during the first 30&#x000a0;days of treatment (i.e., based on data up to days 7, 14, and 30) in comparison with those patients with simplified PESI scores of &#x02265;2. Patients with simplified PESI scores of &#x02265;2 experienced more recurrent VTE, fatal PE, and major bleeding complications than those with scores of &#x0003c;2 in all treatment periods measured, and these results were similar in patients treated with rivaroxaban or standard therapy. Data up to 30&#x000a0;days showed that in patients with simplified PESI scores of 1, the rate of major bleeding was 0.3% in the rivaroxaban group and 1.1% in the standard therapy group; in those with simplified PESI scores of &#x02265;2, major bleeding occurred in 0.8 and 3.2% of patients in the rivaroxaban and the standard therapy groups, respectively.</p><p>Although guidelines, such as those from the American College of Chest Physicians, recommend outpatient treatment for selected PE patients at low risk of recurrence,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> existing evidence for the outpatient management of patients with PE is derived from small cohorts of patients from outside the United States.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The results of this analysis provide further support that risk stratification of PE patients may allow a cohort of low-risk patients to be treated in a clinical decision unit or by a closely monitored outpatient strategy. Such an approach might relieve some of the burden placed on the ED. Because the incidences of major clinical events, such as fatal PE and major bleeding, are relatively low in the first 30&#x000a0;days of therapy, emergency clinicians may consider offering these low-risk patients an alternative to the traditional inpatient stay. This is supported by the finding of this analysis that in patients with simplified PESI scores of &#x02264;1 who were treated as outpatients, there were no cases of fatal PE or all-cause mortality up to 14&#x000a0;days (for a score of 0 or 1) and up to 30&#x000a0;days (for a score of 0). Conversely, the data are also consistent with previous studies in which patients classified as being at high risk of VTE recurrence and 30-day mortality had higher rates of recurrent VTE, bleeding, and overall mortality than low-risk patients.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Furthermore, although no statistical comparison between the two treatment groups for the major clinical outcomes could be made (owing to the low event rates and the small number of patients per subgroup), data from the current analysis suggest that rivaroxaban may provide an equally effective treatment option to standard therapy for both low- and high-risk patients, with a potentially lower risk of major bleeding complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Owing to the nature of a post hoc study, any significant values must be interpreted with caution. In the current analysis, no multiple testing was conducted and p-values remain unadjusted. Moreover, a selection bias arising from the randomized open-label design of the original EINSTEIN PE study cannot be ruled out. In addition to examining the study population, the risk stratification tool used in this post hoc investigation can be scrutinized. The simplified PESI score was chosen for use in this analysis in preference to the original PESI and HESTIA schemes (consisting of 11 variables) because of the clinical applicability of having only six variables that are easily assessed early in the acute care evaluation of PE patients.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Although the PESI and simplified PESI are powerful predictors of short-term mortality, intangible social factors that may mandate inpatient therapy are not part of the model. The HESTIA scheme includes not only physiological parameters, but also sociobehavioral factors that optimize its effectiveness as a decision tool. However, the EINSTEIN database is unable to recover the social factors that would be necessary to evaluate the HESTIA criteria accurately. Additionally, the PESI criteria have been described as a sound tool for predicting mortality; however, they lack the ability to predict patients at low risk of VTE complications. Accordingly, this investigation confirms that a PESI score of 0 has limited utility in the prediction of both recurrent VTE and major bleeding events at &#x02264;7&#x000a0;days. Although it is tempting to conclude that risk stratification using only short-term mortality would allow for safe discharge, clinicians are acutely aware that socioeconomic factors complicate the disposition. Despite the fact that the simplified PESI criterion has been extensively validated as a risk stratification instrument, the individual components of the score may perform differently in prediction of 5-to 7-day versus 30-day outcomes. Some authors have suggested that a model to predict in-hospital or 5-to 7-day clinical deterioration would be more relevant to the clinical decision to admit or discharge a patient with PE than a 30-day outcome.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Another limitation of the PESI and simplified PESI scores is that they were not designed to incorporate bleeding events. In addition, the current analysis does not address any potential influence of renal function (e.g., creatinine clearance rate) on the outcomes, nor provide any information with respect to the treatment of subsegmental PE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This post hoc analysis of the phase III EINSTEIN PE study demonstrated that risk stratification using the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score could identify low-risk patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism and suggests that rivaroxaban may provide an effective alternative treatment option to standard therapy for low- and high-risk pulmonary embolism patients, with reduced risk of major bleeding complications.</p></sec><sec><title/><p>The authors acknowledge Yong-Ling
