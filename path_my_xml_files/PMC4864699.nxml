Three groups in which General Anaesthesia was used i.e. Group 1-ondansetron 8 mg intravenously(IV).Group 2 butorphanol 2 mg IV and Group 3 &#x02013; saline 4 ml IV. And three groups where spinal Anaesthesia was used i.e. Group 4-Ondosteron 8 mg IV, Group 5 butorphanol 2 mg IV and Group 6 &#x02013; saline 4 ml IV 3-5 minutes before anaesthesia.

The reported incidence varies from 5% to 65% of patients after general anesthesia and 33% of patients during regional anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Apart from the obvious discomfort, PAS, like hypothermia, is associated with a number of potentially deleterious sequelae. These include increased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production and catecholamine release, increased cardiac output, tachycardia and hypertension, and raised intraocular pressure.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, patients with the compromised cardiac function may not be able to increase their cardiac output, therefore, may attempt to compensate for the increased oxygen demand by excessive desaturation of the mixed venous blood. PAS also interferes with monitoring. Shivering may endanger the operating results in orthopedic, plastic, and ophthalmic surgery. Hence, prevention and treatment of PAS are an important aspect of patient care.</p><p>Though the cause of PAS is not yet clear, some suggestive mechanisms are a pain, adrenal suppression, decreased sympathetic activity, normal thermoregulatory response to intraoperative heat loss, uninhibited spinal reflexes, core hypothermia and redistribution of heat and obliteration of central and peripheral thermoregulatory control.</p><p>Shivering can be graded by Tsai and Chu as - Grade 0 = no shivering, Grade 1 = piloerection or vasoconstriction but no visible shivering, Grade 2 = muscular activity in only one muscle group, Grade 3 = muscular activity in more than one muscle group but not generalized shivering, Grade 4 = shivering involving the whole body.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Regional anesthesia produces vasodilatation; which facilitates core to peripheral redistribution of heat. It also increases sweating threshold and decreases vasoconstriction and shivering threshold.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The neurotransmitter pathways involved in the mechanism of PAS are complex and still poorly understood. There is evidence that opioids, alpha-adrenergic, serotonergic, and anticholinergic systems are probably involved.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Recently, it has been established that one of the various pathways involved in PAS is through the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor, so 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist must have a role in prevention PAS.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Some of the drugs well-known for the treatment of PAS are meperidine, butorphanol, nefopam, nalbuphine, tramadol, physostigmine, ketanserin, doxapram, ondansetron, and clonidine.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we compare the effectiveness of butorphanol and ondansetron for reducing the incidence of PAS in anesthesia in a placebo-controlled, double-blind manner. And also to study of changes in body temperature, heart rate, pulse oxygen saturation, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) after administering anesthesia and complications if any.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After the approval of Institutional Ethics Committee of the college and informed consent of the patient, the study was conducted on 180 patients of either sex, ranging from 18 to 60 years, undergoing elective general, otorhinolaryngeal and ophthalmology surgery, Mahamaya Rajkiya Allopathic Medical College, Ambedkar Nagar, Uttar Pradesh from May 2013 to August 2015.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 60 years, with American Society of Anesthesiologists Grades I and II and duration of surgery &#x0003c;2 h. Exclusion criteria were any pyrexial illness, allergy, age &#x0003c;18 years and &#x0003e;60 years, use of vasoconstrictors or vasodilators were planned, anticipating surgery longer than 120 min and hyperthyroidism or cardiopulmonary disease.</p><p>A thorough preoperative clinical as well as investigatory assessment was done in all patients. Patients were randomized by using sealed envelope technique to one of the six groups before giving anesthesia:</p><p>Group I &#x02013; Ondansetron 8 mg intravenous (IV) 3&#x02013;5 min before administering general anesthesia</p><p>Group II &#x02013; Butorphanol 2 mg IV 3&#x02013;5 min before administering general anesthesia</p><p>Group III &#x02013; Saline IV 3&#x02013;5 min before administering general anesthesia</p><p>Group IV &#x02013; Ondansetron 8 mg IV 3&#x02013;5 min before administering spinal anesthesia</p><p>Group V &#x02013; Butorphanol 2 mg IV 3&#x02013;5 min before administering spinal anesthesia</p><p>Group VI &#x02013; Saline IV 3&#x02013;5 min before administering spinal anesthesia.</p><p>These trial preparations were prepared fresh and by persons blinded to the study. All patients receive 4 ml injection, the volume of ondansetron and butorphanol being made up with normal saline to 4 ml. The injection of trial medication was given immediately after placement of IV cannula and 3&#x02013;5 min before induction of anesthesia or performing the regional block.</p><p>Core temperature was recorded by using temperature probe by placing it in nasopharynx under the aseptic condition, and the peripheral temperature was recorded by temperature probe on the dorsum of the middle finger of the right hand. Baseline heart rate, MAP, and oxygen saturation were also recorded.</p><p>Analgesia was provided with injection ketorolac 30 mg intramuscular 1 h before induction and after induction and injection diclofenac (aqua) 75 mg in 100 ml normal saline and run over 30 min to be given intraoperatively.</p><p>General anesthesia was induced by propofol 2&#x02013;2.5 mg/kg and intubation was done with vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained within 70% N<sub>2</sub>O in O<sub>2</sub>. Spinal anesthesia was given with 15&#x02013;17.5 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine at L<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>4</sub> level in lateral position. PAS was defined as readily detectable fasciculation or tremor of the face, trunk, or limb of 15 s duration.</p><p>These following parameters were recorded, i.e., the appearance of shivering &#x02013; (intraoperative and early postoperative period up to 1 h), body temperature recording &#x02013; (core and peripheral temperature), heart rate, MAP and oxygen saturation, and complication if any. These parameters were recorded every 10 min.</p><p>The incidence of shivering was tested statistically by using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test with Yates' correction. Differences in demographic data and the effects of treatment on all studied variables were tested by one-way analysis of variance.
