In a novel task that borrows elements of the &#x02018;word superiority&#x02019; and &#x02018;word inversion&#x02019; paradigms, we investigate whether holistic word recognition is impaired in dyslexia. In Experiment 1 students with dyslexia and controls judged the similarity of pairs of 6- and 7-letter words or pairs of words whose letters had been partially jumbled. The stimuli were presented in both upright and inverted form with orthographic regularity and orientation randomized from trial to trial. While both groups showed sensitivity to orthographic regularity, both word inversion and letter jumbling were more detrimental to skilled than dyslexic readers supporting the idea that the latter may read in a more analytic fashion. Experiment 2 employed the same task but using shorter, 4- and 5-letter words and a design where orthographic regularity and stimuli orientation was held constant within experimental blocks to encourage the use of either holistic or analytic processing. While there was no difference in reaction time between the dyslexic and control groups for inverted stimuli, the students with dyslexia were significantly slower than controls for upright stimuli. These findings suggest that holistic word recognition, which is largely based on the detection of orthographic regularity, is impaired in dyslexia.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="20"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Data is available from figshare (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5540014">10.6084/m9.figshare.5540014</ext-link>).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Data is available from figshare (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5540014">10.6084/m9.figshare.5540014</ext-link>).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Developmental dyslexia is characterised by marked difficulties in learning to read that cannot be attributed to low intelligence, poor motivation or to lack of education and opportunity to read [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In standardised measures of reading ability the scores of children with dyslexia are found to scatter on the lower tail of a normal distribution, suggesting that dyslexia is not a discrete or easily defined diagnostic entity [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Clinical reviews paint a similarly complex picture with noted overlap between dyslexia, language impairment and speech sound disorder [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Fluent word recognition&#x02014;the effortless mapping between the sight of a printed word and its sound or pronunciation&#x02014;is central to reading and develops through the acquisition of two distinct skills, phonological and orthographic coding [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Phonological coding refers to the representation of grapheme-phoneme correspondences&#x02013;the matching between letters and their associated sounds&#x02014;and is crucial to the reading of new and unfamiliar words. Orthographic coding refers to the representation of the visual form of words which includes letter combinations at both coarse and fine scales that signal spelling regularities and that help identify words without the need to access phonological information at the sub-word level [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Reading fluency reflects expertise in this visual or direct-access route to word sounds. For example, whereas the time to name a word increases with word length for children who are learning to read and still &#x02018;sounding out&#x02019; the words, word naming latency is largely independent of word length in fluent adult readers [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Bruck [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]argues that poor phonological processing&#x02014;a central characteristic of dyslexia [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]&#x02014;prevents dyslexic readers from accurately noting spelling-sound correspondences in reading which, in turn, prevents them from learning precise orthographic information about words. Ironically, it is their poor knowledge of spelling-sound correspondences that keeps dyslexic readers using these very cues to recognize words, arresting their reading development and preventing them from eventually achieving fluency via the automatic use of orthographic or visual word form cues to recognize words and to access their sounds directly.</p><p>Bruck&#x02019;s idea is an interesting one that long predates current knowledge of the neural basis of visual expertise in word recognition. The visual word form area (VWFA), located in mid-fusiform gyrus in the left hemisphere, is a region of the brain that is activated during reading and that responds preferentially to words over consonant strings, chequerboard patterns [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and line drawings of objects [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Activation of the VWFA is constant across changes in the retinotopic location of word stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]and across changes in their typographic case and size [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This response invariance to stimulus properties that are unimportant to word recognition coupled with a robust response to pseudowords&#x02014;non-words that mimic the spelling structure of real words&#x02014;suggests that the VWFA represents words in a way that captures their orthographic regularity rather than their physical form or associated semantics [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In fact, in studies using fMRI adaptation the VWFA shows greater selectivity&#x02014;to whole words rather than to sub-lexical orthographic patterns&#x02014;suggesting that the region may serve as a form of &#x02018;visual dictionary&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Decreased brain activity in the VWFA has been reported in dyslexia [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Using a cross-sectional design to investigate changes associated with reading development, Shaywitz and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] report that while normal readers show increased activation in the VWFA with age, dyslexic readers instead show increased activation of a nearby (posterior medial occipitotemporal) region. They suggest that increased VWFA activation in normal readers reflects changes associated with increasing fluency in mapping word forms to associated sounds, whereas increased activation in the neighbouring region in dyslexic children reflects increasing reliance on memorization of the visual word form. Others [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] show that while the VWFA is specialized for orthographic regularity at both a coarse scale (distinguishing print from non-print fonts) and at a finer scale that taps into spelling regularity in normal readers, the VWFA in dyslexic readers does not make this distinction. Together these studies point to anomalous development of the VWFA in dyslexia and implicate impaired sensitivity to orthographic regularity as a source of impaired fluency in reading.</p><p>We suggest that this insensitivity to orthographic regularity in dyslexia might usefully be conceptualized as a problem in acquiring a particular type of perceptual expertise, one that relies on holistic processing of words. Broadly speaking, perceptual expertise involves discriminating instances of a category&#x02014;such as recognizing individual words or faces&#x02014;and is thought to engage distinct processes from those involved in more basic categorization as when we identify a visual object as a word or as a face [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As noted by a number of researchers, words and faces share a characteristic that poses a particular challenge for their individual identification, specifically, their high self-similarity [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Individual words are made by arranging a fixed number of letters from a limited alphabet and individual faces share a common arrangement of features with each other.</p><p>In the case of faces, identification of individuals is thought to involve holistic or configural processing [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and a number of experimental paradigms provide support for this idea. In the &#x02018;composite face effect&#x02019; careful alignment of the top half of one face with the bottom half of another leads us to perceive a novel facial configuration that slows or prevents recognition of the component faces [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Central to this effect is an inability to selectively attend to one part of a face and ignore information from other, a type of &#x02018;obligatory attention&#x02019; to all parts of the stimulus [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The &#x02018;face inversion effect&#x02019; links holistic processing to the upright orientation of a face and shows that face recognition [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and sensitivity to distortions of facial shape [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] are compromised when faces are inverted. Finally, Tanaka and Farah&#x02019;s variant of the &#x02018;face superiority effect&#x02019;&#x02014;which shows that facial features are more easily recognized within the context of a face than when presented alone or within a face with spatially scrambled features [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]&#x02013;also points to the importance of facial configuration in face recognition.</p><p>These hallmarks of expertise in face recognition&#x02013;an obligatory attention to the configuration of facial features that is specific to the typical, upright orientation of faces, and a superior ability to recognize facial features within the context of a face&#x02014;have parallels in the study of word recognition. The &#x02018;obligatory attention&#x02019; to all parts of the stimulus that is central to the composite face effect has recently been demonstrated for words. Wong and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] asked participants to match the right or left halves of a pair of words while ignoring the other halves on both congruent trials, (both halves of the pair of words are matched), or incongruent trials (one half of the pair is matched, the other is mismatched). They found that performance was better on congruent than incongruent trials, showing interference from the supposedly ignored halves of the words. This &#x02018;composite word effect&#x02019; was stronger for highly familiar words, i.e., those from participants&#x02019; first compared to their second language and for real words compared to pseudo-words [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Secondly, there is evidence that words are read in a holistic manner over the range of orientations at which we normally encounter them. A seminal study of reading rotated words suggests that words are read &#x02018;holistically&#x02019; at orientations at or close to the upright but in a more piecemeal or analytic fashion when rotated by 180 degrees [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Response times to recognize words are independent of word length between 0&#x000b0; and ~ 60&#x000b0;, increase with increased word length in a manner suggesting piecemeal reading of sub-lexical units, with a final shift to very slow letter by letter reading between beyond ~120&#x000b0;. This &#x02018;word inversion effect&#x02019; holds for words presented in their familiar format but not for words written backwards or for mirror reversed words [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Finally, the face superiority effect has obvious parallels with the &#x02018;word superiority effect&#x02019; which shows that the recognition of single letters is more efficient when they are embedded in real words than when presented alone or embedded in meaningless string of letters [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The current study utilizes design aspects of both the word inversion and the word superiority paradigm to investigate the idea that adult dyslexics are somehow less tuned to the visual form of words than skilled adult readers using a task that does not require reading. We asked participants to judge whether a pair of real words or a pair of letter strings (formed by jumbling the letters of the words) were the same or differed by a single letter. The word-superiority effect [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] predicts that performance should be best in the real word condition. Additionally, we asked participants to make this perceptual judgement for both upright words and letter strings and for the same stimuli which had been inverted. The &#x02018;word inversion effect&#x02019; predicts for our study superior performance in the upright condition. To preview our results, we found that both adults with dyslexia and skilled adult readers preformed as predicted, showing fastest response times for upright real words and slowest for inverted letter strings. Most interestingly, the effects of inversion and degradation of orthographic regularity were more detrimental to the skilled readers than to those with dyslexia, supporting the idea that dyslexic readers may continue to read in a more analytic fashion into adulthood and never attain full automaticity through the exclusive use of visual word form cues [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="sec003" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Participants</title><p>The experimental group comprised 30 students (17 females) with a mean age of 23.6 years (SD = 6.07 years) and age range of 18 to 43 years who were registered with University College Dublin (UCD) Disability Support Services as dyslexic, having provided evidence of diagnosis by an educational or clinical psychologist on registration.

First, the experimental task clearly engages perceptual expertise in word recognition, as response time increases with both inversion and with letter jumbling, establishing a gradient of difficulty whereby participants are fastest for upright-real words, next fastest for upright-jumbled words, slower again for inverted-real words and slowest for inverted-jumbled words. Although word length only varied by one letter, response times showed word length by orientation and word length by orthography interaction effects so that the latency differences for 6- and 7-letter words was greater for inverted than upright and for jumbled than real words. Therefore, the experimental manipulations served, as expected, to shift processing from an expert, largely holistic style to an increasingly analytic style and likely induced letter by letter reading in the most difficult condition. If participants were relying exclusively on an analytic strategy then word length effects would not be expected to vary with changing orientation and orthographic regularity.</p><p>Secondly, we stress that even the easiest condition likely involves some degree of analytic processing. This is because participants must scan between a pair of words in deciding whether they are the same or different. And, as spelling regularities exist at both a coarse, whole word scale and at finer sub-lexical scales [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], a strategy that capitalises on expertise for orthographic regularity may also involve some analytic processing.</p><p>Regarding the performance of dyslexic and normal readers, four aspects of the results are notable. First, the performance of both groups is consistent with the use of holistic processing, showing clear evidence of both superiority and inversion effects, i.e., participants from both groups are faster to detect a difference between the stimulus pairs when these are real words rather than jumbled words and when they are upright than inverted. Secondly, and central to this study, we find that college students with dyslexia are less hindered than their peers by changes in orientation and orthography that make the task more difficult. Specifically, the proportionate change in response time that accompanies both word inversion and word jumbling is significantly greater for normal readers than their dyslexic peers. This result is consistent with the idea that &#x02018;compensated dyslexics&#x02019;&#x02013;adults who have successfully learned how to read&#x02013;may read in a manner that still relies more on analytic and less on holistic processes. As such they may be less affected by the experimental conditions that force a shift from holistic to analytic processing. The third and fourth observations from our data are related, namely that the dyslexic college students are significantly slower than their peers in all conditions but show comparable sensitivity in the task. This is consistent with a recent study comparing the cognitive profile of dyslexic college students with their peers [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; here differences in various performance measures, apart from spelling, reflect response time rather than accuracy differences.</p><p>In Experiment 2 we modified the task to address two limitations of the first study. First, there is the issue of word length. While the 6- and 7-letter words we used might not be classified as particularly &#x02018;long words&#x02019; by some accounts [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], using shorter words may increase the use of holistic processing in the easier conditions. A second limitation of Experiment 1 relates to the use of a non-blocked design, i.e., all four conditions were intermixed so that participants, insofar as they used different strategies in the different conditions, could not predict in advance the optimal strategy from trial to trial. Therefore, Experiment 2 utilized shorter words of 4 or 5 letters and a blocked design with the expectation of revealing more marked differences between the groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Experiment 2</title><sec id="sec012" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The methods were identical to those of Experiment 1 except where noted below.</p><sec id="sec013"><title>Participants</title><p>The experimental group comprised 16 students (12 females) with a mean age of 21.0 years (SD = 3.18 years) and age range of 18 to 31 years who were registered with UCD Disability Support Services as dyslexic.

As in Experiment 1, this suggests that the experimental manipulations worked as expected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>General discussion</title><p>The word superiority effect attests to perceptual expertise in word recognition whereby familiar words are read in a largely holistic fashion [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This sensitivity to orthographic regularity&#x02014;to the visual form of familiar words&#x02014;is tied to the orientation of words that we encounter while reading [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] just as holistic processing of faces is tied to orientations at or near the upright [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This same perceptual expertise is engaged in our study in which participants judge whether pairs of words or pairs of letter strings are the same or different and where the stimuli are presented in both upright and inverted form.</p><p>In both Experiments 1 and 2, the experimental manipulations of stimulus inversion and degradation of orthographic regularity worked to induce a shift from a predominantly global or holistic style of processing to one that is more local or analytic. And in both experiments, RT differences between the groups suggest that those with dyslexia may rely more on a local analysis of words and word-like stimuli as their default processing style. As such they are less affected by the experimental manipulations that their non-dyslexic peers. In Experiment 1 these differences only emerge in an analysis of the proportionate increase in RT that accompany changes in orthographic regularity and stimulus orientation, with dyslexic participants being comparatively less affected as the task becomes more difficult. While consistent with the general thesis that dyslexics may rely more on analytic processing in processing words and word-like stimuli, this conclusion is strengthened by the results of Experiment 2 which shows significant interactions of experimental group with both word length and stimulus orientation, both indicative of a greater reliance on analytic processing in the dyslexic group.</p><p>The second experiment differed from the first in two respects, namely in the use of shorter words and a blocked design, both manipulations used to encourage the use of holistic processing. A comprehensive review and reanalysis of word length effects in word recognition which controls for word frequency effects [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] found that that word length is facilitatory for short words of 3&#x02013;5 letters, does not affect performance for words of 5&#x02013;8 letters and is inhibitory for longer words. While this suggests that the 6- and 7-letter words we used, especially as they are highly familiar words, might not be classified as particularly long words, shortening word length in Experiment 2 clearly had effect of highlighting differences between the groups.</p><p>Regarding the use of a blocked design in Experiment 2, recent research on discrimination of both simple tones and more complex speech sounds demonstrate that a key factor distinguishing dyslexic and control participants in such sound discrimination tasks is the ability, on the part of controls, to take advantage of a &#x02018;perceptual anchor&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Specifically, whereas the two groups show no difference in sound discrimination under conditions in which there is no common reference stimulus on successive trials, the presence of such a perceptual anchor (e.g., on each trial participants are judging whether a test tone is higher or lower than a common reference tone of fixed frequency) leads to a strong advantage to non-dyslexic participants. Thus, the use of a blocked design may also have contributed to highlighting groups differences in Experiment 2.</p><p>In relating our findings to those of previous researchers, we recap the main findings. First, both groups show word superiority and word inversion effects, being faster to judge the similarity of upright than inverted stimuli and for real than for jumbled words. Previous research with dyslexic children (mean age, 11.5 years) reports robust word superiority and pseudo-word superiority effects in the face of compromised phonological skills [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As the children failed to show a word superiority effect of greater magnitude than the pseudo-word superiority effect, the authors argue that the effects reflect sensitivity to orthographic regularity rather than to lexical processes. Reilhac and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] used a different task in which dyslexic children and controls had to decide whether two sequentially presented 4-letter strings (including words, pseudowords and non-words) were the same or different and where the differences included letter substitutions or letter transpositions. When the difference between pairs of letter strings involved letter substitution, the dyslexic children showed an advantage for both real words and pseudowords over non-words but they did not show a WSE above and beyond the PWSE, again arguing for intact sub-lexical processing of word forms in dyslexia. Similarly, our results with dyslexic college students point to intact sensitivity to the visual form of the word, with increased response times when the word form is degraded by jumbling or by inversion.</p><p>Secondly, college students with dyslexia are less hindered than their peers by changes in orientation and orthography and more hindered by increased word length, all factors that make the task more difficult. This is evident from Experiment 1 where the proportionate change in response time that accompanies both word inversion and word jumbling is significantly greater for normal readers than their dyslexic peers. And in Experiment 2 those with dyslexia are more affected by increases in word length but less affected by changes in stimulus orientation than the control group. These finding are consistent with the idea that adults with dyslexia may read in a manner that still relies more on analytic and less on holistic processes. In the case of reading, Bruck [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] has argued that college students with dyslexia show &#x02018;arrested&#x02019; development and rely on strategies typical of much younger readers, specifically using more spelling-sound correspondences and context to recognize individual words. Although our task does not involve explicit reading or word recognition, one interpretation of the results is that they reflect a relatively greater reliance on analytic strategies in the dyslexic group and a poorer use of the cues of orthographic regularity that are of greater benefit to the normal readers.</p><p>While caution must be taken in speculating about the neural basis of these difference, it is interesting that there are a number of reports of anomalous functioning of the VWFA in dyslexia [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], a region of the brain that represents the visual form of the word at a level that captures orthographic regularity and that is sensitive to word inversion [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In particular, the research of [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] suggests that a regions of the brain neighbouring the VWFA which is involved in memorization of the visual word form compensate for this lack of sensitivity to orthographic regularity in dyslexia.</p><p>Turning to the broader behavioural literature, we note that there are reports of superior orthographic processing in dyslexia. Using a large sample, Siegel and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] compared dyslexic and normal readers at eight different reading levels on both an &#x02018;orthographic awareness task&#x02019; which measured readers knowledge of the probable sequences of letters within words, and a &#x02018;phonological awareness&#x02019; task which involved reading pseudo-words aloud. Replicating many previous studies that show poorer phonological skills in dyslexia, this study also showed superior orthographic skills suggesting that dyslexic readers rely more on visual strategies and visual memory in learning to read. However, superior orthographic skills may not imply perceptual expertise in the sense of automatic or holistic recognition of word forms, e.g., while college students with dyslexia prefer a visual over a phonological strategy in matching words and non-words, this often includes a letter by letter visual scanning strategy [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. And there is evidence that some aspects of orthographic knowledge, specifically letter position, is poorly developed in dyslexic children [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>The final observations from our study is that college students with dyslexia are generally slower but show comparable sensitivity to their peers. As noted above, this is consistent with studies comparing the cognitive profile of dyslexic college students with their peers [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] where differences generally reflect response time rather than accuracy differences. Similarly, in the learning of non-words via practice and repetition, college students are reported to be slower but not less accurate than their peers [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] As a university education increases vocabulary and introduces subject-specific terminology that may present challenges for even the most accomplished dyslexic readers [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], knowledge of how &#x02018;compensated&#x02019; dyslexics differ from their peers is crucial to providing supports at university. Persistent difficulties in reading are reported in college students with dyslexia, coupled with differences in a number of verbally based performance measures including working memory, arithmetic and tasks involving the retrieval of verbal information from long term memory [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] As such, the generally slower performance of the dyslexic participants in our study is perhaps not surprising.</p><p>Although generally slower, the dyslexic participants are less affected than their peers when experimental conditions force a shift from holistic processing to a style that favours analytic processing. One interpretation of these results is that while those with dyslexia are clearly sensitive to orthographic regularity, this expertise appears to be less well developed than in those with typical reading skills. This is consistent with what we know about dyslexia&#x02014;that it is a disorder characterised by a lack of fluency, where &#x02018;fluency&#x02019; reflects expertise in translating between the visual form of a word and its pronunciation without recourse to phonological information at the sub-lexical level [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] By some accounts reading fluency is synonymous with holistic visual processing, and it has been suggested that fluent readers can automatically recognize ~ 300 words that make up about 85% of those encountered in everyday reading [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>More generally, while some have argued that word recognition involves predominantly part-based processing [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], a number of phenomena associated with reading and word recognition&#x02014;including the word inversion effect [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the word superiority effect [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the word inferiority effect [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], our sensitivity to letter position in words [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and the &#x02018;illusory letter phenomenon&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]&#x02014;point to a considerable role for holistic processing. And, as in face recognition, the use of &#x02018;holistic&#x02019; information demonstrated by these phenomena is a marker of perceptual expertise in word recognition [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Relatedly, and in contrast to the idea that word recognition is a process whose efficiency is limited by having to recognize individual letters [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], metrics of capacity based on response times suggest that word recognition reflects a particularly efficient form of perceptual processing [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This efficiency may reflect in part the contribution of fast-acting, magnocellular processes that return an initial coarse analysis of word shape which facilitates perception at a configural or holistic level [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Interestingly, Chinese children with developmental dyslexia who show deficits in magnocellular visual processing fail to show the typical global over local processing advantage in the processing of Chinese characters that is shown by typical Chinese child readers. And this global advantage is intact in Chinese children with developmental dyslexia who show normal magnocellular visual processing.</p><p>To summarize, we introduce a novel task that does not require reading and that borrows design elements from both the word superiority and word inversion paradigms. We find that college students with dyslexia perform in a manner that suggests sensitivity to orthographic regularity showing increased response times when words are inverted or their letters jumbled. However, relative to their peers, they are less disadvantaged than their peers when forced to rely more on analytic processes in the task, suggesting comparatively poorer tuning to orthographic regularity. This is especially interesting in light of reports of hypoactivation in the VWFA in dyslexia [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], a region of the brain that gradually attunes itself to orthographic regularity as children learn to read [<xref rid="pone.0187326.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. While much research on dyslexia focuses on poor phonological processing, research on the visual skills of dyslexics, particularly their sensitivity to the redundancy inherent in visual word forms, offers new ways to study the disorder.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0187326.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Shaywitz</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>. <article-title>Dyslexia</article-title>. <source>Sci Am</source>. <year>1996</year>;<volume>274</volume>(<issue>5 November</issue>):<fpage>25</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>33</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0187326.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Shaywitz</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Escobar</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Shaywitz</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Flecher</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Makuch</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>. <article-title>Evidence that dyslexia may represent the lower tail of a normal distribution of reading ability</article-title>. <source>N Engl J Med</source>. <year>1992</year>;<volume>326</volume>:<fpage>145</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>50</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199201163260301">10.1056/NEJM199201163260301</ext-link></comment>
