In HMB endometrium, inactivation of cortisol (by enzyme 11&#x003b2; hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11&#x003b2;HSD2)), may cause local endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency and hence increased angiogenesis and impaired vasoconstriction. We propose that &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; of luteal phase endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency could reduce menstrual bleeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>DexFEM is a double-blind response-adaptive parallel-group placebo-controlled trial in women with HMB (108 to be randomised), with active treatment the potent oral synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, which is relatively resistant to 11&#x003b2;HSD2 inactivation. Participants will be aged over 18&#x02005;years, with mean measured menstrual blood loss (MBL) for two screening cycles &#x02265;50&#x02005;mL. The primary outcome is reduction in MBL from screening. Secondary end points are questionnaire assessments of treatment effect and acceptability. Treatment will be for 5&#x02005;days in the mid-luteal phases of three treatment menstrual cycles. Six doses of low-dose dexamethasone (ranging from 0.2 to 0.9&#x02005;mg twice daily) will be compared with placebo, to ascertain optimal dose, and whether this has advantage over placebo. Statistical efficiency is maximised by allowing randomisation probabilities to &#x02018;adapt&#x02019; at five points during enrolment phase, based on the response data available so far, to favour doses expected to provide greatest additional information on the dose&#x02013;response. Bayesian Normal Dynamic Linear Modelling, with baseline MBL included as covariate, will determine optimal dose (re reduction in MBL). Secondary end points will be analysed using generalised dynamic linear models. For each dose for all end points, a 95% credible interval will be calculated for effect versus placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Dexamethasone is widely used and hence well-characterised safety-wise. Ethical approval has been obtained from Scotland A Research Ethics Committee (12/SS/0147). Trial findings will be disseminated via open-access peer-reviewed publications, conferences, clinical networks, public lectures, and our websites.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01769820; EudractCT 2012-003405-98.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>STATISTICS &#x00026; RESEARCH METHODS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Background</title><p>Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is defined as excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with the woman's physical, emotional, social or material quality-of-life.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The prevalence of excessive menstrual bleeding in developing countries is reported as 4&#x02013;9%.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Community surveys of UK menstruating women have found 35&#x02013;52% prevalence of reporting &#x02018;heavy periods&#x02019; in the past 6&#x02005;months,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

The Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), a hormonal contraceptive now licensed as treatment for HMB, is unsuitable for women seeking to become pregnant. LNG-IUS can cause amenorrhoea, or for other users there is ongoing and unpredictable unscheduled bleeding, and these consequences can be unacceptable to women.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The audit reported that in the first year after attendance for HMB, oral medication and IUS were received by 29% and 33%, respectively, but these were the &#x02018;final&#x02019; treatment for only 12% (over half switched from oral medication) and 22% (one third switched from IUS).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> IUS and systemic progestin therapies for HMB are discontinued by up to one in five users due to side effects.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A recent meta-analysis concludes that LNG-IUS is less cost-effective than hysterectomy for HMB.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

Approximately 48% of cases of HMB referred to secondary care occur in the absence of obvious pathology.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In the normal menstrual cycle, blood vessel proliferation, differentiation and vasoconstriction in the endometrium is tightly regulated to ensure that a controlled and self-limited endometrial shedding occurs at menses. This is followed by a self-limiting inflammatory response to endometrial injury to ensure successful healing with a return to normal architecture, prior to the next cycle of vascular proliferation.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> These cyclic processes are orchestrated by dynamic changes in sex steroids and their interplay with endocrine, vascular and immune systems. Perimenstrual disturbance in local molecular and cellular mechanisms that are likely to lead to heavy and/or prolonged bleeding, include: (1) decreased vasoconstriction; (2) decreased vascular homeostasis; (3) an excessive inflammatory response at menses; and (4) defective repair of the postmenstrual endometrium. Deficient vascular development and abnormal angiogenesis have been reported in women with HMB.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Glucocorticoids promote vasoconstriction and inhibit angiogenesis, so HMB could result from local endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref> We have shown that endometrium from women with HMB has increased expression of 11&#x003b2; hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11&#x003b2;HSD2), an enzyme which inactivates the major endogenous glucocorticoid, cortisol. This may cause local deficiency in endometrial cortisol,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and result in an inadequate hypoxic signal at the time of progesterone withdrawal.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>We propose a novel therapy with synthetic glucocorticoid to &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; luteal phase endometrial deficiency of cortisol in women with HMB, ensuring endometrial vascular differentiation and inflammation are properly controlled during the peri(menstrual) time of the cycle. There are several potential approaches, including use of a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist which is less susceptible than cortisol to inactivation by 11&#x003b2;HSD2. Dexamethasone has higher affinity for GR than cortisol, but lower affinity for 11&#x003b2;HSD2. Therefore, our proposed treatment is a new therapeutic use of an existing, well-characterised medical treatment&#x02014;oral dexamethasone&#x02014;administered at a low &#x02018;replacement&#x02019; dose.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives for this trial of oral dexamethasone for amelioration of HMB, are to: (1) identify the efficacy of oral dexamethasone, and optimal dose to use; (2) gather safety data; (3) gather methodological and mechanistic insight to allow further development of this or similar treatment option.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Design and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>A response-adaptive parallel group randomised-controlled trial was proposed, comparing oral dexamethasone (in a range of doses) with placebo treatment, over three menstrual cycles. This allows, at intervals across enrolment, adaptation of the investigational treatment allocation probabilities, in response to the outcome data already collected, so those subsequently enrolled are more likely to be randomised to doses that are more informative about the dose&#x02013;response relationship. This design ensures as robust as possible identification of the optimal dose, and maximal study power to estimate the effect of dexamethasone versus placebo, assuming treatment for three menstrual cycles. Objective measurement menstrual blood loss (MBL) was selected as the outcome, assessing treatment effect in terms of reduction from baseline in MBL (in the 2nd and 3rd of these treated cycles). This outcome is well suited to the adaptive design context since MBL data are available promptly after treatment, to inform adaptation. An adaptive design has efficiency and ethical advantages. Efficiency gains in terms of sample size required are in the range 25&#x02013;40% for a broad spectrum of adaptive designs.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This efficiency itself constitutes an ethical advantage,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and additionally such a design ensures that more women are randomised to more effective doses (see online supplementary figure).</p><p>Development of a Bayesian adaptive design requires extensive preliminary simulation studies to explore empirically the performance of candidate designs.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Simulations were performed via fractional factorial design, covering a range of design options and model assumptions, including: proportion allocated to placebo (constant throughout); number of active doses; variance of the primary outcome (change in MBL from baseline); shape of the true dexamethasone dose&#x02013;response curve for the primary outcome; accrual rate of patients to the study; and specific features of the adaptation process, including the method determining how the randomisation schedule would be adapted and the frequency with which this takes place. The simulations allowed the frequentist properties (statistical power and significance level) of candidate adaptive designs to be assessed. The final design selected is one which performs well across a broad range of scenarios. The adaptive design development process will be reported in detail elsewhere <italic>(CH et al, manuscript in preparation</italic>).</p><p>On the basis of the simulations, the specific features of the design selected were: 29% of patients allocated to placebo throughout; six active doses (0.4&#x02013;1.8&#x02005;mg total daily divided dose of dexamethasone) starting with equal allocation probability; and five adaptations, evenly spaced after 16, 32, 50, 66 and 84 randomisations (see online supplementary figure).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study setting</title><p>The participant population will be women reporting HMB who are referred for management to gynaecology outpatient departments in NHS Lothian (NHSL), Scotland, or who attend a community gynaecology clinic (self-referral or general practitioner (GP) referral).

Thus, for a patient with a regular standard 28-day cycle, treatment should happen on days 20&#x02013;24, ending 4&#x02005;days before the start of the expected next period. Women who do not wish to carry out serial dipstick testing will be permitted to participate, but the treatment start date in each cycle will be estimated &#x02018;pro rata&#x02019; on the basis of the woman's cycle length documented in previous screening and treatment cycles. Dipstick testing, where used, should start early in the follicular phase (about day 6&#x02013;9 of a 28-day cycle). In the event no LH surge is detected we will, to avoid missed treatment, specify a &#x02018;latest&#x02019; day in the cycle to start treatment, as above.</p><p>If a patient is unable to tolerate the trial medication or develops a serious adverse event, or falls pregnant, or starts a prohibited medication (see bottom of <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>), trial medication will be discontinued.

We will also examine change in menstrual diary score for volume of menstrual period, assessing its reliability and validity as substitute for change in objectively measured MBL.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size</title><p>In trials of medical treatments for HMB it is generally held that a 25% reduction in MBL would be a worthwhile improvement<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02014;for example, a 16&#x02005;mL reduction for an MBL of 65&#x02005;mL, a fairly typical MBL among women with problem of HMB. The trial had been funded on the expectation that it would be completed within 3&#x02005;years, and it was expected that recruitment of and completion by 100&#x02013;110 participants was possible within the shorter time frame for recruitment, to ensure data collection completes about 4&#x02005;months before the end of funding. Therefore, all simulations took 100 as the total study size and thus 4 patients per month being enrolled. These analyses showed that our adaptive design is estimated to have statistical power of 93.8%, provided within-patient MBL SD is 18&#x02005;mL and maximum mean MBL benefit over placebo is 16&#x02005;mL. Patients who withdraw from the study will be replaced, so to have 100 completing the target, enrolment total is estimated at 108, based on prior experience.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Adaptive randomisation</title><p>The adaptive randomisation will proceed in six phases. Across the entire study a fixed proportion of patients (2/7, 29%) will be allocated to placebo, in order to protect the interpretability of the trial results from any drift in participant characteristics during the course of the trial. During phase one (the first 16 patients randomised) the remainder of patients will be assigned to one of the six active dexamethasone daily doses with equal allocation probability. At the end of the first and next four phases the NDLM (Normal Dynamic Linear Model) analysis will be run by the unblinded statistician to ascertain, on the basis of the accumulating MBL primary outcome data, how the randomisation schedule should be adapted. (The adaptation timings have been determined from the pretrial simulations and will take place after 16, 32, 50, 66 and 84 patients have been randomised.) During phases 2&#x02013;6 the allocation probability for each active dexamethasone dose will depend on the amount of new information that a randomisation would be expected to provide about the underlying dose&#x02013;response relationship, based on results collected in earlier phases. Specifically, this will be evaluated as the variance of the primary outcome at the current estimate of the ED<sub>95</sub> (the minimum dose with near-maximal efficacy). The independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will monitor the progression of the adaptive randomisation to verify that the randomisation schedule is being adapted appropriately in response to the accumulating MBL data.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Sequence generation</title><p>Computer-generated random numbers from the uniform (0,1) distribution will form the basis for the allocation sequence. This list of numbers will be generated by the unblinded programmer at Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit (ECTU) in advance and will be accessed in sequence during the trial to determine the treatment group for the next randomised participant, based on the set of treatment allocation probabilities at the current stage of the adaptive design.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Allocation concealment</title><p>Patients will be randomised via a secure website. Based on the treatment group assigned using the allocation sequence, a medication code from a predetermined &#x02018;reference&#x02019; list will be automatically added to a printed prescription. (In a Bayesian adaptive design there is no role for an allocation list, but this &#x02018;reference&#x02019; list is needed to ensure concealment.) This prescription will be dispensed by unblinded pharmacist by referring to the reference&#x02019; list provided in advance by ECTU, and only the patient number will be included in the treatment capsule bottle labelling.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Blinding</title><p>Unblinded study staff will be the programmer generating the treatment allocation sequence, the pharmacist dispensing the drug (or placebo) using the list of medication codes, the statistician performing the adaptation analyses and generating the DMC reports, the independent statistician validating the DMC reports and members of the independent DMC.

(Daily active dose will be split between morning and evening so the 6 strengths of dexamethasone capsules manufactured will be 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75 and 0.9&#x02005;mg capsules.) The bulk containers will be labelled to identify the strength of the capsules and these will be held (out of sight of any of the research team) by Pharmacy, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.

Glucocorticoids are even used to treat medical conditions in pregnancy (in first trimester for asthma; rheumatoid arthritis; hyperemesis gravidarum). This means the safety profile is well-known, and the exclusion criteria for this research therefore &#x02018;well-informed&#x02019;. Furthermore, the modest (short-course) doses being used are periphysiological. (Typical equivalent doses of dexamethasone in an acute exacerbation of obstructive airways disease, eg, would be &#x0003e;3&#x02005;mg/day, or over 66% more than the maximum dose proposed here.) A further advantage of this phase II &#x02018;new use for an existing drug&#x02019; trial, is that if it shows beneficial effect, &#x02018;drug development&#x02019; costs for future use will be comparatively low.</p><p>The rationale for the use of dexamethasone is derived from mechanistic laboratory studies which suggest a luteal phase glucocorticoid deficiency in the endometrium of women with HMB.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> While participants in the trial are not individually assessed to have low levels of endometrial glucocorticoid, it is expected that administration of dexamethasone would reverse local endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency where this is the case.</p><p>A unique feature of adaptive trial design is the time lag needed between initiation of research funding and initiating the trial itself, in order to allow the simulation analyses required to develop the design. In this time we undertook two small clinical/mechanistic studies, which involved 15 women in total, and comprised a first use of any modality of glucocorticoid for treatment of HMB. While these studies were not powered to estimate treatment effect, they enabled: collection of safety data (no safety concerns were raised and no patient withdrew during treatment) and mechanistic information (via repeat before-and-after MRI and endometrial biopsies); piloting of methods; and a check on some assumptions that had been fed into the adaptive design simulation model, for example, within-patient variability in MBL. Apart from the opportunity for this preliminary work, adaptive randomisation has notable methodological benefits, in terms of statistical efficiency, and ethically.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A disadvantage is that it is not easy to provide a simple explanation of adaptive randomisation in the patient information sheet.</p><p>The challenge for this study is recruitment, because a lot is asked. Participation lasts 6&#x02005;months, comprising screening menstrual collections and diary records for two untreated menstrual periods and then for each of the three treatment menstrual cycles (1) ovulation testing by urine dipstick each morning from about day 8, for about 6&#x02013;10&#x02005;days depending on cycle length, (2) taking medication twice a day for 5&#x02005;days in the mid-luteal phase (exact start date is calculated from ovulation) and (3) diary record of the period. In addition, for the second and third treatment cycles menstrual collection is requested. At start and finish safety bloods are taken and in the last treatment cycle twice-weekly urine collections are requested to assess ovarian function. It speaks volumes about the adverse impact of HMB on women's lives that patients judge it worthwhile to participate in such a trial.</p><p>This also underscores the unmet clinical need for a medical treatment for HMB that was noted above, particularly one that is compatible with starting pregnancy. Therefore, demonstration of efficacy with systemic administration of dexamethasone has potential benefit for many women. It will allow further development of this drug as a treatment option, a possible stepping-stone to more sophisticated/targeted steroid treatment of HMB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e269" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006837.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are immensely grateful for the valuable contributions to DexFEM of: DexFEM research team&#x02014;research nurses Catherine Murray &#x00026; Sharon McPherson; laboratory manager Moira Nichol; technical support: Alison Murray; secretaries Sheila Milne &#x00026; Anne Houghton.

HODC, PW, BRW, CJW, SS, SGH, JPI and PTKS designed the overall research and obtained funding. CJW and CHH undertook adaptive design simulation analyses and, with PW, HODC and BRW, finalised design of the adaptive trial. PW, HODC, AD, CJW, BRW and MM wrote/reviewed all protocol versions. AD (trial coordinator) registered the trial and submitted all REC, MHRA and local R&#x00026;D applications. CJW, CHH and PW devised the statistical plan. CJW and CHH devised the format for reports to DMC and a process for regular (blind) reporting of adaptations to DMC. PW, AD and MM designed data collection materials and patient information sheets, with input from HODC and research nurses. PW, AD and HODC designed community mail-out materials, with advice from SPCRN. AD, MM, HODC, PW and CJW designed patient CRFs with help from ECTU and research nurses.
