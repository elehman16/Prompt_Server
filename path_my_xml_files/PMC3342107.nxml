Of these 60% are left with moderate to severe walking disability. Evidence shows that rehabilitation techniques which emphasise activity of the hemiplegic side increase ipsilesional cortical plasticity and improve functional outcomes.

We have shown that an orthosis "TheraTogs" (a corset with elasticated strapping) significantly increases hemiplegic muscle activity during gait.

Subjects will walk throughout the day with only the assigned walking aid. Standard therapy treatments and usual care will remain unchanged and documented. The intervention will continue for five weeks or until patients have reached Functional Ambulation category 5.

In Switzerland approximately 9000 people a year suffer a first time stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Of those patients who survive the acute phase, between 20 and 30% are unable to walk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Those who can are often left with moderate to severe walking disability and reduced gait speeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The risk of falling increases--a recent study indicating that at 3 months 28% of stroke patients have fallen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The resulting disability has an enormous socioeconomic impact on patients, families and health service providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Rehabilitation methods which improve balance and gait are crucial for the quality of life of stroke victims and to reduce the ongoing cost of long term care. Studies have shown that early rehabilitation in specialised settings e.g. stroke units results in better functional outcome than in non-specialised units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It has been suggested that these better results are achieved partly due to enhanced staff awareness of the importance of mobility thus preventing secondary complications such as loss of cardiovascular fitness or muscle weakness. The physical environment is also likely to be adapted enabling more independent movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Current rehabilitation methods which aim to improve motor control during walking do not appear to deliver additional improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis showed that only cardiorespiratory physical fitness training provides robust evidence for a benefit to walking ability after stroke. Repetitive task training also appeared to have some effect. Motor and neurophysiological approaches did not demonstrate a positive effect on walking recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This suggests that underlying mechanisms responsible for the recovery of motor co-ordination and control of walking following stroke are not significantly influenced by current therapy methods. These findings are further illustrated by studies which show that long term improvements in gait function occur in the absence of improvements in muscle co-ordination patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or improved kinematic or kinetic gait profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Buurke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] concluded that "functional gait improvements may be more related to compensatory strategies than by restitution of muscle co-ordination patterns in the affected leg." Kautz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] concluded that "There is no evidence of improved locomotor co-ordination post intervention. The increased walking and pedalling speed were achieved by a more proficient use of the same impaired pattern without EMG timing changes, likely because of increased strength and endurance post intervention." We suggest that improvements in gait function due to current rehabilitation methods are predominantly achieved through more efficient use of abnormal movement patterns. This may be a reason for the generally low level of independence and function achieved following stroke.</p><p>Spontaneous recovery which occurs within the first weeks post stroke largely defines long term functional outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Recent studies investigating changes in the cerebral cortex following focal injury have indicated that cortical plasticity and neuronal growth that occurs early after infarct may "underlie the brain's self-repair process" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Evidence shows that this early cortical plasticity is an important factor in the spontaneous recovery of motor control which predicts long term outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We suggest that it is this process which is inadequately influenced by current rehabilitation methods. The recovery of motor skills following stroke relies on the brains ability to reorganise its neuronal control of movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Reorganisation can occur within and between cortical networks both within the lesioned and non-lesioned hemisphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Rossini et al. stated that "Reorganization phenomena following ischemic stroke observed so far, may be classified into two main groups: overactivation of areas belonging to the neural network for a specific task--or activation of unusual areas that attempt to replace the function of the damaged tissue" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The overactivation of the original neural network is primarily activity in the lesioned hemisphere. Following stroke cortical activity has been recorded in both lesioned and non-lesioned hemispheres during movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Increasingly findings show that increased activity in the lesioned hemisphere correlates with better recovery and improved motor performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Conversely increased activity in the contralesional hemisphere is associated with poorer motor recovery of the hemiplegic limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It appears that improved motor recovery occurs when the brain is able to make use of the original neural network to control movement. When new networks are formed for example in the unaffected hemisphere, motor recovery is reduced. The authors suggest that activity in the original network represents "true" recovery. The recruitment of new networks may represent the learning of compensatory movement strategies associated with poorer functional outcome.</p><p>Findings in favour of this hypothesis have been demonstrated in both upper and lower limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As post-injury behavioural experience is critical to the reassembly of adaptive networks and strongly influences cortical reorganisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] these results indicate that treatment approaches which promote increased plasticity in the lesioned hemisphere will promote greater functional recovery. This assumption is supported by a recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] which examined whether participating in stroke rehabilitation which emphasised use of the paretic upper limb was associated with increased cortical activity of the lesioned hemisphere and consequently better function. The review concluded that neural changes in the sensorimotor cortex of the lesioned hemisphere were achieved with rehabilitation interventions that emphasized use of the paretic upper limb and resulted in improved functional motor gains.</p><p>Nudo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] demonstrated with squirrel monkeys that forced retraining of skilled hand use prevented loss of hand territory representation adjacent to the infarct and in some instances the representations expanded. This functional reorganization was accompanied by recovery of skilled hand movements. Control monkeys with identical lesions who did not receive therapy lost paretic hand representation und function.</p><p>In general these results suggest that therapies which emphasise use of the hemiplegic side promote plasticity in the lesioned hemisphere through emphasising the use of previously established neural networks and are associated with improved function. It may be that therapies which promote compensatory movement or reduce activity of the hemiplegic limb inhibit plasticity in the lesioned hemisphere and promote the development of new neural networks associated with reduced function.</p><p>To date therapies which emphasise use of the hemiplegic limb have been confined to the upper extremity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and have not been applied during gait rehabilitation following stroke. Canes are very commonly used post stroke although studies have consistently shown a significant reduction in surface electromyography (EMG) activity in all muscle groups on the side contralateral to cane use in both stroke and non-stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In light of the factors which increase plastic reorganisation in the lesioned hemisphere, namely interventions which emphasise use of the paretic limb, the effect of canes which reduce activity in the hemiplegic side may be to inhibit activity in the original neural networks responsible for lower limb control resulting in poorer walking function.</p><p>In gait rehabilitation, attention should also be paid to the optimal restoration of balance. In relation to balance, evidence shows that balance control does not occur automatically at spinal cord and brainstem level as has previously been thought, but rather is highly influenced by cortical activity and cognitive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Two main types of balance strategies are recognised--fixed support or change of support strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Fixed support strategies are used when no stepping or reaching activities are needed to maintain balance. Rotatory torques are generated through muscle activity primarily around the hip and ankle. Change of support strategies are used in challenging conditions when stepping or reaching reactions are necessary to maintain equilibrium. Fixed support strategies use less cognitive resources than change in support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Elderly people or subjects with poor balance use more change in support strategies and therefore more cognitive resources than younger, healthy subjects to maintain equilibrium under the same conditions.</p><p>The authors suggest that balance rehabilitation should attempt to restore balance strategies used by healthy individuals--namely fixed support responses requiring fewer cognitive resources in unchallenging situations. However cane use increases the base of support when walking through use of the arms. This strategy may emphasise use of cortical networks used for reaching "change of support" reactions. It emphasises use of cognitive resources on safe level ground and reduces the use of "fixed support" strategies. The authors suggest this leads to a long term reduction of automatic balance responses. It may be that because cognitive resources are needed in safe, level environments fewer additional resources are available for more difficult conditions such as walking outside or on public transport. The long term effects of canes on balance recovery and functional gait following stroke has to our knowledge been investigated in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Balance recovery and community participation were shown to be reduced.</p><p>Taking all of these considerations together, the authors suggest that an optimal walking aid for post stroke gait rehabilitation would provide enough support to enable independent early walking without reducing hemiplegic muscle activity or inhibiting the use of balance reactions. The immediate effect of an elasticised orthotic walking aid (TheraTogs) on hemiplegic hip abductor activity has been previously investigated by the authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Activity in gluteus medius was increased by 16.5% compared to walking without aids when walking with TheraTogs (with cane use activity in gluteus medius was reduced by 22% compared to walking without aids). The increased activity with TheraTogs may be due to increased proprioceptive input provided by the orthosis or to the physical shortening of the muscle leading to increased overlap between the actin and myosin filaments and consequently a stronger contraction.</p><p>The authors hypothesize that cane use will inhibit activity on the hemiplegic side leading to reduced ipsilesional cortical activity and poorer long term functional gait outcomes. In contrast we hypothesize that TheraTogs will increase activity on the hemiplegic side during walking leading to increased ipsilesional cortical activity and improved long term functional gait outcomes.</p><p>We further hypothesize that cane use will inhibit the use of normal balance reactions leading to reduced balance recovery and poorer social participation. As no external support is provided with the TheraTogs orthosis the use of automatic balance responses will not be inhibited during walking. This will result in improved balance recovery and social participation.</p><p>The aim of this study is to investigate the long term effects of canes and TheraTogs on the recovery of motor control and co-ordination, gait, daily activity, balance and social participation when used in early gait rehabilitation following stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods - testing the hypothesis</title><sec><title>Design and setting</title><p>This study is a multi-centred single blind, randomised, control trial with parallel design.</p><p>Subjects will be recruited from the neurological rehabilitation department of 3 participating Swiss hospitals: Felix Platter Spital Basel, Kantonspital Luzern Neurorehabiltaton and Reha Clinic Zurzach.

Intervention will begin when patients have reached level 3 on the FAC.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention details</title><p>Interventions will be applied for five weeks. If patients become independent walkers before this time (FAC 5) the intervention will be discontinued. If patients are discharged before this time and have not reached FAC 5 where possible the home carer will be instructed in the application of TheraTogs and the intervention will continue for 5 weeks as planned. TheraTogs will be applied as part of the washing/dressing routine in the morning by therapists or nursing staff instructed in the standard application. Subjects will walk throughout the day until preparing for bed with the prescribed walking aid. Standby assistance only will be provided during walking when necessary for safety. No other form of walking aid will be used for the duration of the study intervention. Foot or foot/ankle orthoses will remain unchanged and be worn as usual. All other forms of therapy (frequency and type) will remain unchanged and documented. Patients will receive usual care. When therapists feel that TheraTogs hinders treatment sessions the application may be removed for the duration of the session. It must be immediately reapplied with the standard application following treatment. When necessary TheraTogs may be removed for sleeping in the afternoon.

Surface EMG electrodes (Kendall, Tyco/Healthcare) will be placed onto the skin overlying these muscles following the "European Recommendations for Surface Electromyography" (SENIAM) guidelines with a spacing of 20 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The ground electrode will be placed on the clean shaven skin overlying the sacrum. EMG is measured at a sampling rate of 2048 Hz without filtering so that the signals are measured including DC. The digitalised data will be high pass filtered with a fourth order filter with a cut off frequency of 10 Hz and full wave rectified. To test gluteus maximus subjects will lie prone on an examination plinth. With hip and knee extended manual resistance will be given at the ankle joit in the opposite direction to movement. Subjects will be asked to slowly increase the force, reaching maximum effort after 3-5 sec, hold it for 3 sec and relax over 3 sec. A rest for 1 min will provided after which the test will be carried out once more. The maximum value from both tests will be used a s MVC.</p><p>To test gluteus medius, subjects will lie on the hemiplegic side. &#x0003c; the subject will beinstucted to lift leg sideways and manual resistance will be applied at the ankle in the opposite direction to movement. Subjects will be asked to slowly increase the force, reaching maximum effort after 3-5 sec, hold it for 3 sec and relax over 3 sec. A rest for 1 min will provided after which the test will be carried out once more. The maximum value from both tests will be used a s MVC.</p><p>3. Electrodes will be removed from the non-hemiplegic side and will be applied with the same procedure as described above to the hemiplegic muscles of gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, vastus lateralis, semitendinosis, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior. Henna will be applied to ensure accurate replacement at subsequent sessions.</p><p>4. The electrogomiometer, foot switches and SwayStar instrumentation will also be fitted. A biaxial electrogoniometer will be placed over the anterior hemiplegic hip joint line, proximal arm in line with the anterior superior iliac spines, distal in line with the axis of the femur. Foot switches will be placed under the calcaneus and the third distal phalange of each foot to measure "initial contact" and "foot off" simultaneously with the EMG. SwayStar will be strapped to the patient's waist.</p><p>5. Patients will complete the "Timed up and go test". Time taken will be recorded, EMG activity, dynamic balance and hip kinematics will be collected and video recordings will be taken.</p><p>6. Subjects will then rest for five minutes after which they will walk for twelve gait cycles three times. Subjects will rest for five minutes between each set of twelve gait cycles. Data collected during the first two and last two gait cycles will be excluded. Data from the three sets of eight remaining gait cycles will be used to calculate mean values.</p><p>7. Patients will rest for ten minutes and then walk over a set of four low (24 cm high) barriers placed 1 m apart.</p><p>8. Measurement equipment will be removed, patients will rest for 20 min with a drink after which the SIS will be completed.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>Hemiplegic peak EMG values of gluteus maximus and medius will be compared as a percentage of the maximum voluntary contraction peak EMG value of the same muscles of the unaffected leg.</p><p>Activation patterns of gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, vastus lateralis, semitendinosis, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior will be assessed at baseline and at subsequent data collection points. On and off times for each muscle during each stride will be calculated. An amplitude of two standard deviations higher that the resting (reference) amplitude will be considered "on" activity. All detected on- and off- times will be normalised in time using the stride time from the related heel strike measured by a foot switch. SEMG will be rectified and filtered with a high pass fourth order filter with a cut off of 10 Hz and plotted with the timing information along the x-axis. Total burst duration (gait cycle time minus off time) and median on and off times in percentage of the gait cycle will be calculated for each subject for each muscle. Activation patterns will be compared to established normal patterns.</p><p>For kinematic measures mean hip range of movement during 1 gait cycle in the frontal plane (ab/aduction) and in the sagittal plane (flex/ext) will be measured for the intervention groups and compared with normal values for matched controls.</p><p>Balance control will be assessed with four measurements consisting of trunk pitch (forwards-backwards) angular displacement and velocity and roll (side to side) angular displacement and velocity. Measurements will be taken during all tasks. The fibreoptic gyroscopes (SwayStar) will be attached via a belt to the subjects so that the sensors are at the level L2/3. The sensors will be attached to a computer via a Bluetooth communication, which will sample the velocity signals every 100 ms and numerically integrate the velocity signals to yield angular displacement. The mean will be taken from the maximum values of the two angular displacement measures and the two angular velocities for the cane and TheraTogs intervention groups. The Sway Star has been has been used to assess static and dynamic balance in healthy individuals of differing ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and for institutionalised older individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The means obtained for the intervention groups post treatment will therefore be compared to baseline values and to established normal values.</p></sec><sec><title>Accelerometer activity monitoring</title><p>The accelerometer (Aipermon<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>GmbH, Germany) will be attached to the patient's belt and positioned above the left hip. Patients will wear the device during waking hours during intervention time. The accelerometer will be attached after dressing in the morning and only taken off for showering, bathing and sleeping. In the statistical analysis a day starts at 24.00 o'clock and ends at 23.59 o'clock the same day. Mean activity per day will be calculated. All device settings (date, time, weight, age and gender) are pre-programmed for each patient upon receiving it and the device is switched on throughout the entire measurement period to keep patient handling of the accelerometer to a minimum. Upon completion of the intervention, the data is copied onto a PC, and its contents are viewed via ActiCoach MPAT2Viewer, Aipermon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Wearing-time include min/day spent passively (PAS: sitting), actively (ACT: movement, but not walking), walking (WLK: 0-5 km/h)) and fast walking (FWLK: &#x0003e; 5 km/h). These are computed and analyzed. Walking speeds from 0 to 80 m/min are detected as <italic>Walking </italic>and walking speeds from 83 to 115 m/min are detected as <italic>Fast Walking</italic>. Speeds above 115 m/min are considered <italic>Sportive </italic>at which point walking would turn into jogging in most individuals. Non-wearing time is indicated by the device as "resting mode". Walking and fast walking times are added to a total walking time (TWT). Activity modes and accelerometer detection accuracy have been extensively validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>All testing procedures will be carried out by dedicated trained, blinded assessors.

This calculation was performed assuming a SD of the timed up and go of 19 sec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Since there are indications that the distributions of the primary endpoint variable is skewed, the use of a nonparametric test should increase the actual power. To allow for drop-outs 60 participants per intervention will be recruited.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and allocation concealment</title><p>Subjects will be randomised into cane or TheraTogs group using a computer generated randomisation programme. Allocation will be concealed with group allocation contained in centrally held sealed envelopes at Maastricht University.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The primary analysis will be performed in an intention-to-treat fashion, i.e. all subjects who where randomised and have at least a Timed Up and Go assessment before start of therapy will be included in all analyses. In the primary analysis, missing values will be replaced by the last available value. If no value under or after treatment is available, the value measured before start of therapy will be used.</p><p>The primary analysis will be performed on the Timed Up and Go after 5 weeks of therapy. A nonparametric two sample Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test will be performed. Significance levels will be 5%. As robustness analyses, an analysis of covariance will be performed with the value before start of therapy as covariate and centre and therapy as factors. 95% CI's will be calculated based on this analysis. Descriptive statistics for all data will be presented. For continuous data, this will include the change from pre-therapy values. Pre-therapy values will be compared between groups to identify relevant co-variables.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion - implications of the hypothesis</title><p>Various forms of walking aids are commonly used in post stroke rehabilitation although the long term effects have been sparsely researched. In order to ensure the positive effect of these treatments and to enable evidence based practice, these interventions should be clinically researched.</p><p>Early walking is an important aim of stroke rehabilitation for many reasons including the psychological well-being of the patient, to prevent loss of cardiovascular fitness or the development of secondary musculoskeletal problems. This study questions whether canes are the optimal walking aid to enable early independent walking as their use inhibits rather than stimulates activity of the hemiplegic musculature and reduces the use of automatic balance responses contrary to the aims of rehabilitation. A possible alternative to cane use was recently tested by the authors in whom the immediate effects of TheraTogs were to significantly improve hip abductor muscle activity compared to cane walking or walking without walking aids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The rate of recovery of all impairments after stroke is greatest in the first few weeks and slows down after two to three months. Kwakkel et al. discussed an early window during which rehabilitation has the most long term impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The potential negative or positive effects of walking aids may therefore be particularly significant in this early stage. To our knowledge no studies have investigated this question before. The results of this study may have important clinical significance and could be used in the development of guidelines for gait rehabilitation following stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p><p>TheraTogs orthoses have been provided by the manufacturer for use in the research, however the manufacturer has no influence on the research process, the collection and analysis of data or the presentation of results.
