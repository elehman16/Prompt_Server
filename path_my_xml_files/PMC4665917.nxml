The purpose of the current study was to establish bioequivalence, safety and tolerability of single 300-IU subcutaneous (sc) doses of XM17 to that of the reference follitropin alfa (Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) in healthy young women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This open-label, Phase I, single-dose, single-center, two-way crossover study was conducted from February to May 2009. Thirty-six women aged 18&#x02013;39&#x000a0;years were included, with a study duration of ~27 days per participant. After endogenous FSH downregulation with goserelin (3.6&#x000a0;mg) on study Day 0, XM17 and Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> were administered on Days 11 and 19 in random sequence. Frequent serum samples were drawn for standard pharmacokinetics until 168&#x000a0;h postdosing. Laboratory values, adverse events (AEs) and local tolerability were assessed throughout the study period. Primary endpoints included C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-t</sub>.

Participants could continue into the treatment period only if downregulation of plasma FSH to &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;IU/L was confirmed 10&#x000a0;days after goserelin administration. Based on previous reports of an initial rise in FSH and luteinizing hormone levels after beginning downregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], participants took their own OCs for another 4&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days to ensure pregnancy prevention.

With a sample size per sequence group of 18 (total sample size of 36), the crossover design had 90 % power to reject both null hypotheses that the test to reference geometric mean ratio was either &#x0003c;0.8 or &#x0003e;1.25 (ie, the test and reference were not equivalent) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. PK variables were calculated using noncompartmental methods using WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software (Pharsight Version 5.21, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). Primary PK parameters were based on actual times and values (ie, not imputed if missing) derived after subtracting predose (baseline) endogenous FSH serum concentrations from values immediately predosing. If subtraction produced a value &#x0003c;0, that value was set to 0. Serum concentrations of XM17 and Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were labeled as (BLQ) in the serum study drug concentration data listings and set to 0 if recorded predose and to 1/2 LLOQ otherwise. &#x003bb;<sub>Z</sub> was calculated by linear regression methods using &#x02265;3 of the last data points above the LLOQ from log-concentration vs time plots. The &#x003bb;<sub>Z</sub> (and parameters derived from &#x003bb;<sub>Z</sub>) were considered sufficiently reliable only if the adjusted r<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.85 and were not used otherwise for pharmacometrics. The V<sub>z</sub>/F during the terminal phase was determined as CL/F &#x000f7; &#x003bb;<sub>Z</sub>.</p><p>For the majority of PK parameters (ie, AUCs, C<sub>max</sub>, t<sub>1/2</sub> and t<sub>max</sub>), descriptive summary statistics were presented by treatment, including n, arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), maximum, median, minimum and CV%. All values except t<sub>max</sub> were corrected for predose FSH concentrations. Statistical differences in PK parameters (except for t<sub>max</sub>) were evaluated using ANOVA mixed-effects procedure on log-transformed values and back-transformed for presentation. Ratios of PK parameters for XM17:Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> were derived from least squares geometric means (nonparametric Hodges-Lehman evaluation for t<sub>max</sub>). Differences between treatments were considered clinically irrelevant if the 90 % CI was fully contained within the interval between 0.8 and 1.25, the customary range for investigations of bioequivalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Safety and tolerability data were descriptive (coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] v12.0) but were not evaluated statistically. AEs occurring between Days 0 and 10 were considered TEAEs for goserelin. AEs occurring or worsening after administration of the study drugs on Days 11 or 19 were considered TEAEs for the study drug administered on that respective day. AEs that occurred during PK period 1 (Day 11-18) and that lasted until PK period 2 (Day 19-26), but that did not increase in severity, were counted only for the study drug administered on Day 11.

There were no serious events and no AEs leading to withdrawal after the start of treatment with either XM17 or Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Most TEAEs were judged by the investigator as being &#x0201c;unlikely&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;not related&#x0201d; (53 TEAEs) to XM17 or Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, while 32 TEAEs were considered possibly related (for XM17, 14 events in 9 [25.0 %] participants; for Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 18 events in 9 [25.0 %] participants).

However, newer biologics that mimic the innovator product have been slow to develop. The incentive to develop such agents has been hampered by the challenges of manufacturing and extracting from living cells an exact copy of the desired therapeutic protein. The EMA has issued guidance documents regarding the regulatory pathway that manufacturers must follow to gain marketing approval for biosimilars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These guidances address the expectations of the EMA about the documentation required to register a biosimilar. The process demands a rigorous demonstration of comparability, with the dossier expected to include information about the biologic&#x02019;s mechanism of action, route of administration, formulation, PK, potency, indications for use, data to support safety and efficacy, excipients, manufacturing facility, patent protection and any other aspect of the agent relevant to the safety of the drug class.</p><p>Follitropin alfa (Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) is the reference (innovator) product that has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of anovulation, for the stimulation of follicular development in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures, and in those with severe luteinizing hormone and FSH deficiency, as well as for spermatogenesis stimulation in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is one of the many complex biologic proteins produced by recombinant technology.</p><p>This Phase I study achieved its goal of demonstrating significant bioequivalence of single 300-IU sc doses of XM17 to the reference follitropin alfa (Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) with respect to the primary PK parameters C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-t</sub>. In addition, all secondary PK parameters were comparable to the reference product. There was no difference in t<sub>max</sub>, and the ratios of C<sub>max</sub> and AUCs were close to 1 and well contained within the predefined interval of 0.8&#x02013;1.25, which is the commonly accepted interval required to demonstrate equivalence of two biological products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For the facultative additional parameter t<sub>1/2</sub>, the ratio between the two treatments was 0.939, with a 90 % CI of 0.711 and 1.240. Mean concentration-time profiles after doses of XM17 and Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> were almost identical.</p><p>The systemic and local tolerability of XM17 was also similar to that of approved follitropin alfa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Headache was the most frequently reported AE for both XM17 and Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Except for mild pain on movement in one participant, XM17 was well tolerated locally. There were no safety concerns or treatment-related findings from the examination of vital signs, ECG, laboratory or physical examination parameters. No anti-FSH antibodies were detected in this single-dose study, however it should be noted that antidrug antibodies might be more likely to show up with repeated dosing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on the primary PK parameters measured, single 300-IU sc doses of XM17 (Ovaleap<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; follitropin alfa, Teva Pharmaceuticals Europe B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands) and Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> administered to healthy young women can be considered bioequivalent. The safety and tolerability profile of XM17 was comparable to that of Gonal-f<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.
