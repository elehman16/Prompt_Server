Institutional Ethical Clearance was obtained. The study was a prospective randomized double-blind study. As per power analysis - Based on outcome variable on BP for a two group study, with 90% statistical power, 5% level of significance, the sample of sixty was considered adequate (thirty in each group) to detect the difference of 20 mmHg with common standard deviation 15.</p><p>All patients posted for elective craniotomies belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 1 and 2, in the age group of 18&#x02013;70 years without any history of allergy to study drugs were included in the study.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Patients not willing to take part in the study, emergency craniotomies, Glasgow coma scale &#x0003c;7, patients with a difficult airway, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, renal disease, aneurysm, and arteriovenous malformation were excluded from the study. Preanesthetic evaluation was done on the previous day of surgery. Patients were explained about the study and written informed consent for participation in the study was obtained.</p><p>On the day of surgery, i.v. line was secured in preoperative holdup area. Patients were randomly allocated to the study group by computer-generated random numbers. Sixty patients were divided into two groups: Group-C and Group-L, with a sample size of thirty each. Group C (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received i.v. clonidine 2 &#x000b5;g/kg, as infusion[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Group L (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received i.v. lignocaine, 1.5 mg/kg as an infusion.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In the operation room, baseline readings of HR, noninvasive BP (NIBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and electrocardiogram and oxygen saturation were recorded. Study drugs were diluted to 10 ml with normal saline and administered in 10 ml syringes with syringe pump over 10 min. No interventions were made till study drugs were administered. After completion, drugs infusions were disconnected and were not used intra-operatively. All patients were administered injection fentanyl 2 &#x000b5;g/kg, induced with injection thiopentone 5 mg/kg, muscle relaxation achieved with injection vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Intubation was done when the train of four counts was 0 on neuromuscular monitor. Anesthesia was maintained with controlled ventilation with injection vecuronium, air-oxygen, and isoflurane on closed circuit. NIBP and MAPs were recorded every 3 min on Datex-Ohmeda monitor to avoid observer variation. Pin site infiltration and scalp block were avoided. Mayfield head holder was inserted in all cases. Monitor setting was changed to manual recording of NIBP and MAP at following instances - after drug administration (AD), after intubation (AI), 1 min prior to pin insertion-pre-pin (PP), and 5 min after pin insertion (AP). After recording the parameters of the study, intra-arterial line was placed, and the patient was positioned as per surgical procedure. Standard anesthesia protocol was followed in the management of cases. The increase of MAP &#x0003e;30 mmHg above baseline (BL) reading was considered as hypertension and a fall of MAP &#x0003c;20 mmHg was taken as hypotension.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Rescue drug for hypertension was injection propofol in doses of 0.5 mg/kg boluses till MAP reached BL levels. Hypotension was managed with injection metaraminol 3 mg boluses and fluid bolus of 200 ml till BL levels were achieved. Bradycardia was managed with injection atropine 0.6 mg bolus. Patients who had profound hypotension or severe hypertension in spite of rescue medications were eliminated from the study and aggressive management as per protocol was carried out. After the study period, the patient was observed continuously as per standard anesthesia protocols. Depending on the requirements of surgery, anesthesia depth was altered with higher doses of opioids, propofol infusion, or thiopentone. Blood was transfused if necessary. Intra- and post-operative management were as per institutional practice. Use of above-mentioned drugs and changes would alter our observation of hemodynamics.

Literature search revealed-lignocaine, a time-tested drug is commonly used for scalp block as infiltration; i.v. lignocaine is routinely used only as bolus dose 90 s prior to intubation. As there was a lack of studies using lignocaine as an infusion for attenuating pin insertion response and various studies, have compared scalp block versus i.v. clonidine, we chose to compare Lignocaine infusion with clonidine infusion. Our aim was to use drugs of different groups administered via the same route. Hence, two disparate drugs were selected.</p><p>Clonidine is a centrally acting antihypertensive drug with its selective alpha 2 receptor agonist action with selectivity of 220:1 for alpha 2: alpha 1 receptors.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The beneficial effects of clonidine are dose-dependent analgesia, sedation, anxiolysis and reduced requirement of anesthetics and muscle relaxants.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Clonidine is available as oral, transdermal and i.v. preparations. Use of clonidine as parenteral or i.v. preparation is effective in attenuating stress response due to its ability to reduce systolic BP more than diastolic BP, maintenance of glomerular filtration, blunt reflex tachycardia for intubation, reduce vasomotor liability, and to reduce plasma cortisol levels.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Several studies have used oral preparation of clonidine in doses ranging from 3 to 5 &#x000b5;g/kg, 1 h prior to pin insertion and found effective control of BP and HR.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In one study conducted by Cormack and Costello,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] oral Clonidine in dose of 3 &#x000b5;g/kg significantly reduced the MAP from the baseline MAP of 126 mmHg to 80 mmHg after intubation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and to 100 mmHg after pin insertion (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). A similar finding was noted in our study too with MAP remaining at 86 mmHg postintubation and 76 &#x000b1; 9 mmHg after pin insertion in Group C (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Similarly, HR was reduced from BL 70 beats/min(bpm) to 62 bpm and 68 bpm at prepin insertion and postpin insertion periods respectively. Our study recorded a steady fall in HR from 86 bpm to 76.8 and 76.03 bpm at prepin and after pin insertion periods. Ten percent fall in HR was noted in study by Cormack <italic>et al</italic>. and our study. Hence, clonidine at a dose of 2 &#x000b5;g/kg reduces the HR and BP response to pin insertion.</p><p>Chaudhry <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] used oral clonidine at 3 &#x000b5;g/kg 90 min before induction and recorded hemodynamics at various intervals throughout craniotomy procedure. The HR recorded in Clonidine group postintubation and postpositioning (pin insertion) was 83.18 and 73.82 respectively. In our study HR at postintubation and postpin insertion were 77 &#x000b1; 10.83 and 76 &#x000b1; 19.75 respectively. MAP recorded by Chaudhry <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] was 94.04 mmHg and 82 mmHg at postintubation and post positioning period; our study recorded 86.83 &#x000b1; 9.71 and 76.03 &#x000b1; 9.88 mmHg, respectively. Our study compares the control in HR and MAP similar to the findings of Chaudhry <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] though the slight difference in findings may be due to different route of administration.</p><p>In a study by Makwama <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] i.v. clonidine in dose of 2 &#x000b5;g/kg was used 10&#x02013;15 min prior to induction.

Our study recorded 20% lower MAP than findings of Makwama <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Though, the dose, route and timing of administration were comparable to our study, the fall in MAP was more than Makwama <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This difference may be due to the difference in induction and anesthesia protocol followed.</p><p>Lignocaine is an amide local anesthetic with membrane stabilizing action.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The decrease in HR and BP is due to its action on myocardium than on cerebral blood vessels. Hence, i.v. lignocaine is used for attenuating laryngoscopy and intubation response in neuro-anesthesia, lignocaine infiltration is routinely used for scalp block and incision site infiltration.</p><p>Literature search revealed lack of data on studies conducted with i.v. lignocaine infusion for attenuation of skull pin head holder insertion. Ours is the only study where i.v. 2% lignocaine was used as infusion for blunting hemodynamic response to pin insertion. However, there are umpteen numbers of studies supporting the use of i.v. bolus 2% lignocaine in the dose of 1.5 mg/kg for prevention of sympathetic response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Hence, we are justified in the safety and use of 2% lignocaine at dose of 1.5 mg/kg.</p><p>Chatterji <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] compared i.v. 2% lignocaine bolus at 2 mg/kg with oral clonidine at dose of 3 &#x000b5;g/kg for attenuation of hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation. i.v. lignocaine group recorded postintubation HR and MA<italic>P</italic> values of 99.14 &#x000b1; 17.68 and 89.24 &#x000b1; 10.14 respectively. Oral clonidine group recorded HR and MA<italic>P</italic> values of 77.97 &#x000b1; 16.26 and 82.03 &#x000b1; 2.59 respectively. Chatterji <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] concluded that oral clonidine was better than i.v. lignocaine in attenuating stress response to intubation. Our study too showed similar results with respect to HR and MAP at intubation and pin insertion periods. The use of i.v. lignocaine in our study prior to intubation proved beneficial in attenuating the laryngoscopy and intubation response in craniotomy cases. The effect also lasted till head holder insertion. However, the control over HR and BP was less effective than i.v. clonidine. This difference may be due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic properties of two drugs.</p><p>The study was restricted to postpin insertion period, though the study drugs have effect on the course of anesthesia throughout the procedure. The drugs lignocaine and clonidine continue to have the effect beyond the end point of the study. However, intraoperative use of mannitol, phenytoin, frusemide, and dexamethasone will alter the hemodynamics. Surgical blood loss, change in position will also add to continuous changes in the HR and BP. Several confounding factors were present throughout the craniotomy procedure which would alter hemodynamic and attributing the changes to drug used preoperatively would be difficult. In our study, neuroendocrine biomarkers, sedation scoring, requirement of anesthetic drugs, cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and intracranial pressures were not studied.
