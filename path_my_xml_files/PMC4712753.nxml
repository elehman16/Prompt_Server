Each site was scheduled to enroll approximately 25&#x02013;30 patients with a 10% over-enrollment to allow for dropouts to achieve a minimum of 100 participants who had successfully completed at least one self-injection. This number of participants is representative of a typical human factors evaluation for a device and was deemed necessary by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for US-labeling of the autoinjector pen.</p><p>Design of the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2050312114564241">Figure 1</xref>. Screening of patients took place at Day &#x02212;14 (14&#x02009;days prior to the start of the first study visit. Study Visit 1 (V1; Day 1) consisted of training on the use of the device followed by patient self-injection in the presence of a qualified healthcare professional. Afterwards, healthcare professionals completed a questionnaire of patient training (part 1 of the label comprehension assessment) and evaluated pen robustness. To achieve interrater reliability, the healthcare professionals of the different study sites were trained by the same individual on the use of the device. This assured a standardized level and quality of patient training at V1 between study sites. At Study Visit 2 (V2; Days 8&#x02013;10), patients completed a written examination in order to evaluate how well they comprehended training information they received at V1 (part 2 of the label comprehension assessment). V2 also consisted of human factors/usability testing in which patients were evaluated under direct observation of an independent monitor for evaluation of conduct while performing a self-injection. A subjective-measures questionnaire was used to record patient impressions, any difficulties, and general comments on the device. Pen robustness was again evaluated by an independent monitor. Pharmacokinetic assessments were also performed beginning at Day 8 and extended until Day 11.</p><fig id="fig1-2050312114564241" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Study design&#x02014;Label comprehension assessment (by healthcare professional): questionnaire for healthcare professionals regarding patient training and ability to self-inject using the device following training at V1.

All of the AEs were mild in severity and only one of the AEs (diarrhea) was deemed to be related to MTX treatment. There were no reports of burning while receiving the injection, and no patients experienced an AE as a result of the self-administration at V1. No ADEs, UADEs, deaths, SAEs, or AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were reported.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section28-2050312114564241"><title>Discussion</title><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the usability, label comprehension, robustness, bioavailability, and safety of SC self-administration of MTX using the MTX pen in patients with RA who required MTX treatment. This study was designed to assess user/MTX pen interaction issues that could pose a safety risk for patients. The vast majority of patients were able to successfully and comfortably use the MTX pen during their first attempt, and no AEs were associated with use of the pen. Overall, the subjective-measures questionnaire indicated that patients felt the MTX pen was easy to use and their overall impression was favorable. Other studies of autoinjector pens in patients with chronic disorders (including RA) requiring long-term injection treatments have also reported favorable patient opinions,<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="bibr25-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr26-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and that autoinjector pens were preferred by patients over syringes mostly because of their ease of use and convenience. In this study, some patients remarked that they felt the MTX pen was even more convenient than taking oral MTX.</p><p>Several patients in this study indicated that one of the things they liked best about the injection was that it was relatively pain free. This is not surprising, given that automatic needle insertion has been found to be significantly less painful than manual needle insertion.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In a study of patients with RA assessing preference and tolerability of adalimumab via a prefilled syringe or an autoinjector pen,<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> approximately 77% of patients reported that the pen was less painful to use than the syringe. Additionally, a study in healthy patients comparing SC self-injection using an autoinjector pen versus injections administered by a nurse using a syringe found that pain associated with the autoinjector pen was significantly lower than that from the syringe.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Berteau et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> also reported that all patients preferred self-administration using the autoinjector pen for the final study injection and for potential future treatment of a chronic disorder. Patients in this study also commented that they liked the ability to view the injection fluid in a window to confirm that they had indeed received the medication.</p><p>In this study, patient comprehension and retention of the usage training and IFU of the MTX pen were validated by the written examination administered at V2. The delay between training at V1 and examination at V2 allowed for a period of training decay. Despite this delay, 98.1% of patients passed their written examination at V2, indicating that almost all patients had learned how to properly use the MTX pen and retained the training information.</p><p>Data from the pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that the MTX pen reliably delivered drug across a wide range of body weights; however, we found that excessive body weight (over 100&#x02009;kg) significantly decreased both total and peak exposure of MTX when administered subcutaneously to the abdomen. Therefore, consideration should be given to using the SC MTX pen in the upper thigh rather than the abdomen for patients weighing over 100&#x02009;kg. For all other AUC and C<sub>max</sub> comparisons with the 60&#x02013;100&#x02009;kg weight group, statistical analyses were inconclusive.</p><p>Overall, data from the SP showed that the MTX pen was well tolerated, and no patients discontinued the study due to AEs, ADEs, UADEs, deaths, or SAEs. A study evaluating tolerability of beta-1&#x003b1; treatment in patients with multiple sclerosis has shown that autoinjectors are associated with a significantly reduced incidence of injection-site reactions (pain, bruising, and/or transient erythema; inflammation with or without induration; necrosis at injection site and necrosis necessitating plastic surgery) compared with manual injections.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> None of the few AEs reported in this study were attributed to local reactions at the injection site.</p><p>One of the benefits of SC MTX is that it demonstrates exceptional efficacy in treating RA<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and potentially decreases the need for patients to progress to costly biologic therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> SC administration of MTX offers more predictable drug bioavailability resulting in less AEs and better disease control. However, in patients weighing over 100&#x02009;kg, both total and peak MTX levels are decreased with abdominal MTX injection, and it should be recommended that these patients inject SC MTX in the upper thigh. Additionally, it has been speculated that optimized drug-delivery systems, such as autoinjector pens, may potentially increase patient adherence to treatment for chronic disorders, likely improving disease outcomes in those patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-2050312114564241" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Current options for SC MTX administration are hampered by requirements of a hand not limited by disability or disease, dedicated office staff, and a concern as to whether patients are actually getting the dose prescribed. Our data showed that the MTX pen used in this study was consistently and reliably used by a heterogeneous population of patients with moderate to severe RA with a high degree of effectiveness, patient satisfaction, and safety. The MTX pen was rated highly by newly diagnosed/MTX na&#x000ef;ve patients, patients switching from oral MTX, and current SC MTX users, potentially providing physicians with a new treatment option for patients with RA requiring SC MTX.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This trial is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> under identifier NCT01871961.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> J.A.
