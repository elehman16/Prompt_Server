Active smoking was defined as smoking one cigarette or more per day during the month preceding the hospital stay. Exclusion criteria were index revascularisation with coronary artery bypass graft, severe physical disability, inability to give consent (dementia), impossibility of returning for a follow-up clinical visit at 12&#x02005;months and &#x0003c;1&#x02005;year of life expectancy for non-cardiac reasons. Patients were followed at 12&#x02005;months for assessment of smoking cessation outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011520F1">figure 1</xref>). The observation phase was from August 2009 to October 2010 and the intervention phase from November 2010 to February 2012. The study includes two intervention sites (A and B) and two control sites (C and D). There are five major academic medical centres in Switzerland and four participated in the prospective cohort study of patients with ACS.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref> The two intervention sites were chosen based on the existence of a team providing smoking cessation interventions to hospitalised smokers before the start of the study on a reactive basis. There was no random allocation of study sites into control and intervention sites.

We made two comparisons for smoking cessation outcomes at 12&#x02005;months follow-up and process outcomes: a before&#x02013;after comparison between observation and intervention phases in intervention sites A and B; a parallel group comparison between intervention (A and B) and control (C and D) sites in both observation and intervention phases.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study protocol and interventions</title><p>During the observation phase at the intervention sites (study sites A and B), the standard practice in place was that patients received information about the possibility of a dedicated smoking cessation intervention and clinicians in charge of patients could request a specialised smoking cessation intervention for hospitalised smokers through a simple phone call and after patient's agreement.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We called this approach a &#x02018;reactive approach&#x02019; to delivering smoking cessation interventions. In the intervention phase, a resident physician trained in MI identified all smokers included in the clinical follow-up study and systematically approached them to get permission to discuss their smoking habit. We called this approach a &#x02018;systematic approach&#x02019; to delivering smoking cessation interventions. There was no restriction on the duration of the interview and residents ended the discussion once they felt an increase in the resistance of the patients, if they were interrupted by competing care to patients or if patients specifically asked the interview to end. Multiple MI sessions were allowed during the hospital stay and at the end of each session, the resident systematically offered the possibility of additional consultations during the hospital stay provided the logistics were possible. While the in-hospital counselling intervention was the same in the observation and in the intervention phase, residents also systematically suggested to patients to be contacted by a study nurse after their hospital stay for four ambulatory telephone contacts during the intervention phase, which was not done in the observation phase. Study nurses systematically contacted by phone each patient at 2&#x02005;days, 1&#x02005;week, 1&#x02005;month and 2&#x02005;months after discharge from the acute care hospital.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Whenever possible, the nurse tried to meet all counselled smokers for a brief face-to-face encounter before discharge. In addition to training in tobacco cessation counselling and prescription of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT),<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> residents were trained in MI during four sessions of 4&#x02005;hours each over 1&#x02005;month separated by 1&#x02005;week before the intervention phase. To allow residents to adapt the interview to the patient's needs, we did not develop a detailed manual for directing the MI.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> To minimise interference with the intervention, most data were collected during the inclusion of patients before the residents approached patients. If not already prescribed by the health care provider (HCP) in the ward, the resident offered NRT and brochures on smoking cessation. Residents provided the HCP in charge of the patient with a brief summary of the intervention and recommendations for NRT and sent a medical report to the patient's primary care provider. Study nurses followed the same training in MI as the residents. NRT, which is not reimbursed in Switzerland, was available free of charge during the hospital stay, but were at the patients&#x02019; charge in ambulatory care. In the control study sites (C and D), there was no dedicated smoking cessation intervention throughout the study duration and participants received minimal smoking cessation advice by hospital clinicians in charge of their care.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Covariates</title><p>Current smoking status, age of smoking initiation and daily cigarettes consumption were assessed for all patients throughout the study duration in all sites during the inclusion process in the clinical study. In the intervention sites during the intervention phase, patients were given a questionnaire to be filled during the hospital stay.</p><p>Administrative (length of stay, discharge home or direct transfer to a peripheral hospital or to cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR)), demographic (age, sex, race, education), medical (type of ACS (NSTEMI/UA and STEMI); previous coronary health disease (CHD)) data and processes of care were collected during the inclusion in the clinical follow-up study and completed after discharge. Attendance rate to CR and type of CR (ambulatory vs hospital) were assessed from administrative data available at discharge and from self-report during the ambulatory follow-up visit at 1&#x02005;year. In Switzerland, healthcare providers&#x02019; organise CR during the hospital stay or provide patients with information to benefit from CR. Thus patients could be directly addressed to an inpatient CR facility or attend ambulatory CR in the outpatient setting. Quality indicators were based on cardiological guidelines and included systematic collection of reason for non-prescription for preventive medication.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome for smoking cessation was 1&#x02005;week smoking abstinence (point prevalence) at 12&#x02005;months. At the time of inclusion, patients were informed that they would be asked about their smoking status during a visit at 12&#x02005;months. Self-reported smoking cessation was biochemically confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide levels (Micro Smokerlyzer; Bedfont Scientific) at the 1-year follow-up visit in all sites.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Patients who did not return at 12&#x02005;months were contacted either by phone or mail. We classified those with carbon monoxide levels of at least 10&#x02005;ppm as current smokers. Secondary process outcomes were: the number of patients who received smoking cessation counselling, NRT at discharge and follow-up as well as the duration and number of interventions during the hospitalisation and follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Frequencies, means with SDs and medians with IQRs were used when appropriate, as were &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests, Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for bivariate analyses. The primary analysis examined the point estimate and 95% CI of the risk ratio (RR) for smoking cessation at 12&#x02005;months between both phases in the intervention sites and using an intention-to-treat approach. The sample size calculation was based on an expected 10% absolute increase in smoking abstinence at 12&#x02005;months in the two intervention centres. The 10% difference was based on a summary estimate of 11 previous RCTs identified in a systematic review and meta-analysis which included smokers hospitalised with CHD and tested the effect of a high-intensity intervention with phone follow-up.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;36</xref> The summary quit rate over all these studies in the intervention groups was 45% and 31% in the control groups, thus an absolute risk difference (ARD) of 14%. Using an &#x003b1;-level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, and given the potential increase in abstinence due to the intervention in some smokers in the observation phase, we estimated that 400 patients had to be included in the intervention sites (A and B) over the entire study period to detect a 10% absolute difference in quit rates. Secondary analyses were a comparison of the smoking cessation rates at 12&#x02005;months between both phases in the control study sites (C and D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011520F2">figure 2</xref>). The study was not powered to detect a significant difference between intervention and control sites over the observation and intervention phases. We also conducted stratified analyses by attendance to CR and education status (with or without university degree). We further tested the association between the presence and duration of counselling between phases using logistic regression models and Poisson logistic regression models. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. All analyses were performed using STATA V.12 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016011520F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Flow chart of participants included in the intervention sites (A and B) and control sites (C and D) during observation phase (August 2009&#x02013;October 2010) and intervention phase (November 2010&#x02013;February 2012).

The median duration of counselling during the hospital stay was 50&#x02005;min and did not vary between phases. Comparing observation with intervention phases, the smoking abstinence at 1&#x02005;year increased from 43% to 51% (8% absolute difference in abstinence, p=0.08). At sites without dedicated in-hospital smoking cessation intervention during the entire study period, no difference in smoking abstinence was observed. In subgroup analyses, the benefit of the systematic intervention appeared limited to smokers not attending CR and those with lower education level.</p><p>Murray <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> recently tested the effectiveness of systematically providing support to all identified smokers in a RCT randomising medical wards in one medical centre in the UK. The systematic identification permitted to increase the offer of behavioural support from 46% to 100% of smokers and the acceptance of behavioural support from 29% to 70% of smokers. However, of the 1072 smokers identified in ward, 30% declined consent to participate in the study and an additional 30% of those offered behavioural support refused it. In our study, detailed analysis of the flow of participants until inclusion in the clinical study showed that 4% refused to enter the clinical follow-up study, followed by 2% who completely refused to open the discussion with the resident approaching them to start a motivational interview. The benefits of counselling all smokers regardless of their motivation to quit using MI had also previously been tested in a rigorously performed RCT in 1996&#x02013;1997.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Of the 164 smokers with acute myocardial infarction, 8 (5%) refused to participate in the smoking cessation intervention including follow-up at 6&#x02005;months. The smoking cessation rate at 1&#x02005;year was 34% in the observation group and 55% in the intervention group (p&#x0003c;0.005). However, the study was performed in a single study site and the rate attending CR was not provided and is expectedly lower than the rate in our population, thus limiting the comparison.</p><p>The sharp increase in uptake of the smoking cessation intervention highlights the effect of changes in the choice architecture described in behavioural economic theories. Setting the default option from an <italic>opt-in</italic> to an <italic>opt-out</italic> has been shown to be a powerful driver of uptake in interventions.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In the context of our study, the systematic offer of a smoking cessation intervention is similar to an <italic>opt-out</italic> policy where patients ask not to have the intervention compared to the <italic>opt-in</italic> policy where patients or their caregivers specifically have to request a smoking cessation intervention.</p><p>In our study, the rate discharged to CR in the intervention sites increased from 58% to 73% between the observation and intervention phases. Given that CR includes smoking cessation counselling and support, it could be considered a follow-up intervention as recommended by guidelines and might be explained by a higher attendance rate to CR.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, in stratified analyses by attendance to CR, the benefit of the systematic smoking cessation intervention was mostly apparent among participants not attending CR. The systematic approach might permit to counsel those most at risk of lack of follow-up in the ambulatory care. The high attendance rate to CR overall in our study might explain the negative findings on smoking cessation rates over follow-up<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39&#x02013;42</xref> Overall, attendance rates in the USA range from 14% to up to 55%.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39&#x02013;42</xref> We based our sample size estimation on previous studies on smoking cessation after ACS where attendance rates to CR were expectedly lower. Unfortunately, we are unable to compare the attendance rates in our study to previous smoking cessation studies because previous studies included in the Cochrane systematic review and to the recent study by Murray <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> have not reported on rates of ambulatory CR.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;36</xref> Future studies should also better describe the concomitant interventions in the ambulatory care in order to facilitate the interpretation and translation of findings into clinical practice.</p><p>Our findings challenge the recommendation of allocating high intensity counselling only to those &#x02018;willing to make a quit attempt&#x02019; recommended in smoking cessation guidelines based on the 5A's framework.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> According to MI, motivation occurs in the interpersonal context, which depends on the style used by counsellors with smokers and may influence the acceptance rates of the intervention.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A previous rigorously performed RCT including only those willing to make a serious quit attempt was unable to show a benefit on smoking cessation.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>We found that the systematic smoking cessation intervention led to an increase in NRT prescriptions at discharge comparing the observation and intervention phase at the intervention study sites. However, the high cost of NRT after discharge, given that NRTs are not covered by healthcare insurance companies in the ambulatory setting in Switzerland, might explain the lower rate of participants still taking NRT at the phone follow-up. Future studies should test the effect of removing potential financial barriers for using NRT after the hospital stay on smoking cessation outcomes.</p><p>Our study has certain limitations. The weaker before&#x02013;after design with parallel group comparisons does limit the causal inferences from our results. Participants received phone counselling after their hospital stay in the intervention phase, but not in the observation phase. A systematic review on the benefits of smoking cessation intervention for hospitalised smokers suggested that only interventions including a follow-up intervention in the ambulatory setting have shown an effect on smoking cessation outcomes at 12&#x02005;months. This strongly limits the comparison of smoking cessation rates between the observation and intervention phase as the smoking cessation increase could be due to either phone follow-up or a proactive versus reactive approach of offering smoking cessation intervention. We urge for careful interpretation of the results given differences in covariates between participants included in the observation phase and intervention phase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011520TB1">table 1</xref>). In the participants included in the intervention sites, we found a significant increase in length of stay in addition to the previously discussed increase in attendance rates to CR between the observation and intervention phase. Smoking cessation rates at 12&#x02005;months were based on self-report. We validated the 1 week smoking abstinence by measuring the exhaled carbon monoxide whenever possible.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, misclassification of the smoking cessation outcome is still possible. Rates of referral to CR were based on information at discharge and self-report at 1&#x02005;year follow-up. The reliability of self-reported CR referral has been validated in patients after an ACS in Canada and used recently to report on enrolment rate to CR in the USA.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Exploratory subgroup analyses on the differential effect of education level and attendance to CR should be carefully interpreted, as these analyses were defined a posteriori<italic>.</italic> Patients were included in four high-quality academic hospitals and results may not apply to different settings. The MI sessions were not recorded and the quality of interactions can therefore not be directly assessed. We did not develop a detailed manual for directing the MI. A prior meta-analysis suggested that clinical trials in which MI was delivered without a manual had showed better treatment outcomes.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we found that a systematic smoking cessation intervention using MI for smokers hospitalised for an ACS compared to a reactive strategy relying on busy healthcare providers to contact a specialised smoking cessation consultation permitted to sharply increase the number of patients counselled. In exploratory subgroup analyses of data collected in one study centre, patients with lower education level and not attending CR appeared to be more likely to benefit from the intervention. Comparison of smoking cessation rates at 12&#x02005;months between the observation and intervention phases are limited by the study design and showed a trend towards an increase in smoking cessation rates. Future studies should evaluate the benefit of systematically exposing smokers to a smoking cessation intervention based on MI.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Reto Auer at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/retoauer">@retoauer</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> RA, BG, RT, CMM, TFL, SW, FM, JC, J-PH, NR were involved in conception or design of the work or the acquisition.
