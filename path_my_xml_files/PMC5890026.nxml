Pregnancy is a condition of modulated immune suppression; therefore, this group of patients has increased risk of infectious diseases [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The low vaccination rates of pregnant women officially recommended in the Russian Federation since 2009 necessitate further investigation of the efficacy of influenza vaccine prophylaxis in this patient population. There have been several studies that have demonstrated the safety of vaccination during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and even during the first trimester, in the presence of risks without any attributable adverse fetal, perinatal or infant outcomes [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], particularly in women with a complicated premorbid background (especially asthma and diabetes) [<xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A combination of cardiac, respiratory, hormonal and immunological changes accompany pregnancy, which impair responses to infection and increase the likelihood of serious complications requiring hospitalisation [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, several large-scale studies have reported an inverse relationship between maternal vaccination and stillbirth (risk ratios 0.56, 0.66, 0.59&#x02013;0.74, 0.77 and 0.79) [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], although only some of these inverse relationships reached statistical significance. The mechanisms that increase the risk of serious complications from influenza during pregnancy are incompletely understood.</p><p>Whereas the safety of vaccination has been evaluated in almost all studies, its immunogenicity is assessed significantly less frequently, but studies that have directly compared adjuvant and non-adjuvanted vaccines are insufficient [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, it is known that immunological responses generated by influenza immunisation are comparable in pregnant and non-pregnant women and can provide protection to the fetus and infant by transferring specific antibodies across the placenta [<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and in breast milk [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Data are insufficient with regard to the scale of antibody production in pregnant women following administration of adjuvant-containing subunit vaccines. This is particularly important, because one of these polymeric-subunit vaccines takes priority in the Russian Federation, being one of the first adjuvant vaccines worldwide to be recommended for pregnant women [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The goal of this study was to perform a comparative immunogenicity analysis of different subunit influenza vaccines in pregnant women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and population</title><p>This study was a prospective, randomised, open-label, comparative, parallel-group trial in pregnant women conducted in accordance with the approved Protocol of the Russian Federation National Standard, SISS R 52379-2005 &#x0201c;Good Clinical Practice&#x0201d;, and the international Good Clinical Practice guidelines [<xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Nevertheless, pregnant women administered non-adjuvanted vaccine had lower anti-&#x00410;(H3N2) seroprotection levels at 1&#x02005;month, 3&#x02005;months and 8&#x02013;9&#x02005;months, as compared with the group receiving the adjuvanted vaccine.</p><p>Increased geometric mean titres of antibodies to all influenza virus strains were observed in the post-immunisation period in pregnant subjects. Pregnant women immunised with non-adjuvanted vaccine had lower geometric mean titres for antibodies to the &#x00410;(H3N2) strain at 1&#x02005;month, 3&#x02005;months and 5&#x02013;6&#x02005;months post immunisation than those in subjects immunised with adjuvanted vaccine; however, the geometric mean titres for antibodies to the influenza B strain registered at the same time-points (1&#x02005;month, 3&#x02005;months and 5&#x02013;6&#x02005;months) were higher (<xref rid="TB5" ref-type="table">table 5</xref>).</p><p>The seroconversion level for the analysed influenza virus strains at 1&#x02005;month after immunisation was higher than 40% in both study groups (which meets the CPMP criteria), although the group I level of anti-&#x00410;(H3N2) seroconversion was lower (51.3%) than that in group II (71.4%) (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Among immunised pregnant women, the seroconversion factor also exceeded, more than 2.5-fold, the efficacy level recommended for vaccines, with the highest value (9.2) obtained for the &#x00410;(H3N2) strain in group II (<italic>versus</italic> 4.7 in group I; p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>The proportion of subjects seronegative to the evaluated influenza strains, &#x00410;(H1N1), A(H3N2) and &#x00412;(Brisbane), did not exceed 21.6% for group I and 17.5% for group II during the first month post immunisation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Assessment of the clinical picture of pregnant women subject to vaccination, as well as placebo groups, showed the presence of concomitant somatic pathology, which does not differ from the indices of other authors [<xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These indicators in the post-vaccination period were not taken into consideration. Similar premorbid backgrounds were observed in the two study groups, which permitted a comparative qualitative analysis of the clinical tolerability and immunological efficacy of the influenza immunisation. There was the same high proportion of women with underlying comorbidities in both groups, but these women were not registered in any clinics as patients with chronic diseases. There were no outbreaks of these diseases during the pregnancy. If we assume that these comorbidities could influence the efficacy of vaccination, the data would be affected in both groups.</p><p>The introduction of subunit vaccines to pregnant women, regardless of the production technology, was accompanied in the first week by the development of local reactions more often than in the placebo group. At the same time, the frequency, severity and duration of these reactions did not differ between the compared vaccinated groups. However, it is important to note that these reactions were rare when the placebo phosphate-buffered saline solution was administered. The frequency of development of systemic reactions did not differ between groups of pregnant women vaccinated with unadjusted and adjuvant preparations against influenza, and these systemic reactions were often subjective in nature and their interrelation with immunisation is unlikely. In favour of this argument is their similar development after the injection that did not contain vaccine strains (placebo group) [<xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Registration of cough or sore throat, regardless of the administration of vaccine preparations and water-salt solution, cannot be considered as a negative effect of vaccinations but rather as a coincidence of circumstances with the simultaneous appearance of respiratory infections of the upper respiratory tract.</p><p>The emergence of systemic reactions in the late post-vaccination period can be regarded as background symptoms accompanying the course of pregnancy. In addition, they differ little from those that occurred in the early period after immunisation. Cough or sore throat signified the appearance of respiratory infections, which proceeded in mild form; the treatment consisted mainly of local application of decongestants or irrigation of the oral cavity with antiseptic solutions, without development of complications. The described symptoms and complaints made by pregnant women were not regarded as side-effects of vaccination and did not affect the subsequent course of pregnancy.</p><p>Despite the fact that the teratogenic effect on the development of the fetus of subunit vaccines against influenza, including those containing adjuvants, has been previously studied, it was of interest to estimate the outcome of pregnancy after vaccines in the second and third trimesters. It should be noted that the physiological births in the groups administered with both vaccines met with the same frequency, not differing from the placebo group, and coincided with the frequency of this indicator recorded in the Ulyanovsk region where this study was conducted. This outcome was due to obstetric pathology, which had no link with previous vaccination. Note that the congenital anomalies and malformations among vaccinated and unvaccinated (placebo) pregnant women were the same. The frequency of anomalies and malformations among the observed groups did not differ from the mean values for the Ulyanovsk region (3.8&#x02013;5.9%).</p><p>The baseline concentrations of antibodies to the evaluated influenza &#x00410; and &#x00412; virus strains demonstrated that some of the subjects had conditionally protective titres defining the seropositive state, as evidence of a previous infection, although it was not approved by documentation and collected anamnesis of patients. The obtained results demonstrate a prolonged circulation of this virus resulting in annual epidemic outbreaks [<xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Since in each group there was almost the same number of pregnant women with initially protective antibodies to strains of the influenza A and B viruses, and also due to their small number, it was considered inappropriate to separate them into separate subgroups.</p><p>Despite the differences in the concentrations of initially protective levels of antibodies to influenza A(H1N1) and B virus strains in the observed groups, after immunisation the growth of specific antibodies to all vaccine strains, regardless of the drug administered, was noted. It should be emphasised that pregnant women who received an adjuvant vaccine had antibody levels to the A(H3N2) influenza virus that were 22.7%, 24.3% and 20.1% higher at 1, 3 and 8&#x02013;9&#x02005;months, respectively, than subjects immunised with a non-adjuvanted vaccine. The levels of antibodies to the strain of influenza B virus were registered higher by 16.3% at 5&#x02013;6&#x02005;months after vaccination of pregnant women with an unadjusted vaccine, but after 8&#x02013;9&#x02005;months these differences were levelled. Nevertheless, by analysing the levels of protection against influenza in vaccinated pregnant women with one of the two vaccines, a fairly strong seroprotection can be observed within 8&#x02013;9&#x02005;months after immunisation.</p><p>The study of the average geometric antibody titres in the observation dynamics showed differences in the values of the A(H3N2) influenza virus among pregnant women vaccinated with an immunoadjuvant preparation, in which they were higher in comparison with the pregnant women receiving the unadjusted vaccine. Conversely, the average geometric titres of antibodies to the influenza B virus strain were higher at all observation times in subjects vaccinated with a conventional subunit vaccine. It is important to note that these differences disappear 8&#x02013;9&#x02005;months after immunisation, regardless of the vaccine used. It is interesting that there were no differences between the groups according to the average geometric titres of antibodies to the strain of the A(H1N1) virus.</p><p>Despite the fact that the levels of seroprotection, determined at 1&#x02005;month and 8&#x02013;9&#x02005;months after immunisation, did not differ statistically, except for the A(H1N1) strain in group I, the average geometric amount of antibodies received in 8&#x02013;9&#x02005;months was lower, regardless of the vaccine used, except for the A(H3N2) virus strain in group I and A(H1N1) in group II, which corresponded to the antibody level after 1&#x02005;month after vaccination.</p><p>The level and seroconversion factor reflecting the increase in antibody titres after immunisation against influenza were high during the first month after vaccination in both study groups, although there were some differences (a relatively lower increase in antibody titre after the first month after immunisation against influenza A(H3N2) in group I).</p><p>Thus, the administration of subunit influenza vaccines to women in the second and third trimester of pregnancy does not lead to the development of unusual phenomena that cause a complicated course of pregnancy. In the post-vaccination period, a symptomatic complex of systemic reactions was most often associated with the psychoemotional state of pregnant women, due to the fear of the possible development of an adverse effect of vaccination. After vaccination, antibodies to all strains of the influenza virus were observed at a conventionally protective level with an increase to 64.8&#x02013;94.5% after immunisation with the subunit vaccine and to 72.5&#x02013;90.0% after the administration of the immunoadjuvant vaccine. Although the number of cases of seropositive pregnant women declined in the post-immunisation period, we demonstrated that the majority of subjects immunised against influenza were still protected from three strains of the influenza virus 8&#x02013;9&#x02005;months after vaccination (the proportions changed to 51.3&#x02013;72.9% in group I and to 54.2&#x02013;74.2% in group II). Another interesting result was that during the epidemic season, there were no cases of influenza among the immunised.</p><p>In conclusion, the most advanced trivalent subunit anti-influenza vaccines, Agrippal S1 and Grippol Plus, are an effective means of specifically preventing influenza for pregnant women, in full compliance with the requirements of the CPMP. The immunogenicity of subunit influenza vaccines in pregnant subjects is confirmed by the fact that 1&#x02005;month after vaccination, a high level of seroprotection, seroconversion and high intensity of influenza immunity are provided. After the introduction of an immunoadjuvant vaccine with a reduced amount of antigens (5&#x02005;&#x003bc;g of each of the influenza virus strains), the criteria for CPMP were fully met for all strains of the influenza virus included in the vaccine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the study participants and staff members of the different study sites for their contribution to the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p>Author contributions: M.P.
