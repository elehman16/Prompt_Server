Acute exacerbation of emphysema leads to increased morbidity, mortality and, in some cases, requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). So far, no study has compared the impact of pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) and pressure-support ventilation (PSV) on lung mechanics and histology as well as cardiac function in experimental emphysema.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>Our aims were<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>to develop an elastase-induced emphysema model in rats that results in lung mechanical and histological impairment and <italic>cor pulmonale</italic>; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>to compare the effects of PCV and PSV on lung and heart.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-six Wistar rats were randomly divided into 2 groups. In ELA group, rats received porcine pancreatic elastase (2 IU) intratracheally, once a week, during 4 weeks, whereas SAL group was treated with saline. Lung mechanics and histology, as well as echocardiography were analyzed at 4, 6, 8, and 11 weeks. Additional thirty-two animals were treated with saline (n=16) and elastase (n=16) using the same protocol previously described and randomized according to ventilator strategy: pressure-controlled ventilation (SAL-PCV and ELA-PCV, n=8/each) and pressure-support ventilation (SAL-PSV and ELA-PSV, n=8/each). Tidal volume was kept constant (&#x000bb; 6-8 ml/kg) Lung mechanics and echocardiography were performed at the beginning (Initial) and 4 hours MV (Final), after which lungs were removed for morphometric analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Results</title><p>Compared to SAL group, ELA animals showed increased specific elastance, functional residual capacity, mean alveolar diameter, and right ventricle area at 6 (61%, 37%, 64%, and 8%, respectively) and 8 weeks (37%, 37%, 40%, and 16%, respectively). At 11 weeks, no significant changes were observed in lung mechanics but Lm (53%) and right ventricle area (20%) remained elevated. Based on these data we opted to compare the mechanical ventilation strategies at 8 weeks. Mean airway pressure (Pmean,<sub>aw</sub>) was lower in ELA-PSV compared to ELA-PCV at the Final (p&#x0003c; 0.01). Transpulmonary peak pressure (Ppeak,L) was more reduced in ELA-PSV in Final compared to Initial (p&#x0003c; 0.05). PCV resulted in greater areas of alveolar hyperinflation compared to PSV (p&#x0003c; 0.05). The ratio between the pulmonary artery acceleration time and the pulmonary artery ejection time (PAT/PET) increased in ELA-PSV (16%) along time, but not in ELA-PCV, suggesting reduction in pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the current elastase-induced emphysema, we found that: 1) 8 weeks was the time associated to lung mechanical and histological changes and cardiac impairment that resemble human emphysema; and 2) PSV attenuated lung mechanics, hyperinflation, and cardiovascular dysfunction compared to PCV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Supported by</title><p>CNPq, FAPERJ, CAPES, PRONEX, INCT-INOFAR</p></sec></body></article>
