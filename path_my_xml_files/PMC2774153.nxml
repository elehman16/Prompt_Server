Women with contraindications for mesh usage, such as prior pelvic radiotherapy, pelvic sepsis, planned future pregnancy or immunocompromised were ineligible for the study. Institutional research and ethics committee approval for this study was obtained. All eligible women who agreed to participate in this study and provided written informed consent were enrolled between February 2003 and August 2005.</p><p>A sample size of 128 women (64 in each group) was required to achieve a significance level of 0.05 with a power of 0.8. This was based on the assumptions of 71% cure for traditional colporrhaphy and 93% for vaginal repair with mesh augmentation and a 15% loss to follow-up rate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> Randomisation was computer generated and assignment was revealed prior to surgery. Subjects and surgeons were not blinded to the intervention.</p><p>Patients were assessed clinically and the prolapse staged using the POP-Q quantification system. Multichannel urodynamics was performed on subjects with urinary incontinence prior to surgery. All subjects completed validated questionnaires prior to surgery and at 6 and 12 months following surgery. The questionnaires were the Prolapse Symptom Inventory and Quality of Life questionnaire (PSI-QOL), Short-form Urogenital Distress inventory (SUDI), Short-form Incontinence Impact questionnaire (SIIQ) and Cleveland Clinic Continence score (CCCS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> The subjects also completed a visual analogue scale (VAS; 0-100 where 100 represented being completely satisfied and 0 completely dissatisfied) of their satisfaction with surgery at 6 and 12 months following surgery.</p><p>The primary outcome was objective success of surgery as defined by the absence of POP-Q stage 2 or more prolapse (i.e. no prolapse at or below a point 1 cm above the hymen at any vaginal site) 12 months following surgery. Secondary outcomes were symptoms, quality-of-life outcomes and patient satisfaction with surgery at 6 and 12 months. Complications of surgery were also reported.</p><p>If a tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) or trans-obturator tape was required, this was undertaken at the start of surgery. A vaginal hysterectomy was then performed for women requiring this procedure. The vagina repair procedure was then performed. A perineal repair was performed as required.</p><p>Patients randomised to the no mesh group underwent standard anterior and posterior colporrhaphy. Plication of the pre-vesical and pre-rectal tissue with 2/0 polydioxanone sutures was performed. Excess vaginal epithelium was excised as required and closed with a continuous locking suture.</p><p>When mesh was used in the anterior vaginal repair, a full thickness midline epithelial incision was made. The vaginal epithelium was mobilised off the underlying pre-vesical tissue. Dissection continued towards each arcus tendineus fascae pelvis (ATFP). The inner aspect of the pubic bone was palpated at the level of the mid-vagina and lateral dissection was then continued through the ATFP with fine scissors using a &#x02018;push-spread&#x02019; technique for approximately 3 cm. Only the central area of the pre-vesical fascia was repaired with 2/0 Monocryl (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA). This avoided narrowing the pre-vesical space. The mesh (Gynemesh PS; Ethicon) was soaked in an antibiotic solution prior to placement and liberal wound irrigation with saline was performed during surgery. A cross-shaped piece of mesh was cut and placed over the pre-vesical tissue with the extension arms placed into each paravaginal space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). The mesh extension arms abutted the inner aspect of the pubic bone on each side. Excess vaginal epithelium was trimmed as required and closed with a nonlocking continuous everting mattress suture.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A cross-shaped mesh was used for the anterior vaginal repair.

The vaginal epithelium was dissected off the underlying pre-rectal tissue. Dissection continued laterally on each side to the levator ani muscles. At the apex, dissection continued through the rectal pillars to each ischial spine and sacrospinous ligament. Only the central area of the pre-vesical fascia was repaired with 2/0 Monocryl. This prevented narrowing the pre-rectal space. A &#x02018;Y&#x02019;-shaped piece of mesh was cut and placed over the pre-rectal tissue with the extension arms placed in the tunnels created by the dissection onto the sacrospinous ligaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). The mesh extension arms abutted each sacrospinous ligament. Mesh was not placed in the lower third of the posterior vaginal wall.

During the examination, the examiner attempted to remain blinded to the surgical intervention received by each subject. Patient satisfaction using a visual analogue score (VAS) and validated symptom and quality-of-life questionnaires (Prolapse Symptom Inventory &#x00026; QOL [PSI-QOL]) were administered at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.</p><p>Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used for discrete outcomes.

Departure from study protocol occurred in seven women with uterine prolapse who underwent laparoscopic suture sacral hysteropexy (two in the mesh and five in the no mesh group), two women who underwent a single compartment posterior repair (one in the mesh and one in the no mesh group) and one subject treated without mesh with a stage 4 uterine prolapse. In an attempt to replace these subjects, a further 11 women were recruited into the study in addition to the 128 planned recruits. All 139 women remained in the final analysis based on an intention-to-treat analysis. Therefore, for purposes of analysis, there were 69 women in the mesh group and 70 women in the no mesh group.

Three mesh exposures were anterior and one was both anterior and posterior. Only one patient who developed a mesh exposure had a concomitant vaginal hysterectomy. Three of the mesh exposures presented at the 6-week postoperative review and one presented at 12 months. Three mesh exposures were treated surgically by simple excision of the exposed mesh and one case was managed conservatively. There was one tape exposure from a TVT procedure in the no mesh group.</p><p>Women were questioned regarding sexual activity and dyspareunia preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months. Eleven of 34 (32.4%) sexually active women in the mesh group and 20 of 36 (55.6%) in the no mesh group described preoperative dyspareunia. This difference was not significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.07). At the 6-month review, six of 25 (24.0%) in the mesh group and 11 of 27 (40.7%) in the no mesh group reported dyspareunia (<italic>P</italic>=0.25). At 12 months, 12 of 30 (40.0%) in the mesh group and 13 of 33 (39.4%) in the no mesh group reported dyspareunia (<italic>P</italic>=1). De novo dyspareunia was reported by five of 18 (27.8%) sexually active women without preoperative dyspareunia in the mesh group and five of 12 (41.7%) in the no mesh group at 12 months (<italic>P</italic>=0.46). Dyspareunia following surgery was considered to be because of vaginal stenosis in three women in the mesh group and five women in the no mesh group. Two women underwent vaginoplasty for vaginal stenosis and both were from the no mesh group.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results failed to demonstrate that vaginal repair surgery augmented by mesh was significantly more successful in terms of reduced recurrent prolapse than traditional colporrhaphy 12 months following surgery. This finding was based on analysis of only those women who returned for the 12-month review. Alternative assumptions about missing data suggested a significantly higher success rate for the primary outcome measure for the mesh group when subjects not returning for review were assumed to be treatment failures.</p><p>While designing the study, we chose a relatively homogenous group of women requiring both anterior and posterior vaginal repair surgery with limited apical prolapse. This avoided the need for within group analysis and the problem of how to deal with women developing prolapse in the nonrepaired compartment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> Departures from the study protocol were included in the final analysis on an intention-to-treat basis. However, the requirement for additional surgery for stress urinary incontinence and vaginal vault prolapse adds heterogeneity to the study population, and this together with protocol departures and missing data, undoubtedly effects the power of our study. Our failure to detect a difference between these procedures does not mean that such a difference could not exist.</p><p>Combined anterior and posterior colporrhaphy was chosen as the comparator as this is the most common procedure performed for prolapse in the USA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> This operation was performed on 35.2% of 199 698 women undergoing prolapse surgery in the USA in 2003 compared to 17.0% of women undergoing anterior and 16.4% undergoing posterior colporrhaphy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> Four randomised controlled studies have compared traditional colporrhaphy with vaginal repair with synthetic or biological graft augmentation with conflicting results. A recent study demonstrated that anterior colporrhaphy reinforced with mesh significantly reduced recurrent cystocele from 38.5 to 6.7% when compared with traditional anterior colporrhaphy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> Another study reported that vaginal repair augmented by polyglactin 910 absorbable mesh significantly reduced recurrent cystocele from 43% in the no mesh group to 25% in the mesh group, but there was no difference in the rate of recurrent rectocele between the two groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> A further study demonstrated no significant difference in cystocele recurrence rates when three anterior repair techniques were compared, including one group with polyglactin 910 mesh reinforcement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> Another study reported anterior colporrhaphy augmented by solvent dehydrated fascia lata did not reduce recurrent cystocele compared with traditional colporrhaphy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> Two further studies have compared abdominal sacral colpopexy with transvaginal sacrospinous colpopexy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> Both studies reported a trend towards the abdominal sacral colpopexy being associated with less recurrent prolapse and dyspareunia than sacrospinous colpopexy. Both studies have been widely interpreted as comparisons between abdominal and vaginal surgery for prolapse. However, in both studies, the subjects were randomised to prolapse surgery with mesh (abdominal sacral colpopexy) and without mesh (sacrospinous colpopexy) with less recurrent prolapse and dyspareunia reported in the mesh group.</p><p>The impact of surgery on sexual function is difficult to quantify. On direct questioning, the rates of dyspareunia were high in both groups preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months following surgery. These rates seemed to fluctuate with time. The high prevalence of dyspareunia is consistent with other studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> There was an improvement in sexual function according to the PSI-QOL questionnaire in both groups following surgery. Interestingly, some women who reported no sexual activity to the medical staff reported sexual dysfunction because of pelvic symptoms in the self-administered PSI-QOL questionnaire. This may reflect a reluctance to discuss these issues with the medical staff. We observed that de novo dyspareunia at 12 months following surgery was higher in the no mesh group compared with the mesh group. This may be explained by the different surgical techniques between traditional colporrhaphy and mesh-augmented repair. With colporrhaphy, the more lateral plication of the pre-vesical and pre-rectal tissues may result in reduced vaginal capacity compared with the mesh repair with plication of only the central pre-vesical and pre-rectal tissues.</p><p>The prevalence of vaginal mesh exposure (5.6%) in the mesh group is similar to rates reported for abdominal sacral colpopexy. A comprehensive review of abdominal sacral colpopexy by Nygaard <italic>et al.</italic> identified a 3.4% prevalence of mesh erosion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> A more recent study of 313 women treated by abdominal sacral colpopexy reported a mesh erosion rate of 5.4%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study showed no significant reduction in recurrent prolapse 12 months following anterior and posterior vaginal repair with mesh augmentation compared with standard anterior and posterior colporrhaphy. Given our sample size and the number of patients failing to attend follow up, conclusions regarding the primary outcome were sensitive to assumptions made regarding those lost to follow up. A larger study is required to more conclusively assess the effectiveness and safety of mesh-augmented vaginal repair surgery.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Disclosure of interest</title><p>The first author, Dr Marcus Carey, has a consulting agreement with Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA.
