Previous research has suggested that insecticide treated curtains (ITCs) can lower dengue vector infestations in houses. This observational study investigated individual and household-level socio-demographic factors associated with correct and consistent use of ITCs in Iquitos, Peru. A baseline knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) survey was administered to 1,333 study participants, and ITCs were then distributed to 593 households as part of a cluster-randomized trial. Follow up KAP surveys and ITC-monitoring checklists were conducted at 9, 18, and 27 months post-ITC distribution. At 9 months post-distribution, almost 70% of ITCs were hanging properly (e.g. hanging fully extended or tied up), particularly those hung on walls compared to other locations. Proper ITC hanging dropped at 18 months to 45.7%. The odds of hanging ITCs correctly and consistently were significantly greater among those participants who were housewives, knew three or more correct symptoms of dengue and at least one correct treatment for dengue, knew a relative or close friend who had had dengue, had children sleeping under a mosquito net, or perceived a change in the amount of mosquitoes in the home. Additionally, the odds of recommending ITCs in the future were significantly greater among those who perceived a change in the amount of mosquitoes in the home (e.g. perceived the ITCs to be effective). Despite various challenges associated with the sustained effectiveness of the selected ITCs, almost half of the ITCs were still hanging at 18 months, suggesting a feasible vector control strategy for sustained community use.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Dengue is an arthropod-borne virus of great public health importance.

Most people preferred to hang the ITCs in doorways and as room dividers, but also hung them as curtains on windows and on their walls. We assessed who still had their ITCs hanging or tied up at 9 months and 18 months after distribution, and found that use of the ITCs decreased over time to about half. When we explored who was more likely to be using the ITCs correctly (having them hanging in place, or tied up in place, or washed without bleach and avoiding direct sunlight), we found that those who knew more about dengue, knew someone who had dengue, had young children in their homes sleeping under an insecticide treated mosquito net, or who perceived the ITCs to work well, were more likely to be using their ITCs than others. Despite various challenges in sustained ITC effectiveness in this study, the fact that almost half of the homes still had the ITCs hanging at 18 months suggests this vector control strategy is feasible for long term community use.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by funding from the Wellcome Trust (WT085714MA), the U.S. National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH/NIAID) award number R01 AI069341-01, the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center Global Emerging Infections Systems Research Program (847705.82000.25GB.B0016), and the Military Infectious Disease Research Program (S0263_10_LI and S0216_09_LI).

The Americas are one of the most affected areas in the world, and in 2013 had the largest number of cases ever reported in that region&#x02014;2.3 million&#x02014;of which 37,692 were severe and 1,208 resulted in death [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Peru bears a substantial portion of the disease burden in the Americas, with 11,816 cases and 16 deaths reported in 2013 [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In particular, the Department of Loreto, where this study was conducted, experienced nearly a third of the country&#x02019;s cases in 2013, with 3,542 cases reported [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>While significant advances are underway in dengue vaccine development, vector control remains the only current option for prevention of dengue infection [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and it is likely to remain necessary once vaccines become available both in the context of integrated dengue control programs and to prevent other <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> transmitted infections such as the rapidly increasing chikungunya virus. Vector control strategies most commonly target the immature stages of the mosquito, as <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> preferentially breed in containers in close proximity to human habitations. Container control interventions at most reduce vector density and do not impact adult mosquito longevity, which limits their potential to reduce dengue transmission. Interventions targeting the adult stage of the mosquito are often only used in outbreak situations due to their limited efficacy and residuality, as well as their comparatively labor intensive requirements [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For this reason, long-lasting interventions targeting the adult stage of the mosquito are attractive, and the use of insecticide-treated curtains (ITCs) offers one promising household-level strategy to achieve this. The use of ITCs combined with insecticide-treated container covers has been demonstrated to decrease significantly both the Breteau Index (BI) (number of positive containers/100 households) and pupae per person index (PPI), with evidence that a protective spillover effect from the intervention occurs in neighboring untreated areas [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The effectiveness of any intervention relies on more than just its availability. Successful implementation requires full acceptance by key community leaders and members, as well as correct and consistent use of the intervention [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Numerous studies have been conducted about the use of insecticide-treated materials (ITMs) as vector control tools for malaria prevention [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but the use ITCs for dengue prevention has been evaluated in only a few contexts. Those studies reported high acceptability of ITCs [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], particularly among those families who had previous experience with dengue infection [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and who perceived the ITCs to be effective [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Continued ITC use was reported to be higher among families who had been resident in their home for more than five years and families that had previously used decorative curtains in their homes [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>An attractive aspect of using ITCs to suppress dengue vector populations is that they comprise a largely passive intervention: the ITCs simply hang inside a house and beyond acceptance of their presence they require minimal behavior change on the part of the householders. Understanding the socio-demographic factors and knowledge, attitudes and practices associated with correct and consistent ITC use can shed light on how to maximize the effectiveness of future ITC intervention programs. A systematic review of the effectiveness of 21 dengue fever prevention programs from around the world revealed that an understanding of the link between human behavior and correct and effective vector control programs was missing [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, a more recent study focusing on the individual determinants of insecticide-treated bednets use&#x02014;a similar vector control strategy&#x02014;identified a gap in understanding which behavioral mechanisms and educational tools were associated with successful ITC program implementation [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This study aims to fill these gaps with respect to the effectiveness of ITC interventions for dengue control.</p><p>As part of a cluster-randomized trial examining whether ITCs could reduce dengue transmission, the objective of this study was to determine the individual and household-level socio-demographic factors that are associated with the correct and consistent use of ITCs in Iquitos, Peru. Correct and consistent use was defined for this study as 1) ITCs <italic>observed</italic> as hanging properly&#x02014;loosely and extended&#x02014;at the time of visit, 2) ITCs <italic>observed</italic> to be tied up, but still in their place, at the time of visit, and 3) ITCs <italic>reported</italic> as washed correctly&#x02013;with only water and/or mild soap and hung to dry in the shade.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study Setting</title><p>This observational study was conducted in an urban part of the San Juan district population ~102,000) of Iquitos, Peru (population ~430,000)&#x02014;a large, geographically isolated city in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, accessible only by boat or plane [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Dengue epidemiology has been extensively studied in Iquitos since 1999 by the University of California at Davis/U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit 6-Iquitos group [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study is part of a larger cluster-randomized controlled trial, initiated in October 2009, to measure whether ITCs can reduce dengue transmission and dengue vector activity in 10 treatment clusters compared to 10 control clusters of approximately 70 households each (2&#x02013;3 city blocks). ITCs were an official WHO-recognized brand of long-lasting insecticide (deltamethrin) treated material.</p><p>Based on formative research conducted prior to the study, we estimated that each household would request approximately 5 ITCs, but participants could request as many as they wanted. There were three colors to choose from&#x02013;pink, sky blue and dark blue&#x02013;and the ITCs were lacey, since there was consensus at the formative stage that this is what individuals preferred. Study staff hung the ITCs in locations suggested by householders, which were documented (i.e., doorways, walls, windows, as room dividers). A member of the study team distributed an information sheet about the ITCs and discussed their correct use (i.e., hanging loosely) and upkeep (i.e., not washed with bleach, kept out of direct sunlight when being dried, mend holes if holes form) with the householders. Due to an unexpected problem with ITC losing bioefficacy after 3&#x02013;6 months, the research team removed all ITCs from houses 12 months after distribution and re-treated them with deltamethrin, and then returned them to their locations in the houses.</p><p>One month prior to ITC distribution, a baseline survey was administered to 1,333 individuals in intervention and control households, assessing knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) associated with dengue and mosquito control [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A total of 3,178 ITCs were then distributed to the 593 intervention households between November and December 2009, with an additional 1,049 ITCs distributed to the intervention homes that requested more 9 months later.</p><p>Follow up KAP surveys were conducted at 9 and 27 months post-ITC distribution with the same household respondent, when questions regarding barriers and motivators to regular ITC use were included (although there were no KAP related interventions, we expected possible knowledge improvement from the regular presence of our research team in the community monitoring ITCs and answering questions). ITC-monitoring checklists were also conducted at 9 and 18 months post-ITC distribution, when &#x0201c;correct and consistent use&#x0201d; of the ITCs, as has been defined for this study, was verified by direct observation by a 7-membered research team. If individuals wanted more ITCs for their homes at the 18 months, more ITCs were distributed at that time. Additionally, focus group discussions with a small sub-sample were conducted at 6 and 12 months to understand more about the participants&#x02019; experience using the ITCs&#x02013;findings from the focus groups are being published separately. For the KAP surveys and ITC-monitoring checklists, we sought to interview the same individual at the home who was responsible for the ITCs&#x02013;which was determined by asking who makes the decisions in the home (most commonly the person who managed all aspects of the household, e.g. housewife). If the person identified as responsible for the ITCs was not at home during follow-up visits, additional visits were made in the morning, afternoon, and evening hours a minimum of 3 times and a maximum of 8 times. If repeated visits were unsuccessful in locating the person responsible, then the home was removed from the analysis. All tables report whether data came at 9, 18 or 27 months, unless it was socio-demographic and dengue-related knowledge or preventive practices which all come from the baseline KAP.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Monitoring of ITC Use</title><p>The hanging, condition and upkeep status of the ITCs was observed at 9 and 18 months after distribution using a monitoring checklist based on direct observation. To assess hanging status, our trained research team members directly observed, for each ITC, whether it was: 1) hanging correctly, 2) hanging in place but tied up, 3) being washed, 4) being stored, 5) other location, or 6) missing (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004409.t001">Table 1</xref> for a full list of variables and their definitions). The condition of the ITC was also directly observed by our team, and recorded as excellent, good, poor, or missing. To ensure consistency in the responses recorded by our research team members, during training the team practiced recording their observations about ITCs in different conditions until their reports were consistent with each other. To assess the upkeep status, the householder was asked how the ITC had been washed, and who had washed it, as well as whether it had required mending&#x02013;and if so, it was checked for having been mended by our research team.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to create the socioeconomic status (SES) variable, where 50% above the mean was defined as higher SES and less than or equal to 50% was defined as lower SES. Components of the PCA included: exterior wall material, interior wall material, roof material, floor material, window material, cooking material, has fixed telephone line, has electricity, and number of refrigerators, televisions, DVD, computer, radio, washing machine, cars, rooms in the home. Because each home had more than one ITC, the dependent variables of interest&#x02014;ITCs hanging correctly, tying ITCs up, and washing ITCs correctly&#x02014;were made dichotomous by classifying those homes with 50 percent or more ITCs hanging, tied up or washed correctly as &#x02018;correct&#x02019;, whereas those with 49 percent or less were classified as &#x02018;not correct&#x02019;.</p><p>Chi-square tests were conducted to determine whether differences observed in the categorical variables of knowledge, perception of risk, prevention practices, and perceived effectiveness were statistically different between those households: 1) that had ITCs hanging fully extended vs. tied up or not in place, 2) that had ITCs hanging fully extended and/or tied up vs. not in place, and 3) that had washed ITCs correctly or not (see precise definition of these measures in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004409.t001">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, we looked to see if there were significant differences amongst participants who reported that they would recommend ITCs to friends or family in the future versus those who would not.</p><p>A logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between the predictor (independent) variables (socio-demographic variables, as well as variables associated to dengue knowledge, perception of risk, prevention practices, and perceived ITC effectiveness, as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004409.t001">Table 1</xref>) to the dichotomous criterion (dependent) variables of interest associated with correct and consistent use of ITCs. The independent variables for these models included: age, education, occupation, number of children 3 years old and under living at home, wealth index, knows a relative or close friend who had dengue, knows three or more correct symptoms of dengue, knows three or more correct protection methods, knows one or more correct treatment methods, children sleep under a mosquito net, and saw a change in the amount of mosquitoes.

However, despite the ease of use of the ITCs, the use of the ITCs decreased from 68.6% at 9 months to 45.7% at 18 months after distribution. Two similar studies&#x02013;one in Venezuela and Thailand on ITCs for dengue prevention, and another in Ethiopia on ITNs for malaria prevention&#x02013;also found a decrease in usage over time, and found that long-term use of the ITCs was associated with perceived effectiveness: when participants perceived that their ITNs had lost effectiveness, they stopped using them [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although the perception of effectiveness was high in our study at 9 and 27 months (over 90% reporting they felt ITCs worked well at both times), there was a high percentage of participants who perceived that the change in the amount of mosquitoes lasted only a few months (34.9% at 9 months, 55.7% at 27 months), which might have affected use or explain why so many ITCs were no longer in place at 18 months. However, the association between perception of effectiveness and future use of the ITCs was still significant at 27 months after distribution, and the odds of recommending ITCs to friends or family in the future was significantly higher among those who did perceive the ITCs to be effective (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004409.t005">Table 5</xref>).</p><p>Controlling for various socio-demographic and knowledge-related variables, knowing a relative or close friend who had dengue previously and using a mosquito net were both positively associated with our most important measure of correct and consistent ITC use: having 50% or more of the ITCs in that house hanging fully extended or tied up. Previous research also found that the correct and consistent use of ITCs was positively associated with knowing someone who had been infected with dengue [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is possible that perceiving that dengue could happen to anyone&#x02013;including themselves&#x02014;or seeing firsthand the severity of illness that can result from a dengue infection served as an incentive to use the ITCs correctly [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, we also found that in the adjusted models, knowing someone who has had dengue and knowledge of dengue symptoms were both associated with the odds of washing the ITCs correctly&#x02013;one of our measures of correct use. Previous studies on the acceptability and use of ITNs as a vector control tool for malaria have not shown an association between knowledge of the infection and use of the control measure [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Also, a previous study of ITCs in Thailand and Venezuela did not find a significant association between knowledge of dengue and ITC use [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, in the other studies, knowledge of dengue (or malaria) was examined in association to use of the ITCs or ITNs, and like those studies, we did not see an association with ITC correct use either&#x02013;we only saw the association between knowledge of dengue symptoms and washing the ITCs correctly, a measure not used in those studies.</p><p>This study also presents novel KAP and socio-demographic factors positively associated with the correct and consistent use of ITCs: having children sleep under a mosquito net and being a housewife. We suspect that participants whose children slept under mosquito nets at night were more familiar with using vector-control tools, and that these are families that tend to practice preventive behaviors, and for these reasons, were more likely to use ITCs correctly and consistently&#x02014;selection bias. Moreover, the choice of a mosquito net indicated familiarity and acceptability of an insecticide treated material for vector control&#x02013;similar to an ITC for dengue control. In future health campaigns associated to ITCs, these families would likely be &#x0201c;early adopters&#x0201d; of an ITC intervention, and families who would likely require less health promotion to initiate ITC use. The positive association between washing ITCs correctly and being a housewife could be due to the fact that those who did the washing for the home were predominantly housewives and were therefore more likely to be familiar with washing items correctly.</p><sec id="sec014"><title>Limitations</title><p>There were several limitations to this study. First, we were unable to track any changes in the location of individual ITCs inside the home. For example, were ITCs placed in the doorway more likely to be moved to other locations compared to those placed on the wall? These data would have enabled us to determine the most successful long-term placement for ITCs within the home. Second, it would have been useful to know more about maintenance behaviors: how often did individuals report washing the ITCs? How often did these need to get mended? Though we perceive the ITCs to require minimal upkeep, it would be useful to find out what type of upkeep effort was required. Third, it would have been interesting to quantify how much of an impact was attributable to a barrier effect and how much was attributable to an insecticide effect. However, the trial did not aim to measure the impact of insecticide vs. non-insecticide treated curtains; rather, the aim was to assess the impact of ITCs as a single intervention vs. the status quo which was no ITCs at all. Fourth, &#x0201c;correct and consistent use&#x0201d; was a subjective measure used for this study and based on only two observation visits. It is possible that ITCs that were coded as &#x0201c;hanging loosely and extended&#x0201d; were actually tied up at other times of the day, and vice versa. Despite this limitation, we felt it was important to assess use in the most objective way we could: observation of use (vs. self-reporting). We also expect that if ITCs were hanging&#x02014;fully extended or not&#x02014;that they were hanging there most of the time, since participants did not know when we were coming to monitor the use of ITCs and we would not expect them to put them in place just for us. Finally, due to social desirability bias (wanting to seem like they were using them correctly most of the time), respondents might be more likely to underestimate the time the ITCs were tied up.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>ITCs are an attractive vector control intervention due to the minimal upkeep and attention they require. The findings reported here add to the body of literature regarding the effectiveness of ITCs as a vector control tool in dengue endemic areas. The long-term use of ITCs in this study decreased significantly over time; we believe this was primarily the result of a reduction in perceived effectiveness of the insecticide. In fact, this perception was correct: when we learned that people were perceiving the ITCs to no longer be working, we removed several ITCs from the field, tested them using standard WHO cone bioassays [<xref rid="pntd.0004409.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and found that indeed, the ITCs were not killing mosquitoes as they should have been. As such, we then decided to remove all ITCs from the field to re-impregnate them, which might have validated people&#x02019;s perceptions that the ITCs lost their effectiveness. The odds of using ITCs correctly and consistently and recommending ITCs in the future were significantly greater among those who did perceive the ITCs to be effective. Hence, importantly, despite the fact that the effectiveness of the ITCs did decline noticeably, it is encouraging that 18 months after distribution, ITCs were still hanging in almost half of the houses.</p><p>It is important for future ITC intervention programs to note that, although all participants had a choice as to how many and where to place their ITCs, a higher percentage of ITCs that were hung on the wall were hanging properly at 9 months as compared to windows, doors, or room dividers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004409.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This study supports previous findings that perception of ITC effectiveness was associated with correct and consistent use. Additionally, this study reports that certain participant characteristics and behaviors&#x02014;especially knowing someone who has had dengue or having children sleep under a mosquito net&#x02014;were significantly positively associated with different measures of correct and consistent use of ITCs. These findings reveal that perception of risk for dengue (by knowing someone who has had dengue) and already practicing preventive behaviors are key factors associated in using ITCs correctly and consistently, and that vector control health promotion should include messages stressing the high risk for all to dengue in dengue endemic regions like Iquitos. Finally, findings from this study could guide future ITC-related interventions regarding locations in the house where ITCs were more likely to be used correctly and remain over time.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004409.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>STROBE checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004409.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our gratitude to the survey and entomology teams for their hard work gathering the baseline information.
