The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate the effect of a combined, progressive, strength and neuromuscular exercise intervention on knee muscle strength, functional capacity and hamstring muscle-tendon morphology in ACL-reconstructed patients with persistent hamstring muscle-strength deficiency compared with controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The study is designed as a multicenter, parallel-group RCT with balanced randomization (1:1) and blinded outcome assessments (level of evidence: II) and will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT Statement. Fifty ACL-reconstructed patients (hamstring auto-graft) with persistent limb-to-limb knee-flexor muscle-strength asymmetry at 12&#x02013;24 months&#x02019; post surgery, will be recruited through outpatient clinics and advertisements. Patients will be randomized to a 12-week progressive, strength and neuromuscular exercise group (SNG) with supervised training twice weekly or a control intervention (CON) consisting of a home-based, low-intensity exercise program. Outcome measures include between-group change in maximal isometric knee-flexor strength (primary outcome) and knee-extensor muscle strength, hamstring-to-quadriceps strength ratios of the leg that has been operated on and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (secondary outcomes).</p><p id="Par3">In addition, several explorative outcomes will be investigated: The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), the Tegner Activity Score, rate of force development (RFD) for the knee flexors and extensors, tendon regeneration and potential muscle hypertrophy at graft harvest site evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), postural control, kinetic/kinematic gait characteristics and knee-related functional capacity.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">This RCT is designed to investigate the effect of combined, progressive-resistance and neuromuscular exercises on knee-flexor/extensor strength, in the late rehabilitation phase following ACL reconstruction. Reduced hamstring strength represents a potential risk factor for secondary ACL rupture and accelerated progression of osteoarthritis. If deemed effective, the intervention paradigm introduced in this study may help to improve current treatment strategies in ACL-reconstructed patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02939677 (recruiting).

ACL reconstruction aims to restore functional stability of the knee, and can be performed using a variety of different surgical techniques and graft sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The hamstring tendon is one of the most commonly used graft donor sites used for ACL reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although current ACL reconstruction procedures intend to restore internal knee biomechanics, function of the ACL-reconstructed knee remains different from that of healthy knees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and is associated with early development of osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, information about factors associated with increased risk of osteoarthritis, such as lower-limb muscle-strength deficits, should be part of the risk management with ACL reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In a recent study, maximal isometric hamstring-muscle strength was reported to be 22% lower in the ACL-reconstructed limb at 18&#x000a0;months post surgery, and reduced knee-joint function was also observed compared with healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Notably, hamstring muscles are considered important protagonists to the ACL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and reduced knee-flexor strength represents a potential risk factor for secondary ACL rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. According to international standards and consensus, ACL postoperative rehabilitation is generally limited to the first 9&#x02013;12 months post surgery. Furthermore, the effect of early (first 12&#x000a0;months post surgery) rehabilitation has previously been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] .Thus, long-term rehabilitation protocols of ACL-reconstructed patients, especially when using semitendinosus auto-grafts, are strongly advised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Due to well-documented positive effects, neuromuscular training has become an integral part of most early post-operative ACL reconstruction rehabilitation programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, there is limited evidence on studies performing muscle-strength interventions during the late rehabilitation phase (12&#x000a0;months post surgery) following ACL reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Tissue regeneration by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-verified muscle volume and tendon-graft-site regrowth is generally considered to be one of the pivotal preconditions for postoperative recovery in terms of improved knee-joint function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Several studies have examined the regenerative capacity of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] demonstrating substantial tendon regeneration at 6&#x000a0;months after time of harvesting. However, regeneration is slow and may continue up to approximately 12&#x02013;24 months after ACL reconstruction, without guarantee of full muscle-tendon regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and thus it may have impact on the effect of muscle-strength interventions.</p><p id="Par8">The objective of this study is, therefore, to investigate the effect of targeted exercise on knee-muscle strength and joint function in ACL-reconstructed patients with persistent hamstring muscle deficiency 12&#x02013;24 months post surgery compared with controls. Furthermore, an explorative part of the study will evaluate the extent of tissue regeneration at the graft harvest site by MRI, and kinematic and kinetic analyses on functional gait performances.</p><p id="Par9">As such, this study is expected to provide important clinical evidence on late-phase rehabilitation in ACL-reconstructed patients. If deemed effective, these study findings may help identify and refine optimal rehabilitation paradigms for ACL-reconstructed patients and help to describe and/or develop optimal exercise-based therapy to improve donor-site tendon regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par10">The study is designed as a prospective, superiority, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) with balanced and blinded randomization (1:1) with blinded outcome assessment (level of evidence: II).

Group-based exercises will have a maximum of six participants, and will be performed at the hospital rehabilitation facility (Kolding) as well as in a local commercial fitness centre (Odense). The physiotherapists involved in the training are experienced in the rehabilitation of knee-related injuries, will participate in scientific seminars on ACL-rehabilitation and exercise, and will be instructed and trained in the specific intervention protocol by the principal investigator prior to the initiation of participant recruitment.</p><p id="Par19">After 2&#x000a0;weeks of familiarization with emphasis on correct technique, the strengthening part of the intervention will commence consisting of eight exercises (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) for the lower extremities performed in three sets of 10 repetitions with an intensity of 12 repetitions maximum with the time for rest (between sets). To apply with the principles of explosive-type resistance training (RFD-training) the participants will be instructed to complete the concentric phase of the movement &#x0201c;as fast as possible,&#x0201d; then pause briefly, and complete the eccentric phase of the movement in approximately 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;s. Measurements of the velocity during the concentric phase are not applicable; however, the quality of the explosive component of the exercise is supervised by an experienced physiotherapist throughout the entire intervention period.

Specific exercise instructions using body weight (gravity) and resistance bands, will be provided by the physiotherapists upon randomization (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The home-based training regimen of the control group (CON) is based upon the fact that persistent asymmetry of hamstring muscle strength has been evaluated by hand-held dynamometry, before enrollment. There is currently, no established national guideline, concerning late rehabilitation programs, to ACL patients with muscle asymmetry and/or knee-instability symptoms. However, since the referring surgeon has observed pathological asymmetry of the knee-extensors at inclusion and for ethical reasons, patients in the current trial are offered a low-resistance exercise regimen to mimic realistic clinical guidelines for the current patient group (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Pain monitoring during exercise intervention</title><p id="Par22">The intervention procedures may provoke musculoskeletal pain and participants will, therefore, be asked to rate perceived pain intensity in their training diary before and after training and test sessions using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0&#x000a0;mm&#x02009;=&#x02009;no pain, 100&#x000a0;mm&#x02009;=&#x02009;worst possible pain).

As a prospective RCT, the results of this study are expected to provide high-level evidence of the potential clinical and functional benefits of performing an exercise-based intervention in the late rehabilitation phase following ACL reconstruction, using hamstring auto-grafts. So far, no RCTs have evaluated the effect of combined, progressive-resistance training and neuromuscular exercise in the late rehabilitation phase in patients demonstrating persistent hamstring deficiency following ACL reconstruction. If deemed effective, the intervention paradigm introduced in this study may help improve current treatment strategies for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Outcome variables</title><p id="Par51">Comprising the primary outcome variable, maximal hamstring-muscle strength, immediately following intervention (12&#x000a0;weeks) is chosen to examine if persistent hamstring-strength deficiency can be reduced by targeted exercise-based intervention. Furthermore, patient-reported perceived knee-joint function is evaluated at 6-month follow-up to evaluate the long-term effect of the intervention on knee function and knee-related quality of life.</p><p id="Par52">Patient-reported outcome variables are obtained (secondary/explorative outcomes) to investigate potential effects on self-perceived function in daily living, knee pain, symptoms, sports and recreation and knee-related quality of life. A recent cross-sectional study from our laboratory demonstrated strong associations between patient-reported outcomes and the objective outcomes listed in the current trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Such potential associations, if also detected in the current prospective RCT, may provide further understanding of the underlying impairments in neuro-mechanical muscle function associated with ACL surgery.</p><p id="Par53">In accordance with the International Classification of Function, Disability and Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] the current test battery is composed of different test types that cover different domains. Maximal isometric muscle strength is related to <italic>body structure and function</italic> whereas the remaining test types (one-legged jump for distance, kinematic/kinetic outcomes of gait and counter movement jumping) mainly serve to evaluate neuromuscular impairments, which are primarily related to <italic>activity</italic>. Impairments in <italic>body structure and function</italic> (i.e., Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC)) are linked to limitations in <italic>activity</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], which have been proposed to affect health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Thus, intervention paradigms aimed at improving maximal knee-extensor and flexor strength (MVC) might be expected to improve <italic>activity</italic> outcomes and thereby positively affect quality of life. In support of this notion, we have previously demonstrated that hamstring and quadriceps MVC are central outcome variables to explain the inter-individual variation in KOOS profile (subjectively perceived knee-joint function) in ACL-reconstructed patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, it may be reasonable to assume that the expected improvements in hamstring and/or quadriceps-muscle strength elicited by the intervention regimen will result in improvements in the remaining three test types evaluating <italic>activity</italic> and patient-reported outcomes.

Consequently, this may affect the generalizability, especially in the conventional clinical settings where late-phase (12&#x000a0;months post surgery) rehabilitation generally is not offered to patients, besides brief recommendations regarding engaging in training and/or referencing to web-based rehabilitation programs.</p><p id="Par55">To improve external validity and generalizability, only a few exclusion criteria will be employed. An exclusion criterion of BMI above 35 will be used since obesity causes soft skin tissue artifacts that will affect the validity of 3-dimensional motion analysis. Mechanical stability in the reconstructed knee, will be evaluated by the surgeon at the standard 1-year outpatient clinic follow-up. In case of an insufficiently healed graft, poor mechanical knee-joint stability or reduced range of motion, the surgeon will evaluate the need for re-surgery. In such cases participants will be excluded due to the potential occurrence of other known joint pathologies that may affect adherence to the intervention protocol. Patients who demonstrate associated meniscal and/or cartilage procedures, which are commonly related to ACL reconstruction, will not be excluded even though their functional limitations may be slightly different from the remaining sample.</p><p id="Par56">Since the trial is based upon patients volunteering for a physical intervention, the study may potentially be affected by selection bias.

The trial results should help to determine whether targeted exercise interventions can increase hamstring strength, and thereby be employed in the late rehabilitation phase for ACL-reconstructed patients demonstrating persistent hamstring muscle-strength deficiency. If deemed effective, the intervention paradigm introduced in this study may help to improve current treatment strategies and their timing for patients undergoing hamstring auto-graft ACL reconstruction. Furthermore, the explorative part of the trial will provide understanding of the underlying impairment in mechanical muscle function associated with ACL reconstruction.
