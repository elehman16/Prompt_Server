The rationale for using classical chemotherapy is to kill malignant cells in order to reduce tumor size. However, this method has not provided satisfactory benefits for patients with advanced cancers and poor prognoses in terms of survival. Often, these patients experience disease progression after a short period of remission, if any, despite treatment with classical chemotherapy. This progression requires not only residual cancer cells, but also a biological response permissive to and conditioned by the malignancy, according to several reports in the current literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In these reports, two broad components of the permissive biological response were identified: neoangiogenesis and tolerogenic immunity. Therefore, in addition to using treatments that kill cancer cells, targeting these additional components may also improve the antiprogressive efficacy of the treatments.</p><p>Recently, several clinical trials have attempted to control neoangiogenesis by incorporating antiangiogenic therapies into classical chemotherapy treatments for malignancies with poor prognoses. Improvements in progression-free survival have been shown in some cases. However, it is premature to draw conclusions about the overall survival benefits based on currently available evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In order to optimize these results, it was suggested that agents that target both neoangiogenesis and tolerogenic immunity, and not neoangiogenesis alone, might provide a greater benefit as adjuvants of chemotherapy. Indeed, the relevance of the tolerogenic immune component in a permissive biological response of malignant progression has been highlighted in reports that identified tolerogenic immunity as an early, permanent, and common phenomenon of malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Researchers previously reported that some standard chemotherapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], drugs used in non-cancer conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and cancer vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] could switch angiogenesis and immune responses from a tumor progression/tolerance balance to an antiprogressive/antitumor balance when used at specific dosages within a particular regimen. Therefore, in this study, we tested the effect of combining a set of agents that have been reported to promote antiangiogenesis and switch tumor tolerogenic immunity to antitumor immunity with standard chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In order to determine the applicability of our approach in different cancers, we tested the regimen in three malignancies with recognized poor prognoses, high prevalence, and appropriate survival expectancy for this study, namely unresectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] locally advanced pancreatic cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer.</p><p>Pancreatic cancer is a worldwide health problem, and surgery is currently the only potentially curative treatment. However, the number of newly diagnosed patients with surgically resectable pancreatic cancer is limited to 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;%. Locally advanced disease is observed in 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% of patients, which is associated with a median survival time of 6&#x02013;10&#x000a0;months. To date, chemotherapy only provides a marginal improvement in the overall survival for these patients. Similarly, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality for men and women worldwide. In the United States, 222,520 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed in 2010, and 157,300 deaths resulted from the disease. Approximately 85&#x000a0;% of primary lung cancers are categorized as NSCLC, which includes the main histological subtypes of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. The majority of NSCLC patients present with advanced disease at diagnosis, and the survival rates are quite low. The overall survival for patients with unresectable NSCLC is generally 13&#x02013;14&#x000a0;months after treatment. Lastly, prostate cancer is one of the most common solid tumors affecting men. It is the second most commonly diagnosed form of cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men worldwide. Once metastasized to distant organs, prostate cancer is incurable, leaving clinicians with palliative care as the only option for disease management. In their hormone-refractory stage, more than 84&#x000a0;% of prostate tumors metastasize, with a median patient survival of approximately 14&#x000a0;months. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the potential benefits of adding an induction regimen of antiangiogenesis and antitumor immunity to chemotherapy in poor outcome disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A prospective, randomized, phase 1/2 trial was designed primarily to assess safety, tolerance, and preliminary efficacy of the combination of standard chemotherapy with the aforementioned, previously published treatment that switches both angiogenesis and immunity conditioning.

This study aimed to explore the rationale of a complementary therapeutic approach that targets angiogenesis and immunity. In this trial, the analysis of two 30-patient groups of three different primary cancer types showed that survival was significantly improved when an induction regimen of antiangiogenesis and antitumor immunity was added to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. This survival improvement was observed in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, NSCLC, and hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Interestingly, the degree of improvement, though varied, was significant for all three of the primary diseases assessed in this study, indicating that this approach has a general benefit and suggests that the pathogenic and therapeutic mechanisms involved are essential for malignancies.</p><p>The link between these effects on survival and the modulation of the biological response was shown by comparing a 90-patient cohort that was treated with only chemotherapy with a 90-patient cohort treated with chemotherapy plus the induction regimen of antiangiogenesis and antitumor immunity. Although separate clinical trials for each type of cancer would be beneficial for analysis purposes, we believe that this design was more effective for assessing the essential mechanism proposed for the development of malignancies. The comparability of the analyzed groups was possible due to enrollment of the same number of patients with the three tumor types in each group as well as the use of the same inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p><p>After 3&#x000a0;months of treatment, the assessment of angiogenesis and immunity mediators in blood showed a net increase in AT and VEGF levels as well as a net increase in aDC and T-Reg cells. These results are in agreement with a change in the conditioning of the biological response induced by malignancies, neo-angiogenesis, and tolerogenic immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The conditioning becomes more antiangiogenic and less immune tolerogenic when chemotherapy is combined with an induction regimen of antiangiogenesis and antitumor immunity. This modulatory activity can be explained by the known properties of the agents included in this regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Metronomic treatment with a low dose of cyclophosphamide has been shown to not only be antiangiogenic due to its antiproliferative activity upon endothelial cells, but also antitolerogenic by selectively depleting regulatory T-cells and restoring T and NK effector functions in immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, Cox-2 inhibitors interfere with VEGF expression in neoangiogenesis and also block indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity, which is required to generate the tolerogenic immunity of T-Regs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) increases the number of peripheral blood DCs and the expression of their activation markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], thereby improving the antigen processing and presentation (i.e., classical non-tolerogenic immunity). Furthermore, sulfhydryl (SH) donors improve the generation of angiostatin from autoproteolysis of plasmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], allowing tumor infiltration from the blood immune-competent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Taken together, the properties of the drugs included in the induction regimen explain the tumor infiltration effects of the antiangiogenics and the non-tolerogenic immune-responder cell population. However, the generation of antitumor immunity requires not only immune-responder cells, but also a challenge of the immune system with tumor antigens. In the tested antiangiogenesis and antitumor immunity induction regimen, the tumor antigens were those released from tumors into the bloodstream by spontaneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] or chemotherapy-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] of previously stressed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Indeed, it has been reported that some of those tumor antigens released by tumors circulate as protected complexes with heat-shock proteins can induce vaccination against tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and can be recovered in a thermostable hemoderivative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This hemoderivative was used as the tumor immunogen to challenge the conditioned immune-responder cells. The results of cell-mediated immune responses assessed by DTH and IFN-ELISPot assays indicated the efficiency of this immunogen to induce antitumor immunity. Introducing autologous antitumor immunity in cancer treatments, as previously stated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], adds autologous tumor specificity, exposes the current tumor antigen library to the immune system, and provides immune memory. Taken together, the results of this study are compatible with the rationale of combining tumor cell killing with an induction regimen of antiangiogenesis and antitumor immunity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In advanced malignant diseases with poor prognoses that are treated with standard chemotherapy, the addition of an induction regimen of antiangiogenic and antitumor immunity agents that effectively switch the biological response from neoangiogenesis to antiangiogenesis and the immunity from permissive to antitumor immunity safely improved the survival of patients with three different tumor types in this study. Although these results are preliminary, they encourage further studies to confirm the clinical relevance of these findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p><sec id="d29e612"><title>Open Access</title><p>This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and the source are credited.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zitvogel</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Apetoh</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ghiringhelli</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The anticancer immune response: indispensable for therapeutic success?</article-title><source>J Clin Invest</source><year>2008</year><volume>118</volume><fpage>1991</fpage><lpage>2001</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1172/JCI35180</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18523649</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Folkman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Tumor angiogenesis: therapeutic implications</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>1971</year><volume>285</volume><fpage>1182</fpage><lpage>1186</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1056/NEJM197108122850711</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4938153</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mulcahy</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bevacizumab in the therapy for refractory metastatic colorectal cancer</article-title><source>Biologics</source><year>2008</year><volume>2</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>53</fpage><lpage>59</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19707427</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Lasalvia-Prisco E, Goldschmidt P, Galmarini F, et al.
