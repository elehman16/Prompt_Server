&#x02003;Prospective study.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>
&#x02003;Because single-level disk arthroplasty or arthrodesis in the lower subaxial spine improves headaches after surgery, we studied whether this effect may be better appreciated after two-level arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>
&#x02003;We performed an independent post hoc analysis of two concurrent prospective randomized investigational device exemption trials for cervical spondylosis, one for single-level treatment and the other for two adjacent-level treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>
&#x02003;For the one-level study, baseline mean headache scores significantly improved at 60 months for both the cervical disk arthroplasty (CDA) and anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). However, mean improvement in headache scores was not statistically different between the investigational and control groups from 6 months through 60 months. For the two-level study, baseline mean headache scores significantly improved at 60 months for both the CDA and ACDF groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). The CDA group demonstrated greater improvement from baseline at all points; this difference was statistically significant at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months but not at 18 and 60 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>
&#x02003;Both CDA and ACDF at either one or two levels are associated with sustained headache relief from baseline. Patients undergoing two-level arthroplasty had significantly greater improvement in headache at all points except for at 18 and 60 months. This difference in improvement was not observed in patients undergoing single-level arthroplasty. The mechanism of greater headache relief after two-level arthroplasty remains unclear.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>cervicogenic headache</kwd><kwd>headache</kwd><kwd>cervical disk arthroplasty</kwd><kwd>cervical fusion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sjaastad first coined the term &#x0201c;cervicogenic headache&#x0201d; in 1983 to describe headache referred from the neck.<xref rid="JR1500091-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

In addition, demographic variables of interest (i.e., age, gender, and body mass index [BMI]) were analyzed to determine their effect on headache relief.

An additional 24 patients (15 one-level, 9 two-level) were treated with the CDA device as training cases. This study only includes data from the randomized patients; the training cases were excluded from the analysis. It was not possible to blind the treating surgeons to the treatment. The patients were unblinded after surgery, because the postoperative radiographs viewed by the patient and clinician made the treatment readily apparent.</p><p>Postoperative care was left to the discretion of the treating surgeon. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. Patients were asked to refrain from taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs from a week before surgery to 3 months after surgery.

Although male and female patients did not demonstrate significantly different improvement in headache scores, it is interesting to note that female patients in the CDA and ACDF populations for both one-level and two-levels of treatment reported more headache than their male counterparts at baseline and at 60 months.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The exact mechanism of cervicogenic headaches has not been elucidated. Moreover, the precise definition of cervicogenic headache continues to be debated among different groups. The mechanism of referred pain can be explained by nociceptive afferents from C1, C2, and C3 spinal nerves that synapse onto second-order neurons in the trigeminocervical nucleus. This nucleus also receives afferents from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. This convergence described by Bogduk and Govind can help explain the referral of pain to the frontoparietal and orbital regions of the head.<xref rid="JR1500091-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Additional studies have shown that stimulation of the rostral spine evokes referred pain to the occipital, frontal, and orbital regions of the head, whereas stimulation of the caudal cervical spine elicits pain mainly in the occipital region.<xref rid="JR1500091-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="JR1500091-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p><p>The association between cervical nerve roots below C3 and headache is not as well understood. Cervicogenic headache arising from the lower cervical spine was first described by Diener et al, who theorized that nociceptive afferents from the lower cervical roots also converge on the cervical trigeminal nucleus.<xref rid="JR1500091-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Persson et al analyzed headaches in patients with cervical radiculopathy from the lower cervical spine. Selective nerve root blocks of the pathologic level produced a 50% or more reduction in headache with 69% of these patients reporting complete relief of headache using the VAS.<xref rid="JR1500091-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This study lends support to the theory that cervicogenic headache has the potential to be relieved with diskectomy in the lower cervical spine (in addition to the upper cervical levels).</p><p>Attempts have also been made to correlate cervicogenic headaches with a sympathetic phenomenon in patients with cervical spondylosis. Barre and Lieou first described these sympathetic symptoms in 1926, which include vertigo, headache, dizziness, and hyperhidrosis.<xref rid="JR1500091-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="JR1500091-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Li et al noted an association between anterior cervical diskectomy and improvement in these sympathetic symptoms, including headache. They hypothesized that headache relief was mediated by the removal of sympathetic nerve fibers contained within the posterior longitudinal ligmament.<xref rid="JR1500091-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In the one- and two-level clinical trials studied here, resection of the posterior longitudinal ligament was left to the discretion of the operating surgeon for both arthroplasty and arthrodesis treatment.<xref rid="JR1500091-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p><p>As noted above, cervicogenic headaches improve after anterior cervical diskectomy procedures. Schofferman et al first demonstrated headache relief after cervical arthrodesis in the upper cervical levels C2&#x02013;C5.<xref rid="JR1500091-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Riina et al reported headache relief after either single-level arthroplasty or arthrodesis with 2-year follow-up, and patients having arthroplasty experienced even greater headache improvement compared with the patients having ACDF.<xref rid="JR1500091-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This result was different from another one-level analysis with 2-year follow-up, which showed no significant difference in headache relief between arthrodesis and arthroplasty.<xref rid="JR1500091-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Both single-level procedures, however, showed a significant improvement in headache when compared with baseline.</p><p>The mechanism for headache relief may be multifactorial, and the putative mechanisms include neuroanatomic connections of the trigeminocervical nucleus with lower cervical roots; sympathetically innervated structures, which are then denervated by surgery; relief of cerebrospinal fluid obstruction during systole caused by focal spinal stenosis; and kinesthetic improvements in the cervical spine after surgery, either through improved spinal biomechanics or relief of reflex muscle spasm. To further investigate the role that improved spinal biomechanics may have in relief of headache after anterior disk surgery, we broadened our analysis to include patients undergoing two-level surgery and with follow-up out to 5 years. We assumed that the loss versus preservation of two contiguous motion segments may have a greater impact on spinal kinesiology compared with analysis at only a single level. Indeed, Pimenta et al has shown that multilevel cervical arthroplasty when compared with single-level arthroplasty allows for a greater improvement in NDI and VAS scores.<xref rid="JR1500091-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Cervicogenic headaches, however, were not specifically analyzed in the study by Pimenta et al.</p><p>We found a statistically significant difference in the headache scores between the two-level procedures at all points except for 18 and 60 months. There was no difference in headache relief between the groups in patients undergoing only a single-level surgery. Both the two-level and single-level data analysis showed an improvement in headache from baseline, with the patients having two-level CDA experiencing a greater mean improvement in headache. Although the two-level CDA group demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared with ACDF at most points, there was no difference between the two groups at the last follow-up (60 months). It remains to be seen if the difference favoring the arthroplasty group will reemerge with even longer follow-up. Therefore, we are not able to draw conclusions on the clinical relevancy on the difference between CDA and ACDF.</p><p>We suggest that an improvement in spine kinematics may improve headaches and that the effect is more apparent with multilevel arthroplasty. With multilevel CDA, each vertebral segment remains biomechanically distinct, unlike with arthrodesis, which consolidates motion segments.<xref rid="JR1500091-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

<xref rid="JR1500091-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> With the longer lever arm of multilevel fusion, spine kinematics is more adversely affected than with single-level fusion. However, we are not able to make a definitive conclusion, as kinematic measures were not analyzed in this study and the difference was not statistically significant at all points. Additional studies that measure the biomechanical profile at the index level and adjacent levels up to 5 years after surgery and its effects on headache relief can be done to help elucidate these relationships.</p><p>Importantly, both the fusion and arthroplasty groups had statistically significant headache relief at all points up to 60 months compared with baseline. A fundamental assumption of cervical disk arthroplasty is that loss of a motion segment is detrimental to spinal biomechanics and that preservation or restoration of motion at that segment is beneficial. Yet patients with two-level fusion still improved significantly with respect to headache scores compared with baseline. If one postulates that improvement in spinal biomechanics alone mediates headache relief, then one must assume that for fusion, the correction of deformity through the restoration of intervertebral height or lordosis improves spinal biomechanics independent of segmental motion preservation. Alternatively, additional mechanisms such as those listed above must play a role.</p><p>Previously, we reported headache outcomes for patients having one-level fusion and arthroplasty through 24 months postsurgery. We used a mixed-models repeated-measures regression to assess the postoperative pain relief and to establish a significant trend of gradually worsening pain from 6 weeks to 1&#x02009;year, followed by the maintenance of pain relief from 1 to 2 years. The model accounted for differences in treatment type as well as differences in operative level. Here, we have chosen not to construct a new model or update the previous model, but focus rather on the comparative outcomes of ACDF and CDA through 5 years, extending our analysis to include a separate assessment of patients having two-level treatment. Unlike the previous 2-year analysis, this assessment does not model trends in pain attenuation nor does it account for differences in operative level. However, we were able to demonstrate that both patients having ACDF and patients having CDA maintained significant improvement from baseline headache scores through 5 years (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). Whether a trend in worsening pain exists as it did between 6 weeks and 12 months remains unclear, as does the effect of treatment level on long-term headache outcomes.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the inability to definitively diagnose cervicogenic headache in our patient population based on the diagnostic criteria proposed by the IHS. These patients did not undergo a diagnostic blockade to provide objective evidence of a cervical source of headache. As stated in published studies using similar methodology,<xref rid="JR1500091-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="JR1500091-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> headache assessment using a component of the NDI only provides a very basic headache questionnaire, and thus specific headache characteristics are not captured More detailed prospective studies that precisely qualify cervicogenic headaches should be done to corroborate our findings, as this study was a post hoc analysis of prospectively collected data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>At 5 years, patients who undergo single- or two-level anterior cervical diskectomy procedures benefit from improvement in their baseline headaches. For one-level surgery, the mean improvement in headache scores was not statistically different between the investigational and control groups at all time points. In contrast to the one-level cohort, patients receiving two-level CDA showed a greater improvement in mean headache scores from baseline at all points except for at 18 and 60 months. We also show that headache scores were not significantly different between the demographic groups for either one-level or two-level surgery. Although headache was apparently relieved after either arthroplasty or fusion, headache was relieved by two-level arthroplasty more so than by two-level fusion, and this difference was not observed in the single-level arthroplasty trial. Improved kinematics after arthroplasty may play a role but headache alone should not be the indication for surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Kyle Marshall from LDR for his expertise in statistical analysis and data interpretation.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="d31e137" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Disclosures</bold> Jonathan J.
