In regard to energy intake, Lowe(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) proposed three possible reasons for this. First, lifestyle change programs place roughly equal emphasis on scores of diverse lifestyle changes but evidence suggests that specific attributes of the food environment (e.g., the availability of high-calorie foods) and of food itself (e.g., portioning and energy density) play a disproportionately large role in appetite and weight control (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This suggests that it may be advantageous to make modification of participants&#x02019; personal food environments a major focus of treatment. Second, changes in self-control skills (e.g., self-monitoring, stimulus control, boosting motivation), though useful for weight loss, apparently cannot be reliably maintained, resulting in weight regain when treatment ends. Third, because obese individuals are particularly sensitive to the influence of food cues in the environment (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), they might benefit the most from an approach that directly produces and sustains nutritional changes in their personal food environments (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In this study two nutrition-focused strategies for enhancing the maintenance of weight loss were tested. The first was the use of meal replacements (MRs); past research has suggested their usefulness for weight loss (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and maintenance (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The second strategy was training in a reduced energy density eating (ED) approach to food selection and preparation. This approach (i.e., reducing the number of calories in a given weight or volume of food) is a promising strategy for weight loss maintenance because it promotes consumption of a satisfying volume of food while minimizing caloric intake (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In the current study, participants also were instructed to make changes in their food purchases and food preparation so the ED of the foods in their personal food environment (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) was reduced in ways that would be sustainable after treatment ended.</p><p id="P6">To evaluate the effect of the MR and ED interventions specifically for weight loss maintenance, all participants first completed a 12-week behavioral weight loss program. Participants were randomized into one of four maintenance conditions before the weight loss phase but both participants and their group leaders were kept blind about their assignment until week 13. In this manner participants were able to remain in the same group for the full 12-month treatment period. The 9-month maintenance conditions were: (a) lifestyle modification only (i.e. the absence of both MRs and the ED program, designated as MR&#x02212;/ED&#x02212;), (b) lifestyle modification plus MRs (MR+/ED&#x02212;), (c) lifestyle modification plus the ED intervention (MR&#x02212;/ED+), or (d) lifestyle modification plus MRs and the ED intervention (MR+/ED+). The study tested the hypothesis that the latter three experimental conditions would produce superior weight loss maintenance at 1- and 2-year follow-ups.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Methods and procedures</title><sec id="S7" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P7">A total of 238 overweight primary care patients (65.8% African American, 89% women, mean BMI= 39.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were recruited by physicians in primary care offices.

Exclusion criteria included lactose intolerance, serious psychiatric disorders and medical conditions and drug regimens know to affect body weight or appetite.</p><p id="P8">The 132 participants who completed the 12-week weight loss phase were randomly assigned to one of four weight maintenance groups formed by crossing two factors: 1) the presence or absence of ongoing use of one meal and one snack replacement per day (MR+; n= 66 and MR&#x02212;; n = 66) and 2) the presence or absence of a reduced energy density eating (ED) program (ED+; n=72 and ED&#x02212;; n = 60).

WCSs had graduate degrees in clinical psychology or nutrition. Participants were instructed to follow a balanced 1200&#x02013;1500 kcal, MR-supplemented diet (using Slim Fast<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>); MR shakes and bars were provided free of charge. The WCS also reviewed appropriate use of MRs, answered questions, and provided support to motivate participants to continue adhering to LEARN recommendations. During the weight loss phase, all participants weighed themselves at least weekly on digital scales that were provided to them and reported their weight during each phone call with their WCS.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Maintenance Phase</title><p id="P10">Participants were randomly assigned to weight loss maintenance interventions formed by crossing two factors: 1) continued use of MRs or not; and 2) introduction of a reduced energy density eating (ED) program or not. During this phase the 15-minute phone calls and written educational modules continued, but gradually decreased in frequency from weekly for the first 3 months, to bi-weekly for the next 3 months, and then monthly for the final three months.

The discontinuation of MRs was explained as a necessary transition to learning how to maintain lost weight using regular foods. The ED condition emphasized purchasing and preparing foods lower in energy density, mostly by reducing fat content and/or increasing water content of foods throughout the 9-month maintenance phase. Regular homework assignments aimed at having participants systematically prepare or purchase foods that were reduced in energy density to permanently replace ingredients or foods that had been a regular part of their diet. The goal was to change the energy density of as many foods as possible in participants&#x02019; personal food environments (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) in ways that could be sustained. These environments included their car, workplace and any other contexts where they regularly spent time.

Participants who did not complete the initial weight loss phase were not randomized to a maintenance intervention.</p><p id="P26">The effect of the two maintenance interventions on change in outcomes during the maintenance phase was examined using linear and nonlinear mixed models. As a first step, unconditional models were specified for each outcome variable to test for linear and exponential trends over time, and to evaluate the variance components associated with slopes to determine assignment as fixed versus random effects (all slopes were treated as random effects). Given our 2&#x000d7;2 factorial design (MR&#x02212;/+ and ED&#x02212;/+), two binary variables representing the effect of the two maintenance conditions were then added simultaneously to the best fitting model from step 1, along with their interaction. This approach allowed us to test for main effects of the ED and MR conditions, as well as to test for an interaction (which, if not significant, was not retained in the final model). These analyses included the following covariates: the value of the outcome at baseline and the time of randomization, gender, race (Caucasian vs. non-Caucasian), and weight loss from baseline to 3-months. As a final step, the linear mixed models were used to estimate least squares (LS) means for each outcome, for each cell of the 2 &#x000d7;2 design at 12-, 24-, and 36-months.

The relatively high attrition rate (44%) during the weight loss phase was presumably due to the fact that any eligible patient referred by his or her primary care doctor could enroll. Notably, the elevated attrition rate did not affect the internal validity of our study because our hypotheses were based solely on the maintenance of lost weight.</p><p id="P41">The weight loss phase produced smaller weight losses (a mean reduction of 6 kg or 3.3%) than those reported in most previous lifestyle change programs, which could be due to the relatively short weight loss phase of 12 weeks or to the fact that treatment was administered through individual phone calls instead of a group format. The significant three-way interaction between experimental conditions (MR and ED status) and time indicated that there were significant differences in the extent to which the four groups kept off their lost weight. The only significant between-group difference indicated that the MR&#x02212;/ED+ group maintained their weight losses better than the control group at 24 and 36 months. In a previous study, individuals in a reduced energy density diet program maintained their weight loss for 6 months but then started regaining weight (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p id="P42">The weight loss maintenance shown by the MR&#x02212;/ED+ group is encouraging because in most past studies of lifestyle change for weight loss, weight regain began shortly after treatment ended. On the other hand, if MRs have the potential to also facilitate weight loss maintenance as some past research suggests (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), then it is unclear why the MR+/ED+ group did so poorly during maintenance. One plausible explanation is that the convenience and simplicity of the MRs, and the fact that they were given free of charge during the 9-month maintenance phase of the intervention, led participants to rely on them to continue losing weight or avoid weight regain, thereby undermining these participants&#x02019; motivation to learn and consistently implement the strategies that were being taught simultaneously in the ED program from months 4&#x02013;9. If accurate, this would suggest that the potential benefits of MRs for weight loss (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) may be counteracted during maintenance if interventions taught simultaneously with MR use are not well learned because participants are relying too heavily on MRs to manage their weight.</p><p id="P43">To better understand the poor results of the MR+ condition, we examined participants&#x02019; reports of the use of MRs (which were collected at the 24 and 36 month assessments). At 24 months, 69.5% of those in the MR+ condition and 50% of those in the MR&#x02212; condition reported using MRs for weight control; the comparable figures at 36 months were 43.1% and 40.5%. There was no difference in weight change between those who did and did not make further use of MRs from 12 to 24 or from 24 to 36 months. Therefore, because the post-intervention compliance with meal replacement usage was incomplete in the MR+ condition, and because a surprisingly large percentage of participants in the MR&#x02212; condition also reported use of meal replacements, a meaningful difference in MR usage during the 24 maintenenace phase was not achieved. It is possible that many MR&#x02212; participants, who used MRs during the weight loss phase but then discontinued their use from months 4 through 9, returned to MRs during maintenance in an effort to prevent or reverse weight gain. This possibility suggests that in future studies of MRs for maintenance, investigators should test whether participants in a MR&#x02212; condition are not in fact using MRs during maintenance and that most of those in a MR+ condition are in fact continuing to use them during maintenance. Most past studies have not assessed MR usage following the intervention period.</p><p id="P44">In terms of blood lipids, the two ED groups experienced little change in total and LDL cholesterol during maintenance whereas the two groups that did not receive the ED intervention experienced a significant increase in these lipids. The absence of change in total and LDL cholesterol suggests that something about the two ED+ conditions prevented the rise in these outcomes experienced by the two ED&#x02212; conditions. Finally, the interaction effect on HDL cholesterol presumably reflects the superior weight loss maintenance of the MR&#x02212;/ED+ condition and the fact that HDL (a protective lipid) is a fraction of total cholesterol (which also declined in this condition).</p><p id="P45">Given the weight loss maintenance achieved by the MR&#x02212;/ED+ group, it was surprising that none of the possible mediators of this outcome changed differentially in this group. A possible explanation for the lack of differences in the total energy and energy density of the participants&#x02019; diets is that the ED group, who must have shown enduring improvements in their energy intake to maintain their weight losses for two years, devoted more attention and effort to maintaining changes in their diets and therefore demonstrated less underreporting of energy intake than the other three groups when dietary intake was assessed at follow-up. That is, it is possible that the success demonstrated by the MR&#x02212;/ED+ group reflected reduced energy intake but also less underreporting of intake, which could account for why energy intake reports of this group were actually the highest of the four groups.</p><p id="P46">A novel feature of this study was the use of weight loss during the first 12 weeks as a covariate when examining the effects of the interventions on weight loss maintenance. This procedure accounted for some of the individual differences in success at weight control that otherwise would have been treated as error variance, increasing the ability of the study to detect group differences during maintenance.</p><p id="P47">This is one of the few studies that have evaluated interventions for weight loss maintenance as distinct from weight loss. Other strengths of the study include its use of primary care patients, its inclusion of a high percentage of African-Americans, the comprehensiveness of its outcome measures, and its measurement of follow-up one and two years after the end of treatment. One weakness of the study was its relatively high attrition rate during the weight loss phase, which raises questions about the generalization of our findings to those who join a weight loss program. Also, the relatively modest weight losses achieved (an average of 3.3% of starting weight) may have reduced the potential to identify mediators of the treatment effect that was found.</p><p id="P48">In conclusion, the present findings can be seen from two opposing perspectives. On one hand any intervention that offers the hope of improving the typically disappointing long-term outcomes of previous weight loss studies is noteworthy. On the other hand, this implication is balanced by several others, including the poor outcome found for the MR+/ED+ group and the fact that several nutrition-related variables that were expected to partially account for the superior performance of the ED group failed to do so. More research is warranted on the use of reduced energy density diets and a focus on changing participants&#x02019; personal food environments for weight loss maintenance. Such research might also benefit from incorporating additional nutrition-focused strategies (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) to extend the durability of weight losses.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S34"><p>This research was supported by grant R01-DK066759 from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
