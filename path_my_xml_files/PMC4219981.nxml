known to alleviate allergic symptoms. Therefore, we examined whether citrus juice fermented by a specific lactic acid bacteria can
improve the symptoms of Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCPsis). <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> YIT 0132 (LP0132) was
selected based on its high proliferative activity in citrus juice and anti-inflammatory interleukin-10-inducing activity. Dietary
administration of heat-killed LP0132 cells or citrus juice fermented with LP0132 was found to significantly suppress nasal rubbing
in a JCPsis mouse model, indicating relief of allergy symptoms. To evaluate the effects of LP0132-fermented citrus juice on
pollinosis symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in humans with JCPsis, a single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical
trial was conducted. The participants were 42 adults with JCPsis. They ingested 100&#x02005;mL of sterilized LP0132-fermented citrus juice
(active group) or unfermented citrus juice (placebo group) once daily for 8 weeks. Immediately after the pollen peak when allergy
symptoms and QOL loss were most severe, itchy eyes, itchy skin, and QOL loss by JCPsis were alleviated in the active group
compared with the placebo group. At 10 weeks after starting the intervention, increased the levels of blood eosinophils were
significantly suppressed in the active group compared with the placebo group. We conclude that continuous ingestion of citrus
juice fermented with LP0132 may help alleviate the allergy symptoms and impaired QOL caused by JCPsis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic></kwd><kwd>citrus juice</kwd><kwd>interleukin-10</kwd><kwd>Japanese cedar pollinosis</kwd><kwd>mouse model</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>eosinophils</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCPsis) is an allergic reaction to the pollen of the Japanese cedar (<italic>Cryptomeria
japonica</italic>) and is the most common type of allergic rhinitis in Japan. Individuals with pollinosis experience sneezing,
runny nose, blocked nose, and itchy eyes every spring. Those with severe symptoms frequently develop asthma or bronchitis as
complications. According to epidemiological studies, the number of people in Japan with JCPsis was estimated to be about 30 million
(26.5% of the Japanese population) in 2008 [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. JCPsis has therefore been called the national
disease of Japan. JCPsis reduces quality of life (QOL), and the cost of treatment with antihistamines, steroids, and other drugs is
high. Furthermore, long-term administration of these drugs frequently causes side effects. Thus, ways to prevent or treat pollen
allergies without drugs are urgently required.</p><p>The hygiene hypothesis states that the lack of exposure to infectious agents, symbiotic microorganisms, or parasites in early
childhood increases susceptibility to allergic diseases [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to this theory, the
immunomodulatory effects of microbial contact in the intestine are important. By this reasoning, the involvement of lactic acid
bacteria (LAB) in allergic diseases has recently received considerable interest. In fact, many clinical trials have been conducted
to examine the effects of LAB on allergic diseases, and evidence for the health benefits of fermented milk and bacterial cells with
respect to JCPsis has been accumulating [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. LAB with anti-allergy effects often induce the release
of cytokines from immunocytes. For example, a strain of <italic>Lactobacillus pentosus</italic> has been reported to be a highly
potent interleukin (IL)-10 inducer that produces an anti-allergic effect <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Some types of herbs and natural herbal products have been demonstrated to have anti-allergic potential. An example of this is
hesperidin, a flavanone glycoside found abundantly in citrus fruits and known for beneficial effects such as anti-inflammatory
activity, inhibition of degranulation of mast cells, relief of edema, and prevention of anaphylaxis [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study, we selected a
strain of LAB showing both high proliferative activity in citrus juice and anti-allergic activity in an animal experiment, and
conducted a clinical trial to examine the beneficial effects of citrus juice fermented with the selected LAB on allergy symptoms in
individuals with JCPsis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial culture</title><p>About 100 strains of LAB isolated from various traditional fermented foods or the environment were obtained from the culture

Tachikawa City, Tokyo, Japan. The exclusion criteria were food allergy, pregnant or lactating, and planning to become pregnant.
Prior to enrollment, the purpose and protocol of the trial were fully explained to all the participants, after which signed
informed consent was obtained. Throughout the test period, intake of beverages containing LAB or bifidobacteria; food containing
LAB such as kimchi, cheese, and pickles; all citrus fruits except for grapefruit; and foods with anti-pollinosis potential were
restricted. The use of eye drops, nose drops, and anti-pollinosis drugs and hospital visits were not restricted but were recorded
in a diary. The protocol was approved by the Human Studies Committee of Yakult Central Institute for Microbiological Research
(Tokyo, Japan), in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Committee&#x02019;s own guidelines.</p><p>A single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted in the spring of 2010. Participants were divided into a
placebo group and an active group according to a completely randomized design, so that there would be no bias in terms of age, sex
ratio, body mass index, symptom score of pollen-induced disease during the last pollen season and pre-observation period,
co-medications, and number of hospital visits. Once daily after lunch for 8 weeks, participants in the active group ingested
100&#x02005;mL of the sterilized LP0132-fermented citrus juice, and those in the placebo group consumed the equivalent amount of Valencia
orange juice flavored to taste the same as the drink for the active group.</p><p>Throughout the 12-week test period (2 weeks pre-observation, 8 weeks sample intake, and 2 weeks post-observation), questionnaires
were completed to assess symptoms of pollinosis (runny nose, sneezing, blocked nose, itchy nose, itchy eyes, and watery eyes) and
QOL loss, in accordance with the Japan Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The degree of skin itchiness was evaluated using a similar questionnaire about symptoms of pollinosis. Blood
samples were collected from a brachial vein just before completing the questionnaire and at 4 and 8 weeks after initiation of
sample intake. The serum concentrations of immunoglobulin E (IgE) (total, specific for JCP, and specific for Japanese cypress
pollen) were determined by fluorescent enzyme immunoassay. Blood eosinophil counts were determined by flow cytometry using an

selected LAB on allergy symptoms of JCPsis. We demonstrated that most strains belonging to <italic>L. plantarum</italic> could
proliferate well in citrus juice with a pH of 3.5, whereas other species of LAB tested could not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref>). Since this pH is outside the range that general LAB can tolerate and proliferate in [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the strains belonging to <italic>L. plantarum</italic> are thought to utilize special metabolic systems. One
such system could be malolactic fermentation, a metabolic pathway for energy production that uses malic acid and plays an important
role in wine production from acidic grape juice by <italic>L. plantarum</italic> and other LAB [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Malic acid was detected at a level of 0.03% in the citrus juice we used but not after fermentation (data not shown),
suggesting that LP0132 utilized the malolactic fermentation pathway to proliferate in acidic citrus juice.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that some strains of immunoregulatory probiotics that predominantly induce IL-10 can promote the
development of regulatory T cells, thereby improving the symptoms of inflammatory diseases such as allergies, inflammatory bowel
diseases and autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It has also
been reported that LAB that induce a higher ratio of IL-10/IL-12 production have a potent immunoregulatory potential [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For these reasons, we used IL-10-inducing activity and the ratio of IL-10/IL-12 as markers
of anti-allergic potential. Following the secondary screening, LP0132 was selected as a strain with both high IL-10-inducing
activity and a high ratio of IL-10/IL-12 in macrophages (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The anti-allergy activity of the fermented citrus juice containing live LP0132 was demonstrated in the mouse model of JCPsis. For
animals in the fermented juice group, nasal rubbing decreased to a level similar to that in the anti-histamine group (positive
control), whereas the effect of unfermented citrus juice was lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref>). Some kinds of
citrus juice contain hesperidin, which reduces the inflammatory reaction, inhibits the degranulation of mast cells [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], relieves edema, and prevents anaphylaxis. Therefore, we posit that this weak anti-allergic
activity in the unfermented juice group is probably due to the action of hesperidin. No significant difference was detected between
the fermented and unfermented juice groups, but on average, the number of nasal rubbing events was 15% lower in the fermented juice
group than in the unfermented juice group. Kim et al. [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported that hesperidin may act
as a potential IL-5 antagonist and have a therapeutic effect on allergic asthma. However, there is less information available about
the anti-allergy mechanism of hesperidin, and we have not yet examined the involvement of IL-5 in the anti-allergic mechanism of
LP0132. So at this point, it is difficult to estimate if hesperidin and LP0132 exert anti-allergic effects through the same or
different pathways. The reasons why a significant additive effect was not observed is unknown, but we think the large standard
deviation in each group was one of the reasons.</p><p>Since the powder from heat-killed LP0132 cells was also effective in the animal experiment, it was considered that viable cells are
not always necessary for anti-allergy effects. Therefore, we conducted a clinical trial using sterile fermented citrus juice
containing heat-killed LP0132.</p><p>The clinical trial was conducted in 2010. In the spring of 2010, the amount of JCP dispersed in the participants&#x02019; area of residence
was lower than usual [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the symptomatic states of pollinosis and QOL were
worsening in conjunction with the amount of JCP dispersed. Therefore, we consider that the clinical trial was conducted in a
suitable setting for evaluating anti-pollinosis effects.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that the symptomatic states of pollinosis and impairments of QOL were alleviated in the active group as
compared with the placebo group; that is, the average scores of itchy eyes, itchy skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig.
5A</xref>), and some QOL questionnaire items were significantly attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig.
5B</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting that, of the symptoms of pollinosis, the active drink particularly alleviated itching (of the nose, eyes, and
skin) in this clinical trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_006">Fig. 6B, C</xref>), indicating that it may help to improve QOL.
Itching is thought to occur via stimulation of C-fibers by mediators released from mast cells, including histamine and tryptase
[<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Based on the remarkable effect on itching observed in our trial, a possible effect of
LP0132-fermented citrus juice on skin itchiness in atopic dermatitis is also suggested. Jang et al. reported that oral
administration of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> PM008 isolated from kimchi (Korean pickles) reduced nasal rubbing induced by
subcutaneous administration of histamine in mice [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This suggests that the <italic>L.
plantarum</italic> strain may alleviate itching by affecting a mechanism other than histamine release. LP0132 may also effectively
suppress the processes after degranulation of mast cells, since no significant decrease in serum levels of IgE (total, specific for
Japanese cedar pollen, or specific for cypress pollen) was observed.</p><p>The percentage of blood eosinophils gradually increased during the later phase of the trial in the placebo group, but this increase
was not observed in the active group. A significant difference in the percentage of the initial value of blood eosinophils between
the placebo and active groups was observed at 3 weeks after the pollen peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_007">Fig. 7</xref>),
whereas the improvement in clinical scores was observed immediately after the pollen peak. It is known that the ratio of eosinophils
to total leukocytes increases after the onset of allergy, and so we speculate the difference between groups become more clear in the
late stage due to accumulation of suppressive effects on the delayed reaction to JCPsis arising as a result of the continuous
inhalation of antigen. Eosinophil cationic protein released during degranulation of eosinophils is closely associated with chronic
inflammation or asthma [<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, suppression of the level of eosinophils increase by
LP0132-fermented citrus juice may also lead to benefits for individuals with other chronic allergies.</p><p>Although our animal experiment and clinical trial clearly showed that LP0132-fermented citrus juice improved the symptoms of
JCPsis, the mechanism of action was not examined. Since the probiotic strain has a potent ability to induce IL-10, the
immunoregulatory actions of IL-10, including downregulation of inflammatory responses and induction of Treg cells, might be
responsible [<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In a future study, we intend to clarify whether the fermented juice can
promote IL-10 production and Treg cell development.</p><p>The present results show that it is not necessary for LP0132 to be alive to exert its anti-allergic activity, suggesting a mode of
action other than the ecological competition of intestinal microbiota. This property provides advantages such as a long shelf life
and reduced distribution costs of the product, which can be marketed as an anti-allergy drink. The fermented citrus juice also has
some advantages with respect to the costs of manufacture and disposal compared with mixing raw citrus juice with heat-killed
bacteria cultured separately. In conclusion, citrus juice fermented with the selected strain of <italic>L. plantarum</italic>,
LP0132, showed anti-allergic potential. Continuous consumption of this juice may help in the relief of allergy symptoms and impaired
QOL caused by JCPsis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the volunteers who enrolled in the clinical trial. We also thank Drs. H. Kikuchi-Hayakawa and C. Kaga of Yakult
