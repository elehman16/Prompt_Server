Pre-diabetics are more prone to develop Type 2 Diabetes mellitus and its related macro &#x00026; micro vascular complications. Its progression to Type 2 DM is approximately 25% over 3 to 5 years. Apathyanimittaja Prameha of Ayurveda is very near to contemporary concepts of Pre-diabetes/Type 2 Diabetes mellitus. The management of Pre-diabetes is still evolving in conventional system of medicine. In Ayurveda dietary factors are considered as an important component of genesis and management of diseases. It is quite true in case of Pre-diabetes. Based on the above hypothesis, it is decided to evaluate the efficacy of avoidance of certain dietary measures in a series of patients of Pre-diabetes. Aims and objectives: To study the hypoglycemic effect of avoidance of certain dietary measures on subjective &#x00026; objectives parameters of Prediabetes.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Method:</title><p>After thorough interrogation and laboratory investigation 40 cases of Pre-diabetics were selected from OPD and IPD of Kayachikitsa, S. S. H, IMS, BHU, on a well-set proforma. The selected patients were recruited randomly into two group viz. (A) control group and (B) Avoidance of dietary measures for a period of 1 &#x000bd; years with three months of follow ups at 6 months interval.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Discussion:</title><p>This study reveals that patients of Group B not only have encouraging results in terms of metabolic correction but also seems to cut off its progression to Type 2 DM. The Group B patients have showed better percentage of fall in FBS level (19.58%), in comparison to PPBS (15.12%). The overall response was better in-group B, while Group A patients were more prone to develop Type 2 DM in near future.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The leads available from this work open new Ayurveda inspired holistic approach to the management of Pre-diabetes &#x00026; prevention of Diabetes Mellitus. Besides, it also has potential to improve immune status &#x00026; metabolic correction in Young Pre-diabetics.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
