Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are rare progenitor cell subsets originated in the bone marrow, which are mobilized upon specific stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], then homing to target tissues where they are involved in endothelial repair or remodeling, as well as in post-natal neo-vasculogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. EPCs may contribute to cardiac and vascular repair [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. EPCs also appear to promote cardioprotection and cytoprotection by releasing paracrine factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), stem cell-derived factor (SDF)-1&#x003b1; and insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Among their so called &#x0201c;pleiotropic effects&#x0201d;, independent of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) reduction, statins have been shown to efficiently increase levels of EPCs in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and in patients with chronic heart failure [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and to improve the proliferative capacity of EPCs, in a way similar to VEGF [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Such effects have been ascribed to the regulation of stem/EPC gene expression and function [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Treatment with statins may also inhibit stem cell apoptosis and increase their proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. In addition to improving lipid profile by reducing LDL cholesterol levels, statins reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the randomized ARMYDA (Atorvastatin for Reduction of MYocardial Damage during Angioplasty) RECAPTURE trial, reloading with high-dose atorvastatin has been reported to improve clinical outcomes of patients on chronic statin therapy undergoing PCI [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Other described acute effects of statins in the setting of PCI [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] include the modulation on endothelial function, inflammation and thrombosis, with mechanisms not completely understood [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. One hypothesis is that pre-procedural intensive statin treatment activates cardioprotection and vascular repair by stimulating proliferation, mobilization and homing of EPCs, with subsequent augmentation of circulating and cardiovascular tissue-resident EPCs, in a manner independent of cholesterol synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>We tested this hypothesis in the setting of a pre-specified subanalysis of patients enrolled in the Rosuvastatin for REduction of Myocardial damagE and systemic inflammation During coronary angioplasty (REMEDY) trial, specifically investigating whether acute statin treatment before PCI is accompanied by (and is therefore possibly mechanistically linked to) an increase in CEC/EPC levels and functional activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study population and design</title><p>The present report derives from a pre-defined single-institution (&#x0201c;G. d&#x02019;Annunzio&#x0201d; University Cardiology Division at Chieti, Italy) substudy of the <italic>Rosuvastatin For</italic>

The design of the study, as well as of its main substudies, have been published [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The primary results of the REMEDY trial have not been published and likely will not, because, when less than half the projected patients had been included, the sponsoring company with a unilateral decision decided to interrupt the funding. Therefore, only two centers, Chieti and Naples, continued the mechanistic substudies with their own resources, only relying upon the availability of the randomization treatments still available.</p><p>The design of the present substudy is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172800.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Inclusion criteria, as for the main REMEDY trial [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], were: 1) stable coronary artery disease (CAD) with inducible myocardial ischemia and indication to coronary angiography; or 2) non-ST-segment (NSTE) ACS or STEMI deemed to require an invasive strategy, but with stabilized markers of myocardial necrosis (CK-MB or troponins, with variation &#x0003c;20% in 2 consecutive measurements obtained at &#x02265;6 h time distance before PCI, according to the second universal definition of periprocedural myocardial infarction [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). Exclusion criteria, as in the main REMEDY trial, were: STEMI or NSTE-ACS with high-risk features warranting emergency coronary angiography: any increase in liver enzymes (aspartate amino transferases/alanine amino transferases) ascribed to liver dysfunction at baseline; left ventricular ejection fraction &#x0003c;30%; renal failure with creatinine &#x0003e;2 mg/dL; history of liver or muscle disease; ongoing treatment with high-dose statins (atorvastatin 80 mg/day or rosuvastatin 40 mg/day); pregnancy and lactation.</p><fig id="pone.0172800.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0172800.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Study design of the REMEDY-EPC early substudy.</title><p>Coronary artery disease (CAD) patients candidate for an elective percutaneous coronary interventions (n = 60) were screened, Forty-eight of them, providing written informed consent, were enrolled and randomly allocated to 4 treatment strategy groups comprising placebo or 3 lipid-lowering treatments, as illustrated.

No independent measures of treatment intake were therefore obtained. However the intake of the double-blinded study medications was witnessed by the investigators responsible of their administration.</p><p>Informed consent was obtained from all patients. This specific substudy, in addition to the main study, was approved by the local Ethics Committee (Full name: &#x0201c;Comitato Etico delle Province di Chieti e Pescara e dell'Universita' degli Studi "G. d'Annunzio" di Chieti-Pescara&#x0201d;). All participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study. The Ethics Committee approved this consent procedure. Data obtained were managed blindly.</p><p>According to the protocol, patients were treated before intervention with aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day if on chronic (&#x0003e;3 day) treatment; or given a 300&#x02013;600 mg loading at least 6 h before the procedure if previously untreated with a P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor. Procedural success was defined as a residual stenosis &#x0003c;30% diameter. After PCI, aspirin (100 mg/day) was continued indefinitely, whereas clopidogrel (75 mg/day) was administered for at least 1 month (6&#x02013;12 months in patients treated for ACS or receiving drug-eluting stents). After the intervention, all patients were treated with atorvastatin (40 mg/day), irrespective of the initial randomization assignment.</p><p>At the time of randomization and at the time of treatment reload immediately before the diagnostic angiography and PCI, peripheral blood was collected to measure CEC levels and EPC levels and functional activity (see below). In addition, plasma lipids (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, to derive low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol according to the Fredrikson formula), were measured before treatment; creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB (mass), troponin-I (mass), and myoglobin were assayed&#x02013;before and after the acute treatment&#x02013;with standard centralized laboratory assays. The upper limits of normal (ULN) were defined as the 99th percentile of a normal population with a &#x0003c;10% total imprecision according to the Joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Universal Myocardial Infarction definition [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

These results were obtained adopting a number of complementary techniques for the identification of circulating progenitors, and in the unprecedented setting of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.</p><p>Since the acute pre-procedural administration of statins has been associated with cardio- and renal protection, including reduced release of myocardial necrosis markers [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and reduced incidence of contrast media-induced acute kidney injury [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the hypothesis that some of these effects may be contributed by an acute mobilization of circulating progenitors had attracted considerable interest. Nevertheless, results from the studies of EPCs and statins in the context of periprocedural myocardial injury, such as during and after PCI, have yielded quite equivocal or discordant results [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This may reflect on the one hand the quality of the experimental setting in which such hypotheses were tested; and, on the other hand, the varying manner by which EPCs had been quantified.</p><p>There are two possible ways to identify and characterize EPCs: by flow cytometry, looking at cell surface antigenic markers; and by cell culture methods, looking at their functional activities (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]). Currently, 3 main cell culture methods are used to identify 3 types of EPCs with different functions and angiogenic potential: late outgrowth colonies, also known as ECFCs, which are considered as genuine or true EPCs [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; colony-forming unit (CFU)-Hill cells [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; and early outgrowth EPCs, also known as circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]). ECFCs display a high proliferative potential, express endothelial antigens, form capillary-like structures when plated on Matrigel, but also blood vessels when suspended in collagen or Matrigel scaffolds and implanted in immunodeficient mice (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]). CFU-Hill cells and CACs display a low proliferative potential, but a great potential to secrete an array of angiogenic cytokines. CFU-Hill cells and CACs are positive for CD45, CD34, CD31 and KDR, and have the capacity to uptake uptake acetylated LDL labeled with 1,1&#x02019;-dioctadecyl-3, 3, 3&#x02019;, 3&#x02019;-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiDLDL)) [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As to the identification and enumeration of EPCs by flow cytometry, EPC antigenic profile continues to be controversial [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and no consensus guidelines have been agreed upon so far [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, in the present study we decided to analyze CECs by flow cytometry, for which there is at least some agreement in identifying such cells as CD34<sup>bright</sup>/CD45<sup>-</sup>/CD144<sup>+</sup>/CD146<sup>+</sup> events, together with DNA staining and dead cell exclusion [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

Likewise, preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that EPCs play an essential role in neovascularization, and are biomarkers of atherosclerosis, inversely related to the presence and progression of the disease (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]).The balance of CEC and EPC levels would reflects the endothelial health status [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>We examined whether the reported beneficial effect of statins in reducing periprocedural myocardial injury is due to their effects on EPCs. We also addressed the important question of whether this is a class effect or, on the contrary, differences exist between rosuvastatin, atorvastatin and the low-dose rosuvastatin/ezetimibe combination. These 3 treatments were selected because achieving similar effects on LDL lowering on chronic treatment. While the first two treatments determine a robust LDL lowering through a substantial inhibition of HMGCoA reductase [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the third does so by combining a relatively milder HMGCoA reductase inhibition with an interference in LDL intestinal absorption with ezetimibe [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The setting of the REMEDY trial, by which these 3 active treatments were compared with placebo in a double-blind double-dummy design, overcomes several of the methodological biases attributable to less rigorous study design, as adopted in virtually all previous studies on this topic. This report addresses the possible impact of tested regimens on early EPC levels and functional activity; another report will deal with longer-term (3-months) effects [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Here we prospectively investigated whether the preprocedural exposure to different lipid-lowering drugs (statins and/or ezetimibe) or placebo can acutely (within 24 h) modify levels of CECs and levels and functional activity of EPCs, with potential differences between treatments. While it is generally recognized that statin administration to patients may increase levels of EPCs, identified by varying combinations of surface antigens, in the absence of accepted guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the time- and dose-response course of such effects by different lipid-lowering agents had not been previously characterized. Our study is therefore the first attempt to assess functional and antigenic levels of EPCs after the acute administration of various lipid-lowering agents, prospectively administered with random allocation and in a double-blind design. In addition, this is the first study attempting to enumerate CECs and any subsets of CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>-</sup> cells, deriving from several combination of endothelial markers (CD144, CD146 and CD309), by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of CAD patients.</p><p>Our data show that the acute (within 24 h) preprocedural administration of different lipid-lowering drugs, at higher doses compared with the usual-doses administered before an elective PCI, is not associated with any evidence of EPC mobilization and/or of any release of CACs from the vessel wall in the peripheral blood, without any differences between either treatments and placebo or among the various treatment here tested. Recently, CECs have been found to define a population of mature endothelial cells, that detach from the vessel walls, following vascular damage or its physiological turnover, and become circulating cells [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, data about the acute effects of statin treatment and PCI on EPCs are debatable, reflecting the heterogeneity of methods used for the evaluation of EPCs and the great variability in statin treatment timing and dosage [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Vasa et al. [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] demonstrated, in a series of 15 patients with stable CAD, that a therapy with atorvastatin 40 mg/day increased the number and functional activity of EPCs after 1 week of treatment. More recently, it has been suggested that the effect on EPC mobilization might be dose-dependent: among 100 patients with ischemic heart disease; here treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day was associated with a higher EPC level than a regimen of atorvastatin 10 mg/day [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. At the same time, other groups have shown that chronic statin therapy can be associated with a reduced&#x02013;rather than increased&#x02013;EPC number and function. So, Hristov et al. found that a chronic (3-month) statin treatment was associated with a reduction in the number of circulating EPCs. The dose of continuous statin therapy inversely correlated with EPC number, and patients treated with a 40 mg/day statin (simvastatin or atorvastatin) showed a reduction in EPC number. Interestingly, statin treatment did not affect the functional properties of EPCs tested by the CFU-Hill Assay [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Conversely, Deschaseaux et al. found that the number of EPC colonies after 5 days of culture was lower in patients on chronic statin treatment (here with 40 mg/day of pravastatin or simvastatin for at least 4 weeks) compared with those without statin therapy, while long-term statin treatment would preserve late EPC colonies [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Recently, a systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies on statin and EPCs [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] reported two clinical studies examining the effect of statin therapy on EPC levels in CAD patients [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. One study used atorvastatin and the other used rosuvastatin. One study showed an increase in circulating levels of EPCs after 5 days of statin therapy and the other reported greater numbers of CFU-Hill after 6 months of treatment. However, the non-randomized nature of most of these studies and the lack of standard dosing certainly justifies uncertainty in drawing firm conclusions. Data from randomized studies of both early and long-term effects of statin therapy on EPCs are therefore clearly warranted. Our report tries to fill-in such knowledge gap with an appropriate study design and multiple methods to detect and quantify EPCs and CACs. We found no evidence of any acute effect of lipid-lowering therapies on any of the parameters here investigated. We also report no correlations of antigenic vs functional parameters for EPC/CEC assessment (with only 3 out of 126 correlation coefficients turning out to be &#x0201c;statistically significant&#x0201d;, but with no adjustment for multiple testing, which we therefore attribute to the play of chance), casting doubts on the possibility of using such parameters interchangeably in future studies.</p><sec id="sec028"><title>Study limitations</title><p>We recognize limitations of our study. Given the relatively small patient population, we cannot rule out the occurrence of a Type 2 statistical error. However, the combination of high statin dose (atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) does not here provide a signal for efficacy, nor such a signal appears even combining the 3 active treatment groups or the similarly acting, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, with similar potency.</p><p>As a second limitation, no data are here available about the EPC behavior in a prolonged follow-up. This was beyond the specific objectives of the present REMEDY-EPC early substudy, but will be the subject of an independent report (the REMEDY-EPC late substudy), as also obtained in a different patient population and in another research center, within the same overall REMEDY study.</p><p>Because of the short time of the observation, no independent effects of any of the acute treatment administered could be demonstrated. We did not measure changes in lipid parameters or CRP, clearly shown upon longer treatments [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], as such changes are not expected to occur so acutely. The occurrence of acute administration was however witnessed by the investigators involved, and we can reasonably exclude issues of non-compliance. We did not find any effect of treatments on indices of myocardial damage, suggesting at least no harm from such treatments. The main aim of this pilot study was to provide descriptive data that can be valuable in designing future trials</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec029"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data, the first obtained after randomization of patients to multiple types of lipid-lowering drugs and at different dosage, and assessing CEC and EPC levels and functional activity, argue for the absence of any mechanistic link between any otherwise observed clinical outcome (observed in other studies) and the effects of early statin therapy on EPCs/CACs in patients with CAD. The absence of any increase in EPC levels and function, whathever the type and dosage of lipid-lowering agent used, appears to reinforce the concept that any beneficial effect of early therapy with lipid-lowering drugs on periprocedural myocardial injury at PCI would be concomitant&#x02013;and therefore also possibly linked&#x02013;with the lowering of LDL cholesterol levels, which would require a longer time course, rather than to pleiotropic effects, at least those due to the mobilization of EPCs. This is in line with our findings explaining the effects of statins on stroke largely as the result of LDL cholesterol lowering, in a separate analysis of lipid-lowering clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0172800.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172800.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0172800.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Perin</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Dohmann</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Borojevic</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sousa</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Mesquita</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
