the pelvis during lower extremity mobilization. [Subjects] This study enrolled 24 subjects
into control and experimental groups. [Methods] This randomized controlled study included
patients who underwent arthroscopy after meniscus injury and started a rehabilitative
exercise program 8 weeks after surgery. Subjects were divided into the experimental
gluteus medius resistance exercise group (n=12) and the control group (n=12). The study
investigated muscle strength and balance of the flexors, extensors, and abductors of the
knee for 8 weeks. [Results] Strengths of knee extensors in patients who underwent
rehabilitative exercise for 8 weeks were measured. Strength of the knee extensors of the
experimental and control groups increased by 40% and 31%, respectively; strength of the
hip flexors of the experimental and control groups increased by 31% and 18%, respectively.
Strength of the hip joint muscles showed a 40% increase in the experimental group and a
14% increase in the control group. However, there was a significant difference (18%) in
muscle strength of the hip abductors between the groups. Measurements of trunk lateral
flexion showed a difference within a group, but no intergroup difference was found.
[Conclusion] This study investigated the effect of hip abductor exercise on muscular
strength and trunk stability in patients with a meniscus injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Gluteus medius</kwd><kwd>Trunk lateral flexion</kwd><kwd>Arthroscopy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus, the most typical injuries of the
knee joint, make up a large proportion of cases<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A knee joint injury may lead to injury of the ankle, as well as the
hip joint<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The hip abductor is a muscle
that plays an important kinesiologic role in humans for standing on the feet and
ambulating<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The gluteus medius muscle
controls movements of the femur and stabilizes the pelvis during mobilization of the lower
extremities<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of a study of
muscular strength of the hip joint after a knee joint injury revealed that isometric muscle
strength of the hip abductor, adductor, flexor, and extensor of an operated leg decreased by
12% to 25% in comparison with that of a leg that had not been operated on<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The hip abductor muscles play an important
biomechanical role in humans, and are an essential pivotal point in mobilization of body
weight. A weakening of the hip joint has an effect on a closed mechanism by applying a
suitable force through the sacroiliac joint. Such weakening may cause impairment in deep
core muscles, such as the multifidus. Patients with weakened hip abductor muscles need a
mobilization strategy to counteract such weakening. The induction of compensatory movements
of the waist, the hip joint, and the knee joint require a suitable muscular kinetic
strategy<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. A weakening of the gluteus
maximus or the external rotator muscle of the hip joint increases the stress on the
tibiofibular articulation, and increases the risk of injury to the anterior cruciate
ligament (ACL)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Supplementary study on
the gluteus maximus or the external rotator muscles is necessary. If the hip abductor
muscles play the role of kinesiologic control of the tibiofibular articulation in a forward
facing position, these muscle groups would not show a significant difference in strength
between the genders<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Researchers suggest that the role of the gluteus medius muscle is important in the
kinesiologic control of the hip joint, which has a great variety of directivities<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Intermediate and posterior fibers of the
gluteus medius muscle, in an open chain, play the role of abduction and external rotation of
the hip joint<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Theoretically, the
centrifugal contraction of these fibers, which occurs during the period of the deceleration
phase of closed chain activities, controls the abduction of the hip joint, and the scope of
joint activities of internal rotation. If the strength of the gluteus medius becomes
inadequate and weak during landing, the angle of abduction of the hip joint and that of
external rotation increases. Thus, the torque of the tibiofibular articulation increases and
an ACL sprain may occur.</p><p>A study by Wong<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> asserted that the
movement of trunk lateral flexion could be achieved by lateral lumbar flexion, ipsilateral
abduction of the hip joint, and contralateral adduction of the hip joint. On the basis of
such movements, the author emphasized the importance of the relationship of mobility between
the lumbar spine and the hip joint in understanding low back pain. The present study
attempts to investigate the effect of exercise of the hip abductor on muscular strength and
trunk stability of the lower extremities in patients with an injury of the lower
extremities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study enrolled 24 subjects divided into two groups: the control group (CG) with 12
subjects, and the experimental gluteus medius resistance exercise group (GREG) with 12
subjects. In the CG, mean age was 40.1&#x000b1;14.4&#x02005;years, mean height was 172.8&#x000b1;6.1&#x02005;cm, and mean
weight was 73.3&#x000b1;10.9&#x02005;kg. In the 12 male subjects in the experimental GREG, mean age was
38.7&#x000b1;12.4&#x02005;years, mean height was 173.8&#x000b1;4.8&#x02005;cm, and mean weight was 74.3&#x000b1;9.0&#x02005;kg. There were
no significant differences in the general characteristics of subjects between these two
groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). All participants understood the purpose of this study and provided
written informed consent prior to participation, in accordance with the ethical standards of
the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>A device (ISO-Check, Germany) was used to measure the isometric muscle strength of the
lower extremities. The ISO-Check device measures maximum and mean muscle strength. Patients
were asked to sit on the device and use the fixed strip to attach the device to the chest.
The mean muscle strengths of the knee flexor, extensor, and abductor were measured for 10
minutes in each direction to prevent compensation by the upper extremities. Nm is the unit
of measurement.</p><p>A skin-surface device for the measurement of spinal range of motion, the
SpinalMouse<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Idiag, Voletswill, Switzerland), was utilized to measure the
kinetic angle and flexibility of vertebral segments in the sagittal and frontal planes. It
has shown satisfactory correlations and a high reliability coefficient (0.96) in functional
radiology, as well as in comparative research<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Spinal curvature on the first
attempt was measured during relaxed standing by gliding the device manually down the back
along the lateral aspect of the spinal processes from the 7th cervical vertebra to the 3rd
sacral vertebra. Spinal curvature on the second attempt was also measured in the same way in
full flexion of the trunk. Flexibility of the thoracic vertebrae was examined using the data
collected from subjects before and after the exercise<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As suggested in studies by Gobbi<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and
Heckmann<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, the program for
rehabilitative exercise after a meniscus injury was revised and reinforced to fit the scope
of this study. The exercise program was carried out in 3 steps: warm-up, main training, and
cool-down. This exercise program was implemented in 4 sets, repeated 12 times at 70% of
maximum muscle strength. The entire duration of exercise was 60 minutes, performed 3 times a
week for 8 weeks.</p><p>SPSS for Windows S12.0 was used for statistical analysis of the data. General
characteristics of subjects and all variables of the two groups were computed and expressed
as a mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. A paired t-test was used for muscle strength of the knee
joint and hip abductor, and for verification of differences in balancing capacity within
each group, before and after exercise. An independent t-test was used for the intergroup
analysis of muscle strength of the knee and hip joint, and for verification of differences
in balancing capacity. A p-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically
significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, muscle strengths of the knee flexors in the CG before and after exercise
were 70.7&#x000b1;30.4 and 84.0&#x000b1;29.7, respectively, while those of the experimental GREG were
69.0&#x000b1;20.2 and 90.7&#x000b1;27.2, respectively. The data showed a significant increase after the
exercise within a group. However, there was no significant difference in muscle strength
between these two groups. Muscle strengths of the knee extensor in the control group before
and after the exercise were 96.9&#x000b1;42.6 and 127.9&#x000b1;42.1, respectively, while those of the
experimental GREG were 99.6&#x000b1;48.2 and 140.1&#x000b1;42.1, respectively. Muscle strength significantly
increased after the exercise within a group. However, there was no significant difference in
muscle strength between these two groups. Muscle strengths of the hip abductor of the CG
before and after the exercise were 60.2&#x000b1;10.3 and 69.0&#x000b1;11.6, respectively, while those of the
experimental GREG were 58.0&#x000b1;14.8 and 81.8&#x000b1;16.3, respectively. The muscle strength
significantly increased after the exercise within each group (p&#x0003c;0.05). There was a
significant difference in muscle strength between these two groups. In this study, the
extents of trunk lateral bending on the side of an injured leg in the CG before and after
exercise were 25.2&#x000b1;10.2 and 27.5&#x000b1;9.8, respectively, while those of the experimental GREG
were 25.9&#x000b1;10.4 and 30.7&#x000b1;9.7, respectively. The extent of trunk lateral bending after the
exercise significantly increased within a group. However, there was no significant
difference in the extent of trunk lateral bending after the exercise between these two
groups. The extents of trunk lateral bending on the normal leg side in the CG before and
after the exercise were 27.5&#x000b1;10.3 and 28.4&#x000b1;9.5, respectively, while those of the
experimental GREG were 28.6&#x000b1;10.6 and 29.8&#x000b1;10.6, respectively. The extent of trunk lateral
bending on the normal leg side showed no significant increase after the exercise within a
group.</p><p>There was no significant difference in the extent of trunk lateral bending on the normal
side between these two groups (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Recent studies have focused on the importance of the muscles concurring with the
corresponding muscular angle of the hip joint. In particular, these studies were largely
conducted with an emphasis on the gluteus medius with a purpose of injury prevention in the
lower extremities<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jacobs<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that diminished muscular strength
of the hip abductor reduces controllability of the proximal aspect of the hip joint, and
causes kinesiologic weakening of the knee joint. Furthermore, instability of the lumbar
vertebrae is one of the significant causes of low back pain. The functional weakening of the
hip abductor induces chronic lumbago and functional disability of the lower extremities<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study reported that not only pain
reduction and the recovery of muscle strength but also securing of the range of joint
movement are the most important tasks in order to gain stability and normal functionality of
the knee joint in patients with an injury of the lower extremities<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sale<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that muscular strengthening, which occurs in the early phase of exercise for 4 to 6
weeks after an injury of the lower extremities, is attributed to neurologic adaptation. In
this study, among patients who underwent a rehabilitative exercise program for 8 weeks after
an injury to the lower extremities, the muscle strength of the knee extensor after exercise
in the experimental group increased by 40%, while that of the control group increased by
31%. The muscle strength of the knee flexor after exercise in the experimental group
increased by 31%, and that in the control group increased by 18%.</p><p>With respect to the results for the hip joint, the muscle strength of the subjects in the
experimental group increased by 40%, and that of the control group increased by 14% within
each group. There was a significant difference of 18% in muscle strength of the hip abductor
on the injured side between these two groups. Only an exercise program of the hip joint
produced a significant difference in the rehabilitation program. The results concur with
those of previous studies. The Corrigan study reported that position sense decreased on the
injured side and threshold levels increased after an injury of the lower extremities<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Effective proprioceptive function
prevents injuries and recovers damaged motor sensation. This is emphasized in rehabilitative
processes, and proprioceptive training in the early phase of rehabilitation is
recommended<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fujisawa et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> reported development of the gluteus
maximus muscle after carrying out a training program for improvement of muscle strength of
the lower extremities. They also asserted that the development of the gluteus maximus muscle
had an effect on the improvement of self-balancing capacity. The results in this study
showed that there was a difference of 0.7% in balancing capacity between the experimental
group and the control group before the exercise program (experiment). However, there was a
difference of 12% in balancing capacity between these two groups after the exercise program
(experiment). Therefore, with continuous application of the 8-week rehabilitative program,
the muscle strengths and balancing capacities of the abductors of the knee and hip joints
improved. These results may support those of previous investigations. However, another study
was conducted on athletes to investigate the correlation between imbalance of the hip joint
muscles and development of low back pain. The results of this study revealed that changes in
left-and-right balancing abilities of the hip muscles were correlated with the load of body
weight, form, lateral dominance, and gender, but were not correlated with the muscle
strength of the abductor of the hip joint<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the measured results of trunk lateral bending showed a difference within
each group, but revealed no difference between these two groups. These outcomes concur with
the results of previous studies, but further study on a correlation between the hip extensor
and the trunk is necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>WS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>MY</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>KC</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Sports injury around knee joint</article-title>. <source>J
