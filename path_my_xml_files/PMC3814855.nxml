The effect of non-opioid component of Tis mediated through &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonistic and serotonergic activities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] As a week opioid, Tramadol (T) also is a centrally acting analgesic selective for &#x003bc;-receptors with local anesthetic actions on peripheral nerves.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Some attempts have been made until now to reduce post-operative pain through incisional infiltration. For example, subcutaneous wound infiltration with T reduced post-operative opioid consumption and produced less nausea and vomiting than dose intravenous (IV) administration after pyelolithotomy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Another study could not identify any significant difference in VAS and morphine consumption following T administration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>The degree of post-operative pain is multifactorial and depends on variables such as type and duration of operation, type of anesthesia used, and patient's mental and emotional status.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Also, the post-operative analgesic effects of preemptive subcutaneous infiltration of Tin the site of surgical incision have not been extensively studied based on the location of incision and surgery. In addition, lower abdominal surgeries are common operations in many countries. So, the aim of our study was to evaluate the effects and complications of preemptive subcutaneous T infiltration in comparison with a control group in lower abdominal surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining institutional approval from the ethics committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, this double-blind randomized clinical trial was carried out in the AL-Zahra general hospital, Isfahan, Iran during 2011. Ninety healthy American Anesthesiologists&#x02019; Society (ASA) physical status I and II, 18-65-year-old patients scheduled for elective lower abdomen surgeries were entered in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients after full explanation of the goals and procedures of the study.</p><p>Patients with a history of acute or chronic pain, alcohol or drug abuse, past lower abdomen surgery, and morbid obesity were not included. Moreover, any patient with a history of intolerance or adverse reactions, or showing anaphylactic reactions to the medications used in the study was excluded. Patients who endured post-operative bleeding or needed blood transfusion were excluded too. Informed consent was obtained from the patients. Before anesthesia induction, patients were randomized using computer-generated random numbers and received either preemptive subcutaneous T (group T) or normal saline (NS) (group NS). All patients were instructed pre-operatively about the use of VAS (0 = no pain to 10 = most pain imaginable). The preparation of study drugs was performed by an anesthesiologist who was not involved in the data collection. All patients were pre-medicated with a tablet of clonazepam1 mg and 150 ml water 2 h before surgery. Fluid therapy was the same in the groups based on 4,2,1 rule using 1/3 dexrtose water-2/3 NS solution before surgery.</p><p>After arrival to the operating room, patients were monitored by an electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive blood pressure measurement and pulse oximetry throughout the study. Then, anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg, sodium thiopental 5 mg/kg and atracurium0.5 mg/kg IV, and intubation was performed with cuffed tube number 7.5-8. Then, group T patients received 2 mg/kg T (attenuated with N/S to the volume of 20 cc) subcutaneously before incision at the site of surgical incision. Group NS patients received 20 cc N/S (placebo), respectively. Injections were performed by the surgeon. The syringes were all unlabeled and the anesthesiologist and the surgeon were blinded to the patients&#x02019; treatment assignments. Then anesthesia was maintained with oxygen 50%, nitrous oxide 50% and 0.8-1.2% isoflorane to maintain the blood pressure and pulse rate within 20% of the patient's baseline values. Tidal volume was 10 cc/kg and End Tidal (ET) carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) was maintained within 35-45. No additional narcotic was given in the operating room. At the end of the surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine 2.5 mg IV and atropine 1.25 mg. After extubation, patients were transferred to the recovery room and were tended by nurses who were also blinded to the patients&#x02019; treatment assignment.</p><p>VAS scores were recorded 0, 15, 30, 60 min and 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 h post-operatively after the patients&#x02019; admission into the recovery room. These scores were obtained at rest and cough position. In addition, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and sedation score (SS: 1. alert, 2. Occasionally drowsy, 3. frequently drowsy, 4. sleepy or easy to arouse, 5. somnolent or difficult to arouse) were recorded in these times, respectively. Each time a patient had VAS score &#x02265;4, he received 0.05 mg/kg morphine to maintain VAS score &#x0003c;4. For each time of nausea and vomiting, a patient received 0.15 mg/kg metoclopramide IV. Total dose of opium and metoclopramide consumption in 24 h following the surgery, first opium requirement time and post-operative complications (including dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache and seizure) were also recorded. Satisfaction status of patients (scaled by five different degrees including: Outstanding, very good, good, fair, and bad) was also recorded within 24 h following the surgery. Anesthesia time was considered as the time between induction of anesthesia and patient's extubation. Operation time was defined as the time between skin incision until the latest suture. Extubation time was described as the time between the discontinuation of anesthetics and extubation. Recovery time was based on the time between extubation and discharge from recovery room using modified Alderet score.</p><p>Based on a pilot study, the difference between the mean VAS of two groups was calculated (0.8) and according to the findings, the recurred sample size for each group was calculated to be 45(a = 0.05, b = 0.2). We used independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test for quantitative variables and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for qualitative variables in SPSS software V.17 (Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All patients completed the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

It is based on the theory of prevention of central pain sensitization. This concept was described first by Crile.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Opioids have long been the mainstay for post-operative pain relief.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Many studies have shown that the peripheral local anesthetic effects of T are related to those of Codein.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>The aim of our study was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of preemptive T in treating pain after elective lower abdomen surgeries. We demonstrated that preemptive analgesia given by pre-incisional infiltration with T2 mg/kg subcutaneously, has a significant and beneficial effect on post-operative pain in the first 24 h following the operation and reduces post-operative opioid consumption in lower abdominal surgeries.</p><p>Khajavy <italic>et al</italic>. found that subcutaneous wound infiltration with T following pyelolithotomy reduces post-operative opioid consumption compared to IV administration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Ozyilmaz <italic>et al</italic>. showed that wound infiltration with combined levobupivacaine and T resulted in elimination of post-operative analgesic demand and reduction in the incidence of side effects compared with levobupivacaine or Talone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] In another study, Isiodria-Espinoza <italic>et al</italic>. have demonstrated that administration of submucous local T after impacted mandibular third molar surgery reduced analgesic consumption in comparison to placebo.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] In another study by Unlugene <italic>et al</italic>. a considerable decrease in opium consumption following T administration after major abdomen surgeries has been noted.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Altunkaya <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that the duration of post-operative analgesia provided by subcutaneous wound infiltration with T was longer in comparison with those who received lidocaine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Contrary to our findings, there are other studies that could not identify any significant difference in VAS or opium consumption following T administration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Santos <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that a difference between IV and subcutaneous T regarding the quality of analgesia was not observed during the 8 h following its administration. They compared subcutaneous and IVT 1.5 mg/kg, diluted in 100 mL of NS and administered over 5-10 min at the end of the surgical procedure (skin closure).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] A study by Hassan <italic>et al</italic>. showed that butorphanol 1 mg was more effective than T 50 mg in respect to post-operative analgesia in mandibular third molar surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Another study by deCosta Arajua <italic>et al</italic>. has noted that nimesulide and T chlorhydrate demonstrate similar preemptive analgesic effects when used in lower third molar surgeries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>We did not find any statistic difference in operation time, general anesthesia time, extubation time and recovery time between the groups, and there was no significant difference in MAP, HR, RR and SS between two groups but a significant change in total morphine consumption was noted between them. Patients who received T had less opioid consumption and the time of the first opioid requirement was longer in them.</p><p>Total dose of metoclopramide consumption and frequency of nausea and vomiting were also higher in the group who received T. Considering that the main adverse effects of Tare nausea and vomiting,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] it could be due to the systemic absorption of T after infiltration. The variable incidence of nausea and vomiting associated with T reported in the literature seems to be related to the administration route and doses used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Altunkaya <italic>et al</italic>. used 2 mg/kg of T and only one out of 20 patients developed nausea and prolonged analgesia, over 24 h of evaluation in the post-operative period of lipoma excision.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] The absence of statistically significant differences regarding the incidence of nausea and vomiting when using IV and subcutaneous T has been demonstrated.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In spite of that, Khajavy <italic>et al</italic>. found that subcutaneous T wound infiltration produces less nausea and vomiting than does IV administration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>It is also notable that the frequency of headache (another adverse effect of T) was higher in those who received T; however, all of these patients reported their headache to be mild to moderate and treated successfully with oral NSAIDs. Another study demonstrated skin rash due to histamine release after T injection,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] however, such a complication was absent in our study.</p><p>In spite of the fact that some of the patients in group T experienced adverse effects of T, there was a statistically significant difference in patients&#x02019; satisfaction between the groups. It shows that post-operative pain control is an important aspect in pre-operation patient care. Our findings were similar to results of several studies which have noted that use of analgesic agents such as T during the surgery, reduces the patients post-operative pain and post-operative need for opioids.</p><p>We didn&#x02019;t measure the serum concentrations of T and it's correlation to analgesic effect in different times.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion considering the mentioned studies, preemptive subcutaneous infiltration of T, is not only an appropriate pain relieving method for post-operative pain treatment and reduces the need for more opioid considerably but also increases patient's satisfaction following the surgery. Yet, further studies should be planned in this regard.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This study was supported by the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (IRCT number: IRCT201201162405N9).
