We conducted a cluster-randomized trial of an intervention to integrate CHWs with &#x02018;Option B+&#x02019; PMTCT services in Shinyanga Region, Tanzania.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>The intervention was implemented for 11 months and included four integrated components: 1) formal linkage of CHWs to health facilities; 2) CHW-led antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence counseling; 3) loss to follow-up tracing by CHWs; and 4) distribution of Action Birth Cards (ABCs), a birth planning tool. We cluster-randomized 32 facilities offering PMTCT services, within strata of size, to the intervention (n = 15) or comparison (standard of care, n = 17) groups. Intervention effectiveness was determined with a difference-in-differences strategy based on clinical and pharmacy data from HIV-infected postpartum women at baseline (births in 2014) and endline (births April-Oct 2015). The primary outcome was retention in care between 60 and 120 days postpartum. Secondary outcomes included ART initiation, timing of ART initiation (as measured by week of gestation), and ART adherence 90 days postpartum, measured using the medication possession ratio (MPR&#x02265;95%).</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Intervention and comparison facilities were similar at baseline. Data were collected from 1,152 and 678 mother-infant pairs at baseline and endline, respectively. There were no significant differences in retention in care, ART initiation, or timing of ART initiation between the intervention and control groups. Adherence (MPR&#x02265;95%) at 90 days postpartum was 11.3 percentage points higher in the intervention group in ITT analyses (95% CI: -0.7, 23.3, p = 0.06), though this effect was attenuated after adjusting for baseline imbalance (9.5 percentage points, 95% CI: -2.9, 22.0, p = 0.13). Among only sites that had the greatest fidelity to the intervention, however, we found a stronger effect on adherence (13.6 percentage points, 95% CI: 2.5, 24.6).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite being feasible and acceptable, the CHW-based intervention did not have strong effects on most PMTCT indicators.

Tanzania exemplifies this situation, as mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) accounted for one of every 5 new HIV infections in 2014, despite major declines in MTCT in the past decade.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Antenatal care, HIV testing, linkage to HIV care and treatment, and adherence to ART are the essential series of services to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This &#x02018;PMTCT cascade&#x02019; can reduce transmission to between 2% and 5%.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The highest risk of transmission is observed among women who missed clinic visits or dropped out of PMTCT care.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The impact of poor retention in care is most acute in settings with a high HIV burden, where a small proportion of women disengaging from care can translate to a large number of infected infants.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Despite significant improvements in the uptake of services along the cascade, retention and adherence among pregnant and postpartum women remains a significant challenge across sub-Saharan Africa. Loss to follow up (LTFU) rates differ dramatically by context, varying between 19% to close to 90% from one to six months postpartum, with the greatest loss from the cascade occurring in the first year postpartum.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The effectiveness of interventions to improve retention in care among HIV-infected pregnant women is mixed. A recent systematic review suggests evidence is generally weak, though in part due to study quality.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Furthermore, challenges retaining women in the PMTCT cascade must also be viewed in light of the broader healthcare workforce shortage that affects much of sub-Saharan Africa.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The success of Option B+ may be threatened by overburdened clinics and staff that in turn affect service distribution, quality, and the patient experience.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Consequently, paraprofessionals, like community health workers (CHWs), are emerging as key partners in the delivery and/or enhancement of health services in the community. A new and growing body of evidence supports the effectiveness of CHW task-shifting/sharing in PMTCT programs, particularly given their ability to aid with linkage to and retention in care and adherence.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The present study examines the effectiveness of one such intervention in the Tanzanian context. Tanzania is one of UNAIDS&#x02019; 22 priority countries for PMTCT support and faces health workforce scarcity; Tanzania has one physician per 125,000 people, and is among the 10 countries with the lowest density of nurses and midwives.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Approximately 12,000 CHWs provide key maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) services to women and families across the country.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] These part-time volunteer workers are elected by village councils and their community influence make them unique allies in the provision of key health services. This trial is the first of its kind to examine whether a community-level CHW intervention can improve short-term retention in care and adherence to ART among pregnant women living with HIV infection in the context of Option B+ in Tanzania.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the short-term effectiveness of a CHW intervention to improve retention in care and ART adherence for HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The intervention was implemented between May 2015 and March 2016 by Amref Health Africa in selected communities in Shinyanga Region, Tanzania. Shinyanga is a resource-constrained landlocked region in the northwest of Tanzania, where HIV prevalence is 7.4%.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The project was intended to evaluate the intervention&#x02019;s short-term effectiveness during an 18-month study period. Baseline data were collected between July and December 2015; the baseline cohort of women included HIV-infected women who were 90 days postpartum between April 1, 2014 and March 31st, 2015. Endline data were collected between January and May 2016; the endline cohort included HIV-infected women who were 90 days postpartum between July 1, 2015 and January 31, 2016. The intervention period was 11 months in length. This study was approved by the Amref Health Africa Institutional Review Board in Tanzania as well as the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California, Berkeley. The protocol for this study was pre-registered with the Registry for International Development Impact Evaluations (RIDIE, ID-552553838b402).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Community eligibility criteria</title><p>Communities were selected for the study if they were served by health facilities meeting the following criteria: 1) the provision of on-site HIV treatment and care services, including ART; 2) the provision of PMTCT services and reproductive and child health services; 3) the facility was not participating in another study or program linking CHWs to PMTCT; and 4) the facility managed a caseload of &#x02265;75 female patients on ART in 2014.

Formal linkage of CHWs to the health facility was intended to further integrate CHWs into the formal health system, and involved weekly supportive supervision meetings with facility staff to discuss caseloads and challenges. The Action Birth Card is an interactive birth planning tool that reminds women about antenatal care visits, helps them plan for delivery, and if HIV-positive, encourages them to receive necessary care. The Action Birth Card was originally developed in Zimbabwe where it has demonstrated preliminary effects on service utilization.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The study adapted the Action Birth Card to Tanzania&#x02019;s context and translated it to Kiswahili. The card was distributed to pregnant women at health facilities and in their homes during the intervention period. ART adherence counselling training was provided to all CHWs in the treatment catchment areas in April 2015, where they learned methods to support patients to overcome barriers to ART adherence. The training also included orientation to the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly, and Children (MoHCDGEC) defaulter tracking tool for health staff and CHWs. Using this tool, CHWs in intervention facilities worked with healthcare workers to identify and locate pregnant and postpartum HIV-positive women who had fallen out of antenatal and/or HIV care with the goal to re-link them back to care. Together, these four strategies were intended to integrate community-based health services delivered by CHWs with HIV prevention, treatment, and care&#x02014;bridging the gap between community and facility, and enhancing the potential benefits of Option B+.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The outcomes were measured among HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women attending facilities in study communities and were linked to the series of services on the PMTCT cascade. The primary outcome was retention in care 90 days postpartum. Retention in care was calculated both among the full sample and among women with prior evidence of HIV clinic care (i.e., women assigned an HIV clinic identification number). Women were considered retained in care at 90 days postpartum if they had an HIV clinic care visit or pharmacy refill between 60 to 120 days postpartum (inclusive).</p><p>Secondary outcomes were also measured among women attending health facilities and included: initiation of ART during pregnancy, timing of ART initiation, and ART adherence 90 days postpartum. Initiation of ART was measured as the number of HIV-infected women in the sample who had any evidence of beginning ART after pregnancy, among women without evidence of treatment prior to pregnancy (women who had initiated ART before the current pregnancy were excluded). The timing of ART initiation during pregnancy was defined by gestational week at start of ART, which was computed using standard approaches (i.e., 40 weeks prior to the date of birth or, when available, the expected delivery date based on last menstrual period). ART adherence was measured using the medication possession ratio (MPR), a pharmacy-based measure of adherence defined as the proportion of days in an interval when ART was prescribed and individuals are in possession of &#x02265;1 dose of ART (determined with pharmacy dispensing data).(22) MPR is associated with short-term virologic outcomes.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] We computed MPR overall (continuous scale) and determined the proportion of women with MPR &#x02265;95% and MPR&#x02265;80% from birth to 90 days postpartum, consistent with prior literature about the adherence threshold associated with virologic suppression.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Data collection</title><p>To examine the effectiveness of the intervention, we used a &#x02018;difference-in-differences&#x02019; approach, whereby the effect of the intervention on the outcome can be &#x02018;differenced out&#x02019; from time-constant effects.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Thus, we collected data from two cohorts of women attending both intervention and control facilities. The baseline cohort included HIV-infected women who delivered an infant between January and December 2014 (90 days postpartum April 2014 to March 2015); these women were unexposed to the intervention. The endline cohort included HIV-infected women who delivered an infant between April and October 2015 (90 days postpartum July 2015 to January 2016; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181919.g002">Fig 2</xref>); these women were both exposed and unexposed to the intervention (depending on their community&#x02019;s study arm). We extended the timeline of the baseline cohort to one year to increase sample size, but were unable to do so in the endline cohort because of the short length of the intervention. Women were considered eligible for inclusion in the study if they were identified in one of the medical registers used for sampling at the facility (described below), were HIV-positive, and had a child born in either the baseline or endline cohorts. Women in the endline cohort who attended a facility in the intervention group were exposed to the intervention for 4 to 9 months of their pregnancy and 90 days postpartum, depending on their delivery date. We hypothesized that this exposure would be the minimum effective intervention &#x02018;dose&#x02019;, given that, on average, women in Tanzania are 5.4 months pregnant at their first ANC visit when they have the initial opportunity to begin ART, if they haven&#x02019;t already.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><fig id="pone.0181919.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0181919.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Baseline and endline cohort timeline and data collection periods for the impact evaluation of a CHW-based intervention for PMTCT in Tanzania, 2014&#x02013;2015.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0181919.g002"/></fig><p>At baseline and endline, the impact evaluation team visited the 32 facilities and abstracted data from facility records. At each site, individuals were identified for inclusion through the complete enumeration of HIV-positive women meeting the inclusion criteria in facility registers. We selected all eligible women in the two cohorts, with the exception of large facilities (defined as &#x02265;50 eligible women at baseline or endline), where we selected a systematic random sample of eligible women using a pre-determined sampling fraction based on facility size (e.g., 0.75 for facilities with 51&#x02013;100 patients, inclusive, and 0.50 for facilities with 101&#x02013;200 patients). We abstracted patient-level data from various medical registers that are a central repository for patient medical information (Antenatal Care Register, Postnatal Register, etc.) as well as data from individual patient records used for HIV patient care.</p><p>In addition to the facility records, the team also collected baseline and endline facility surveys that detailed the size, area and scope of services available at each facility.

Though we checked the assumptions necessary to use a linear probability model for a binary outcome[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we additionally re-ran the analyses with a logistic regression model for the outcomes of retention in care, adherence (MPR&#x02265;95% and MPR&#x02265;80%), and ART initiation. We found that the conclusions did not significantly change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181919.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The outcome was on a continuous scale in the case of timing of ART initiation.</p><p>Secondary analyses included repeating the above analyses, adjusting for factors imbalanced at baseline, and conducting a sensitivity analysis to explore differences in treatment effect by how well the intervention was implemented. To achieve this, we created a summary score for each community that represented the average &#x0201c;fidelity&#x0201d; score associated with each of the four intervention components, using monitoring data. Thus, to measure the linkage of CHWs and health workers, we used the average number of recorded meetings between CHWs and health care workers per month at each facility. For the Action Birth Card, we used the number of cards distributed by the facility, divided by the number of HIV+ women that were recorded as visited by CHWs (to account for differing population sizes). To measure adherence counselling, we used the average number of CHW visits per woman at each site (from CHW log forms). For tracing defaulters, we used the proportion of defaulters successfully traced at the facility relative to the total number of defaulters at the site. We ranked each of these intervention component scores (from 1 to 15, 1 being the lowest rank and 15 being the highest rank) and then averaged them to create a summary score. The resulting average score across the four components was then analysed as part of a three-level treatment variable, grouped into &#x0201c;high performing&#x0201d; (above the median) sites, &#x0201c;low performing&#x0201d; (at or below the median) sites, and control sites.</p><p>All analyses were weighted by facility to account for: 1) the probability of facility selection within strata of large and small sites, 2) the probability of individual selection given the number of eligible women at each site, and 3) the response rate (number of records with adequate identifying information to connect observations across registers; 10.5% of initial baseline sample excluded).

With an ICC of 0.04 and the assumption that the intervention would increase the proportion of women who are retained in care postpartum from 67% to at least 80% (detectable effect size of 13 percentage points, or 20%), we required at least 39 observations per community to have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of no effect.

id="sec021"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study examined the short-term effectiveness of an intervention utilizing CHWs to strengthen maternal health and PMTCT services in Shinyanga, Tanzania. Our ITT and adjusted analyses revealed that the intervention did not significantly change the primary outcome of retention in care at 90 days postpartum or the secondary outcomes related to Option B+ implementation, such as ART initiation and its timing during the pregnancy. However, both the primary analyses and sensitivity analysis by intervention fidelity suggest that the intervention may have improved postpartum ART adherence, especially among women living in catchment areas where the intervention was implemented with higher intensity. In those sites, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of women achieving at least 95% MPR at 90 days postpartum, an adherence threshold associated with virologic suppression.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Although the width of the confidence intervals indicates considerable uncertainty in our estimates, if such an increase in adherence were true, it could have direct benefits on maternal health and secondary benefits on preventing MTCT during breastfeeding.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>We hypothesize that the intervention&#x02019;s effects were primarily manifested on ART adherence among women already enrolled in care and on ART because these women had already wholly or partially overcome economic and/or social obstacles to HIV care, such as transportation costs, lack of disclosure, and/or stigma associated with HIV. For these women, CHWs may have provided a motivating &#x0201c;nudge&#x0201d; to attend scheduled appointments on time, thereby improving the proportion of women with high levels of ART possession (i.e., MPR, which is influenced, by definition, with on-time pharmacy pickups). In contrast, the intervention as designed may have been unlikely to overcome significant barriers for women who were out of care at the start of the intervention or who were forced to disengage from care during their pregnancy. It is well documented, for example, that financial obstacles, lack of HIV disclosure to household members, and stigma can hinder HIV care initiation among pregnant and postpartum women in sub-Saharan Africa.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] The intervention was clearly unable to remove these obstacles, which may explain the lack of a finding on retention in care at 90 days postpartum.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous study evaluating the use of CHWs to enhance PMTCT services post-Option B+ rollout in Tanzania. We found that the intervention itself was relatively low cost as well as acceptable to facility staff, CHWs, and patients. The results agree with recent pre-Option B+ research that suggests that utilizing CHWs to implement PMTCT services is feasible,[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and can potentially aid in virologic suppression.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Importantly, CHWs can act as a &#x02018;bridge&#x02019; through which women build stronger connections to facility-based services by encouraging them to attend visits by identifying and helping to overcome barriers such as distance by arranging for women&#x02019;s transportation.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This is particularly important in the context of Tanzania&#x02019;s National Strategy for eMTCT, in which the integration of community involvement in the delivery of community eMTCT and paediatric HIV care and treatment services is a priority.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Our findings disagree, however, with data from rigorous studies reporting a connection between CHW delivery of PMTCT services and retention in care.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] This may be due to differences in the interventions themselves and/or because of a lack of statistical power in the current study. In addition, we faced several implementation challenges that may be pertinent in future CHW-based interventions, including heterogeneity in education status of the CHWs as well as a lack of CHW motivation at some sites. The lack of effect on retention in care in this study is particularly important, given the high levels of loss to follow up that have been recently found under Option B+, particularly in the first year postpartum,[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] highlighting anew the need to continue to develop effective interventions that can address this.</p><p>In addition to evaluating the intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness, this study provides evidence of temporal improvements in key outcome indicators among HIV-positive postpartum women. Retention in care, ART initiation and timing of initiation all improved significantly in the control group over time. While there is no way to be certain of the cause of such improvements, it is conceivable that this change is related to the successful adoption of Option B+ and/or other NGO programs that target MTCT. Improvements in these key points of the service cascade are encouraging and worthy of further documentation as Tanzania strives for elimination of MTCT.</p><p>This study has several limitations, including most notably imprecise effect estimates due to lack of statistical power. We anticipated <italic>a priori</italic> that, with at least 6 intervention months in each community, we could meet our sample size goal of 39 postpartum women living with HIV infection per facility, as many RCH facilities initiate an average of 11 HIV-infected women on ART per month. In reality, we found that the number of HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women per site was less than expected (on average, 34 per site), particularly at endline, where the window period for inclusion was only six months and fixed in length by the short period of evaluation mandated by the funding agency. An additional limitation is that we were only able to indirectly monitor the frequency of CHW visits through self-report log forms, which were prone to inaccuracy, due in part to the limited formal education levels of some CHWs. We also collected data retrospectively, which relies on the accuracy on clinic health records, and may therefore be prone to some error. Finally, the difference-in-difference approach assumes equal time trends among treatment and control groups, an assumption we could not verify because of the lack of pre-baseline measures. Nevertheless, we do provide evidence of baseline balance of facility-level variables indicating similarity of the groups at baseline.</p><p>This study also has significant strengths. We used a rigorous cluster-randomized design to evaluate short-term intervention effectiveness, contributing high-quality evidence in pragmatic PMTCT research. It also relies on collection of individual-level data linked across numerous medical registers (not aggregate) from study facilities to measure health outcomes. Furthermore, we used a combination intervention implemented by CHWs, which allows for cost-effective and community-sensitive service delivery in the context of workforce shortages.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>This short-term randomized trial has revealed that, while the intervention was not successful in improving retention in care or ART initiation, it may help to improve adherence. Moreover, facilities that implemented the intervention with a high quality were most successful in improving adherence. This highlights the potential benefits of the program, as well as the importance of high-quality implementation in order to ensure optimal effects. Future iterations of the program may therefore optimize impact by leveraging tools like mobile technology to better track program implementation.[<xref rid="pone.0181919.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Moreover, to more accurately delineate the effect of the intervention, we recommend a redesign of the intervention package that can more actively engage women in the community who have not yet begun vital ART services. By more closely examining both the benefits and challenges of strengthening the CHW cadre, we can work to achieve optimal health outcomes for HIV-positive women pregnant and postpartum women and their children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181919.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Difference-in-difference effect estimates of the community health worker intervention among HIV-positive pregnant and postpartum women in Tanzania using logistic regression models, stratified by treatment group, 2014-2015<sup>a</sup>.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181919.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181919.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Impact evaluation protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181919.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181919.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181919.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181919.s004"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT extension for cluster trials checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181919.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181919.s005"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Final dataset.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181919.s005.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to 3ie for the funding for this project, as well as to the study team who helped to collect data.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0181919.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">UNAIDS. 2015 Progress Report on the Global Plan Towards the Elimination Of New HIV Infections Among Children and Keeping their Mothers Alive [Internet]. 2015 [cited 6 Sep 2016].
