Similarly, in Malaysia, breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among females regardless of their ethnic groups from the age of 15&#x000a0;years onwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The National Cancer Registry (2008) reported that there are 11,952 registered female breast cancer cases, accounting for 31.3&#x000a0;% of all cancer cases registered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>A significant number of Malaysian women present with advanced stages of the breast cancer due to limited knowledge of breast cancer, breast cancer screening, and breast self-examination, which is considered as the main barrier among Malaysian women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. According to the Third National Health Morbidity Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the prevalence rate for breast examination in Malaysia was 70.35&#x000a0;%, where the highest was for breast self-examination (57.14&#x000a0;%), followed by clinical breast examination (51.77&#x000a0;%) and mammography (7.57&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Based on the results of another studies, low percentages of clinical breast examination (23.3&#x000a0;%), breast self-examination (19.6&#x000a0;%), and intention to perform breast self-examination (18.5&#x000a0;%) were observed among Malaysian women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Such results clearly show the need for awareness campaigns that raise the knowledge of young women about breast cancer and the need for the involvement of social media in promoting public breast health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Early detection of breast cancer can reduce the mortality rate and is also important for its effective treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Reportedly at an early stage (stage I-II), its 5-year survival rate reached 100&#x02013;93&#x000a0;%, whereas its later detection (stages III&#x02013;IV) decreased the survival rate to 72&#x02013;22&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Mammography, clinical breast examination, and breast self-examination are tools for early detection of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There are arguments surrounding the efficacy of BSE. Based on the large randomized trials in Shanghai, breast self-examination was not an effective screening tool for breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Likewise, the US Preventive Service Task Force and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care reported that breast self-examinations are no more beneficial for women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Although BSE alone is not sufficient for early detection of breast cancer, it is an effective tool for raising breast cancer awareness and the opportunity to educate women about breast cancer in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, the BSE training and adherence is a gateway to health promotion behavior that gives women knowledge and sets for adherence to clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography screening guideline later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Many interventions have been done to increase breast cancer screening and BSE practice among women worldwide. For instance, Beyda&#x0011f; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] evaluated the effect of BSE brochures among 103 Turkish female college students at Halic University and showed that the BSE knowledge score was 43.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.6 before education, which increased to 68.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.5 after education (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Also, they found that more than half (53.4&#x000a0;%) of the female students, who did not perform BSE, did not have any knowledge about BSE. However, there is no randomized controlled trial done to increase the awareness of breast cancer and BSE practice among young females in Malaysia. Young women believe that they are not at risk of getting breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; however, the higher stages breast cancer presented among young women were more aggressive than those of older women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>To increase breast cancer awareness among women and build their confidence in the BSE practice, we must understand what women may or may not know about breast cancer. Also, we must understand how they feel about breast cancer and its early detection, as well as the benefits and barriers of BSE practice and other screening methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. One of the most widely used conceptual frameworks, which is often used as an educational program, is the Health Belief Model (HBM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Health belief plays an important role in an individual&#x02019;s interest in the health protection behaviour, which leads to screening practices in different countries and cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this theoretical framework, women&#x02019;s breast cancer screening practices such as BSE, clinical breast examination, and mammography are influenced by their health belief model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This model emphasizes that health behaviour is affected by threats from health problems; for example, women perceiving susceptibility to breast cancer risk or believing that breast cancer is a serious disease are more likely to do the BSE practice. Women with higher health motivation, who perceive greater benefits and feel fewer barriers to breast examination, are more likely to perform BSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The model also suggests that, in addition to the health beliefs, the knowledge of BSE and sociodemographic background are positively related to the increase in the chances of performing BSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the components of health belief model and how it is implemented in this study.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Conceptual framework of study based on Health Belief Model (HBM)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3414_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Purpose</title><p>The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a Breast Health Awareness program based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) among female undergraduate students in public universities in Malaysia. We assumed that female students who participated in the Breast Health Awareness program would demonstrate significant differences in knowledge and beliefs towards breast cancer and breast self-examination practice compared to students who did not participate in the program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>A single-blinded randomized controlled trial was carried out from January 2011 until April 2012 in two selected public universities (Universiti Putra Malaysia and Universiti Teknologi MARA) in the Klang Valley in Malaysia.

Therefore, a community-oriented educational intervention which emphasizes proper techniques can bring a desirable change among women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>HBM Model</title><p>In the literature, it was reported that health education is effective in increasing the breast cancer knowledge and BSE practice. However, it is difficult and complex to achieve behavioral change. In this study, positive beliefs about benefits of BSE and confidence of doing BSE were increased after health education while beliefs related to barriers of BSE decreased. This result shows that the health education intervention was effective in terms of increasing accurate perception, providing further support for the results of the previous literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, the other components of health belief model such as perceived susceptibility to BC, seriousness of BC, and health motivation did not change over times, which is in line with studies done in Turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This may be because this study involved younger women, who believed that older women were more likely to get breast cancer; thus, they did not feel obliged to gain knowledge about breast cancer and BSE independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>The participants&#x02019; confidence level and frequency of doing BSE practice increased over time in the current study. According to Selda Secginli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and Ceber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], people with higher level of BSE knowledge have higher perceived confidence. Additionally, confidence in BSE is positively related to the frequency of BSE practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Consequently, promoting breast health awareness through educating women about breast cancer and teaching them how to practice BSE correctly is important. The health education methods which are used in this breast health awareness program, such as practice on breast silicon model and providing information about breast cancer via module may have fostered confidence of doing BSE and its benefit. The findings of this study are supported by Park [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] who reported that women&#x02019;s confidence in performing proper BSE was improved by teaching breast awareness and BSE.</p><p>The significant difference in mean scores of perceived benefits of BSE after training in the intervention group agrees with the results of the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Perceived benefits of a behavior are indicative of the person&#x02019;s understanding of benefits gained from conducting a behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The more people understand the benefits of a preventive behavior, the more they have that behaviour.</p><p>Another studied psychological factor is perceived barriers, which points out the person&#x02019;s perception of intrinsic and extrinsic obstacles in performing a behaviour. Significant differences between groups were found in line with studies done in Turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and Iran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of this study include the use of RCT, adequate sample size, low attrition rate, appropriate statistical tests and its generalizability to the college and university students in Malaysia. To the best of our knowledge, before this study no previous research is available on RCT among young female students in Malaysia; consequently, the result of this study can be used as the foundamental data for further study. Along with the numerous strengths, our study had some limitations. First of all, the result of this study cannot be generalized among all young women in Malaysia, because it focused on young educated women and was only done in public universities. It is suggested that future intervention studies should be extended to different parts and workplaces in Malaysia and among low-literate rather than educated women. Another limitation of this study is that all collected data were self-reported with no objective measures to evaluate the women. In this study, researchers did not implement any education program for the control group until the end of study. Nonetheless, the control group may have been exposed to other information sources, such as media, printed material and any campaign for breast cancer provided by the Ministry of Health during the study period which could not be controlled. In this study, although BSE practice was significantly improved after the intervention, the change was in a small number, indicating future studies should find the barriers of BSE practice and use others methods of intervention, like social media, which is more attractive for this particular group of participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Implication for practice</title><p>Although there is no evidence that BSE lowers mortality from breast cancer, it should not be promoted to detect breast cancer tumors in women effectively. Women are at risk of harm from BSE including unnecessary breast biopsies, imaging tests and emotional duress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p>Breast self-examination (BSE) might still be an important tool to improve breast awareness. Women are encouraged to take responsibility for their own health by examining themselves during bathing or dressing and to become familiar with their breasts at different times of the month and with age, looking and feeling for any changes from normal, and reporting any obvious changes promptly. Therefore, appropriate educational interventions are needed to encourage women to engage in regular breast awareness as well as to practice BSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current study demonstrates that the Breast Health Awareness program which comprised of health education materials and training of the BSE practice, was effective in increasing knowledge about breast cancer, BSE and BSE practice of the female students in the intervention group. Consequently, the Breast Health Awareness program may be appropriate for future samples with similar demographic characteristics to improve BSE in the low-resource area in Malaysia. It is also important to provide information and raise awareness about breast cancer and BSE practice among Malaysian females by the health care providers. In order to make Breast Self Examination a habit, education about breast self-examination should be started for girls at school age.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CBE, clinical breast examination; BSE, breast self-examination; BC, breast cancer; HBM, health belief model; RCT, randomized control trial, CVI, content validity index; ICC, intra-class correlation coefficient</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the participants of the study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was funded by the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF), Universiti Putra Malaysia, Grant #GS23943.
