Cognitive impairments represent considerable burden and can be devastating for people and families affected by HD. Computerised cognitive training interventions that focus on improving executive function present a possible non-pharmacological treatment option. We propose to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriate outcome measures for use in a randomised controlled feasibility study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">Participants will be randomised into either a computerised cognitive training group or a control group. Those randomised to the training group will be asked to complete a cognitive training intervention based on the HappyNeuron Pro software tasks of executive function, for a minimum of 30&#x000a0;min, three times a week for the 12-week study duration. Participants in the control group will not receive computerised cognitive training but will receive a similar degree of social interaction via equivalent study and home visits. We will explore quantitative outcome measures, including measures of cognitive performance, motor function, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures in a subset of participants. Feasibility will be determined through assessment of recruitment, retention, adherence and acceptability of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The results of this study will provide crucial guidance and information regarding the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled study into computerised cognitive training in HD. This study is crucial for the development of larger definitive randomised controlled trials which are powered to determine efficacy and for the development of future cognitive training programmes for people affected by HD.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">The study is registered on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> and has the unique identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02990676">NCT02990676</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Huntington&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>Cognition</kwd><kwd>Computerised cognitive training</kwd><kwd>Feasibility study</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Welsh Government through Health and Care Research Wales</institution></funding-source><award-id>1152-HF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yhnell</surname><given-names>Emma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Jacques und Gloria Gossweiler-Stiftung (CH)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background and rationale</title><p id="Par28">Huntington&#x02019;s disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat trinucleotide expansion within the first exon of the <italic>huntingtin</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and it causes a range of symptoms including motor, cognitive and psychiatric disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These disease symptoms significantly affect daily activities, independence and quality of life, even during the early stages of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Cognitive dysfunctions early in the HD disease process have been well documented and can include specific problems with attention, cognitive flexibility and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, cognitive training interventions, which focus on tasks that require executive function, present a potentially exciting non-pharmacological treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases including HD. Studies in HD mice have previously demonstrated executive function impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and subsequent studies have shown that cognitive training can benefit HD mice and modify the associated cognitive and motor disease symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These results provide important &#x02018;proof of principle&#x02019; evidence that an early cognitive training intervention may be beneficial in HD.</p><p id="Par29">Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence in both healthy and clinical populations that cognitive training, via repeatedly conducting tasks that require specific aspects of executive function such as attention, reasoning, dual tasking and memory, can improve cognitive functions in the trained domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For instance, computerised cognitive training on such tasks has been found to improve cognitive impairments in Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In addition, a recent single arm feasibility study demonstrated the feasibility of and adherence to working memory training on the Cogmed QM programme in a small sample of HD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, previous studies have found that training-related changes are associated with alterations in white matter, particularly with regard to altered myelination in both healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and HD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, we intend to use MRI measures to explore the potential neural mechanisms which may be associated with computerised cognitive training in the HD clinical population.</p><p id="Par30">The utilisation of computerised cognitive training strategies may provide several advantages over repeating practical tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Computerised cognitive training strategies are automated and often provide adaptive difficulty levels based on participant performance. Furthermore, they can be completed by participants at their convenience, they provide automated tasks which require comparatively little demand on motor function and they provide several objective outcome measures which can be used to detect subtle changes in function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, the HappyNeuron cognitive training software, that we intend to use in this study, can be made available in different languages to allow for consistent training globally, and it provides an interface for the researcher to observe the progress of participants.</p><p id="Par31">Despite this, computerised cognitive training interventions are yet to be extensively investigated in the HD clinical population. Therefore, this feasibility study will clarify key uncertainties regarding the study design, participant eligibility and willingness of potential participants to consent to the study and be randomised as well as recruitment, retention and acceptability. It will also facilitate the evaluation of outcome measures and an estimation of effect of the intervention. This study is a necessary step before proceeding to a fully powered efficacy trial in the HD patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p id="Par32">The primary aim of this study is to determine if computerised cognitive training is feasible and acceptable for people with HD in the setting of a randomised controlled study.

No data, whether paper or electronic, will leave the Cardiff University site without being completely anonymised. At the conclusion of the study, patient identifiable data will be destroyed and non-identifiable data will be archived for 15&#x000a0;years, in line with Cardiff University policies. Anonymised data may be shared with researchers at Cardiff University and with other research organisations in the UK; it may also be made publicly available for future research use or shared with the organisations who are funding the study. In the case of the data generated using HappyNeuron systems, these data are captured centrally and are therefore subject to HappyNeuron&#x02019;s policies and procedures. All participant identification and referral procedures as well as procedures for data storage, processing and management will comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. Data collected on paper forms will be stored in locked cabinets in a swipe card access-controlled building, in compliance with the guidelines set by the Cardiff University Research Governance Framework.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par76">Adherence to the proposed cognitive training intervention and any serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported alongside participant withdrawals. Summary statistics of demographics will be reported for both the control and intervention groups. Descriptive data will include an evaluation of eligibility, recruitment, retention rates and adherence to the intervention, with 95% confidence intervals. Successful adherence to the intervention will be defined as having completed 12&#x000a0;weeks of the computerised cognitive training for a minimum of three, 30-min sessions per week. This is a feasibility study; thus, an estimation of retention rates may be difficult with such as small sample size. Therefore, it is suggested that if retention rates are greater than 75%, we will consider this intervention to be feasible. If the proportion retained is less than this but greater than 65%, we will consider adjusting the intervention to increase this in future investigations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>MRI analysis</title><p id="Par77">Potential cognitive training-related changes in the microstructure of white matter pathways of the basal ganglia and motor systems will be assessed with quantitative metrics based on diffusion-weighted (fractional anisotropy, mean and radial diffusivity) and magnetization transfer-weighted MRI (macromolecular proton fraction as proxy MRI metric of axon myelin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Changes in basal ganglia volume will be investigated by extracting subcortical volumes with the FSL-FIRST pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Changes in cerebral blood flow will also be investigated across the whole brain as well as subcortical basal ganglia regions using established methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The quantitative metrics of tissue structure and blood flow will be correlated with changes in cognition to investigate training-related brain-function associations as well as measures of disease severity, including CAG repeat length, disease burden and Unified Huntington&#x02019;s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor scores, using data previously collected and stored as part of the Enroll-HD study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Semi-structured interview analyses</title><p id="Par78">Interview topics will differ slightly depending on allocation and are likely to include how the intervention is perceived/ received, expected or perceived impact on daily routine, expected or perceived impact on family members/carers, overall expectations, expected or perceived acceptability of the intervention, thoughts and views on the randomisation procedure, potential barriers to completing the intervention and general views or comments on cognitive training for people impacted by HD.</p><p id="Par79">Interviews will be transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The data set will be searched to find repeated patterns of meaning, identifying key themes and sub-themes. We will identify contradictory data, as points of contrast as well as similarities in order to understand uptake and engagement with the intervention. Double coding will be utilised to ensure data validity, reliability and integrity. Data will be managed using the qualitative coding software NVivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Monitoring</title><sec id="Sec28"><title>Data monitoring</title><p id="Par80">As this is a non-Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (non-CTIMP) feasibility study which is judged to pose minimal risk to participants, it has been judged that there is no formal need for a DMC. However, the Chief Investigator (CI) will produce regular data monitoring reports to the Centre for Trials Research (CTR) advisory board. The board will assess the data quality and monitor this throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Harms</title><p id="Par81">The safety of the proposed cognitive training intervention will be monitored throughout the feasibility study by recording of all adverse events (AE). Based on the use of this cognitive intervention programme in a similar patient population with other neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], we do not anticipate any serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the intervention. However, safety will be monitored throughout and any AEs or SAEs will be recorded using a standard template and reported in line with standard operating procedures and research ethics committee requirements. If, in the opinion of the CI, the SAE was related to the administration of any of the research procedures and was an unexpected occurrence, the CI will report this to the REC within 15&#x000a0;days of becoming aware of the event. If the clinician responsible for the clinical care of participants deems that it is clinically necessary to stop the intervention, the participant will be withdrawn from the intervention. However, the participant will still be invited to complete the outcome assessments. Relapse, worsening of symptoms of HD, death due to HD and hospitalisations for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition will not be reported as SAEs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>MRI and incidental findings</title><p id="Par82">MRI scanning at 3 Tesla is a well-established and non-invasive technique for imaging the body and the brain using strong magnetic fields and low-energy radio waves. It does not involve the use of radiation. All persons entering the scanning room are screened for ferromagnetic materials or other factors which cause risk in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The scanner creates significant noise during the scan, which is minimised using earplugs. Verbal contact will be maintained between the MRI operators and the participant through the use of intercom, and a call button will be given to the participant to enable them to stop the scanning procedure at any time. A few people have reported minor side effects during MRI scanning including dizziness, mild nausea, a metallic taste in the mouth, peripheral nerve stimulation and the sensation of seeing flashing lights. These side effects, if experienced, resolve after leaving the magnet, and participants will be informed in the participant information sheet (PIS) of the MRI scanning session of these rare side effects. Some people find being inside an MR scanner claustrophobic; thus, in addition to the 3 Tesla MR machine, CUBRIC also has a &#x02018;mock&#x02019; scanner that reproduces, as far as possible, the look and feel of the real MR machine, but without the presence of a magnetic field. Participants will be given the opportunity to lie in this &#x02018;mock&#x02019; scanner to acclimatise in advance of the real MRI scan session. If the participant finds the experience in either scanner unpleasant, then he/she would be removed from the scanner.</p><p id="Par83">In some circumstances, changes in the magnetic field within the MRI scanner could make an electric current flow through some of the volunteer&#x02019;s body, causing peripheral nerve stimulation; this is very rare for the 3 Tesla MRI scanner and not harmful but may be uncomfortable. If two parts of the volunteer&#x02019;s body were touching (for instance legs crossed), then in very rare occasions, it is possible that an induced current may cause skin heating. Volunteers are instructed to lie with their arms to their sides and legs uncrossed, which stops this from happening. Participants will be informed that CUBRIC is a research centre and therefore cannot provide clinical diagnoses; acquired images of the brain are used for specific research purposes only and not suitable for diagnosis of pathology. However, although the pictures are not diagnostic scans, in the unlikely event of a structural abnormality being noted incidentally, a neuro-radiologist would be asked to review the scan and the clinical lead of the study will be informed. The participant&#x02019;s general practitioner (GP) will then be notified by the neurologist. There may be a need for the GP to arrange for a formal diagnostic scan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Auditing</title><p id="Par84">The study is subject to inspection by The Jacque and Gloria Gossweiler Foundation and Health and Care Research Wales as the funding organisations.

During this study, as well as capturing participant views in qualitative semi-structured interviews, we will also aim to consider the views of family members, friends and carers in our analysis of feasibility. Family member, friend and carer involvement in the study will be crucial in determining if this intervention is feasible and able to be completed independently. This will be vital in future studies which may seek to use computerised cognitive training that is completed in participant homes.</p><p id="Par92">In this feasibility study, the proposed computerised cognitive training intervention is supported by home visits and email or telephone reminders. As a result of this, any changes in outcome measures may be attributed to social interaction. Therefore, the control participants will also receive home visits, to control for increased social interaction. Furthermore, it is possible that any observed changes may be attributed to the increased use of a computer. Whilst we have not included them in this in this study, should feasibility be established in future trials, it may be prudent to include additional control groups to explore the generalised effect of computer use in this patient population. Additional control groups could also be considered to explore the effect of home visits, reminders and support provided to participants.</p><p id="Par93">The primary aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled, computerised cognitive training study for people with HD. Therefore, we will explore the willingness of eligible participants to be randomised, to receive and participate in the intervention, any potential barriers to recruitment or completion and response rates and adherence to the cognitive training programme. This feasibility study has not been powered for hypotheses testing, but the data gathered will inform the design and delivery of future larger trials, including providing vital information to inform sample size estimates. Crucial inferences will be made which will allow an estimation of parameters that can inform definitive and future trials in this specific patient population.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p id="Par5">Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CF</term><def><p id="Par6">Consent form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par7">Chief Investigator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p id="Par8">Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p id="Par9">Case report forms</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTR</term><def><p id="Par10">Centre for Trials Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CUBRIC</term><def><p id="Par11">Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>fMRI</term><def><p id="Par12">Functional magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p id="Par13">General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HADS</term><def><p id="Par14">Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HD</term><def><p id="Par15">Huntington&#x02019;s disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IC</term><def><p id="Par16">Informed consent</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPAQ</term><def><p id="Par17">International Physical Activity Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBT</term><def><p id="Par18">Moneybox test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p id="Par19">Magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>non-CTIMP</term><def><p id="Par20">non-Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PIS</term><def><p id="Par21">Participant information sheet</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QTUG</term><def><p id="Par22">Quantitative timed up and go</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>REC</term><def><p id="Par23">Research ethics committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p id="Par24">Serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPIRIT</term><def><p id="Par25">Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TUG</term><def><p id="Par26">Timed up and go</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UHDRS</term><def><p id="Par27">Unified Huntington&#x02019;s Disease Rating Scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study is funded by The Jacque and Gloria Gossweiler Foundation and by the Welsh Government through Health and Care Research Wales, Health Fellowship (HF-16-1152).
