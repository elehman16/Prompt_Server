static and dynamic standing balance in obese individuals with poor standing balance.
[Subjects and Methods] Sixteen obese volunteers were randomly assigned into yoga and
control groups. The yoga training program was performed for 45 minutes per day, 3 times
per week, for 4 weeks. Static and dynamic balance were assessed in volunteers with one leg
standing and functional reach tests. Outcome measures were tested before training and
after a single week of training. Two-way repeated measure analysis of variance with
Tukey&#x02019;s honestly significant difference post hoc statistics was used to analyze the data.
[Results] Obese individuals showed significantly increased static standing balance in the
yoga training group, but there was no significant improvement of static or dynamic
standing balance in the control group after 4 weeks. In the yoga group, significant
increases in static standing balance was found after the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th weeks. Compared
with the control group, static standing balance in the yoga group was significantly
different after the 2nd week, and dynamic standing balance was significantly different
after the 4th week. [Conclusion] Yoga training would be beneficial for improving standing
balance in obese individuals with poor standing balance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Standing balance</kwd><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Yoga training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>According to the definition of &#x0201c;obesity&#x0201d; of the WHO<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, obesity is classified as a body mass index (BMI) equal or greater
than 30&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. However, the WHO criteria for obesity classification might not be
appropriate for classifying obesity in the Asian population considering the differences in
body composition between individuals of different ethnicities. Therefore, the Regional
Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO) standard was used as an alternative obesity
classification for Asian people<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
According to the WPRO standard, obesity is defined as a BMI equal or greater than
25&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In Thailand, the number of individuals with obesity is increasing for
all ages and genders as well as the incidence in other countries of the world<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Obese individuals are at risk of several
noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and
hypertension<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and there is an increased
risk of falling associated with obesity<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
It has been demonstrated that obese individuals have poor postural control and balance when
compared with nonobese individuals<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
2009, Singh et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> revealed that obese
individuals showed increased postural sway while standing compared with individuals with
normal weights. Hence, obese individuals would be at risk of falling, and it would be
interesting to determine if there are any effective treatments to prevent falling in obese
individuals.</p><p>Yoga training has been known as an exercise protocol that combines the practice of
physical, mental, and spiritual components<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The advantages of yoga training have been studied widely, and one
of the advantages is improvement of balance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In 2010, Schmid et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated the
effects of 12 weeks of yoga training on balance in the elderly and found a significant
increase in balance after training. Also in 2010, Telles et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the effect of a short course of yoga training with
diet control on health status in obesity. They reported a significant improvment in static
postural stability while standing in obese individuals after 6 days of training. However, a
longer duration of yoga training may be more beneficial in improving standing balance in
obese individuals, and the effects of yoga training on balance should be investigated under
both static and dynamic conditions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate
the effect of 4 weeks of yoga training on static and dynamic standing balance in obese
individuals with poor postural control. The subjects were obese volunteers aged 18&#x02013;35 years
from Phitsanulok Province, Thailand.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Obese volunteers who met the inclusion criteria were recruited into this study. All
subjects were obese with a BMI of 25&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or more and had poor standing balance
as demonstrated by only being able to stand on a single leg with the eyes open for less than
30 seconds<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The volunteers had no
medical history of serious injury or operative treatment and had no musculoskeletal,
neurological, visual or vestibular problems leading to balance disturbance. After completing
an informed consent form, blood pressure, weight, height, and body mass index of the
volunteers were measured.

functional reach tests. Static standing balance was tested with one leg standing under the
eyes open and eyes closed conditions<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Standing still for longer periods of time represents better static standing balance. The
functional reach test<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> was used to
investigate dynamic standing balance by determining the farthest distance subjects could
possibly reach forward.</p><p>Volunteers were randomly assigned into yoga training and control groups. In the yoga
training group, obese volunteers performed yoga exercise for 4 weeks. The yoga training used
in this study consisted of Hatha yoga, in which asana (posture) and pranayama (breathing)
are essential components of training<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Both physical and mental awareness were emphasized during the practice of yoga postures. The
yoga postures in the current study consisted of consecutive 8 yoga postures. The yoga
postures were purposefully selected to improve standing balance. The yoga training initially
started with breathing control training for a few minutes. The subjects were then instructed
to perform the 8 consecutive yoga postures, including the Tree, Eagle, Warrior, Triangle,
One leg T-standing, Sailboat, Applied Dancing, and Knee to Chest postures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Examples of the 8 yoga postures</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-059-g001"/></fig>). Each posture was slowly performed and maintained for approximately 15&#x02013;30 seconds,
and each was performed twice. Lastly, a relaxation technique in the supine lying position
was applied for at least 5 minutes before finishing the training program. The total duration
of the yoga training was approximately 45 minutes. The yoga training in this study was
supervised by a skilled yoga trainer.</p><p>In the control group, obese volunteers were asked to maintain their usual physical activity
level for 4 weeks and to not participate in any exercise programs. The studied parameters,
including standing times during one leg standing (OLS) with the eyes open and eyes closed
and the forward reach distance from the functional reach test (FRT) were measured every
single week at the end of the training session in both the yoga training and control groups.
The studied parameters for both one leg standing and the functional reach test were measured
by the same testers, who had been verified to have high intrarater reliabilities (tester 1
for one leg standing, ICC 3, 1 = 0.97; tester 2 for the functional reach test, ICC 3, 1 =
0.98). To identify the representative data of each subject, 3 trials of OLS and FRT were
averaged and used as representative data for each subject. The procedures used in this study
were approved by the Naresuan University Institutional Review Board. All subjects were asked
to read a participant information sheet and to then sign an informed consent form. All
testing procedures were performed at the Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Naresuan
University.</p><p>The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the data distribution. The differences in subjects&#x02019;
characteristics between the yoga training and control groups were determined with the
unpaired Student&#x02019;s t-test. Two-way (group &#x000d7; time) repeated measure analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with Tukey&#x02019;s honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc analysis was used to
determine the differences in static and dynamic standing balance between the yoga training
and control groups. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical software

diseases<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, a greater risk of
falling<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and poor postural control and
balance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Much of the research cited in
the review article of Del Porto et al. in 2012<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> revealed that obese individuals have limited postural stability
control due to improper biomechanics of stability control including body segment
orientation, muscle work, and posture. Moreover, obese individuals need to exert more effort
in recovering balance when their posture is perturbed.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of yoga training on static and dynamic
standing balance in obese individuals. Obese individuals who have poor one leg standing
balance were recruited into the current study. All of the obese individuals were asked to
maintain their physical activity level during the study. The results demonstrated no
significant differences in subjects&#x02019; characteristics between groups. Therefore, it could be
stated from the results that the changes in static and dynamic standing balance in the yoga
training group resulted from the yoga training. Regarding the results showing increased
static and dynamic standing times during OLS under the eyes open and eyes closed conditions
in the yoga training group beginning in the 2nd week of yoga training, they may indicate
that yoga training improves static standing balance in obese individuals with poor postural
control. These outcomes may be the result of improved muscular strength of the trunk and
legs induced by yoga training<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
postures used in yoga training were similar to those used in balance testing protocols.
Therefore, this would help to promote specific muscular adaptations of the trunk and lower
extremities, enabling better performance in the static and dynamic standing balance tests
after 4 weeks of training.</p><p>The yoga training program was only 4 weeks long; however, this is possibly long enough to
induce neuromuscular adaptation to improve standing balance<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> as shown in the OLS tests. To control single leg standing within
the base of support with no extraneous force disturbing the balance, trunk, hip, knee, and
ankle muscles were co-contracted to maintain single leg standing balance through a
neuromuscular control strategy<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the
other hand, dynamic standing balance requires a more complex strategy than static postural
control. During the functional reach test, the body maintains dynamic standing balance using
hip, knee, and ankle strategies to control the center of gravity within the base of support.
This requires more recruitment of trunk and leg muscles. The dynamic standing balance
ability was observed at the end of the 4 weeks in the yoga training group and compared with
that of the control group. The results might indicate that the duration of yoga training
should be longer than 4 weeks in order to apparently improve the dynamic standing balance in
obese individuals.</p><p>The limitations of this study were that the age range of the recruited obese volunteers was
narrow, only between 21&#x02013;25 years, and that the body mass indexes of almost all the obese
volunteers classified them as class 1 obese individuals only<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The duration of the yoga training program was only 4 weeks in the
current study, so improvement of dynamic standing balance might not have been clearly seen
in the current study. Therefore, future studies should use a longer duration for the yoga
training program and recruit subjects classified as having various degrees of obesity.</p><p>In conclusion, static standing balance was increased in obese volunteers with poor postural
control after participating in the yoga training program for 4 weeks, and yoga training may
be helpful for preventing falls in obese individuals with poor postural control.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was funded by the Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Naresuan University,
