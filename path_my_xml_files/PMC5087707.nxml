PDSS is believed to be associated with vessel injury during the injection process, resulting in accidental intravascular entry of a portion of the dose. Because olanzapine LAI is a salt-based formulation, it is more soluble in blood than in muscle tissue, resulting in symptoms consistent with olanzapine intoxication, particularly excessive sedation (which could include coma) and/or delirium.<xref rid="b2-ndt-12-2737" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-ndt-12-2737" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The identification of PDSS ultimately resulted in the European label for olanzapine LAI having a risk minimization plan associated with it, the key elements being a 3-hour observation period and for patients to be accompanied home at the end of this 3-hour time period.<xref rid="b3-ndt-12-2737" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In 2013, the European Medicines Agency announced that the safety signal of olanzapine LAI was sufficient to warrant the removal of the requirement of patients to be accompanied home, but the mandatory stipulation of the 3-hour observation period still remains.<xref rid="b3-ndt-12-2737" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b5-ndt-12-2737" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The objective of the present analysis was to determine the impact of the 3-hour observation period on patient satisfaction and well-being by comparing data collected before and after its implementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and design</title><p>This is a post hoc analysis of data from two studies. Study F1D-MC-HGKA was a maintenance study in which patients (18&#x02013;75 years of age) with schizophrenia were stabilized on oral olanzapine for 4&#x02013;8 weeks and then randomized to 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with olanzapine LAI (150 mg every 2 weeks, 405 mg every 4 weeks, 300 mg every 2 weeks, or 45 mg every 4 weeks [total N=743]) or their stable oral olanzapine dose (N=322).<xref rid="b6-ndt-12-2737" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Study F1D-MC-HGKB was a 6-year, single-arm, open-label Phase III study of olanzapine LAI in patients (18&#x02013;76 years of age; N=931) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder from three feeder studies (F1D-MC-HGJZ, F1D-MC-HGKA, and F1D-EW-LOBS).<xref rid="b7-ndt-12-2737" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In that study, patients received 210 mg olanzapine LAI at the first open-label visit. Patients received doses between 45 mg and 405 mg of olanzapine LAI at 2-week, 3-week, or 4-week intervals. Dosing after the first visit was determined on the basis of the investigators&#x02019; clinical judgment.</p><p>The studies were conducted in accordance with ethics principles derived from international ethics guidelines, including the Declaration of Helsinki and the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCP) Guideline, and applicable laws and regulations.

Patients who received oral olanzapine supplementation and who had a total daily dose of &#x0003e;20 mg/d oral olanzapine equivalent were also excluded. This patient population (N=966) was used in the calculation of the rate of PDSS events. For the analysis of patient satisfaction and well-being, the patient population was further refined to include only those patients who received both 1) at least one injection before the implementation of the 3-hour observation period and 2) at least one injection with the 3-hour observation period (N=487).</p></sec><sec><title>Scales and measures</title><p>All questionnaires and assessments (except the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity [CGI-S]) were completed every 6 months.</p><p>Patient satisfaction was assessed with the three-item Patient Satisfaction with Medication Questionnaire-Modified (PSMQ-Mod): satisfaction with current depot medication, preference between current depot medication and previous oral medications, and comparison of side effects between current depot medication and previous oral medications. The PSMQ-Mod uses a 5-point scale, with 5 representing highest satisfaction/preference for olanzapine LAI on the first two items and a score of 1 representing fewer side effects with olanzapine LAI on the third item.<xref rid="b9-ndt-12-2737" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Patient well-being was assessed with the Subjective Well-Being Under Neuroleptics Scale-Short Form (SWNS).

The total score of the scale is the sum of 21 items, with each item being rated on a 7-point scale. Four categories contained in the scale are intrapsychic foundations (items 13&#x02013;17 and 20 and 21), interpersonal relations (items 1&#x02013;8), instrumental role (items 9&#x02013;12), and common objects and activities (items 18 and 19), with higher scores indicating less impairment.<xref rid="b12-ndt-12-2737" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used to evaluate the symptoms of schizophrenia.

Of these 966 patients, the present analysis further focused on those patients (n=487) who received at least one injection before the implementation of the 3-hour observation period and at least one injection with the 3-hour observation period. The mean (SD) age of these patients was 38.2 (11.75) years, with most patients being male (66.3%) and Caucasian (67.1%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ndt-12-2737">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Among patients who were treated both before and after implementation of the 3-hour observation period, there was no meaningful change in their satisfaction with olanzapine LAI (before: mean [SD] =4.0 [1.02] and after: mean [SD] =4.1 [0.82]), preference for olanzapine LAI over oral medication (before: mean [SD] =4.0 [0.90] and after: mean [SD] =4.1 [0.77]), or ratings of satisfaction regarding side effects (before: mean [SD] =1.9 [0.79] and after: mean [SD] =1.8 [0.60]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ndt-12-2737">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Total scores on the SWNS were similar before and after implementation of the 3-hour observation period (before: mean [SD] =87.8 [14.28] and after: mean [SD] =88.6 [13.14]).

Similar results were reported in the subscale scores of the QoL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ndt-12-2737">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The PANSS total score, as well as the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology subscale scores, was similar before and after implementation of the 3-hour observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ndt-12-2737">Figure 5</xref>).

The percentage of injections resulting in PDSS events was similar before (10/13, 660=0.07%) and after (16/24, 350=0.07%) implementation of the 3-hour observation period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>On measures of patient satisfaction, well-being, health, QoL, and symptoms of schizophrenia, we found no evidence of an effect of the 3-hour observation period. On each measure, scores were only slightly different before and after implementation of the 3-hour observation period. Also, as expected, the percentage of injections resulting in a PDSS event was essentially the same before and after implementation of the 3-hour observation period. The percentage of PDSS events that occurred following injections with olanzapine LAI in this patient sample is similar to that previously reported (&#x0003c;0.1%).<xref rid="b5-ndt-12-2737" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>It should also be noted that, overall, these patients had relatively low symptom levels, as patients were generally clinically stable when they began treatment with olanzapine LAI in this clinical study. This is evident by their responses on the PANSS and CGI-S and supported by their responses on the SWNS, SF-36, and QoL scale.</p><p>Overall, on the PSMQ-Mod, the mean responses both before and after implementation indicated that patients experienced less side effects with olanzapine LAI and preferred olanzapine LAI compared to their oral medication and that they were satisfied with olanzapine LAI. As expected, these results agree with a previous report (from a largely overlapping patient sample), indicating that 73.7% of patients being treated with olanzapine LAI were somewhat or very satisfied with their medication, 69.5% preferred or much preferred olanzapine LAI versus previous oral medications, and 74.2% thought that olanzapine LAI was associated with &#x0201c;less&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;much less side effects&#x0201d;.<xref rid="b15-ndt-12-2737" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Though it might not be expected that measures of efficacy and well-being would be affected by the 3-hour observation period, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the initiation of a 3-hour observation period would result in a decrease in satisfaction among olanzapine LAI patients because of the potential resulting inconvenience and interruption of daily routine. However, if this effect is influencing scores at all, it is counterbalanced by other factors. For example, one might expect scores to improve somewhat during the course of an open-label study as some patients continue to improve with treatment and others do not do as well and drop out. However, there is a less obvious possibility. Anecdotal evidence suggests that patients may find that additional time with their mental health care team may be a positive experience for them. Naber<xref rid="b16-ndt-12-2737" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> suggests that positive benefits (eg, patient acceptance and better therapeutic relationship) may result from regular contact with their health care providers. Indeed, the 3-hour observation period could well be further utilized by offering psychotherapy or psychoeducation.<xref rid="b17-ndt-12-2737" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>There are a few limitations of this analysis that should be recognized. First, with no a priori sample size calculation, it is unclear whether the sample of subjects used was large enough to detect a difference in our measures, if one existed. Second, our conclusions are based on interpretation of a body of descriptive statistics rather than predefined inferential tests. Third, this analysis was limited to patients with schizophrenia who were treated with olanzapine LAI consistent with the approved indication and dosing recommendations of the EU SmPC. Results that included responses of patients with schizoaffective disorder, or patients who were given supplementary oral doses of olanzapine beyond those recommended by the EU SmPC, could have been different.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>For patients with schizophrenia receiving treatment with olanzapine LAI consistent with the approved indication and dosing recommendations of the EU SmPC, the 3-hour observation period had no impact on their satisfaction with the medication and on their subjective well-being, overall health, QoL, or symptoms of schizophrenia. It is hoped that these results will help EU clinicians further define and refine how best they would like to use olanzapine LAI in treating their patients with schizophrenia, especially in keeping within the current requirements of the EU SmPC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to dedicate this publication to the memory of our coauthor and colleague, Doctor Marlene Popescu.
