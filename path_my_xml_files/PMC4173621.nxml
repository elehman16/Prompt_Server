The lower abdominal gynecological surgery is expected to produce moderate to severe post-operative pain.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The different classes of analgesics used, exert their effect through different mechanisms. Non-opioid analgesics are favored world-wide as they are devoid of opioid induced side effects and so lesser post-operative monitoring is required. A combination of analgesics from different classes may provide additive analgesic effects than a single drug.</p><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like diclofenac exert their action via inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 enzymes with relative equipotency[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] while the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of paracetamol are similar to those of the selective COX-2 inhibitors.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Intramuscular (IM) injection of diclofenac has established its role as an effective post-operative analgesic even for major surgeries.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Intravenous (IV) paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a newer agent gaining worldwide popularity in acute post-operative pain relief.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] There has been a recent trend for combining different NSAIDs with paracetamol for the management of acute post-operative pain[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] but the therapeutic superiority of any combination remains controversial.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Since the combination of diclofenac and paracetamol has not been investigated so far, we conducted this trial to compare the analgesic effects of diclofenac, paracetamol and their combination in patients undergoing lower abdominal gynecological surgeries. Our study is intended to help concerned medical personnel or institutions to formulate post-operative pain management strategies regarding the use of non-opioid analgesics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted at an Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGMER), a Teaching Hospital in West Bengal, India and was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee.</p><p>After obtaining informed consent from patients, 90 women, in the physiological group American Society of Anaesthesiologists I and II physical status, between 20 and 50 years of age, weighing 40-70 kg, with height ranging from 5 to 6 feet, with no major systemic disease, undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy of duration more than 1 h, but less than 2 h under general anesthesia were randomly allocated into three groups. Patients with any history of allergy to any of the study drugs or any relative contra-indications to study drug, were excluded from the study. If the duration of anesthesia exceeded 2 h, the cases were excluded from the study. The study was conducted from June 1 2012 to May 31 2013.</p><p>Group D received injection diclofenac 75 mg/3 ml IM in the gluteal region, Group P patients received injection paracetamol (1 g/100 ml) IV given over 15 min, and Group PD received both the drugs after starting of surgery and got repeat doses at 8 and 16 h after starting of surgery. The researcher using the different drugs did not make any further participation in the study.</p><p>The patients are observed for 24 h after starting of surgery. The observer and the patients were blinded to the type of drug used. The pain intensity was judged using a 10 point visual analog score (VAS) scale at time periods 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h after the starting of surgery. The pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, urine output, and adverse effect were noted. If a patient reported a VAS pain score of greater than 3, rescue analgesic in the form of IV tramadol 100 mg injection was given. If the patient required tramadol before 2 h from the beginning of surgery, she was excluded from our study. The need of rescue analgesic was recorded in the three groups at time periods 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h after starting surgery.</p><p>A standard anesthetic technique according to the institutional protocol was followed. The patients were premedicated with injection ranitidine 50 mg IV, injection fentanyl 2 mcg/kg IV, injection glycopyrolate 0.2 mg IV, and induced with injection propofol 2 mg/kg and injection rocuronium 0.9 mg/kg. After direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 0.5-1.5% along with nitrous oxide and oxygen in a ratio of 5:3. Injection rocuronium 0.2 mg/kg was repeated as required by using the neuromuscular monitor. Injection fentanyl was chosen deliberately as its duration of action is 30-45 min and except fentanyl, no long acting analgesic, either opioid or non-opioid was used. Reversal of muscle relaxation was achieved by injection neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg/1 mg of neostigmine. The patients were given an injection ondansetron 4 mg, just before completion of surgery and it was repeated 8 hourly over the post-operative period. The patients were observed in post-anesthesia recovery immediately after reversal and later shifted to ward as per institutional protocol.</p><p>The primary outcome of our study was the requirement of rescue analgesic in the form of injection tramadol over 24 h. The secondary outcomes measured were VAS till rescue analgesic was administered, time until first rescue analgesic request, patient satisfaction score (PSC) till rescue analgesic was given and adverse events. VAS was measured on a scale from 0 to 10 and rescue analgesic was administered at any score greater than 3. PSC was assessed using a four point rating scale (poor = 0, fair = 1, good = 2 and excellent = 3).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We calculated our sample size on the assumption of a standard deviation (SD) of 0.6 of the expected difference from previous studies, with a power of &#x0003e;80% to detect this difference, using the Tukey-Kramer's all pair comparison with type I error (&#x003b1;) of &#x0003c;5%.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which has compared the use of parenteral paracetamol and diclofenac and their combination together.</p><p>The mechanism of action of diclofenac goes beyond COX inhibition and includes inhibition of thromboxane-prostanoid receptor, affecting arachidonic acid release and uptake, inhibition of lipoxygenase enzymes and activation of the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate anti-nociceptive pathway.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Whereas, action of paracetamol is due to inhibition of COX-2-dependent pathways that are proceeding at low rates. The analgesic effect of paracetamol is central and is due to activation of descending serotonergic pathways, but its primary action may be inhibition of PG synthesis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In our study, in the diclofenac group and the combination of paracetamol and diclofenac group, the requirement of rescue analgesic was significantly lower compared to paracetamol alone group. The combined group was not superior to diclofenac alone, indicating that the combination does not result in an additional benefit in aspect of post-operative analgesia. Regarding the secondary outcomes, the VAS scores, time since first rescue analgesic requirement and PSC were comparable between the groups.</p><p>Hynes <italic>et al</italic>, in their study of 120 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty, compared 2 doses of 1g intravenous proparacetamol and 75 mg intramascular diclofenac and found no significant difference over the 10 hour study period.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Tuzuner <italic>et al</italic>, studied the effect of 1 g intravenous paracetamol, 75 mg intramascular diclofenac and 8 mg intravenous lornoxicam in 60 patients undergoing surgical removal of third molar and found the pain scores to be comparable in all the groups.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] 30 patients undergoing bimaxillary osteotomy were given 1 g paracetamol intravenously and 75 mg diclofenac intramuscularly, by Oncul <italic>et al</italic>, and the intensity of post operative pain was comparable in both the groups.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] A study by Munishanker <italic>et al</italic>, where 78 patients undergoing elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were given oral paracetamol, diclofenac or a combination of both and morphine as rescue analgesic, found the combination group used 38% less morphine than the paracetamol group.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Hyllested <italic>et al</italic>, in their review article commented that further studies are required to come to a conclusion that whether addition of paracetamol to NSAID is helpful with no potential of increased side effects from their combined use.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study, in patients undergoing lower abdominal gynaecological surgery, we found that Intramuscular Diclofenac appears to be a superior post-operative analgesic compared to intravenous paracetamol, in terms of rescue analgesic requirements (20% vs 50% respectively).</p><p>Diclofenac IM may be a better analgesic option if no relative or absolute contra-indications to its use exist and paracetamol IV may be considered in patients where its relative safety profile is of importance. Combination is not favored as it may increase side effects and cost and with no additional benefit. However further research works with larger sample size are suggested to draw definitive conclusions and influence formulation of post-operative pain management strategy.</p><p>Limitations of this study are the following:</p><p>
