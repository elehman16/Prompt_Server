Unfortunately, there is no definite treatment for this disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Despite self-healing nature of this disease, the scar that remains due to the disease can induce many psychosocial problems for patients. Cutaneous leishmaniasis scar is an atrophic scar that is formed due to dermal atrophy and destruction of collagen following acute inflammatory reaction.</p><p>It is shown that application of 65 and 100% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) can be used for the treatment of atrophic acne scars.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>One of the other methods that are used extensively for treatment of the atrophic scars, such as those formed due to acne or chicken pox, is high-energy pulsed or scanned CO<sub>2</sub> laser that can abrade epidermis in one pass.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>In one study that was performed in 30 patients with acne scar, chicken pox scar and atrophic scar due to heart surgery, 60% improvement in scar appearance was observed following short-pulse and continuous CO<sub>2</sub> laser.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Although CO<sub>2</sub> laser can effectively repair the atrophic scars, some side effects the treatment causes, such as prolonged healing time, resistant erythema and hypopigmentation in 20% of treated cases, should also be considered.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>We designed the following study to evaluate the effect of focal peeling with TCA versus CO<sub>2</sub> laser in treatment of leishmaniasis scar.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial that was performed in 92 patients, aged 18&#x02013;50 years, with atrophic leishmaniasis scar.

For 50% TCA application, the scar site was first defatted with acetone and then 50% TCA was applied to the scar site using cotton applicator. After whitening of the scar, the acid was neutralized using water and petrolatum was then applied. Patients were then instructed to apply sunscreen at the morning and noon and hydroquinone 4% cream at the nights.</p><p>This treatment was performed in monthly intervals and for a maximum of five times. Patients were followed every 2 weeks for 3 months and then at 6 months after starting the treatment.</p><p>For CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment, continuous wave CO<sub>2</sub> laser, 10,600 nm, 3-mm spot size, fluence 5 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1&#x02013;3 passes, based on depth of the scar was performed. CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment was performed only one time and the patients were followed at the start, 3 and 6 months after starting the treatment.
