An excisional biopsy such as a cold knife cone biopsy (CKC) should be performed to exclude invasive adenocarcinoma. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is an alternative modality to CKC but is controversial in AIS. There is a perception that there is a greater likelihood of incomplete excision of AIS with LEEP because the depth of excised tissue tends to be smaller and the tissue margins may show thermal artefact which can interfere with pathology assessment. In the USA, guidelines recommend that any treatment modality can be used to excise AIS, provided that the specimen remains intact with interpretable margins. However, there are no high-quality studies comparing LEEP with CKC and well-designed prospective studies are needed. If such a study were to show that LEEP was non-inferior to CKC for the outcomes of post-treatment persistence, recurrence and adenocarcinoma, LEEP could be recommended as an appropriate treatment option for AIS in selected patients. This would benefit women because, unlike CKC, LEEP does not require general anaesthesia and may be associated with reduced morbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The proposed exploratory study is a parallel group trial with an allocation ratio of 2:1 in favour of the intervention (LEEP: CKC).

Single-specimen excision biopsies with minimal thermal damage or disruption of resection margins are essential for accurate histopathological assessment. A comprehensive review of the Australian 2005 National Cervical Screening Programme (NCSP) guidelines<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> has recommended that &#x02018;cold-knife cone biopsy should be considered the "gold standard" for the diagnostic assessment of glandular lesions. However, a diathermy excisional procedure may be appropriate in some circumstances and could provide an appropriate surgical specimen when performed by a gynaecologist with appropriate training, experience and expertise&#x02019;.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There is a perception that there is a greater likelihood of incomplete excision with loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) because the depth of excised tissue and the overall dimensions of the specimen tend to be smaller in comparison to CKC. It is also argued that the tissue margins in a LEEP biopsy may show significant thermal artefact, which can interfere with the pathological assessment of biopsy margins.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> Some studies have shown a greater risk of a positive endocervical margin with LEEP but these have included cases in which AIS was not suspected prior to the excisional procedure.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> However, current American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology consensus guidelines recommend that any treatment modality can be used for diagnostic excision, provided that the specimen remains intact with interpretable margins and that there is no fragmentation, including &#x02018;top-hat&#x02019; serial endocervical excisions.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Conservative treatment of women with AIS by CKC or LEEP is also controversial because AIS may co-exist with cervical adenocarcinoma<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and hence total hysterectomy has been regarded as definitive management.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, CKC and LEEP present fertility-preserving alternatives to hysterectomy in women of reproductive age in whom AIS is prevalent.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref></p><p>Positive or close histopathological margins have been associated with an increased risk of AIS persistence and recurrence.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A 2014 systematic review<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> reported higher rates of incomplete excision with LEEP (51%) than with CKC (30%) or laser cone (28%) using pooled data and reported rates of recurrence of AIS ranging from 9% to 29%&#x02009;after LEEP and from 6% to 11%&#x02009;after CKC. This review concluded that LEEP had acceptable safety and was comparable to CKC when negative margins were achieved, and is associated with better obstetric outcomes.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that CKC and LEEP are associated with similar rates of positive margins and recurrent AIS.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Advantages of LEEP compared with CKC include the ability to perform the procedure under local anaesthesia in an outpatient setting and lower morbidity, including adverse obstetric outcomes.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref></p><p>There are no prospective randomised studies of AIS treatment to inform clinical practice. More recent retrospective studies have found similar recurrence and persistence rates for LEEP and CKC.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> The absence of prospective randomised studies has recently been highlighted by Cancer Council Australia&#x02019;s working party draft clinical management guidelines for the prevention of cervical cancer.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There is a clear need for prospective randomised clinical trials to determine whether LEEP is associated with similar histopathological and clinical outcomes when compared with CKC in the investigation and management of cervical AIS.</p><p>The Cancer Council Australia Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines Working Party argued that &#x02018;Well-designed prospective research studies are needed to compare the use of cold knife cone biopsy with diathermy loop excision (LEEP or LLETZ) in the diagnosis and treatment of AIS. If such a study were to show that loop excision was non-inferior to cold-knife cone biopsy for the outcomes of post-treatment persistence and recurrence, and adenocarcinoma, loop excision could be recommended as an appropriate treatment option for AIS in selected patients.

Assuming a 10% drop-out rate, a total sample size of 810 participants (405 per group) would need to be randomised. The one-sided type I error is set at 5% with 80% power.

There is a clear need for prospective randomised clinical trials to determine whether LEEP is associated with similar histopathological and clinical outcomes when compared with CKC in the investigation and management of cervical AIS. This is the first prospective randomised study to investigate this clinical question. Limitations of the pilot study are its relatively short follow-up period (6&#x02009;weeks) and small sample size, which are pragmatic. The objective of the pilot study is to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of the intervention as defined by pathological margin status, and hence long-term outcomes of interest including rates of cervical AIS recurrence and obstetric complications will be endpoints in a subsequent phase III trial. Limitations of a phase III study include those of non-inferiority trials such as defining the acceptable margin of AEs that would render the interventional treatment inferior, lack of a placebo group and allowing only an indirect assessment of the efficacy of the intervention compared with an accepted standard.</p><p>Strengths of the study include its randomised design and attempts to minimise surgical performance bias. If LEEP was found to be non-inferior to CKC for the outcomes of post-treatment persistence and recurrence, and adenocarcinoma, it could be recommended as an appropriate treatment option for AIS in selected patients. This would benefit women because, unlike cold&#x000a0;knife cone procedures, loop excision does not require hospital admission and general anaesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e851" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017576.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e852" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017576.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> PAC is the principal investigator, conceived the study and wrote the protocol.
