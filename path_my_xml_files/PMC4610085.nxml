Due to rapid onset and short duration of succinylcholine, it is an appropriate muscle relaxant that is currently available. However, due to the risk of some complications, such as rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia as well as the risk for masseter spasm and malignant hyperthermia, it is suggested that succinylcholine should not be used routinely in children.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] For short surgical procedures, that tracheal intubation is necessary to protect the airway, residual weakness due to the use of muscle relaxant could interfere with timely recovery. Recent studies have shown that tracheal intubation can be done successfully in a patient with normal anatomy of the airway with hypnotics and short-acting opioids such as alfentanil or remifentanil without the need for muscle relaxants.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] High doses of alfentanil (25-50 &#x003bc;g/kg intravenous [IV] weaken hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation, but lead to delay in spontaneous breathing and recovery in a short time surgical procedures. Remifentanil has similar onset effect as alfentanil (1-2 min). Remifentanil is not dose-dependent because hydrolysis by blood esterase and has a short half-life and rapid recovery.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In the study performed by Bouvet <italic>et al</italic>., it was revealed that the effective dose of remifentanil, ED50 and ED90, for intubation was 1.8 &#x003bc;g/kg, 4.0 &#x003bc;g/kg respectively. However, the higher dose was associated with a maximum decrease in heart rate and mean arterial pressure.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Studies also showed that propofol compared with thiopental or etomidate provides better condition for tracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] We hypothesized that, the combination of 3 mg/kg propofol and 2 &#x003bc;g/kg remifentanil may provide good condition for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Hence, this study was scheduled based on a comparison with succinylcholine as standard muscle relaxant that achieves optimal conditions for intubation. Hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation were assessed as secondary objectives of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In a clinical trial, after the approval by our Institution's Ethics Committee and obtaining written informed consent of the parents&#x02019; patient, 60 children aged 3-12 years according to American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II who were candidates for elective surgery requiring oral tracheal intubation were enrolled. Children with a history of colds, cardiopulmonary disease, neuromuscular diseases and other underlying systemic diseases were excluded. Patient's airway was evaluated based on Mallampati test.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Children with difficult intubation were excluded. After entering the operating room, monitoring of blood pressure, electrocardiogram and pulse oximetry were started. After the start of infusion fluids (10 ml/kg/h), 0.05 mg/kg midazolam, 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine were administered to both groups of patients. 5 min after premedication, induction of anesthesia was applied with 3 mg/kg Propofol in both groups. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups; group R received 2 &#x003bc;g/kg remifentanil and group S received 1.5 mg/kg succinylcholine. 90 s after administration of propofol, laryngoscopy with Miller blade and intubation was performed using a proper cuffed tracheal tube. The patient's lung was ventilated before intubation via face mask with nitrous oxide 50% in oxygen 50%. The quality of intubation were assessed by using Copenhagen score based on jaw relaxation, ease of laryngoscopy, position of vocal cord, coughing and limb movement [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Finally, intubating conditions were graded as excellent, all responses are excellent; good, all responses are excellent or good; poor, the presence of one or more poor response. Excellent and good intubation conditions are considered as clinically acceptable intubation condition. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured and recorded before the induction of anesthesia as a baseline, after induction and at 1, 3 and 5 min after intubation.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Intubating scoring system</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-9-409-g001"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was determined 30 patients according to Batra <italic>et al</italic>., study with alpha 0.05 and power of 80%.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] <italic>T</italic>-test and Chi-square were used for analysis of the patients&#x02019; characteristics.

Average weight, age and gender were similar between two groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Mask ventilation was carried out with ease in children. None of the children had a chest rigidity, laryngospasm and hypoxia. Tracheal intubation was made in both groups at the first attempt without any intervention. The intubating conditions were excellent in 86.7% in group R as compared to 100% of the patients in group S. However, not considering the reaction to endotracheal intubation, the quality of intubation in group R was 100% and it was great. Jaw was relaxed, and laryngoscopy was done easily in all of the patients in group R and vocal cord was open during laryngoscopy. Only 4 patients had coughing and mild limb movement after intubation. There were significant difference in systolic blood pressure and heart rate over time between two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02, respectively) [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>].

Taha <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showed that propofol is preferred over other IV anesthetic agents for tracheal intubations without muscle relaxant due to further weaker laryngeal reflexes and better jaw relaxation. Analogous to our study Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported that, 3 mg/kg propofol provides acceptable intubating conditions in 80% patients. They used combination of propofol and 3 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl. In the study by Batra <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] 2 &#x003bc;g/kg remifentanil and 3 mg/kg propofol provided acceptable intubating conditions in 50% patients. They had acceptable intubating conditions in 90% patient after increasing the dose of remifentanil to 3 &#x003bc;g/kg. It seems that, the difference in results between studies is due to the differences in premedication. In our study, we used midazolam and lidocaine as premedication. Lidocaine reduces the need for anesthetic drugs due to analgesic function (anti-nociceptive) and suppressing the cough reflex.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Gulhas <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] concluded that remifentanil without muscle relaxants provides similar intubating conditions as succinylcholine. Furthermore, they asserted that remifentanil is superior to succinylcholine with regard to hemodynamic stability and recovery duration. Morgan <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed that the administration of 1.25 &#x003bc;g/kg remifentanil combined with 4 mg/kg propofol provides good to excellent intubating conditions in 67% patients. Alexander <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] concluded that 2 &#x003bc;g/kg remifentanil after administration of 2 mg/kg propofol will not produce intubating conditions as good as those obtained with alfentanil 50 &#x003bc;g/kg or succinylcholine 1 mg/kg. The difference between the results of our study with theirs may be because of the different age groups (children vs. adults) and a lower dose of propofol (2 mg kg). In our study, in order to avoid bradycardia and hypotension we chose a dose of remifentanil equals to 2 &#x003bc;g/kg. The hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation was blunted in the remifentanil group compared with succinylcholine group. No patient was treated for bradycardia or hypotension in our study. Hanna <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] concluded that, the combination of propofol-remifentanil is able to control the hemodynamic stress response to laryngoscopy and intubation. In our study, the lungs of all patients were easily ventilated via mask. No patient exhibited signs of opioid-induced muscular rigidity such as stiff chest. The absence of muscular rigidity in our patients might be due to using relatively low dose of remifentanil and pretreatment with midazolam. Sub-anesthetic doses of midazolam prevent, attenuate, or successfully treat the rigidity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] We concluded that the combination of propofol and remifentanil can be used effectively in premedicated children for endotracheal intubation, when the use of muscle relaxants is not indicated.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source
