BPD is characterised by the need for supplemental oxygen and/or assisted ventilation at 36&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; postmenstrual age (PMA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Children with BPD are adversely affected through childhood, imposing an extra burden on families, health and education services. In adjusted comparisons involving preterm peers, children who develop BPD have poorer cardio-respiratory outcomes, including reduced airflow, pulmonary hypertension, limited exercise tolerance in later childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and a greater rate of re-hospitalisation (40&#x02013;60 vs. 25&#x000a0;%) with longer hospital stays and multiple re-admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Such babies also have poorer neurological outcomes than preterm infants without BPD including double the rate of cognitive and motor delay at pre-school age, up to a 1/3 standard deviation lower intelligence quotient at school age, more school-based problems including difficulty with reading, mathematics and spelling, a 50&#x000a0;% greater likelihood of needing educational assistance at school, a greater need for speech therapy (50 vs. 20&#x000a0;%) and an increased incidence of cerebral palsy (15 vs. 3&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Reducing BPD would result in savings not only for the health service, but also for families and education services.</p><p>In BPD, the lung develops abnormally, with decreased vascular and alveolar development resulting in larger but fewer alveoli. This abnormal lung development results from a process of chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The risk of BPD is inversely related to gestational age. Risk factors that contribute to a pulmonary inflammatory response include perinatal infection, surfactant deficiency, barotrauma, volutrauma and oxygen toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation and respiratory function in infants</title><p>In infants born at term, several small, randomised controlled trials involving toddlers and children, have shown improved respiratory outcomes in those who consumed formula supplemented with DHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, there have been no trials specifically designed to determine the effect of DHA supplementation on BPD in preterm infants.</p><p>Preterm infants are well recognised as being at risk of DHA insufficiency and have lower blood DHA levels at birth compared with newborn term infants. Early trials involving DHA supplementation of preterm showed improvement in visual function and on this basis all preterm infant formula is now supplemented with DHA at an amount equivalent to that naturally occurring in the breast milk of women consuming a Western diet (0.2&#x02013;0.3&#x000a0;% of total fatty acids). However, no clinical benefit on BPD was shown in these early trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Support for a role of DHA in the development of BPD comes from recent observational data showing that a decreased blood DHA level in infants born less than 30&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation was associated with an increased risk of BPD (OR 2.5 95&#x000a0;% CI 1.3 to 5.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The best evidence, however, comes from our DINO trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the DINO trial the effect on neurodevelopment of breast milk or preterm formula with a DHA concentration of&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;% of total fatty acids (the estimated in utero accretion rate) was compared with the current standard breast milk or preterm formula DHA concentration (&#x02248;0.30&#x000a0;% of total fatty acids) in 657 infants born less than 33&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although the study was not designed to test BPD, an exploratory analysis in the sub-group of infants born less than 29&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestational age (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;225), there was a near significant reduction in infants requiring supplemental oxygen at 36&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; PMA (high-DHA 38.6&#x000a0;% vs. standard DHA 51.4&#x000a0;%; RR 0.75, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.55 to 1.03, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08, unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>How might DHA improve outcomes?</title><p>The parenteral lipids administered to preterm infants as well as most breast milks and infant formulas are rich in the n-6 fatty acid linoleic acid (LA). This fatty acid acts as a precursor for arachidonic acid (AA) that gives rise to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines and also acts as an inhibitor of DHA accumulation in cells. On the other hand, DHA, an n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA), together with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) can be incorporated into membrane phospholipids of immune cells, where they serve as precursors for the synthesis of eicosanoids and docosanoids. These in turn can alter cytokine production and modulate immune cell function and suppress inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The presence of n-3 LCPUFA lowers the production of inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines through competition with AA, both as a substrate for cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase activity, and by inhibiting the conversion of LA to AA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. When n-3 LCPUFA are the substrates, less inflammatory mediators are produced. Thus, incorporation of n-3 LCPUFA into lipid membranes and elsewhere may modulate inflammatory activity.</p><p>The balance of n-3 LCPUFA and AA is important. For example, an in vitro study using a human lung carcinoma cell line showed that pro-inflammatory cytokine release was reduced with the supply of a high proportion of DHA and was increased with a high proportion of AA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This concept is supported in two preterm infant trials. In our DINO trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] the DHA: AA ratio was 2:1, thus favouring the production of anti-inflammatory mediators, and beneficial effects on respiratory function were found in very preterm infants. In the only other trial which used a DHA dose reflective of the estimated in utero accretion rate, DHA was supplemented together with AA in a 1:1 ratio, and a trend towards increased duration of supplemental oxygen and a need for assisted ventilation in the supplemented group were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The beneficial effect of DHA on lung function is supported by animal studies. For example, in murine models of hyperoxia-induced lung injury, DHA supplementation reduced inflammatory responses and improved lung growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Separate studies have also demonstrated that exposure to high DHA increased the production of dipalmatoylphosphtidylcholine, the major surfactant lipid in the fetal and neonatal lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Overall, there are clearly biologically plausible mechanisms by which n-3 LCPUFA, predominantly as DHA, can contribute to reducing the incidence of BPD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Method of enteral supplementation</title><p>While supplementing lactating women with DHA increases the DHA content of their breast milk, maternal compliance and biological variation, along with the necessary delays in establishing full enteral feeds in this population, means that there is an inconsistent delivery of DHA to the infant. These limitations can be overcome by direct DHA supplementation to the infant, which eliminates the need for maternal compliance or for the infant to be on full enteral feeds in order to receive the target dose.</p><p>We have determined that direct enteral DHA supplementation is safe and effective in preterm infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The oral supplement can be commenced within the first days of enteral feeding and is well tolerated, with no effect on the number of days feeds were interrupted or the time taken to reach full enteral feeds. The dietary DHA level was directly related to blood DHA levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Need for a trial</title><p>BPD is a leading cause of mortality and long-term morbidity in infants born less than 29&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestational age. As the survival rate of infants less than 29&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestational age continues to increase, with no reduction in the incidence of BPD, the clinical and health care burden grows. A randomised controlled trial of the use of DHA as a simple, safe and cost-effective strategy for the reduction of BPD in preterm infants is needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of DHA supplementation on the incidence of BPD in infants born less than 29&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestational age, assessed by the requirement for supplemental oxygen and/or assisted ventilation at 36&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; PMA, compared with control.</p><p>Key secondary objectives of this study include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The composite endpoint of death before 36&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; PMA or BPD</p></list-item><list-item><p>Respiratory support requirements, including the duration of respiratory support, the use of caffeine and the use of postnatal steroids and diuretics for lung disease.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Severity of BPD</p></list-item><list-item><p>Feeding tolerance</p></list-item><list-item><p>Growth</p></list-item><list-item><p>Length of hospital stay</p></list-item></list></p><p>Other secondary objectives include retinopathy of prematurity, intra-ventricular haemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia or porencephaly, sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis and death during first hospitalisation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Trial design</title><p>The N3RO trial is designed as a randomised, controlled, clinician, researcher and participant/family blinded, multicentre trial with two parallel groups and a primary outcome of requirement for supplemental oxygen and/or assisted ventilation at 36&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; PMA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Participating centres</title><p>The sponsoring institution and Trial Coordinating Centre is the Women&#x02019;s and Children&#x02019;s Health Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia.

To detect a 10&#x000a0;% absolute reduction (19&#x000a0;% relative reduction) in the incidence of BPD at 36&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; PMA from 51.4 to 41.4&#x000a0;% (with 90&#x000a0;% power, two tailed &#x003b1; =0.05) between the DHA emulsion and control emulsion, a sample size of 1244 is required (622 per group). This sample size takes into account the clustering (non-independence) of multiple births (variance inflation factor 11&#x000a0;%) and deaths (4&#x000a0;% as estimated from the DINO trial). The variance inflation factor for multiple births was based on 26&#x000a0;% of infants born less than 29&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestational age being from multiple births, an intracluster correlation coefficient for BPD of 0.52 and an average cluster size of 2.07 for these infants (as observed in the DINO trial in which mothers were randomised). While the variance inflation factor may be reduced by randomising infants rather than mothers, the calculated sample size ensures sufficient power even in the unlikely event that all infants from multiple births are randomised to the same treatment arm as their siblings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The research nurse will assess infants for eligibility. The parent(s)/guardians of eligible infants will be approached to enter the trial by the local investigator of each centre (or nominee), ideally within 24 to 48&#x000a0;h of birth. If women are in hospital threatening very preterm delivery then, where possible, information about the study will be provided antenatally.</p><p>The information sheet will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation. The investigator, or nominee, will conduct the informed consent discussion and will check that information provided is understood and answer any questions about the study. Consent will be voluntary and free from coercion. Parents willing for their infant to participate will sign a written consent form. A copy of the consent form will be given to the parents and also documented in the infant&#x02019;s medical record and study Case Report Form. Once consent and the eligibility of the infant is confirmed, the infant will be randomised and the study emulsion assigned.</p><p>A record of all infants screened, enrolled and not enrolled will be maintained. Parent(s)/guardians may withdraw their child from the study for any reason at any time. The reason for withdrawal will be recorded. Whenever possible, parent(s)/guardians of infants who are withdrawn from the study will be asked permission to collect follow-up data relevant to the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Randomisation procedures</title><p>A computer generated randomisation schedule using balanced variable block design has been generated by an independent statistician who is not involved with trial participants or data analysis. Stratification occurred for sex, study centre and gestational age less than 27 completed weeks&#x02019; and 27 to 28 completed weeks&#x02019;. Infants from multiple births will be randomised individually. The schedule is kept by the independent statistician and the treatment allocation of each randomisation code can be provided to the investigator in case of emergency.</p><p>Upon consent, infants are randomised using a customised, purpose built web-based randomisation service. A unique study ID and a study pack with a unique product ID are assigned. The study ID identifies the randomised infant. The product ID identifies a study box containing four bottles of study emulsion, all labelled with the same product ID. Each box of study emulsion will contain either intervention or control emulsion, pre-packed according to the randomisation schedule.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Blinding</title><p>Participants and their family, care providers, data collectors, outcome assessors, research personnel and data analysts will all be blinded to randomisation group. The intervention and control emulsions are identical in viscosity, colour, packaging and labelling and uniquely identified only by a product ID.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Emergency unblinding</title><p>The randomisation code for an individual participant may only be unblinded in an emergency situation, where the investigator decides a participant cannot be adequately treated without knowing their treatment allocation. The Principal Investigator must be contacted and all attempts to avoid breaking the code (i.e. withdrawal of treatment) should be made. To break the randomisation code the Investigator must contact the randomisation facility/personnel. The time, date, participant number and reason for unblinding must be documented and events leading to the emergency breaking will be recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Data collection and management</title><p>Data are collected by trained research nurses/coordinators at each participating centre onto carbon copy paper Case Report Forms. Data entry and management are coordinated from the Data Management and Analysis Centre (DMAC) at The University of Adelaide under the direction of the study statistician (TRS). There are regular blinded reviews of data quality and data checks using established protocols. Data discrepancy inquiries and responses are managed through a secure web-based management information system.</p><p>The Case Report Forms are stored in a locked office at each study site. Only research staff directly involved in the study will have access to the information. Electronic forms of data are stored on secure servers at DMAC. Data are released only to persons authorised to receive those data.</p><p>Original/copies of study documents will be retained at each study site or in archives. No paper records are retained by DMAC at study closeout, all are returned to the coordinating centre, the Women&#x02019;s and Children&#x02019;s Health Research Institute. Documents will be retained for at least 30&#x000a0;years after study completion in line with the data retention schedules for research involving minors. At the completion of this time documentation will be destroyed using confidential document disposal. The study electronic data will be stored indefinitely on DMACs secure servers with access only granted to authorised study personnel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>All participants will be analysed according to the group to which they were randomised (intention-to-treat principle). The incidence of BPD will be compared between groups using a log binomial regression model with a generalised estimating equation used to account for dependence due to multiple births. The difference between the groups will be expressed as a relative risk with a 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval. Adjustment will be made for randomisation strata (study centre, sex and gestational age less than 27 completed weeks and 27 to less than 29 completed weeks). Secondary analyses will use log-binomial regression models for binary outcomes and linear regression models for continuous outcomes, with generalised estimating equations used to account for dependence due to multiple births. Missing data will be multiply imputed under a missing at random assumption. Sensitivity analyses will also be performed using the original unimputed data.</p><p>In planned sub-group analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes we will examine the effect of DHA supplementation on boys and girls separately, and on infants with gestational age less than 27 completed weeks or 27 to less than 29 completed weeks separately. Effect modification by these two factors (sex and gestational age) will be assessed separately by including interaction effects in the statistical models. Separate estimates of treatment effect will be obtained for males and females and for infants born less than 27 completed weeks&#x02019; gestation and 27 to less than 29&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation, independent of whether the interaction effect is statistically significant, since this is a priori of interest.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Data monitoring and harms</title><p>An independent Trial Monitoring Committee has been set up to review the progress of the trial and provide feedback to the Trial Management Committee. The Trial Monitoring Committee reviews general study progress (recruitment, compliance, loss to follow-up), the BPD event rate and key secondary/safety outcomes. The Trial Monitoring Committee provides advice regarding external issues that may impact on the N3RO trial (for example changes in clinical practice). The committee meets annually or as required and consists of two neonatologists with clinical trials experience, and a statistician with clinical trials expertise.</p><p>An independent (blinded) Serious Adverse Event Committee has been established to review serious adverse events. There are no serious adverse events which would be anticipated as a unique consequence of participation in the trial, however all deaths are to be reported. The Serious Adverse Event Committee includes experts in neonatology and pathology who are not involved in the trial. The primary role of the Serious Adverse Event Committee is to review all deaths to determine whether there is any likelihood that involvement in the trial could have contributed to the death. The cause of the death is determined from the autopsy results or other hospital summary of the death by the relevant medical personnel. This committee meets six monthly, or as required.</p><p>Any event that in the opinion of an Investigator may be of immediate or potential concern for an infant&#x02019;s health or well-being is to be reported immediately to the Chair of the Steering Committee. Expected events such as necrotising enterocolitis, BPD, intracranial abnormality, pulmonary haemorrhage and patent ductus arteriosus are captured by data collection in the Case Report Form. These data are available for review by the Trial Monitoring Committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Research ethics approval</title><p>This protocol and the informed consent document have been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of each study site.

BPD is a serious complication of preterm birth, associated with long-term morbidity. Both animal and human studies point to the possibility that DHA may have a primary role in the prevention of BPD however there have been no randomised controlled trials designed specifically to determine the effect of DHA on BPD. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such randomised controlled trial. Results from this study will provide the first high quality evidence on whether an enteral DHA supplement reduces the incidence of BPD in very preterm infants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AA, arachidonic acid; BPD, bronchopulmonary dysplasia; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; DINO, the acronym is derived from &#x02018;<bold>D</bold>ocosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) for the <bold>i</bold>mprovement of <bold>n</bold>eurodevelopmental <bold>O</bold>utcomes&#x02019; in Preterm Infants; DMAC, data management and analysis centre; EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid; GMP, code of good manufacturing practice; HREC, Human Research Ethics Committee; LA, linoleic acid; LCPUFA, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid; N3RO, the acronym is derived from &#x02018;<bold>N-3</bold> fatty acids for improvement in <bold>R</bold>espiratory <bold>O</bold>utcomes&#x02019;; NHMRC, National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia; PMA, postmenstrual age</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the research and clinical teams at all participating study centres.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Additional authors and members of the N3RO Investigative Team</title><p>The following are members of the N3RO (<bold>N-3</bold> fatty acids for improvement in <bold>R</bold>espiratory <bold>O</bold>utcomes) Investigative team: <italic>Australia</italic> &#x02013; Philip Ryan (School of Public Health, The University of Adelaide, South Australia), Scott Morris (Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, South Australia), Michael Stark (Women&#x02019;s and Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia), Javeed Travadi, Ian Wright (John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales), Kenneth Tan (Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne, Victoria), James Holberton, Gillian Opie (Mercy Hospital for Women, Melbourne, Victoria), Ian Callander, Jacqueline Stack, Doron Shein, Sarah Bellhouse (Liverpool Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales), Srinivas Bolisetty, Kei Lui (Royal Hospital for Women, Sydney, New South Wales), Helen Liley (Mater Mothers&#x02019; Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland). <italic>New Zealand</italic> &#x02013; Mary Berry (Wellington Hospital, Wellington), Deborah Harris (Waikato Hospital, Hamilton). <italic>Singapore</italic> &#x02013; Mei Chien Chua, Pooja Agarwal (KK Women&#x02019;s and Children&#x02019;s Hospital).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Funding</title><p>Supported by Project Grant 1022112 from the NHMRC, Australia.
