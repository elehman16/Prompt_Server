Empirical evidence shows that exercise combined cognitive training may induce neuroplastic changes that modulate cognitive function. However, it is unclear whether hybridized exercise-cognitive training can facilitate cortical activity and physiological outcome measures and further influence on the cognitive function after stroke. This study will investigate the effects of two hybridized exercise-cognitive trainings on brain plasticity, physiological biomarkers and behavioral outcomes in stroke survivors with cognitive decline.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and significance</title><p>This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A target sample size of 75 participants is needed to obtain a statistical power of 95% with a significance level of 5%. Stroke survivors with mild cognitive decline will be stratified by Mini-Mental State Examination scores and then randomized 1:1:1 to sequential exercise-cognitive training, dual-task exercise-cognitive training or control groups. All groups will undergo training 60&#x0202f;min/day, 3 days/week, for a total of 12 weeks. The primary outcome is the resting-state functional connectivity and neural activation in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes in functional magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes include physiological biomarkers, cognitive functions, physical function, daily functions and quality of life. This study may differentiate the effects of two hybridized trainings on cognitive function and health-related conditions and detect appropriate neurological and physiological indices to predict training effects. This study capitalizes on the groundwork for a non-pharmacological intervention of cognitive decline after stroke.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Cognitive decline</kwd><kwd>Sequential exercise-cognitive training</kwd><kwd>Dual-task exercise-cognitive training</kwd><kwd>Functional magnetic resonance imaging</kwd><kwd>Biomarkers</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Advances in stroke management and organized post-acute care lead to lower stroke mortality. In contrast to the great emphasis on recovery in physical function, post-stroke cognitive decline has largely been ignored. Approximately 20%&#x02013;60% of stroke survivors have cognitive decline three months after stroke [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Patients with cognitive decline may experience difficulties learning motor tasks and thus reduce the intervention effects.</p><p id="p0015">Current evidence indicates that targeted cognitive rehabilitation after stroke&#x02013;including cognitive or aerobic exercise training provided potential benefits to enhance cognitive function. Computerized cognitive training is a common technique to restore executive functioning after a brain injury or other neurological event [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The mechanism of cognitive training might be associated with increased cortical activation and functional connectivity (FC) between the hippocampus and the frontal and the parietal cortices [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Exercise, on the other hand, can improve physical functions such as increased muscle mass, strength, power, endurance and mobility level [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The physiological adjustments after exercise involve glycemic control, oxidative stress modulation, and lipoprotein metabolism modification [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>]. Efficacy research on both cognitive and exercise has shown to up-regulate neurotrophic and vascular growth factors, such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and may indirectly facilitate general cognitive function [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Combining exercise and cognitive training could have synergistic or complementary effects on cognition at both the neurobiological and behavioral levels [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Sequential training is combining exercise and cognitive training sequentially. Aerobic exercise before cognitive training may increase arousal level and enhance memory consolidation which may benefit the following memory retrieval and cognitive task performance [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Winter et al. [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] observed that intense exercise led to elevated levels of BDNF, which is known to promote long-term potentiation, synaptic connection, and neural plasticity. Law et al. [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] suggested that exercise sessions delivered before the cognitive training session preparing the brain for the compensatory recruitment process in the subsequent cognitive training sessions.</p><p id="p0025">Dual-task training is when the participant performs exercise and cognitive tasks simultaneously. Dual-task training is more cognitively demanding because it involves additional cognitive processing to integrate and coordinate two tasks at the same time [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Kim and colleagues [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] investigated the effect of dual-task training on cognition in patients with chronic stroke and found that compared with single-task training, four weeks of dual-task training led to improvements in the walking abilities and executive functions measured by the Stroop test. The enhanced cognitive function was maintained at two weeks follow-up. Many activities of daily life involve the simultaneous performance of multiple tasks concurrently challenging motor and cognitive functions. Stroke survivors with cognitive decline has been significantly associated with daily life functional dependence and reduced quality of life [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To investigate the generalizability of dual-task training effects to real world and functional outcomes is of utmost importance.</p><p id="p0030">The evidence for the hybridized exercise-cognitive training either sequentially or concurrently (i.e., in a dual-task paradigm) for individuals with stroke is limited. We are primarily interested in the changes in cortical activity before and after hybridized exercise-cognitive training in patients with stroke. The secondary outcomes include the physiological biomarkers (e.g., BDNF), cognitive functions, physical functions, daily functions and quality of life. We hypothesize that the exercise-cognitive hybridized trainings could potentially facilitate a wide range of functions. These outcome measures that accompany hybridized exercise-cognitive training in stroke survivors have not been evaluated. Whether the hybridized exercise-cognitive training can improve the activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QOL) needs to be determined given that the fundamental goal of rehabilitation is to improve everyday functioning. Resolving in a randomized controlled trial study the effects of two hybrid exercise-cognitive trainings (HECT) on brain plasticity, physiological biomarkers, and behavioral outcomes is therefore of great importance.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p id="p0035">The study is an interventional, single-blind randomized controlled trial that will be performed in Taiwan.

Treatment to reserve cognitive ability is emergent and attention has shifted toward this less visible cognitive impairment over the recent decades. There is no consensus about pharmacological interventions [<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and it is not highly recommended the use of only medicines for cognitive decline after stroke. Accordingly, it is important to structure non-pharmacological interventions to increase or reserve patients' cognitive capacity. This project represents endeavor toward this possibility.</p><p id="p0275">Physical function and behavioral improvements resulting from exercise or cognitive training were established to a certain degree in certain populations. Despite abundant studies have used fMRI to monitor the changes of neural activities in different brain regions during stroke recovery, the changes in the neural activities that underlie the behavioral improvements are not well understood. Functional neuroimaging such as fMRI has been suggested to be an important source of information about the effects of cognition-related trainings. Neuroimaging can also determine the intervention mechanisms at the cognitive and neural levels, possibly showing changes in FC and the patterns of brain activation.</p><p id="p0280">Sporadic researches on underlying the neural mechanisms associated with cognitive training following stroke were reported recently. For example, Yang and colleagues [<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] examined the effects of integrated cognitive therapy that combined computer-based cognitive rehabilitation and cholinesterase inhibitors on cognitive function in ischemic stroke. Participants were scanned at baseline and after the integrated cognitive therapy. Using the resting-state fMRI, stroke patients showed increased hippocampal FC mainly in the prefrontal gyrus and the DMN after treatment. Their results also found the increased FC was correlated with the improved cognitive performance. Similarly, another study with ten weeks computer-assisted cognitive training in stroke patients also demonstrated an increased hippocampal FC in frontal and left parietal lobe compared with patients without intervention [<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Moreover, this increased FC was correlated with the improvement in memory test by Wechsler Memory Scale and executive function by Trail Making Test [<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Both studies highlighted the possible contribution of computer-based cognitive rehabilitation in modulating neural networks in stroke patients, as reflecting on the increased FC and improvement of cognitive performance.</p><p id="p0285">Although resting-state fMRI can elucidate the brain's functional connections by determining temporal synchrony between brain regions, whether the training-induced changes in the neural activity associated with cognitive training remains unexplored. Event-related fMRI with BOLD contrast technique might be better in representing functionality of brain regions at least in normal subjects performing various cognitive tasks [<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, only one case study investigated the patterns of neural activation after a course of auditory working memory training using event-related fMRI. Leung and colleagues [<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] found that the stroke patient improved the N-back task performance throughout the training and demonstrated improvement in cognitive abilities including attention, working memory and short-term memory after one-month training. Functional imaging showed a pattern of decreased neural activation in the frontoparietal attention network post-training which suggested a decreased compensation for functional deficits and may be linked to cognitive function recovery. This preliminary work provided promising evidence that auditory working memory training could enhance neural efficiency in performing the working memory task. The changes in neural activities might be specific to the training.</p><p id="p0290">On the other hand, training-induced brain plasticity associated with physical exercise in healthy young adults has been examined. A recent study used the fMRI to examine the effect of acute aerobic exercise on working memory task-evoked brain activity in healthy young subjects [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. They found that single bout of 20&#x0202f;min moderate intensity aerobic exercise induced brain activation in the right middle prefrontal gyrus, the right lingual gyrus, and the left fusiform gyrus as well as deactivations in the anterior cingulate cortexes, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the right paracentral lobule. The authors suggest that these specific brain cortexes play vital roles in the alteration of executive function induced by acute exercise.</p><p id="p0295">To sum up, beginning evidence suggests that cognitive and physical exercise training may positively induce neuroplastic changes in stroke patients with cognitive impairment or healthy adults. However, results of such training for patients with brain lesions are scarce. No study used the task-evoked neural activity in various areas, network circuit, and resting-state FC to investigate neural changes after hybrid exercise-cognitive trainings and their mechanisms. There is also no study trying to disentangle the possible differences in brain plasticity after different types of hybrid exercise-cognitive trainings. In addition, including an active control group and examining the long-term follow-up effect for hybrid exercise-cognitive trainings need to be explored as well.</p><p id="p0300">The HECT trial is to our knowledge the first randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of two hybridized interventions on brain plasticity, physiological biomarkers and behavioral outcomes in stroke survivors. This study will ascertain the clinical significance of changes in cognitive function by measuring the behavioral outcomes and quantifying the relationship among neural connectivity, physiological biomarkers, and behavioral outcomes. The fMRI measurement at three-time points will illustrate the time course of the neural mechanisms associated with cognitive training in stroke survivors over six months of hybrid interventions for cognitive recovery.</p><p id="p0305">Given the limited efficacy of current cognitive interventions, as the growing interest in recovery from stroke sequelae, developing integrated and novel training strategies for cognitive impairment is of vital importance. Cognitive treatments and recovery have been listed among the top 10 research priorities after stroke [<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. While cognitive and aerobic exercise training are well evidenced for improving cognitive function, limited efficacy of cognitive interventions for stroke survivors are established. This clinical trial will launch two novel hybrid cognitive trainings and compare the effects in stroke survivors with mild cognitive decline. This trial will also determine whether cognitive function enhancement is associated with changes in brain structure and physiological biomarkers. Our findings will indicate whether the hybrid interventions are feasible and effective for stroke survivors with mild cognitive decline. The findings might inform clinicians how neurobiological change and adaptive modulation occur after specific hybrid training and which type of hybrid therapy engenders specific treatment effects at the specific behavioral performance. Investigation of relations among neural connectivity/activation, physiological biomarkers and behavioral outcomes might underscore the possible neural connectivity/activity patterns relating to or predicting the effects of specific hybrid training. Such examination also explores the brain-behavior relations and detects appropriate patients responsive to specific hybrid training in terms of neurological and/or physiological indices.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Trial registration</title><p id="p0310"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="intref0025">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT03230253.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="p0315">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>J.-H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>J.-T.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Post-stroke cognitive impairment: epidemiology, mechanisms and management</article-title><source>Ann.
