stabilometry of athletes. [Subjects] Thirty-seven athletes were divided into a control
group (n=17) and an experimental group (n=20). [Methods] Both groups performed a
conventional warm-up, after which a 25-minute proprioceptive session on ustable platforms
was carried out only by the experimental group. Before the training session, all athletes
carried out a single-leg stabilometry test which was repeated just after training, 30
minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours and 24 hours later. [Results] Analysis of covariance (&#x003b1;=0.05)
revealed that the experimental group had lower values than the control group in length and
velocity of center of pressure (CoP) of left-monopodal stance and in velocity of CoP of
right-monopodal stance in post-training measurements. Also, the experimental group had
values closer to zero for the CoP position in the mediolateral and anteroposterior
directions of left-monopodal stance (Xmeanl and Ymeanl) and the anteroposterior direction
in on right-monopodal stance (Ymeanr) in post-training measurements. Within-group analysis
of Xmeanl and Ymeanl, length and velocity of CoP in right-monopodal stance showed
continuous fluctuations of values between sequential measurements in the control group.
[Conclusion] Proprioceptive training on unstable platfoms after a warm-up stabilizes the
position of CoP in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions and decreases CoP
movements in short-term monopodal stability of athletes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Proprioception</kwd><kwd>Athletes</kwd><kwd>Stabilometry</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Monopodal postural stance and proprioception are very important parameters in the
functionality of the lower limbs of athletes<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In sports, fatigue and stress along with injuries, contribute to
the deterioration of the proprioceptive sense. All these aspects put athletes at risk of
possible relapses or new injuries<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Training on unstable platforms has become a common tool in several sports to reduce injury
risks of athletes, and to help them improve their proprioceptive sense<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Proprioceptive training on unstable platforms has been shown to result in large and
medium-to-long term improvement when practiced for several consecutive weeks. Its benefits
appear mainly in stabilometric parameters<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several authors have stated that an
improvement in postural stability provides athletes with a much more stable basic stance,
from which they can perform movements in a stronger and more precise fashion<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Romero-Franco et al. showed there were
significant improvements in postural stability as well as in the control of the center of
gravity after a six-week proprioceptive training program<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, Stanton et al. and Mattacola and Lloyd observed an
improvement in static balance and dynamic balance variables, respectively, after
proprioceptive training<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Others surveys have tested the monopodal stability of
athletes due to the fact that it is a more specific analysis, and therefore more fitting to
the needs of their particular sport of choice. The research carried out by Paterno et al. is
a good example of this. They observed that a six-week proprioceptive training program
improved not only general monopodal postural stance but also the values of center of
pressure position in the anteroposterior direction, which reduced the number of ACL
(anterior cruciate ligament) injuries in the long term<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Until now, proprioceptive training studies have mainly dealt with medium- and long-term
effects, while short-term effects have received little attention. Some authors have analyzed
muscle activation using EMG under conditions of instability, and have reported sizeable
immediate increases in muscle activities<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is believed that this increase aims to
stabilize and maintain the gravity center, thus avoiding a potential fall<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, a consequence of this muscle activity increase compensating for the instability
condition, is that athletes experience a great diminution of force output.</p><p>In spite of evidence about the improvement provided by proprioceptive training, studies to
date have not investigated on the short-term stabilometric effects that come from
proprioceptive training. The study of Romero-Franco et al. is the only study, to our
knowledge, that has analyzed the short-term stabilometric effects of training on unstable
platforms. In that study, measurements were taken inmediately after proprioceptive training,
and the results which showed worse bipodal postural stability of the athletes. This decrease
may have been a consequence of fatigue, according to the authors<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>With so little scientific evidence it is difficult to know the immediate results of
proprioceptive training. This would be of great importance for determining when, during the
training process, such exercises should take place. The purpose of this study was to analyze
the short-term effects of a proprioceptive training session on an unstable platform on the
monopodal stabilometry of athletes. Based on previous reports of a great increase in muscle
activity with a consequent loss of force under unstable conditions, and immediate adverse
effects on bipodal stability, of proprioceptive training, we authors hypothesized that
proprioceptive training would negatively affect athletes&#x02019; monopodal stabilometry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A 24-hour quasi-experimental study was carried out in March 2012 with 6 repeated

17 athletes who carried out a 25-minute conventional warm up, and the Experimental Group
(EG), comprised 20 athletes who carried out the same warm up and then performed a
25-minute proprioceptive training session on unstable platforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Proprioceptive training session which the experimental group carried out (Designed

to those who were injured at the time of the study. Before the start, we briefed all the
athletes about the test and about the nature of proprioceptive training. In addition, we
obtained written informed consent from each subject or their legal guardians in the case
of underage athletes, according to the standards of the Declaration of Helsinki<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ethical committee of the University
of Ja&#x000e9;n approved the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We used Five BOSU<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Balance Trainers, five Swiss balls and five 3&#x02005;kg medicine
balls for the proprioceptive training session. We determined the correct diameter of the
Swiss ball by measuring the height of each athlete: when athletes were sitting on the
ball, their knees and hips had to be flexed at 90&#x000b0;<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. A FreeMed<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> BASE model baropodometric platform was
used for the stabilometric measurements (Rome, Italy). The platform&#x02019;s surface is 555 &#x000d7;
420&#x02005;mm, with an active surface of 400 &#x000d7; 400&#x02005;mm and 8&#x02005;mm thickness,
(Sensorm&#x000e9;dica<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Sevilla, Spain). The reliability of this baropodometric
platform has been shown in previous studies<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Calculations of center-of-pressure (CoP) movements were
performed with the FreeStep<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> Standard 3.0 (Italy) software. We collected
baseline features of the athletes with a 100&#x02005;g&#x02013;300&#x02005;kg precision digital weight scale
(Tefal) and a t201-t4 Asimed adult height scale to obtain weight and height respectively
(<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>To carry out the monopodal stabilometric measurement, we asked the athletes to stand for
fifteen seconds on each lower limb, starting with the left one, in the middle of the
platform. The athletes stood without shoes with both arms at the sides of the body and the
non-support leg in 90&#x000b0; of knee flexion. Also, we asked athletes not to engage in any
physical activity for the duration of the study.</p><p>The stabilometry test measured the following parameters of both the left- and right-leg
stances: the center of pressure (CoP) position in the mediolateral (Xmean) and
anteroposterior directions (Ymean), in addition to the length (Length) and the area (Area)
covered by the CoP and the velocity (Velocity) of CoP movement. These variables are
suffixed with &#x0201c;l&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;r&#x0201d; to indicate whether they belong to the left or right leg,
respectively.</p><p>First, all athletes completed the pre-training stabilometry test. After those
measurements, a 25-minute conventional warm-up was carried out by all athletes. The
warm-up consisted of 10 minutes of slow running, 5 minutes of dynamic stretching and 10
minutes of specific running exercises. After the warm-up, the experimental group also
performed the 25-minute proprioceptive training session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>The 25-minute proprioceptive training session consisted of 6 Swiss ball and BOSU
exercises and the correct performance of the exercises was carefully supervised by a
fitness specialist and a sports physiotherapist, who worked with groups of 10 to 12
athletes. The effects of this type of training are based on disturbances caused under
unstable conditions, which force the center of pressure out of the support base. To avoid
a potential fall, stabilizing musculature is activated to make postural adjustments and
maintain the center of pressure within the support base<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. These postural adjustments and neural adaptations are the main
responsible of benefits of proprioceptive training appearing in stabilometric
parameters<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Just after the warm-up, in the case of the control group, and immediately after the
proprioceptive session in the case of the experimental group, the Post<sub>0Min</sub>
measurements were taken. Post<sub>30Min</sub> measurements were taken 30 minutes later and
Post<sub>1H</sub> measurements were taken one hour after the proprioceptive session.
Post<sub>6H</sub> was measured after 6 hours, and Post<sub>24H</sub>, at 24 hours after
the proprioceptive training session.</p><p>Descriptive statistics include averages and standard deviations for the continuous
variables, and the frequencies and percentages of the categorical variables (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to
test the normal distribution of quantitative variables. Regarding the demographic and
morphological variables, Student&#x02019;s t test was used for independent samples in the case of
the continuous variables and the c<sup>2</sup> test for the categorical variables. The
general linear repeated measures model was employed for all variables, with time and
intervention group as within- and between-subjects variables, respectively (repeated
measures ANOVA). A covariance analysis was performed on variables showing differences from
baseline, with the initial measurement as covariate (ANCOVA). The level of statistical
significance used was p &#x0003c;0.05. Data analysis was performed by means of the SPSS

training session with unstable platforms on the monopodal stability of athletes. To this
end, athletes were subjected to a monopodal stabilometry test before a 25-minute
proprioceptive session and then 5 times more: right after the training, after 30 minutes,
after 1 hour, after 6 hours and after 24 hours from the end of the proprioceptive training
session.</p><p>Important findings were observed in variables refering to position of CoP in both the
mediolateral and anteroposterior directions of the experimental group (Xmean and Ymean). The
control group experienced several and important fluctuations in the mediplateral and
anteroposterior directions during the 24 hours after the conventional warm-up session in
left-side monopodal support. These fluctuations were not observed in the experimental group,
which showed values over the whole time. These findings agree with the study of
Romero-Franco et al., in which the control group showed worse stabilometric parameters with
certain fluctuations in mediolateral stability after a 25-minute warm-up<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast, Subasi et al., reported that
a shorter warm-up had positive effects on the balance of healthy young individuals, without
any difference between a 5-minute and a 10-minute warm up<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Regarding the uniformity of stabilometric parameters of the
experimental group, the only study to date, to our knowledge, which has analyzed immediate
effects of proprioceptive training on stability did not find similar results, only a certain
deterioration in mediolateral stability<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All differences found between the experimental and control groups on both the left and
right-side monopodal supports were always in favour of the experimental athletes, who showed
values closer to zero than the control group, and consequently, a more central position of
CoP in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions of left-side monopodal support and in
the anteroposterior direction of right-side monopodal support. In spite of these
between-group differences, no clear stabilometric improvement was shown in the mediolateral
and anteroposterior stability after the proprioceptive training session. Our findings partly
agree with Romero-Franco et al., who showed that a proprioceptive training session had no
effect on most stabilometric parameters of athletes<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. They also reported a certain deterioration in the mediolateral
stability in bipodal support after proprioceptive training, which would have been distinct
from our results, where no changes were observed in the experimental group.</p><p>Regarding variables about the path covered by CoP, significant findings were observed in
Length and Velocity of the right-side monopodal stabilometry. Both the experimental and
control groups experienced a stabilometric improvement after the training session, and this
improvement was higher in the experimental group after the proprioceptive training. Our
findings differ from Romero-Franco et al. who reported deterioration in bipodal stability
right after a proprioceptive training session<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The difference between our results and those of Romero-Franco et
al. seems to mean that the effects of proprioceptive training are different for the cases of
monopodal and bipodal support. This result could be explained by Ashton-Miller&#x02019;s suggestion
about the specific improvement proprioceptive training often induces, which means that only
similar exercises are improved<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
would explain the difference between the result of the present study and those of
Romero-Franco et al., since proprioceptive training in both studies comprised mainly
monopodal exercises. This explanation would also support the study of Paterno et al., in
which athletes showed improvements in anteroposterior and general stability, but not in
mediolateral stability in monopodal support after six weeks of proprioceptive training.
Paterno et al. suggested that these results may have been due to the lack of mediolateral
perturbation during their proprioceptive training program, which only consisted of
anteroposterior perturbations<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study significant fluctuations were found in the stabilometric values of the
control group after the warm-up session, while the experimental group showed similar values
for all measurements after the proprioceptive training session.</p><p>Despite the fact that no clear stabilometric improvement was found during the 24 hours
after the proprioceptive training session, the uniformity observed in the stabilometric
values of the experimental group may mean the proprioceptive training session had a
stabilizing effect on stabilometry. Thus, taking into account the consensus about
stabilometric deterioration as a risk factor of injuries<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, a more stable CoP without significant fluctuations would appear to
be extremely important for injury prevention. However, further investigation is needed to
verify this supposition.</p><p>Also, we suggest that differences found between right and left-side monopodal support may
be explained by the sense of the curve of the track where all the athletes participing in
this study trained, which is always to the left, according to the coaches of all athletes.
However, no studies to date have analysed the effect of this on athletes.</p><p>This study had limitations that need to be considered. First, the size sample was small,
which could have affect the limits of significance. Also, the athletes&#x02019; inexperience with
proprioceptive training may have been the main cause why clear improvements in monopodal
stability did not appear. In futher investigations, we recommend the inclusion of a group of
athletes experienced in proprioceptive training, in order to analyze its immediate effect
and detail the best schedule for a training routine.</p><p>The inclusion of a 25-minute proprioceptive training session on unstable platfoms after a
conventional warm-up by athletes stabilized the position of CoP in the anteroposterior and
mediolateral planes in monopodal stability by decreasing CoP displacement. Contrary to our
hypothesis, after 25-minutes of conventional warm-up, athletes showed stabilometric
alterations. However, the inclusion of an additional 25-minute proprioceptive training on
unstable platforms helped to regulate monopodal stabilometric parameters in the short-term
mantaining the monopodal stability level of athletes.</p><p>In practical application, coaches and physiotherapists should taken into account the
&#x0201c;stable stabilometry&#x0201d; gained immediately after the proprioceptive training which eliminates
significant stabilometric fluctuations which could be a potential risk factor of injuries
for athletes. Besides, the incorporation of proprioceptive exercises as part of the warm-up
would not only result in better stability than a typical warm-up, but would also elicit
medium and long-term improvements in stability that are essential for injury prevention.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Paterno</surname><given-names>MV</given-names></name><name><surname>Myer</surname><given-names>GD</given-names></name><name><surname>Ford</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Neuromuscular training improves single-limb stability in
