Given that haptic communication is particularly under-researched, we focused on the phenomenon of embracing. When we embrace a dear friend to say good-bye at the end of a great evening, we typically first employ smooth and yielding movements with round transitions between muscular tensing and relaxing (<italic>smooth</italic>, <italic>indulging rhythms</italic>), and when the embrace is getting too long, we start to use slight patting (<italic>sharp</italic>, <italic>fighting rhythms</italic> with sharp transitions) on the back or the shoulders of the partner in order to indicate that we now want to end the embrace. On the ground of interpersonal resonance, most persons (per-sonare, <italic>latin</italic> = to sound through) understand these implicit nonverbal signals, expressed in haptic tension-flow changes, and will react accordingly. To experimentally test the hypothesis that smooth, indulgent rhythms signal the wish to continue, and sharp, fighting rhythms signal the wish to separate from an embrace, we randomly assigned 64 participants, all students at the University of Heidelberg, to two differently sequenced embrace conditions: (a) with the fighting rhythm at the end of the sequence of two indulgent rhythms (Sequence A: smooth-smooth-sharp); and (b) with the fighting rhythm between two indulgent rhythms (Sequence B: smooth-sharp-smooth). Participants were embraced for 30 s by a female confe&#x000ad;derate with their eyes blindfolded to focus on haptic and kinesthetic cues without being distracted by visual cues. They were instructed to let go of a handkerchief that they held between the fingers of their dominant hand during the embrace, when they felt that the embracer signaled the wish to finish the embrace. Participants significantly more often dropped the handkerchief in the phase of the fighting rhythm, no matter in which location it occurred in the embrace sequence. We assume that we learn such rhythmic behaviors and their meaning from the beginning of life in the communication with caregivers and meaningful others. Some are universal and some are quite idiosyncratic. Infants seem to be highly sensitive to the dynamic nuances presented to them, demonstrating a high capacity for embodied resonance and a high behavioral plasticity. Such adaptive mechanisms are assumed to lay the foundations of family culture (including the degree to which nonverbal cues are attended to, the communication of taboos, etc.) and larger culture, and may also play an important role in interpersonal attraction and aesthetic experience.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>interpersonal resonance</kwd><kwd>embodiment</kwd><kwd>movement rhythms</kwd><kwd>haptic communication</kwd><kwd>movement qualities</kwd><kwd>movement analysis</kwd><kwd>Kestenberg Movement Profile (KMP)</kwd><kwd>rhythmicity</kwd><kwd>musicality</kwd><kwd>vitality affects</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-behavsci-07-00080"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Implicit nonverbal signals serve to communicate from early infancy onward. A child cries in distress and the mother picks him/her up and moves him/her up and down on her knees, bouncing him/her in a sharp rhythm. He/she slowly starts to calm down and breathes more regularly, while the mother gradually changes the rhythm to a soothing low-intensity swaying rhythm (smooth rhythms; for operationalization see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-behavsci-07-00080">Supplementary Materials videos 1 and 2</xref>; and directly from 1.4 on) that softly rocks him to rest. We all use movement rhythms to address the needs of others, express ourselves, and communicate with others. In early infancy, they are almost our only form of expressing our needs and thus have survival value.</p><p>In an extended good-bye embrace, the movement sequence just described reverses: first, when the wish to indulge is predominant, we can observe smooth indulgent rhythms, then&#x02014;when the embrace starts to get too long for one of the embracers&#x02014;we can observe sharp fighting rhythms from his/her part indicating the wish to separate. This sequencing of movement rhythms in embraces was described by the psychiatrist, child psychoanalyst, and movement specialist Dr. Judith S. Kestenberg (Kestenberg &#x00026; Sossin, 1973/1979; Kestenberg, 1995) [<xref rid="B1-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Kestenberg systema&#x000ad;tically analyzed basic movement dimensions, such as the movement rhythms, along with their meaning; observed their developmental sequence; built a theory about developmental stages; and explored and revised this theory with a group of other researchers and practitioners experientially (movement-based). She related this theory to pathology and health, particularly mental health and disorders of the embodied self (Kestenberg Amighi, Loman, Lewis, &#x00026; Sossin, 1999) [<xref rid="B3-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Movement rhythms are the tension-flow changes that occur in the body, when our muscles go from tense to relaxed and vice versa: the constant change of tension in our body. They build a continuous stream of information for us about where and how our body is, what we need, and how we do (e.g., whether we are &#x0201c;in danger&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d;; Bruner &#x00026; Postman, 1947) [<xref rid="B4-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Movement rhythms indicate needs and serve a perceptive (interoceptive/proprioceptive/exteroceptive), expressive, and communicative function (Koch &#x00026; Sossin, 2012) [<xref rid="B5-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><sec id="sec1dot1-behavsci-07-00080"><title>1.1. Bidirectionality of Movement and Affective-Cognitive System</title><p>As early as 1872, Charles Darwin in his book &#x0201c;The expression of emotions in men and animals&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B6-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] provided many examples of humans and animals using movement to express themselves and communicate with conspecifics and other species. While Darwin focused mainly on the <italic>expressive function</italic>, almost exactly 100 years later, psychology started to pay investigative attention to the <italic>bidirectionality of movement and the affective-cognitive system</italic>, investigating the <italic>impressive function</italic> in the so called facial- and body feedback hypotheses (LaFrance, 1985; Laird, 1980; Riskind, 1984; Wallbott, 1990) [<xref rid="B7-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The impressive function of movement on affect and cognition was subsequently further investigated by looking at how facial expressions (Havas, Glenberg, Gutowski, Lucarelli, &#x00026; Davidson, 2010 [<xref rid="B11-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]) and postures (Rossberg-Gempton &#x00026; Poole, 1992 [<xref rid="B12-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) as well as gestures (Cacioppo, Priester &#x00026; Berntson, 1993 [<xref rid="B13-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) changed emotion, cognition, and even action (Bargh, Chen, &#x00026; Burrows, 1996 [<xref rid="B14-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). Books in phenomenology and cognitive sciences, as well as robotics, picked up upon the principles of embodiment and the effects of the body on the mind (Gallagher, 2006; Gibbs, 2005; Pfeifer &#x00026; Bongard, 2006 [<xref rid="B15-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). The traditional Cartesian split was strongly questioned (Damasio, 1994; Merleau-Ponty, 1962; Sheets-Johnstone, 1999 [<xref rid="B18-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), and the plasticity of the body&#x02013;mind system came more and more to the foreground (Pert, 1997; Keysers, 2011 [<xref rid="B21-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2-behavsci-07-00080"><title>1.2. Dynamic and Interactive Effects of Body Feedback: Including Kinaesthetic and Haptic Communication</title><p>Yet, the body feedback research focused on static gestures or postures and did not employ any dynamic movement. Taking into account the perspective of movement therapy and movement analysis, we conducted a number of experiments to demonstrate the effects of dynamic movements on affect and cognition, with a particular focus on the influence of movement qualities (Koch, 2011; 2014) [<xref rid="B23-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Cacioppo et al. (1993) [<xref rid="B13-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] had demonstrated that approach movements caused positive affect and attitudes to formerly neutral objects (Chinese ideographs), whereas avoidance movements caused negative affect and attitudes toward the same objects. Building upon their findings, we varied approach and avoidance movements in smooth or sharp movement rhythms (four conditions) to find out that only in the smooth rhythm condition did the formerly known effects of approach and avoidance motor behavior (Cacioppo et al., 1993) [<xref rid="B13-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] on affect and attitudes occur (Koch, 2014 [<xref rid="B24-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). That is, movement quality (here movement rhythms) had a decisive influence on the effects of movement shape changes on affect and attitudes. Affect and attitudes were more positive after an approach movement than after an avoidance movement (confirming the findings of Cacioppo et al., 1994) [<xref rid="B13-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while no difference occurred when a fighting rhythm was employed with either an approach or an avoidance movement (Koch, 2014) [<xref rid="B24-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The fighting rhythm seemed to overwrite the meaning of the approach and avoidance difference, possibly because, with its onset, the organism was getting into a defensive state (having to defend against all incoming divergent information) to focus on a specific task to be completed. This is actually quite straightforward and functional: the fighting or indulgent movement quality indicates tension or relaxation, danger or comfort (Bruner &#x00026; Postman, 1947) [<xref rid="B4-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and our attentional system reacts accordingly.</p><p>Yet, the interactive meaning of body rhythms remained to be demonstrated. Social embodiment research is needed to follow up with interpersonal body feedback experiments. A first study was conducted by Koch, Berger, and Schorr (reported in 1.6.1 below, and Koch, 2011) [<xref rid="B23-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], focusing on the <italic>communicative meaning of rhythms in handshakes</italic>, where results suggested indulgent rhythms indicate and cause positive affect and signal agreeableness, openness, and extraversion (from the Big 5 personality dimensions), whereas fighting rhythms indicated negative affect and neuroticism.</p><p>There is much differentiated knowledge on movement, its logic, its basic dimensions, and movement analysis in the field of dance movement therapy (e.g., Bartenieff &#x00026; Lewis, 1980; Kestenberg, 1995; Laban, 1980; Lamb, 1965) [<xref rid="B2-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B25-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Embodiment research could profit a lot from making use of that knowledge in theory, methods, and applications. Particularly, theory is strong in movement analysis (Kennedy, 2010) [<xref rid="B28-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and can help to advance the knowledge about embodiment more rapidly and integratively than the mostly isolated effects that have been empirically tested so far. If empirically tested effects are related to theory systems of movement analysis, missing information on aspects that require further attention will start to stand out. The research could then generally be conducted more systematically, informed by causal hypotheses from already existing experientially and phenomenologically validated systems. Movement analysis systems in turn could be further validated or revised in aspects where quantitative empirical tests yield according results. </p></sec><sec id="sec1dot3-behavsci-07-00080"><title>1.3. Primacy of Movement and Expression: Roots of Rhythms Research in &#x0201c;Ausdruckspsychologie&#x0201d;</title><p>The baby moves already before birth and, by moving (use of proprioception) and touching, develops the first experiences of separating interoception (perception of signals from the inside of the body) from exteroception (perception of signals from outside of the body), differentiating a first sense of &#x0201c;me&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;not me&#x0201d; via surface sensitivity (Sheets-Johnstone, 1999) [<xref rid="B20-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and recognition of a membrane that separates the inside from the outside (which may be our first act of self-consciousness; Sheets-Johnstone, 1999) [<xref rid="B20-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This membrane is permeable and prone to rhythmic stimulation. What it comes down to in any form of rhythmicity/musicality (Trevarthen, 1999) [<xref rid="B29-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] is our ability to resonate using our body, and the biggest sensory organ our skin as a membrane that can bring exteroception and interoception in unison. Proprioception, sense of balance, and kinaesthesia have been widely underestimated as a sensorimotor basis of affect and cognition (Sch&#x000f6;nhammer, 2013; Allesch, 2009) [<xref rid="B30-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Body rhythms provide <italic>structure</italic>, patterns, contrast, figure and ground, temporal sequencing, etc. We can perceive and create rhythms with our bodies. Creating rhythms provides a person with an experience of structure and control. This can be very important in clinical contexts for patients with depression, anxiety disorders, traumatic experiences, schizophrenia, and other mental health problems (Fuchs &#x00026; Koch, 2014) [<xref rid="B32-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], because rhythm can provide experiences of agency and self-efficacy, both crucial components of psychological health (Bandura, 1977) [<xref rid="B33-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>As early as in the 1920s, the term <italic>rhythm</italic> was used in the German &#x0201c;Ausdruckspsychologie&#x0201d; (Kirchhoff, 1965) [<xref rid="B34-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] to describe movements, and the terms <italic>smooth/sharp</italic> (&#x0201c;rund/eckig&#x0201d;) were used to describe the transition between two movements (Oseretzky, 1929) [<xref rid="B35-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. At the same time, an experiment by Gestalt psychologist Wolfgang K&#x000f6;hler (1929) [<xref rid="B36-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] showed that the neutral (non-existing) words <italic>bouba</italic> and <italic>kiki</italic> would be significantly more often assigned to either a smooth or a sharp geometric form. <italic>Bouba</italic> was consistently assigned to the round shape (that was similar to an ink plot or a puddle), and <italic>kiki</italic> was assigned to the sharp form (that was similar to a star shape). Poffenberger and Barrows (1924) [<xref rid="B37-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] discovered that curved and smooth lines (round shapes) were significantly more assigned to states of mind such as sad, quiet, or gay, whereas sharp lines were significantly more assigned to arousal or rage. The <italic>aesthetic aspect</italic> of these shapes was investigated by Bar und Neta (2006) [<xref rid="B38-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], who demonstrated that smooth, curved objects on picture cards (such as sketched vases, sofas, etc.) would be evaluated as significantly more positive and beautiful as the same objects in a sharp lined format. Wallbott (1982) [<xref rid="B39-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and Aronoff, Woyke and Hymann (1992) [<xref rid="B40-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] were the first European researchers who investigated movement qualities experimentally. Both built on the theories of Laban and experimental findings from cognitive psychology and emotion research. Aronoff et al. (1992) [<xref rid="B40-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] showed that smooth and sharp movement affected emotions in distinct ways: Smooth and round facial features and movement qualities in the sense of smooth or flowing transitions would be rated more positively than sharp facial features and movements with abrupt transitions, which were experienced as threatening. These findings yield empirical evidence that smooth transitions in a range of modalities such as facial features, sound, and rhythm can cause other feelings and visceral sensations than sharp transitions (see Kestenberg, 1995; Fuchs &#x00026; DeJaegher, 2009) [<xref rid="B2-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B41-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The studies of Wallbott (1982) [<xref rid="B39-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and Aronoff et al. (1992) [<xref rid="B40-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] were not yet making the connection to body feedback research, and likewise they failed to differentiate shape and quality in an unequivocal way. Yet, they laid important foundations for further research. Koch (2014) [<xref rid="B24-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] started to experimentally separate shape and quality changes in movement, demonstrating their independent influence on affect and attitude change. By relying on Kestenberg Movement Profile-theory (KMP-theory), the present embrace study again separates both aspects, allowing to investigate the dimension of movement quality (smooth vs. sharp rhythms) independently of the dimension of movement shape regarding their affective and communicative effects. The effects of the dynamic movement quality on attitudes and affect has already been discussed above in the studies on <italic>dynamic body feedback</italic> (Koch, 2011) [<xref rid="B23-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot4-behavsci-07-00080"><title>1.4. Basic Movement Dimensions: Tension-Flow Rhythms and Shape-Flow Rhythms in the KMP</title><p>In the 1970s, movement analyst Judith S. Kestenberg developed a theory system of movement and meaning that she related to developmental processes and clinical meaning: the Kestenberg Movement Profile (KMP; Kestenberg &#x00026; Sossin, 1973; Kestenberg, 1975 [<xref rid="B1-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). She based the system on two theories: Laban Movement Analysis (Laban, 1980) [<xref rid="B26-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and psychoanalytic developmental theory (A. Freud, 1992/1937) [<xref rid="B42-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and subdivided movement into movement qualities (the tension-flow system) and movement form (the shape-flow system). Kestenberg hypothesized among other elements <italic>ten movement rhythms</italic> that express different <italic>needs</italic> of a person and can help to understand needs of preverbal infants and their communication with the caretaker. These movement rhythms fall into two important categories: <italic>indulgent</italic> (with smooth transitions between single rhythms) and <italic>fighting</italic> (with sharp transitions or reversals between single rhythms). Kestenberg exemplified in her teaching that when we embrace a friend, we usually first indulge in rhythms that are smooth, and then use tapping or patting on the back of the partner in order to indicate the wish to separate (Kestenberg, 1995; Loman &#x00026; Kestenberg-Amighi, 1996, personal communication, 28 January 1996) [<xref rid="B1-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><sec id="sec1dot4dot1-behavsci-07-00080"><title>1.4.1. Tension-Flow Rhythms</title><p>Rhythms are small (micro-)movements that accompany us throughout life (while they are universal in meaning, they differ in attributes from person to person and thus reflect an important part of our personality). There are ten basic or pure rhythms. The first developmental rhythm is the <italic>sucking rhythm</italic>; it is hard-wired as a reflex and occurs already in the womb (Loman, 1992) [<xref rid="B43-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The newborn baby is increasingly able to use it more consciously to help organize its entire body. This rhythm serves as self-soothing and is often still seen in adults who try to calm themselves down in stressful situations. The next developmental rhythm is the <italic>biting rhythm</italic>, which is the first &#x0201c;fighting&#x0201d; rhythm, that is, one with sharp reversals. One can see it, for example, in lectures, when people start to tap with one of their feet, or bite on a pencil in order to focus or concentrate. The <italic>biting rhythm</italic> serves for separation, categorization, and selection. Both of these &#x0201c;oral&#x0201d; rhythms develop in the first year of life.

Shape-Flow Rhythms</title><p>Shape-flow rhythms are the continuous changes in growing and shrinking movement of the body. The prototype of growing is inhaling and of shrinking is exhaling. Growing can be observed in the body when an individual is comfortable in his/her environment or with the persons present. Growing and shrinking toward a certain stimulus is approach and avoidance motor behavior. A small child may be shrinking away from the barking dog and growing toward mummy. From growing and shrinking movements, we judge comfort or discomfort of preverbal infants or animals in our surroundings. All organisms on our planet seem to be tied to this principle: when the stimulus is evaluated as &#x0201c;good/nourishing&#x0201d; (e.g., food, persons, sunshine) the organism grows toward it, when it is evaluated as &#x0201c;bad/harmful,&#x0201d; it shrinks away from it (even plants follow this rule; Koch, 2011) [<xref rid="B23-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Preceding this evaluation, there needs to be a rudimentary form of self-recognition: any animal needs to recognize any part of his/her body as his/her own to know the rule: &#x0201c;when hungry, don&#x02019;t eat yourself&#x0201d; (Dennett, 2001) [<xref rid="B49-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Back to shape-flow changes, the breast-fed baby will turn toward the mother&#x02019;s body when hungry, and turn away from the breast when full; the regularly sensitive, &#x0201c;good enough&#x0201d; mother (Winnicott, 1960) [<xref rid="B50-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] will recognize the meaning of these shape-flow utterances and react accordingly.</p><p>Growing and shrinking can occur multi-directionally (bipolar shape-flow), that is, growing in all directions, for example, when suddenly coming into a sunny and warm environment; and it can also occur uni-directionally (unipolar shape-flow), when reacting to one particular stimulus (such as food, or a person in the room; Kestenberg-Amighi et al., 1999) [<xref rid="B3-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Shape-flow movements are thus growing and shrinking movements in reaction to the environment: they indicate comfort or discomfort (bipolar shape-flow: growing or shrinking related to the general environment), or attraction or repulsion (unipolar shape-flow: growing or shrinking related to one particular stimulus, termed <italic>approach or avoidance motor behavior</italic> in cognitive science) in a situation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1dot5-behavsci-07-00080"><title>1.5.

We aimed to carry this line of research on the effects of dynamic body movement one step further into interpersonal research on body feedback to explore the interactive meaning of body rhythms. As we had seen from the experiments of Koch (2014) [<xref rid="B24-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], movement qualities in the form of smooth and sharp rhythms had an affective component with sharp rhythm causing more negative affect, but also causing a defensive reaction when it came to rudimentary attitudes: sharp movement qualities overwrote the effect of approach and avoidance motor behavior on attitudes; the effect of approach and avoidance motor behavior on attitudes/evaluation was only retained when the rhythm transitions enacted were smooth. In embraces, this effect of individual and natural approach and avoidance is now extended to include interpersonal body feedback, and has a clear cultural component in addition. </p></sec><sec id="sec1dot6-behavsci-07-00080"><title>1.6. The Influence of Tactile Feedback in Interpersonal Communication </title><p>In all studies described here, effects of movement have been observed on the affective or the evaluative measures (rudimentary attitudes), not on the cognitive ones. All studies so far had only included the proprioceptive-kinesthetic feedback on one&#x02019;s own affect and attitudes (individual level). To go one step further, we included the interactive processes and consequences of dynamic motor feedback. In this interactive study, we focused on the haptic channel of communication and investigated the communicative implications of movement rhythms.</p><p>Touch is a domain rarely investigated in the social sciences (for an exception see Schubert, Waldzus, &#x00026; Seibt, 2008; Seibt, Neumann, Nussinson, &#x00026; Strack, 2008) [<xref rid="B54-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Montagu (1971) [<xref rid="B56-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] had formulated how essential and central touch and skin contact are for the development of a human being. He stated that &#x0201c;the personal identity has only insofar substance and structure, as it has its fundament in the reality of our bodily experiences&#x0201d; (Montagu, 1971) [<xref rid="B56-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The sense of touch can already be observed in eight-week-old fetuses retreating after a touch of the lips. At this point in time, the embryo is only 2&#x000bd; centimeters tall and has neither eyes nor ears. In agreement with Montagu (1971) [<xref rid="B56-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] on the role of tactile communication, Fuchs (2000; p. 114; first author&#x02019;s translation) [<xref rid="B57-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] states that &#x0201c;the reciprocity of the relation is in no other sense modality as pronounced as in the sphere of touch. Visual auditory and the other &#x02018;distance senses&#x02019; use mediating means such as light and air. The skin is both the separating and the connecting interface, both sense organ (impression) and active communication organ (expression)&#x0201d;.</p><p>We worked with embraces as an independent variable, because they are a relevant social phenomenon of nonverbal communication. In Germany, people do not frequently embrace or kiss in public context, and the main body contact in greetings and saying good-bye is the handshake (see Koch, 2011) [<xref rid="B23-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, embraces in Germany are for close friends, family, and lovers, more so than in neighboring countries such as France or the Netherlands, where one greets with two or three light kisses on the cheek (which also implies a closer social distance, where you can not only sense but also smell the person). For a more differentiated understanding of cultural implications of touch see (Burgoon, Guerrero, &#x00026; Floyd, 2016; Gallace &#x00026; Spence, 2010; McDaniel &#x00026; Andersen, 1998) [<xref rid="B58-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. An embrace always has an active and a passive component: to touch (tactile) and to be touched (haptic), which is only actually a shift in focus, since any touch is always &#x0201c;ambiguous&#x0201d; in this sense (Merleau-Ponty, 1962) [<xref rid="B19-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since our participants were more on the &#x0201c;being hugged/touched&#x0201d; side in this case, we mainly speak of haptic communication.</p><p>In this study, we varied the tension-flow rhythms of the embraces to include one fighting rhythm among two indulgent rhythms, keeping the shape-flow constant. There were <italic>two relevant preliminary studies</italic> preceding this study: An experimental study on the effects from dynamic body feedback from handshakes (Koch, Berger, &#x00026; Schorr; reported in Koch, 2011) [<xref rid="B23-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and a naturalistic study on embraces in the field (Koch, Skibka, Steiner, &#x00026; Grassinger, 2011) [<xref rid="B61-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><sec id="sec1dot6dot1-behavsci-07-00080"><title>1.6.1 Preliminary Study 1: What do Handshakes Communicate?

One confederate was trained to shake the hands of the participants in two different sequences: (a) containing two different indulgent rhythms (&#x000e1; 20 s; sucking and swaying) or (b) containing two different fighting rhythms (&#x000e1; 20 s; biting and straining). Results suggested that rhythms have a direct influence on the perception of affect and personality of the handshaker: round rhythms indicated to our participants that the person was in a better mood, more agreeable, open, and extraverted, whereas sharp rhythms indicated to them that the person was in a worse mood and more neuroticistic. Round rhythms furthermore influenced the mood of the participant in a more positive direction than sharp rhythms (Koch, 2011) [<xref rid="B23-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot6dot2-behavsci-07-00080"><title>1.6.2 Preliminary Study 2: Embraces in Natural Contexts (Koch, Skibka, Steiner, &#x00026; Grassinger, 2011) [<xref rid="B61-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]</title><p>Before starting the embrace experiment, we first observed how embraces were carried out in natural contexts (Koch, Skibka, Steiner, &#x00026; Grassinger, 2011) [<xref rid="B61-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]: Would we be able to see the two phases assumed by Kestenberg? In a field study on two campus cafeterias of major University cities and at two train stations in the same two cities in Southern Germany, we observed <italic>N</italic> = 123 pairs of persons, embracing each other, either to greet or to say good-bye. The observed sequences in the field study provided a relatively clear picture that Kestenberg&#x02019;s assumptions were grounded in the observable reality of free embraces in middle Europe of 2010. The rhythm of the main part of the observed embrace was smooth in 83.5% of the cases, and sharp in 16.5%. The rhythm of the separation part was a bit less clear in its pattern, with 49.5% smooth and 50.5% sharp rhythms observed. The <italic>patterns of rhythm sequencing</italic> was: smooth-smooth (46.6%), smooth-sharp (36.9%), and sharp-sharp (15.5%), and thus confirmed the sequencing assumed by Kestenberg (sharp-smooth only occurred in 1.0% of the persons observed). However, we would have expected less round rhythms toward the end of the embrace. The sharp-sharp pattern was observed exclusively in men embracing other men: in Germany, it seems to be culturally indicated to start patting right away in same-sex embraces between men, probably to not let any questions about sexual orientation come up (i.e., homophobia still seems to impede indulgence between men in public places). In sum, it is important to note that none of the observing students was a KMP-notator, but they were merely trained to observe the rhythms in a 30 min training, therefore observational results need to be interpreted with the according caution (Koch, Skibka, Steiner, &#x00026; Grassinger, 2011) [<xref rid="B61-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

Hypothesis and Operationalizations</title><p>We tested whether the smooth vs. sharp movement rhythms serve as communicative signals to continue with or end an embrace (haptic semantics), with the hypothesis that changes in rhythmic movement qualities from indulgent (smooth) to fighting (sharp) are used in interpersonal communication to indicate the wish to separate; assuming that the haptic signal for the wish to continue or end an embrace will be understood from the change in rhythmic movement qualities the participants are exposed to. Following KMP-theory, smooth rhythms (tension-flow changes with smooth transitions) were assumed to indicate the wish to continue with or indulge in the embrace, while sharp rhythms (tension-flow changes with sharp transitions) were assumed to indicate the wish to separate. This was measured by employing a signal (drop of the handkerchief they held in their hand) that the participants were supposed to provide, when they experienced or noticed that the person embracing them wanted to separate. We chose this method because we did not want the embracer to get irritated or reactive, or the sequences of the embrace to get disturbed by any reaction of the person being embraced (non-reactive method). The drop of the handkerchief was in most cases not noticed by the embracer, in the remaining cases not noticed for sure (from the notes of the embracer). It was, thus, the best non-reactive method we could come up with. Regarding the outcomes, we assumed that the handkerchief would more often be dropped after the onset of the sharp movement rhythm during the embrace. The outcome (=time of signal) was measured in milliseconds (ms) from the onset of the embrace to the time the handkerchief was dropped by the participant. The times were then also related to the rhythm phases. In our experiment, only tension-flow was varied in order to isolate the effect of movement qualities (smooth vs. sharp rhythms), that is, the person embraced tried not to provide any shape-flow cues (such as approach or avoidance behavior signals with the torso), keeping the same distance during the entire embrace.</p><p>Under the assumption that there are sex differences in nonverbal sensitivity that may influence the results (Hall, 1990) [<xref rid="B67-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], with women usually scoring higher on nonverbal sensitivity, we selected the sex of participant as a control variable.

The experimenter informed them that a female person concealed behind the folding screen would embrace them, and that they would be blindfolded to not be distracted by any visual cues. After making sure that all instructions were understood and no questions remained, the experiment started. After a brief relaxation (three deep inhales), the first embrace was given (test run). The embracer then either gave Sequence A or Sequence B of the embrace in silence, keeping the shape-flow constant (the shape of the embrace was always: opening, enclosing, application of the three movement rhythms; at the end of the sequence: opening and stepping back). The person giving the embrace was self-cued for the phase changes, reading the 3 &#x000d7; 10 s from a large wall clock, she was directly looking at. Each participant received two identical embraces (test run and trial run), from the female confederate that had been trained in the application of KMP-rhythms. The time was stopped by the experimenter starting at the onset of the embrace and ending with the time, when the participants dropped their handkerchief. After the second embrace, participants filled in the MBAS-scale again and indicated the experienced closeness and naturalness of the embrace. Then, the Need for Interpersonal Touch Scale (NFIPT-Scale; Nuszbaum et al., 2010) [<xref rid="B68-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] was administered. Finally, the participants answered questions in an open format to capture their experience and observa&#x000ad;tions, and for manipulation check. A test of the experimental set-up had shown that for participants, it was important to know the sex of the embracing person. The according information on the gender of the embracer was thus given in the beginning. After the embrace, the embracer provided an estimation of the perceived muscle tone of each participant, a feature potentially helpful for identifying defensive states (usually, the higher the more defensive). After the debriefing, participants received their course credits and/or the 5 Euros and had the opportunity to see the person who had embraced them. Almost everybody took advantage of this offer.

In order to not lose these persons from the data set, we took the values from the preliminary trial (first embrace) from eight out of those nine participants, in which all of the eight had dropped the handkerchief in the interval between 11 and 19 s. This way, only one person needed to be excluded from data analysis: the one who dropped the handkerchief after the entire 30 s were over in both trials. Because the phases were identical in both embraces, we decided to proceed this way. Participants probably just waited for the shape-flow signal of the embracer the second time (i.e., the opening of the arms and the one step back). While this was also &#x02018;correct&#x02019; (i.e., a valid signal indicating that the embracer wanted to end the embrace), it was not the point of our study: we were interested in whether they would notice the tension-flow signal, that is, the rhythm change to a fighting quality.</p><p>However, to be on the safe side with the computational solution, we also computed the infe&#x000ad;rential statistics for the complete first trial excluding the ones that had waited until the 30th s (<italic>n</italic> = 7), and then computed the inferential statistics for the complete second trial excluding the ones that had waited until the 30th s (<italic>n</italic> = 9), and found very similar same <italic>p</italic>-values and effect sizes in all three ways of computing the main results (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-behavsci-07-00080">Appendix A</xref> for an overview).

The construct was originally derived from the construct &#x0201c;Need for Touch&#x0201d; (NFT) from consumers&#x02019; research, which postulates that touching objects changes consumer behavior.

Effects of Movement Rhythms in Embraces</title><p>In the experimental trial at hand, we examined the effects of smooth vs sharp movement rhythms in an embrace on participants&#x02019; perception of the wish to continue or to end the embrace. Relying on the bidirectionality assumption from <italic>embodiment</italic> research (Neumann &#x00026; Strack, 2000; including body feedback findings from rhythms, Koch, 2014) [<xref rid="B24-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B52-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] as well as Kestenberg&#x02019;s theory on movement rhythms and their meaning (Kestenberg &#x00026; Sossin, 1973/1979; Kestenberg Amighi et al., 1999) [<xref rid="B3-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we hypothesized that for the participants, a rhythm with sharp transitions would signal the wish to separate, whereas a rhythm with smooth transitions would signal the wish to continue the embrace. Participants held a handkerchief in their dominant hand during the embrace by a female confederate, and were instructed to simply let go of it once they perceived that the embracer wanted to separate. Participants dropped their handkerchief significantly more often in the phase with the sharp rhythm transitions than in any other phase of the embrace. There were no affect changes from before the embrace to after the embrace. Participants did not show more positive affect after having received the hug, which may partly be attributed to the experienced artificiality of the laboratory situation, and more generally to the wide variety in which the embrace was experienced by the participants, from strange and uncomfortable to comfortable and comforting (see enumeration in manipulation check, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot3-behavsci-07-00080">Section 3.3</xref>). There was no influence of sex of the embraced person, or of need for interpersonal touch (operationalized with the NFIPT-score) on the outcomes. The findings of the manipulation check indicated that only five persons (8%) of our participants were aware of the specific signal communicating the wish to separate (i.e., the change from a smooth to a sharp movement rhythm), but that 78% of the participants clearly understood the message of the signal, that is, for at least 70% of the participants who correctly understood the signal, this understanding was not tied to awareness of the communicative cue. The findings, thus, confirm the assumption that tension-flow-rhythms mostly operate on an unconscious or implicit level as part of tacit communication.</p><p>Our findings suggest that smooth vs. sharp movement rhythms have a clear semantic of their own. Separation is facilitated by movement qualities with sharp transitions, indulgence by movement qualities with smooth transitions. Danger and safety may be communicated in much the same way, that is, based on partly the same movement cues inside and outside the body, with secure attachment as the prototype of safety in our early years. Future research will have to inspect these connections, their validity, and the breadth of their implications. </p><p>We generally have the bodily sensitivity to respond to movement rhythms in an attuned way, even though we may in many cases not be explicitly aware of the relevant communicative signals. <italic>On the active side</italic>, we use these signals &#x0201c;intuitively&#x0201d; in embraces or in handling babies, other con&#x000ad;specifics, or animals. We &#x0201c;intuitively&#x0201d; know what to do to address their needs, since we all have communicated our needs in this non- and paraverbal (e.g., vocal) fashion from our earliest days on. All human beings understand the meaning of movement and are experts in its implicit use (decoding and encoding) to a lesser or stronger degree. Even in disorders of the embodied self, where the understanding of these communicative nonverbal signals is sometimes disrupted (e.g., in autism spectrum disorder), much of this understanding is intact and we can use it (e.g., rhythmicity) as resources and as means to relate to our clients on a different level than just the verbal. If we become more conscious of this implicit knowledge and start to use it more in therapy and education, we can develop health, learning, and understanding via a different pathway.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-behavsci-07-00080"><title>4.2.

The artificiality of the embrace must be discussed in two respects: <list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(a)</label><p>In a natural embrace, the sharp phase would not continue for 10 s but just until the point that the embracers actually separate, which is quite soon after the onset of a sharp rhythm.

This difference may be due to the fact that in Sequence A the embrace had already lasted a lot longer than in Sequence B.

Hertenstein and Keltner (2011) [<xref rid="B84-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] showed, for example, that males and females differ in their communication of distinct emotions via touch (Nuszbaum et al., 2014) [<xref rid="B75-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Yet, in our study, there was no significant gender effect of the person embraced. Men were slightly, but not significantly, more accurate in terms of the main outcome, which is surprising, because studies on nonverbal communication consistently find an advantage for women in the encoding and decoding of nonverbal cues (Hall, 1990; DePaulo, 1992) [<xref rid="B67-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B80-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Then again, men in our study were mainly students of psychology and humanities, where one could hypothesize a higher than average nonverbal sensitivity. Despite the fact that we did not find any gender differences related to the outcomes, we would assume that it creates a difference whether a female confederate embraces a man or a woman, or whether a male confederate embraces a man or a woman. However, for our female embracer, the <italic>sex of the embraced person</italic> and their <italic>&#x0201c;experienced naturalness&#x0201d; of the embrace</italic> were not correlated in this study <italic>r</italic>(1, 60) = &#x02212;0.046, <italic>p</italic> = 0.728 (<italic>n.s.</italic>). Yet, our preliminary study had clearly shown important gendered pattern of embraces and their phases in natural contexts. A standardized embrace must thus exert different influences on men and women depending on whether the embracer is a man or a woman. The most unnatural embrace in Germany (according to our findings from the preliminary field study) would be a smooth embrace between two men. It would thus not be recommendable to work with a male confederate as the embracer, since according to this rationale in a mixed-sex sample this would introduce considerably more bias than working with a female embracer.</p><p><italic>Culture aspects.</italic> Embraces are highly culturally loaded and highly variable. They have a high context dependency. &#x0201c;For example, in Italy, a hug and kiss on each cheek is considered a common and acceptable form of greeting. By contrast, in Japan the proper greeting consists of a respectful bow and the absence of any tactile contact whatsoever&#x0201d; (Gallace &#x00026; Spence, 2010; p. 248) [<xref rid="B59-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In Germany, people do not as frequently embrace in public business contexts, and do not kiss on the cheek for a greeting or good-bye (as they do in France, Italy, Spain, or the The Netherlands); the regular cultural greeting in Germany is a handshake (see Koch, 2011) [<xref rid="B23-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This is a more distant form of greeting and saying good-bye that in many other European countries (Henley, 1973; McDaniel &#x00026; Andersen, 1998) [<xref rid="B60-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B79-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In this form, you cannot smell or sense the person as much, as when the faces get close for a &#x0201c;kiss&#x0201d; or cheek-to-cheek. Thus, embraces in Germany are more private than in many other European neighboring countries, and in public, they are mostly shared among friends or romantic partners. These context factors must be known and taken into account when interpreting the results. Future studies should extend similar designs to other cultures, or plan cross-cultural comparative studies from the start. While we found two naturalistic studies on observations of airport greetings or goodbyes (of <italic>N</italic> = 152/<italic>N</italic> = 103 pairs of persons) from the US from the 1980s, the aims of these studies were more geared toward the correlation of the length of the greeting to the personal relationship these pairs had (Greenbaum &#x00026; Rosenfeld, 1980; Heslin &#x00026; Boss, 1980) [<xref rid="B85-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B86-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], and thus not targeting our aim. Research on interpersonal touch indicates that the perception of touch also varies greatly&#x02014;and more than that of other sense modalities&#x02014;with context, personal preference (such as need for interpersonal touch; Nuszbaum et al., 2010) [<xref rid="B68-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and perceived intention of the toucher (Schubert et al., 2008; Seibt et al., 2008) [<xref rid="B54-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p><italic>Method aspects.</italic> Furthermore, limitations of the method need to be discussed. Firstly, we used two experimental conditions controlling each other, and thus would suggest to introduce another more neutral/more true control group in the future; secondly, in preparing the data, we replaced eight values of the second embrace with the values of the first embrace, which can be critically discussed: in the second embrace (main trial), nine participants waited to drop their handkerchief for the entire 30 s. We assumed that the discrepancy in the participants&#x02019; behavior from the preliminary to the main trial came about, because participants wanted to demonstrate that they are &#x02018;clever/good&#x02019; participants by just waiting for the shape-flow signal, that is, the actual stepping back of the embracer in the second embrace. While this was clearly also a sign to end the embrace (movement shape/shape-flow as a cue), it was not the sign we wanted to investigate: our focus was on movement quality/tension-flow and rhythmic transitions as a cue; the applied computational method not only enabled us to keep more persons in the data set, but also showed more of the true effect. As displayed in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-behavsci-07-00080">Appendix A</xref>, the analysis results in significant findings, no matter whether this replacement is done or not, with roughly the same effect sizes in all three computational ways possible (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-behavsci-07-00080">Appendix A</xref>). Moreover, as described above, the sharp rhythm should not last for 10 s, since in natural embraces the sharp phase is shorter than the smooth phase. Future studies could refine digital time measurements to reach higher accuracy of reaction times, yet, the time measurement was of sufficient accuracy for the purpose of this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-behavsci-07-00080"><title>4.3. Conclusions and Implications for Future Research</title><p>In sum, the findings of this study support the notion that body rhythms are employed and understood as mostly implicit signals communicating specific meanings, such as the wish to separate from an embrace. Such rhythmic behaviors and their meaning are fundamental elements of the communication with caregivers from the beginning of life, and with partners and friends later in life. Infants seem to be highly sensitive to the dynamic nuances, demonstrating a high plasticity at an early age (Shai &#x00026; Belsky, 2011a; 2011b; Trevarthen, 1999) [<xref rid="B29-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B63-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] flexibly adapting to the family and cultural context. Well known in the area of music therapy, Trevarthen (1999) [<xref rid="B29-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] has termed this same basic rhythmicity <italic>&#x0201c;musicality&#x0201d;</italic>, and&#x02014;based on Bruner&#x02019;s essential theories on culture (1990) [<xref rid="B87-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]&#x02014;puts it this way: &#x0201c;<italic>the parameters of musicality are intrinsically determined in the brain, or innate, and necessary for human development. Through their effects in emotional integration and the collaborative learning that leads to mastery of cultural knowledge, cultural skills, and language, they express the essential generator of human cognitive development</italic>&#x0201d; (Trevarthen, 1999; p. 155) [<xref rid="B29-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Adaptive mechanisms regarding dynamic communicative patterns (rhythmicity/musicality) are assumed to lay the foundation of our culture: family culture, subculture, and larger culture and likely also play a role in interpersonal attraction as well as in aesthetic experience (e.g., of nature or of the arts).</p><p>The connection between <italic>resonance</italic> and <italic>aesthetics</italic> is made by Freedberg and Gallese (2007) [<xref rid="B88-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The authors challenge the primacy of cognition in responses to art, and propose that an important part of the aesthetic response consists of the activation of embodied mechanisms including the simulation of actions, emotions, and corporeal sensation (see also Koch &#x00026; Fuchs, 2011; Koch 2017; Niedenthal et al., 2005) [<xref rid="B89-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,<xref rid="B90-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref rid="B91-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The mechanism of motor simulation, coupled with the emotional resonance it triggers, as suggested by Lipps (1910) [<xref rid="B92-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], is likely to be a crucial component of the aesthetic experience of objects in art works: even a still-life can be &#x02018;animated&#x02019; by the embodied simulation it evokes in the observer&#x02026; (Freedberg &#x00026; Gallese, 2007, p. 201) [<xref rid="B88-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. On a kinetic-kinaesthetic and a tactile-haptic level, we may have aesthetic experiences with habitual rhythmicity that we are used to and have been exposed to in pleasant situations. We may find those patterns more beautiful than others, and alternations in habitual patterns more interesting and understandable than completely different patterns. In a video-clip of a demented old lady, she was gently stroked from the top of the nose to the end of the cheek in a certain (swaying) rhythm: her entire face relaxed and she was getting calm and comfortable, crying some tears of being moved, and then smiling with bliss. She could relate this way of being touched to how she was stroked by her mother, when she was a child, and a relation with beauty clearly stood out. Future research is called to investigate the connection between such bodily resonance, aesthetics, memory, and emotion.</p><p>The present study provides evidence supporting the meaning of (micro-)movements in personal and interpersonal communication that future research can build upon. For cognitive scientists, it underlines the utility of accessing the knowledge of movement analysis for a more differentiated theory and method of bodily systems that influence embodiment effects in a systematic way, and for movement analysts, it emphasizes the integration and servicing of their knowledge for other areas of research. Following <italic>embodiment</italic> theory, our bodies influence the ways we think and feel in multiple important respects (Gallagher, 2006; Gibbs, 2005; Johnson, 2008; Pfeifer &#x00026; Bongard, 2006) [<xref rid="B15-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B93-behavsci-07-00080" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Putting more effort into the research of this knowledge and its implications can advance our understanding of communication, expression, human development, human relations, emotion regulation, and clinical recovery.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This experimental study was conducted at the Department of Psychology at the University of Heidelberg, Germany.
