The optimal management of this fracture is uncertain. When treated with a cast, 88 to 90&#x000a0;% of these fractures unite; however, for the remaining 10-12&#x000a0;% the non-union almost invariably leads to arthritis. The alternative is surgery to fix the scaphoid with a screw at the outset.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We will conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 438 adult patients with a &#x0201c;clear&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;bicortical&#x0201d; scaphoid waist fracture on plain radiographs to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of plaster cast treatment (with fixation of those that fail to unite) versus early surgical fixation. The plaster cast treatment will be immobilisation in a below elbow cast for 6 to 10&#x000a0;weeks followed by mobilisation. If non-union is confirmed on plain radiographs and/or Computerised Tomogram at 6 to 12&#x000a0;weeks, then urgent surgical fixation will be performed. This is being compared with immediate surgical fixation with surgeons using their preferred technique and implant. These treatments will be undertaken in trauma units across the United Kingdom. The primary outcome and end-point will be the Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation (a patient self-reported assessment of wrist pain and function) at 52&#x000a0;weeks and also measured at 6, 12, 26&#x000a0;weeks and 5&#x000a0;years. Secondary outcomes include an assessment of radiological union of the fracture; quality of life; recovery of wrist range and strength; and complications. We will also qualitatively investigate patient experiences of their treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Scaphoid fractures are an important public health problem as they predominantly affect young active individuals in the more productive working years of their lives. Non-union, if untreated, can lead to arthritis which can disable patients at a very young age. There is a rapidly increasing trend for immediate surgical fixation of these fractures but there is insufficient evidence from existing RCTs to support this. The SWIFFT Trial is a rigorously designed and adequately powered study which aims to contribute to the evidence-base to inform clinical decisions for the treatment of this common fracture in adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Register (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN67901257">ISRCTN67901257</ext-link>).

These fractures account for 2 to 7&#x000a0;% of all fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, 10 to 12&#x000a0;% do not unite when treated with plaster cast, with a higher incidence of non-union (14 to 50&#x000a0;%) in displaced fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Non-union, if untreated almost inevitably leads to arthritis, usually within 5&#x000a0;years of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This can potentially disable patients at a relatively young age.</p><p>Recent systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] have found insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to inform clinical decisions on the treatment of scaphoid waist fractures. Eight small RCTs comparing surgery with non-operative management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] could not establish whether patients who had surgical fixation of undisplaced or minimally displaced scaphoid fractures had better longer term outcomes. Surgery in these RCTs was shown to facilitate early return of function, but had a higher complication rate (between 9 and 22&#x000a0;%) compared with conservative management although the complications were usually minor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The rate of union was similar between surgical and cast treatment with early fixation of those fractures that failed to unite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A further study found similar outcomes at 10&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Despite insufficient evidence there is a rapidly increasing trend [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] for immediate surgical fixation compared to cast immobilisation for 6&#x000a0;weeks and fixing only those 10 to 12&#x000a0;% that fail to unite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This current trend to fix fractures may be attributed to potential short-term benefits, but concerns remain about the lack of evidence on long-term benefits and additional risks from surgery, such as malunion, infection, implant related problems and avascular necrosis (AVN).</p><p>Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England recorded a near doubling (1534, 1720 and 2582) of acute scaphoid fracture fixations for the years 2007/8, 2008/9 and 2009/10 respectively. In each of these three years we calculated an expected incidence of scaphoid waist fractures of 4140, 4169 and 4197 (population of 51.1, 51.4 and 51.8 million respectively in England in 2007, 2008 and 2009 and based on a rate of 81 acute scaphoid fractures/million population per year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We had to estimate this as currently the diagnosis of cases that do not receive surgical treatment, or those treated only in the outpatient setting, are not recorded in HES. The rate of surgical fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] rose very slightly from 37 to 41&#x000a0;% from 2007/8 to 2008/9 but then increased sharply to 62&#x000a0;% in 2009/10. This trend of increasing intervention rate for these fractures emphasises the urgent need for this study.</p><p>Little is published on patient experiences after a scaphoid fracture and issues pertinent to recruiting participants into surgical RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There is also poor information on the economic aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] of this injury and its treatment.</p><p>These limitations, identified in the current evidence base, justify this adequately powered study. It will contribute to the evidence base for sound clinical decisions for the treatment of this common fracture in predominantly young adults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This is a pragmatic, multi-centre RCT, investigating whether immediate surgical fixation of minimally displaced fractures of the scaphoid waist leads to better patient reported outcomes when compared to initial non-operative treatment with later surgical fixation of only those fractures that fail to unite.

Those patients who have the fracture fixed may begin wrist exercises as soon as comfort permits if they do not have a plaster cast or as soon as the cast is removed. In this pragmatic trial, any other rehabilitation input beyond the written information sheet (including a formal referral to physiotherapy) is at the discretion of the treating surgeon.

It is a brief, reliable and valid instrument for assessing wrist pain and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Scoring for all the questions is on a 10-point, ordered scale ranging from &#x02018;no pain&#x02019; or &#x02018;no difficultly&#x02019; (0) to &#x02018;worst ever pain&#x02019; or &#x02018;unable to do&#x02019; (10).

For the 10 to 12&#x000a0;% of patients who are treated initially in cast but do not heal, surgery should be performed between 6 and 12&#x000a0;weeks from randomisation. Therefore, if assessed at 26&#x000a0;weeks this would leave only 14 to 20&#x000a0;weeks for healing and recovery to take place.

We judge that a 6 point improvement in the PRWE in the surgery group (compared to the controls) would be a minimal clinical important difference. We estimate the standard deviation of PRWE at 52&#x000a0;weeks to be 20 points from the PRWE User manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. This figure is reported for distal radius fracture rather than scaphoid fracture at 6&#x000a0;months. The only published evidence for scaphoid fracture implies a standard deviation in the range of 8 to 10 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; however, this estimate was at a median of ten years after the patient&#x02019;s injury. To be conservative we have chosen the estimate of standard deviation to be 20, which gives a standard effect size of 0.3 for the 6 point PRWE difference.</p><p>We will use a superiority design to observe an effect size of 0.3 at 80&#x000a0;% power using a 2-sided 5&#x000a0;% significance level requiring 350 participants in total. After allowing for 20&#x000a0;% attrition we need to recruit and randomise 438 participants (219 surgery and 219 controls). The estimate of attrition is likely to be realistic given that four RCTs (three studies were single centre and one study had two centres) included in a systematic review of the treatment of scaphoid fractures found response rates for completion of patient-reported functional outcomes between 77 and 100&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>To minimise attrition we will exclude the rare patient in this population who lacks mental capacity and therefore unlikely to comply with treatment or data collection. Active and systematic follow-up of all randomised participants will be conducted at 6, 12, 26 and 52&#x000a0;weeks when we will arrange for the questionnaire to be completed when the participant attends the clinic. An additional 5&#x000a0;year review is also planned. We will monitor the completion of questionnaires at clinics and share retention figures with each trial site blinded by centre.</p><p>At 52&#x000a0;weeks a &#x000a3;40 payment will be made to patients who attend the clinic. Concurrently we will employ a proven postal strategy for the return of questionnaires. This will include the use of reminder letters after 2 and 4&#x000a0;weeks and the option for completion of an abridged questionnaire (a minimum of the primary outcome and EQ-5D) via telephone after 6&#x000a0;weeks. At 52&#x000a0;weeks only (the primary time-point for the study), in addition to the 6&#x000a0;week telephone call we will write to non-responding patients to ask them to complete the PRWE to help maximise return of the primary outcome. We will still call the patient to complete the remainder of the questionnaire over the telephone. At 26&#x000a0;weeks, when the patient does not need to attend for a hospital appointment, we will include an unconditional incentive payment of &#x000a3;5 with the postal questionnaire. We will also circulate a regular newsletter and update the trial website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.swifft.co.uk/">http://www.swifft.co.uk/</ext-link>), to keep the participants informed of study progress and engaged with the trial.

At the five year follow-up, participants will receive &#x000a3;80 to attend hospital for their clinic review which should cover time off work, travel and parking costs. Finally, to minimise attrition bias, as there is randomised evidence in a recent systematic review that the return of postal questionnaires can be improved when patients are included in a prize draw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], those patients who return the questionnaire at 26&#x000a0;weeks could win an iPad worth &#x000a3;500.

The orthopaedic surgeon will confirm eligibility and invite the patient to consider joining the study. The Research Nurse or clinician will then provide an information sheet and answer any questions. The patient will be asked whether they agree to consent at that time or are offered up to 48&#x000a0;h to discuss the study and their participation with family or friends before deciding.</p><p>When patients have given consent their baseline forms will be completed and randomisation&#x000a0;done. The Research Nurse or recruiting clinician will contact York Trials Unit, either by telephone or via the internet, to access the secure randomisation service. This will ensure treatment concealment and unbiased allocation. Once eligibility is confirmed, patients will be randomised (via a secure, computer generated allocation sequence) to receive immediate surgical fixation or immobilisation of the wrist in a cast.</p><p>Patients and their clinician will be informed of the allocations. As the trial is pragmatic and compares surgery with initial cast treatment, blinding of participants and clinicians to treatment allocation is not possible. When possible, the surgeon will take no part in the postoperative subjective assessment of patients. The statistical analysis will also be performed blind as far as possible. We will mitigate against bias by ensuring that all radiographs and CT scans are assessed by two independent consultant musculoskeletal radiologists and a consultant orthopaedic surgeon.</p><p>As the non-union rate for displaced fractures is 14&#x000a0;% compared with 10&#x000a0;% for transverse undisplaced fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], randomisation will be stratified by the presence or not of displacement of a scaphoid fracture as seen on radiographs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] Within strata, a sequence of confidential random block sizes will be used to generate the block allocation sequence. To avoid predictability of the randomisation we will not stratify by site. The radiographic views to assess displacement should include the semi 45&#x000b0; prone, semi 45&#x000b0;supine and an elongated scaphoid view e.g. Ziter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] type view (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

This magnitude of displacement will avoid compromising surgeon equipoise for non-operative treatment as displacement &#x0003e;2&#x000a0;mm suggests significant instability and therefore the need for surgical intervention.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Radiographic views of a scaphoid fracture.

Any subsequent amendments will be clearly stated and justified. All analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat basis, including all available randomised participants in the groups to which they were allocated. Analyses will be conducted using 2-sided significance tests at the 5&#x000a0;% significance level (unless otherwise stated). The statistician conducting the analyses will remain blind to treatment group until all data summaries and results are finalised. For some variables the type of data reveals treatment allocation (e.g. complication data), hence relevant analyses will be conducted by a second statistician.</p><p>The flow of participants through each stage of the trial will be presented in a CONSORT flow diagram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. PRWE scores will be summarised descriptively (number, mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range, minimum and maximum) at each time point by treatment group and overall. PRWE at baseline will be collected for the time before and after injury. Mean pre-injury PRWE scores will be presented in total and for each treatment group and compared descriptively to PRWE scores post-injury at baseline and all other follow-up time points.</p><p>Our primary analysis will compare total PRWE scores between treatment groups at 52&#x000a0;weeks using a covariance pattern mixed model incorporating all post-randomisation time points, where effects of interest and baseline covariates are specified as fixed effects, and the correlation of observations within patients over time (random effect) is modelled by a covariance structure. The outcome modelled will be PRWE at 6, 12, 26 and 52&#x000a0;weeks, predicted by treatment group, time, treatment group-by-time interaction and adjusting for age, fracture displacement (undisplaced vs. minimally displaced) and hand dominance. Estimates of the difference between treatment groups in total PRWE scores will be derived at all time points with 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals and <italic>p</italic>-values. The primary end point will be the treatment effect estimate at 52&#x000a0;weeks. This model will naturally include all patients who provide data for the baseline covariates, and valid PRWE data for at least one post-randomisation follow-up time point.</p><p>The impact of missing PRWE outcome data will be minimised to some extent by using the mixed model, which allows the inclusion of intermittent responders in the primary analysis. PRWE scores for complete and intermittent responders will be compared descriptively. The impact of missing data will additionally be assessed using multiple imputation by chained equations. Missing outcome and covariate data will be predicted by age, fracture displacement, hand dominance, available PRWE data at other follow-up time points, and any baseline covariates found to be predictive of missing 12&#x000a0;month outcome data.</p><p>All secondary outcomes will be summarised descriptively. The following outcomes will be analysed using the same methods as the primary analysis adjusting for the same covariates: pain and disability subscales of the PRWE, physical health and mental health component summaries of the SF-12 and range and grip strength. Where available, baseline values of the dependent variable will also be included as a covariate in the models. The presence of any complication assessed by clinical examination up to 52&#x000a0;weeks will be analysed by logistic regression (sufficient numbers permitting). Complications will be defined as medical, surgical or plaster cast related. Union will be assessed as a percentage (0&#x02013;100&#x000a0;%) and categorised as: total non-union [0&#x000a0;%]; slight union [&#x0003e;0&#x02013;20]; partial union [&#x0003e;20&#x02013;70]; mostly united [&#x0003e;70&#x02013;&#x0003c;100]; and complete union [100&#x000a0;%]. Summary statistics for union will be presented at each time point by trial arm. Union will be dichotomised into a &#x02018;Probably need surgery&#x02019; group [0&#x02013;20&#x000a0;%] and a &#x02018;Probably do not need surgery&#x02019; group [&#x0003e;20&#x02013;100&#x000a0;%] and analysed using a logistic regression adjusting for treatment group.</p><p>Two subgroup analyses will be undertaken: one exploring patient preferences (surgery, plaster cast, no preference) and the second exploring the type of fracture displacement (undisplaced, displaced), for any differential effect of the trial treatments in these subgroups. Each baseline factor (preference or displacement) and its interaction with the randomised treatment group will be added to the primary analysis model. Our expectation is for patients who preferred surgery to benefit more from surgery over plaster cast treatment and conversely for patients who preferred plaster cast to benefit more from plaster cast than surgery. For patients with a displaced fracture we expect them to benefit more following surgery than patients whose fracture is undisplaced. Since the trial is not powered for these subgroup analyses, any inferences will be made with caution.</p><p>The number of adverse events experienced by each participant and the total number of events overall will be summarised for each treatment group.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Interim analysis</title><p>There are no planned interim analyses for the trial or stopping guidelines. There will, however, be an internal pilot study from which the data will contribute to the final analyses. The primary reason for this pilot study will be to check the assumptions about recruitment and feasibility of the trial. The DMEC and TSC will review the pilot data and recommend whether any changes are required to the trial team and whether the trial should continue or not. Furthermore, as we did not have data on the standard deviation of our primary outcome at one year, we will estimate this for the patients recruited into the internal pilot study. This will inform the potential need to increase the planned sample size as recommended by the independent DMEC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><p>The economic evaluation will assess the relative cost-effectiveness of surgical fixation compared with plaster cast treatment. Costs and health outcomes associated with the interventions will be collected during the 1-year trial period. However, the trial data is unlikely to provide all the evidence to inform the decision on whether surgical treatment represents a cost-effective option to the NHS. Therefore, these costs and outcomes will be extrapolated and modelled over a longer time horizon than captured by the trial (e.g. lifetime of the patient) if this is appropriate given the results of the trial. The additional data from the 5-year follow-up review on the long-term consequences of cast immobilisation and internal fixation, which are not adequately captured in RCTs, will be used to update the model results once available.</p><p>Detailed information will be collected on the costs of surgical fixation, including time in theatre, drugs and hospital bed usage, and the costs associated with plaster cast treatment. The impact of the two treatments on subsequent morbidity costs will be assessed. The use of hospital readmissions, outpatient attendances, general practice, community and personal health services will be collected during the various follow-up points through administered questionnaires. The primary perspective of the analysis will be that of the NHS and Personal Social Services, consistent with that used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Private expenditures related to treatment will also be recorded and these costs will be included in a secondary analysis.</p><p>Health outcomes will be expressed in terms of the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using the EQ-5D data collected at baseline, 6, 12, 26, and 52&#x000a0;weeks follow-up. The EQ-5D scores will be converted into QALYs using area under the curve analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p>Cost and QALY data will be synthesised to generate an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Multivariable regression analyses will be used to assess heterogeneity in costs, QALYs and cost effectiveness.</p><p>The 5-year follow-up review will facilitate an additional analysis that examines the relationship between outcomes reported at 1&#x000a0;year and 5&#x000a0;years. If considered appropriate, structural equation modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] will be used to determine the factors that predict outcomes at 5&#x000a0;years and to assess the predictive performance of outcomes at 1-year. This may also be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of following patients up at 5&#x000a0;years post-surgery in general practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Qualitative study of patient experience</title><p>The qualitative data collected in the nested study will be used to generate a model (or models) which reflect patient experiences of wrist fracture and treatment, and which identify difficulties and advantages of the different treatment options. Such models are likely to focus upon personal and lifestyle attributes as well as physical recovery, and to incorporate a range of non-clinical factors which are not routinely considered in clinical interactions. Insight into participation in a clinical trial will also be generated.</p><p>Sampling to the nested qualitative study will be purposive to include men and women from different trial sites, of different ages, occupations and leisure/sporting activities, and those with scaphoid fractures on their dominant and non-dominant sides. The sample will be drawn primarily from those individuals recruited to the trial (n to be determined by concerns for data saturation, see below). In addition, up to ten individuals who decline participation in the trial will be interviewed to explore their experience of fracture and their reasons for not taking part in the RCT. All participants will be interviewed within 6&#x000a0;weeks of their treatment and those in the trial will be interviewed again following collection of clinical and other data at the primary end-point (52&#x000a0;weeks).</p><p>All interviews will be semi-structured with open questions used to guide a discussion of a patient&#x02019;s experience of treatment, their opinions about treatment benefits and drawbacks, their reflections upon wrist fracture and recovery, and their attitudes towards participating in clinical research. All interviews will be digitally recorded and transcribed in full.</p><p>Following the conventions of the constant comparative method, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] data analysis will be carried out alongside data collection, with interviews transcribed and analysed in batches before further data are collected. In this way, the process is iterative with models and theories developed from &#x02018;within&#x02019; the interviews rather than from existing theory or clinical practice and tested or refined in the collection of more data.</p><p>These models will be further tested and <italic>constantly</italic> refined as new data are considered. Data collection, and analysis, ceases when no new themes or ideas are present in the interview data, and when the model of patient experience is stable and no longer growing or evolving. This point is known as data saturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], previous research suggests that this is often reached with as few as 10&#x02013;13 interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] &#x02013; we are conducting around 40 interviews to include at least 15 from each treatment arm to enable data saturation. Data from those individuals not in the main trial will be considered alongside this data, and considered separately to inform practical concerns of trial recruitment.</p><p>Within this study we would expect to generate up to 4 interrelated models of patient experience: i) reporting patients&#x02019; experiences of wrist fracture, its impact upon their lifestyle, everyday functioning and their recovery; ii) reporting the benefits and difficulties associated with surgical fixation; iii) reporting the benefits and difficulties associated with plaster cast treatment and, iv) reporting experiences and attitudes towards involvement in surgical, clinical research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Adverse event management</title><p>Adverse events (AEs) related to the scaphoid fracture injury and its treatment during the 12&#x000a0;months after randomisation will be recorded by site Investigators and the categorisation of causality and expectedness confirmed by the Chief Investigator. AEs that may be expected with this injury to the wrist or a consequence of the trial treatments that do not need to be reported to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) include infection, delayed wound healing, CRPS, nerve or vessel events, screw related complications, fracture of scaphoid tuberosity, and chondrolysis. There are also adverse events specific to the plaster cast which are expected and do not need reporting to REC: soft cast/broken cast that leads to movement of wrist, pressure sores, CRPS, nerve compression, or pain due to tight cast. Movement in a cast is an untoward event as it can mean the fracture is not properly immobilised which can result in failure of the fracture to unite.</p><p>Serious adverse events that are confirmed to be <italic>related</italic> to the research and are <italic>unexpected</italic> will be reported to REC. All AEs will be routinely reported to the TMG, DMEC, and Sponsor. The DMEC will be responsible for reviewing related <italic>and</italic> unexpected serious adverse events.</p><p>All AEs that are unresolved at initial reporting will be reviewed by the Chief Investigator a month later to ensure that adequate action has been taken and progress made to manage the adverse event. Additional reviews at one month intervals will be conducted when necessary until the Chief Investigator decides that no further reporting is required.</p><p>The Chief Investigator will also be informed, by the reviewers of the X-rays/CT scans collected for the study, of any abnormalities identified. The Chief Investigator will judge whether the abnormality is clinically important and could impact on patient safety (e.g. a protruding screw). The need to notify the Principal Investigator of the site, and whether to record this as an AE, will also be considered. No actions or treatments will be discussed between the Investigators.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Quality control</title><p>The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust will be the Sponsor for this project. This study will be fully compliant with the Research Governance Framework and Medical Research Council Good Clinical Practice Guidance. If a patient wishes to complain formally, they will be advised to do this through the usual NHS Complaints Procedure. If a patient is harmed and this is due to someone&#x02019;s negligence then they may have grounds for legal action or compensation against the Sponsor (in respect of harm arising out of participation in the trial) or the NHS (in respect of any harm which has resulted from the treatment received).</p><p>Review of core trial processes will be undertaken by the Trial Management Group (TMG) on a quarterly basis which includes representation from the Sponsor. These meetings focus on aspects of patient recruitment (e.g. enrolment, consent, eligibility); allocation to study groups; adherence of the trial interventions to the protocol; monitoring of adverse events and reasons for patient withdrawal; and retention of trial participants. When necessary the review will be undertaken at a recruiting site level and information feedback to the Principal Investigator and Research Nurses at each site. Independent review of the trial processes is undertaken every six months by the DMEC and TSC. These committees assist the TMG with their audit of trial processes and advise on strategies to preserve the integrity of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Protocol modifications</title><p>Important protocol modifications are those that are likely to affect to a significant degree: the safety, physical or mental integrity of the subjects of the study; the scientific value of the study; or the conduct or management of the study. These substantial amendments will be submitted to REC for approval having been agreed with: the Funding Body, Sponsor, TSC, DMEC, TMG and the Research Governance Committee for the Department of Health Sciences, University of York. Minor modifications to the protocol will be agreed with the TMG and Sponsor before submission for approval to REC. All amendments will be implemented in the NHS organisations in agreement with the guidance of the Health Research Authority. Trial participants will be written to, if necessary, to explain any changes. All amendments whether substantial or not will be listed in the published Final Report to the Funding Body.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Dissemination policy</title><p>This protocol is being made publically available. It is planned for the full Trial Report up to the 52&#x000a0;week follow-up to be submitted to the Funding Body and for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.. The full trial report will be open access and made available as a permanent archive in the NIHR Journals Library. At the time of publishing the protocol there was no plan to make the anonymised participant level dataset and statistical code for generating the results publicly available. After publication, however, of the main trial findings, an external request that is made for this data and code will be agreed by the TMG and confirmed with the Sponsor and Funding Body.</p><p>The criteria for authorship and contributorship will be taken from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Those who did not design the study or contribute to drafting the work but were involved in the trial conduct (e.g. staff at recruiting sites) will be acknowledged as collaborators. When a journal permits we will list all authors rather than use a group name. There will be a designated writing group for each publication and one or more lead writers who convene the group. Any member of the trial team can propose a publication to the Chief Investigator, Trial Manager and Senior member of York Trials Unit. All members of the trial team will be informed of the proposal who will suggest whether they consider themselves to be a potential author, contributor or neither. The Chief Investigator, Trial Manager and Senior member of York Trials Unit will then agree on this. Order of authorship will be determined by individuals&#x02019; completion of the Author Order Form which weights their contribution to elements of preparing the manuscript. Any individual who feels the order of the authorship does not reflect their input will notify this to the Chief Investigator, Trial Manager and Senior member of York Trials Unit. There are no plans to use professional medical writers to assist with the preparation of trial reports or publications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Discussion</title><p>Scaphoid fractures are an important public health problem as they predominantly affect young active individuals in the more productive working years of their lives. Non-union, if untreated, can lead to arthritis which can disable patients at a very young age. There is a rapidly increasing trend for immediate surgical fixation of these fractures but there is insufficient evidence from existing RCTs to support this. The SWIFFT Trial is a rigorously designed and adequately powered study which aims to contribute to the evidence-base for informing clinical decisions for the treatment of this common fracture in adults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AVN, avascular necrosis; BSSH, British Society for Surgery of the Hand; CONSORT, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials; CRPS, complex regional pain syndrome; CT, computerised tomogram; DMEC, Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee; EQ-5D, EuroQol 5 Dimensions; HES, Hospital Episode Statistics; ICER, incremental cost effectiveness ratio; ISRCTN, International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number; NHS, National Health Service; PRWE, Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation; QALY, quality-adjusted life year; RCT, Randomised Controlled Trial; REC, Research Ethics Committee; SF-12, Short Form 12-Item Questionnaire; SWIFFT, Scaphoid Waist Internal Fixation for Fractures Trial; TMG, Trial Management Group; TSC, Trial Steering Committee</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>SWIFFT Trial Sponsor: University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.</p><p>SWIFFT Trial Patient Representative: Mr Ashley Langton.</p><p>Trial Steering committee: Prof Wendy Baird (<italic>Independent Chair - Director NIHR RDS for Yorkshire and Humber</italic>); Mr Peter Burge (<italic>Independent Member - Consultant Hand Surgeon, Oxford</italic>), Dr Jonathan Cook (<italic>Independent Member - Statistician, University of Oxford</italic>), Mr Nick Welch (<italic>Independent Member &#x02013; Member of BOA Patient Liaison Group</italic>) and Mr Richard Palmer (<italic>Independent Member &#x02013; Member of BOA Patient Liaison Group</italic>).</p><p>Data Monitoring Ethics Committee: Mr Graeme MacLennan (<italic>Independent Chair &#x02013; Senior Statistician, University of Aberdeen</italic>), Mr Adam Watts (<italic>Independent Member &#x02013; Consultant Hand Surgeon, Wrightington</italic>) and Mr Timothy Hems (<italic>Independent Member &#x02013; Consultant Hand Surgeon, Glasgow</italic>).</p><p>Miss Roseanne Billany (Clinical Research Assistant &#x02013; <italic>University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust</italic>).</p><p>Mr Chris Bunce (<italic>Research Assistant</italic> - University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust).</p><p>Mrs Paula Cowan (<italic>Research Secretary</italic> &#x02013; University of York).</p><p>Mrs Elaine James (<italic>Trial Administrator</italic> - University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust).</p><p>Mr Matthew Northgraves (<italic>Trial Co-ordinator</italic> - University of York).</p><p>Dr Sarwat Shah (<italic>Trial Co-ordinator</italic> &#x02013; University of York).</p><p>Dr Garry Tew (<italic>Trial Co-ordinator</italic> - University of York).</p><p>Mrs Nicola Woofenden (<italic>Research Secretary</italic> - University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust).</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The research costs of the study will be funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 11/36/37).
