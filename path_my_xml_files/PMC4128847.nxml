The disease classically manifests in the second decade of life, when the cornea assumes an increasingly conical shape owing to its biomechanical instability.<xref rid="b1-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>After initial encouraging laboratory evidence, a pilot study by Wollensak et al demonstrating successful halting of KC progression was published in 2003. The researchers utilized ultraviolet (UV)A light and riboflavin as a photosensitizer, to induce covalent cross-link bonds between collagen fibers in the corneal stroma, thereby increasing its biomechanical strength and stability.<xref rid="b2-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> There have been numerous publications in the peer-reviewed literature over the last decade, with a variety of methodologies (retrospective, prospective uncontrolled, and randomized controlled trials), addressing the safety and efficacy of corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) in the treatment of KC as well as other corneal ecstatic disorders.<xref rid="b3-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These studies have provided sufficient evidence that CXL is successful in slowing or halting KC progression and may even demonstrate visual, topographic, and aberrometric improvement through induced corneal flattening and reduction in irregular astigmatism.<xref rid="b3-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Importantly, medium- and long-term studies have validated an excellent safety profile for standard CXL (epithelium-off method).<xref rid="b4-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In the Dresden protocol, a 30-minute instillation of riboflavin is followed by 30 minutes of 365 nm UVA illumination at 3 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> (equivalent to a 5.4 J/cm<sup>2</sup> dose).</p><p>The technique of accelerated CXL was recently introduced. This aims to: reduce patient discomfort; to achieve more effective time management; and to avoid the excessive corneal dehydration and thinning that can occur during the 30-minute period and that may lead to deeper penetration and riboflavin/UVA toxicity in the corneal endothelium.<xref rid="b5-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The idea behind CXL is to shorten the illumination time by increasing the illumination intensity, while maintaining a constant radiant exposure of 5.4 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, according to the Bunsen&#x02013;Roscoe law of reciprocity.<xref rid="b6-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> With the recent advances in UV delivery systems, intensities of up to 45 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> are available, which permit a possible reduction of UV exposure time down to 2 minutes.<xref rid="b7-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It has been shown with confocal microscopy that accelerated CXL leads to anterior stromal changes similar to those produced by conventional CXL, lasting for up to 6 months.<xref rid="b9-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of accelerated CXL in the management of progressive KC, in comparison with conventional CXL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The study was a prospective, randomized interventional clinical study in which 25 eyes of 18 patients were randomly divided into two groups: group A, with 14 eyes, received accelerated CXL; and group B, with eleven eyes, received standard CXL (Dresden protocol).<xref rid="b2-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria included grade 1 and 2 KC (Krumeich classification),<xref rid="b10-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> with topographic evidence of progression as defined by: an increase of 1.0 D or more in the steepest keratometry (K); an increase of 1.0 D or more in the manifest cylinder; or an increase of 0.5 D or more in the manifest refraction spherical equivalent over a 6-month period. A minimum pachymetry of 400 &#x003bc;m at the thinnest corneal location was obligatory.</p><p>Cases with apical opacity or hydrops were excluded. A history of herpetic corneal disease or previous ocular surgery were considered contraindications.</p></sec><sec><title>Preoperative assessment</title><p>A slit lamp evaluation, including applanation tonometry and dilated fundoscopy, using a +90 D lens, was performed. Manifest and cycloplegic refraction were recorded. Next, a corneal analysis (Pentacam<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HR Premium; Oculus Optikger&#x000e4;te GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) was performed, and the topographic maps were studied. To study the biomechanical parameters of the cornea, Ocular Response Analyzer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (ORA) (Reichert Technologies, Inc., Depew, NY, USA) measurements were obtained: corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) were recorded.</p><p>The study was conducted according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The Rowad Cornea Center ethical committee approved the study. The nature of the treatment was explained to all patients, and a written informed consent was obtained in all cases.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Science Version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) version 16.0. The independent paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used. A <italic>P</italic> -value &#x02264;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Operative steps</title><p>All cases were performed at Rowad Cornea Center, Giza, Egypt.</p><p>After topical anesthesia, the corneal epithelium was scraped using a crescent knife, and corneal thickness was measured using contact pachymetry (PacScan&#x02122; 300P; Sonomed Escalon&#x02122;, Wayne, PA, USA).</p><p>In group A, a drop of riboflavin 0.1% dextran solution (VibeX&#x02122;; Avedro, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) was applied every 2 minutes for 30 minutes, followed by exposure to UV light (370 nm, 30 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 4 minutes and 20 seconds using the KXL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system (Avedro, Inc.) during which riboflavin was not applied. In the group B patients, a drop of riboflavin 0.1% solution (VibeX) was applied every 2 minutes for 30 minutes, followed by exposure to UV rays (370 nm, 3 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) (UV-X&#x02122;; Peschke Meditrade GmbH, H&#x000fc;nenberg, Switzerland) for 30 minutes during which riboflavin was applied every 2 minutes.</p><p>Care was taken to protect the limbus from inadvertent UV exposure in both groups. Finally, a bandage contact lens was applied, and a topical antibiotic (Zymar; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) and a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug Nevanac (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA) was prescribed. Topical steroids were started after complete epithelial healing and were tapered over 1 month.</p></sec><sec><title>Postoperative evaluation</title><p>Slit lamp examination was performed at 1 day, 4 days, 1 month, 6 months, and at 12 months postsurgery. Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and manifest refraction were measured at 6 months and 12 months. Pentacam corneal analysis and ORA measurements were performed at 6 and 12 months. The entire follow-up period lasted 12 months.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The study included 25 eyes of 18 patients (eleven males and seven females) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-8-1435">Figures 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-opth-8-1435">3</xref>).</p><p>The accelerated CXL group included 14 eyes of ten patients (five females and five males). The mean age of this group was 21.58&#x000b1;5.78 years. In the accelerated CXL group, the mean preoperative flat keratometry (K<sub>min</sub>) was 47.02&#x000b1;1.88 D and was reduced to 46.95&#x000b1;2.06 D at 6 months after surgery. The reduction was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.46). At 12 months, it declined further, to 46.6&#x000b1;1.89 D; however, the reduction from baseline values was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.28).

One case in the conventional group developed severe central haze (grade 4), which decreased gradually over the following months; at 1-year postsurgery, the patient still had a faint anterior stromal opacity, with no loss of UCVA or BSCVA.

The explanation is that the former two groups included more advanced cases of KC, while the latter two groups included mild- to moderate-KC cases as the amount of flattening by CXL is directly proportional to the steepness of the cornea.<xref rid="b17-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>In our study, the accelerated CXL group showed a significant reduction of the CCT 6 months after surgery, which gradually increased afterwards. A similar behavior was observed in the conventional CXL group and is similar to previous reports. The early thinning may be attributed to the compression of collagen fibrils or keratocyte apoptosis, among other theories.<xref rid="b18-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The cause of the later thickening between 6 and 12 months is still unclear.<xref rid="b18-opth-8-1435" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement in BSCVA, 1 year after surgery.

One case in the conventional CXL group developed severe anterior stromal haze (grade 4) that decreased gradually with topical steroids; at 12-months postoperative, an opacity was still visible (grade 2).
