Systemic absorption of adrenaline often leads to adverse hemodynamic responses such as hypertension and arrhythmias.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Anesthetic agents can modulate these hemodynamic responses. It is known that hemodynamic responses to low-dose of adrenaline used to test accidental intravascular placement of epidural catheter is attenuated by anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Infiltration of surgical incision site for cleft palate surgery is likely to result in significant systemic absorption of adrenaline due to the high vascularity of the tissues.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The effects of isoflurane (ISO) and sevoflurane (SEVO) in modulating the hemodynamic response to surgical site infiltration of adrenaline in children undergoing cleft palate surgery have not been compared. The aim of this study was to compare the hemodynamic changes to adrenaline infiltration during general anesthesia with iso-minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC) of ISO and SEVO.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>Approval of Institutional Ethics Committee and informed consent from the legal guardians of the participating children was obtained. Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 1 children undergoing cleft palate surgery aged between 9 and 48 months, belonging to either sex, weighing between 8 and 20 kg were enrolled. Children with re-operations, congenital syndromes, cardiac disease, arrhythmias, respiratory disorders including upper respiratory infections within 3 weeks of surgery, renal or hepatic dysfunction, and muscular dystrophy were excluded at initial assessment for eligibility. The eligible children were randomly allocated into two groups using computer-generated random numbers, group ISO &#x02014; maintained on ISO at 2 MAC with nitrous oxide 50% and group SEVO &#x02014; maintained on SEVO 2 MAC with nitrous oxide 50%. All patients were premedicated with oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg. After 15 min of premedication, when the children were sedated and separable from parents, they were brought into the operating room (OR) and induced with inhaled SEVO 7% with O<sub>2</sub>. Monitoring in the OR included electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure (BP), temperature, and capnography. Venous access was obtained after induction and intravenous fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg was administered. Intubation was done when MAC was about 3 and the following criteria were met - the child was immobile, and the limbs were floppy. Intubation was performed with appropriated sized RAE tube and connected to closed circuit with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg and respiratory rate adjusted to obtain normocapnia (EtCO<sub>2</sub> of 35-40 mmHg). Anesthesia was maintained with O<sub>2</sub> (50%), N<sub>2</sub> O (50%) and SEVO or ISO at 2 MAC as per randomization. The initial gas flow rates were set around 2-3 l to obtain the desired end tidal anesthetic agent (ETAA) concentration and then reduced to 1 l. After the initial inclusion, patients who required more than one attempt, more lifting force or pressure on the neck at intubation were excluded. Events such as bronchospasm, change or adjustment of the endotracheal tube, movement of patient requiring intervention with change in inhalational agent or administration of vasoactive drug were excluded after initial inclusion. EtCO<sub>2</sub> and ETAA were stabilized for 5 min. The baseline heart rate (HR) and BP were noted. The surgical site was infiltrated with 1 ml/kg of 1:200,000 solution of adrenaline with 0.5% lignocaine. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were noted at the end of infiltration and every 1 min for 5 min following infiltration. The highest HR, SBP, and any arrhythmias were noted. No surgical stimulus or movement of the patient was performed during this period. Patients who required alteration of anesthetic agent concentration during the study period were excluded from the study. The bleeding from the incision site was graded as mild, moderate and severe by the operating surgeon. The anesthetic management and the surgical management after the study period were as per the institutional protocol.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was determined using PASS based on the results from the pilot study on 20 children (6 excluded). A group sample size of 19 each (allocation ratio 1:1) was required to achieve 80% power to detect a difference of &#x02212;24.0 in SBP with standard deviations of 24.0 and 27.0 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test (equal variance not assumed). Hence, 60 children were recruited.</p><p>The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 17.0, Chicago, SPSS Inc. The normality of the data was tested using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z. The normally distributed continuous data were described as mean and 95% confidence interval for mean (95% CI), as median with interquartile range (IQR) when the distribution was not normal, and categorical data are expressed as number with percentage. The continuous variables were compared between the groups using independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test for data distributed normally and nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test when skewed, and categorical data were compared using Chi-square test and fishers exact test when the expected cell value of &#x0003e;50% of the cells was &#x0003c;5. The changes in the hemodynamics from baseline within groups were analyzed using ANOVA for repeated variables and post-hoc Dunnett test was performed with baseline as control.

Systemic absorption of adrenaline infiltration often leads to adverse hemodynamic responses.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Some authors have shown minimal adverse effects with adrenaline infiltration[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] while others reported that increased blood levels of adrenaline results in major changes in arterial BP and HR even following sub-maximal doses of adrenaline in association with anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] There are several reports of hypertension,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] arrhythmia[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and cardiac arrest resulting from surgical field infiltration of adrenaline.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Matsumae reported ventricular tachycardia, severe hypertension, and pulmonary edema following infiltration of adrenalnine.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Hypertension was noted in 21.6% children, and there were no instances of clinically unstable tachycardia or arrhythmia with a dose of 12.5 &#x003bc;g/kg of adrenaline used as infiltration in children undergoing palate surgeries.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, their definition of significant change was SBP, &#x0003e;120 or DBP, &#x0003e;70 and tachycardia (&#x0003e;190 beats/min) as defined by the American Heart Association guidelines. A change of &#x0003e;20% from the baseline was defined as significant change in our study. The addition of lignocaine to adrenaline[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and use of lower adrenaline concentrations have shown to limit the hemodynamic responses.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Muthukumar <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that 1:400,000 adrenaline and 1:200,000 adrenaline with lignocaine 0.5-0.7% provided stable hemodynamics. Significant hemodynamic changes were seen only in children administered 1:200,000 adrenaline without lignocaine.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>General anesthesia with volatile anesthetic agents is commonly practiced in children.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The anesthetic agents influence the cardiovascular function. Some authors reported more hemodynamic stability with SEVO[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] while others reported no significant difference in hemodynamics during maintenance of anesthesia with ISO or SEVO.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The hemodynamics during maintenance of anesthesia with ISO or SEVO was comparable in this study. The arrhythmogenicity of ISO and SEVO was also found to be comparable.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It has been observed that there has been only moderate change in cardio-circulatory parameters during general anesthesia despite significant elevations of epinephrine serum levels after local infiltration for surgical correction of clefts.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The hemodynamic responses to intravascular injection of low-dose adrenaline, commonly used as test doses of the epidural, are altered by volatile anesthetic agents during general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The peak HR response and the sensitivity to detect intravascular injection following 15 &#x003bc;g of adrenaline were significantly lower during general anesthesia. However, the influence of ISO and SEVO on the hemodynamic responses to adrenaline infiltration of the surgical field have not been compared. In this study, we compared the hemodynamic responses to surgical field infiltration of adrenaline during general anesthesia with ISO and SEVO. The HR responses to infiltration were comparable with both anesthetic agents. The increase in BP was lesser with ISO than SEVO. ISO produces greater relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and decrease in cytosolic calcium than SEVO.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This could have resulted in the attenuation of BP following adrenaline infiltration during ISO anesthesia observed in our study. The peak presser responses in both the groups occurred after about 2 min of infiltration of adrenaline and were transient. The peak response was greater during SEVO anesthesia than ISO anesthesia. The hemodynamic responses exhibited a trend to return to baseline by 5 min. The time required to return to baseline was not noted as the study concluded 5 min after the infiltration. There were no instances of arrhythmia in any of the patients in this study. There is a high incidence of associated congenital heart disease in children undergoing cleft lip and palate surgery.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The hemodynamic responses to adrenaline infiltration can be potentially hazardous in these children as it can alter the shunt fraction. The results of this study may guide the choice of anesthetic agents during adrenaline infiltration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Isoflurane results in
