It is estimated that individuals who are physically active have a 30% to 50% lower risk of chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Physical activity is particularly important for older adults as chronic disease risk increases with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Physical activity also reduces the risk of falls by 17% in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and improves symptoms in those diagnosed with depression or dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] which are more common in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Despite the health benefits of physical activity, only 48% of Australian adults are meeting the physical activity guidelines for good health, and this is even lower in adults aged 55&#x02013;65 (43%) and 65&#x02013;75 (40%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Inactivity is contributing to the burden of Australia&#x02019;s aging population on the health care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Interventions are needed to promote physical activity in older adults to help them to maintain their health and prevent chronic disease and mental health problems as they age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The Internet is an effective way to deliver physical activity interventions in adult populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Web-based interventions have time, geographical and financial advantages over face-to-face interventions. This enables programs to be delivered to large populations at low cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and they have also demonstrated that they can be as effective as face-to-face interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Older adults are the fastest growing age group of Internet users, with 77% of Australian adults aged 55+ years already connected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Web-based physical activity interventions are well accepted by older adults and older participants have been found to have greater increases in physical activity compared to younger participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As such, web-based interventions are potentially well suited to older adults, but this area is under-researched.</p><p id="Par12">Challenges with web-based physical activity interventions in adults of all ages include low satisfaction, website usage and retention. This limits long-term behavioural outcomes, as higher intervention exposure is associated with more positive behavioural outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Greater website interactivity has shown to improve website usage and engagement in middle age adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This may also be the case in older adults, however their Internet literacy remains lower, which may influence how they use more complex and interactive websites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, it is not known if enhanced interactivity in a web-based physical activity intervention is effective at engaging older adults in terms of improved satisfaction, usability and website usage and if satisfaction, usability and website usage is higher in older adults with higher Internet literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Next generation Web 2.0 applications have potential to improve the interactivity and engagement of static Web 1.0 health websites with fixed content. Web 2.0 applications are aimed at giving users control of how information is generated and shared, and include social networking, blogs, wikis, podcasts, mash-ups and video sharing sites. Web 2.0 has become common on the Internet, and users have become accustomed to this level of interactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In response to the high use of Web 2.0 applications, some recent web-based physical activity interventions have included Web 2.0 applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Maher, Lewis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] found in their systematic review on web-based health behaviour change interventions incorporating online social networks that 9 out of 10 interventions lead to positive health behaviour changes. Social networking use is higher and more frequent in younger adults, with 79% of adults 30&#x02013;49&#x000a0;years being Facebook users in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, there has been an increase of older adults using such applications. For example, the percentage of older adults aged 50&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years and 65+ years with Internet access who used the social networking site, Facebook rose between 2012 to 2015 (52 to 64% and 35 to 48% respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Despite the rise in the number of older adults using Web 2.0 applications, older adults&#x02019; lower and less frequent use of Web 2.0 features may mean that they have a lower satisfaction and usage of Web 2.0 features in a web-based physical activity intervention when compared to younger adults.</p><p id="Par14">This study builds on a previous RCT that demonstrated greater website usage and physical activity improvements of a Web 2.0 website for increasing physical activity compared to a Web 1.0 website in a sample with high age variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The first aim of this study was to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (&#x0003c;55y and &#x02265;55y) exists for intervention satisfaction, usability and website usage (assessed through non-usage attrition, website visits, time on site, days with step entry). The second aim of this study was to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (&#x0003c;55y and &#x02265;55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in moderate to vigorous physical activity and step counts). The third aim was to investigate whether an interaction between Internet self-efficacy and intervention group (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) exists for satisfaction, usability, website usage, and intervention effectiveness in older adults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par15">This paper used data from the WALK 2.0 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], a three-arm randomised controlled trial investigating the efficacy of a web-based physical activity intervention with Web 2.0 features in comparison to a Web 1.0 physical activity intervention and a physical activity logbook.

Although the standard cut off used to define &#x02018;older adults&#x02019; is 65&#x000a0;years, the &#x02265;55y group is a useful target for physical activity interventions to help them to establish healthy physical activity habits and reduce their risk of disease before they enter into the 65+ age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. People over 55y have lower Internet literacy than younger age groups and it is therefore likely that they will interact and engage with Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 features differently to younger adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

The variance of Internet self-efficacy scores was also greater in older (2.41) compared to younger adults (1.58).</p><p id="Par36">Within older adults, a significant interaction between older adults&#x02019; Internet self-efficacy and intervention group for time on the website was observed at 3&#x000a0;months (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.11, 95%CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.00&#x02013;1.51, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05), demonstrating that higher Internet self-efficacy was associated with more time spent on the website, and this effect was significantly stronger for the Web 2.0 intervention. There were no interactions between older adults&#x02019; Internet self-efficacy and intervention group for satisfaction, usability, non-usage attrition, days with a step entry or number of visits to the website. Within older adults, no interactions between Internet self-efficacy and intervention group (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) were found on physical activity (MVPA or step changes) from baseline to 3&#x000a0;months, 12&#x000a0;months, or 18&#x000a0;months.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par37">This study aimed to determine whether there were age differences in intervention satisfaction, usability, website usage and effectiveness in a Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 physical activity intervention. The original WALK 2.0 trial demonstrated higher website usage and behaviour changes in those who received the Web 2.0 intervention, and the interpretation and discussion of those outcomes has been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, age-related differences have not been published or discussed in relation to this study. The current study found that older adults had more website visits than younger adults, but this did not differ by intervention. Website usage (i.e., time on site) was significantly higher for the Web 2.0 intervention, and this effect was stronger in the older adult age group. This finding was unexpected as older adults in general have a lower use of Web 2.0 features such as social media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. It is possible that the older adults&#x02019; spent longer on the Web 2.0 intervention as they had more leisure time to interact with the Web 2.0 features compared to younger participants due to being retired. The average age for retirement in Australia is 63, which also was the average age of the older adult group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The older adults may also be more willing to invest time in their health compared to younger adults as they are at an age where they are at a higher risk of developing chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The Web 2.0 features may have given them more opportunity to engage compared to the Web 1.0 website. Alternatively, it could be possible that the older adults took more time to work out how to use the Web 2.0 features, or used different Web 2.0 features than the younger participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Further research is needed to investigate how older adults interact with specific Web 2.0 features as part of a behaviour change intervention. Based on the longer time on site for older adults in the Web 2.0 intervention, future interventions targeting older adults should consider using Web 2.0 features to encourage greater website use.</p><p id="Par38">No interactions between intervention and age on satisfaction, usability or non-usage attrition were observed, and older adults were less satisfied with both web-based interventions compared to younger adults at 3&#x000a0;months. No satisfaction differences were found at 12 and 18-months, however this may be affected by low participant numbers at these time points. It is interesting that the older adults&#x02019; satisfaction did not differ between the Web 1.0 and the more interactive Web 2.0 intervention. Therefore, whilst the Web 2.0 features were not problematic for older adults, they did not improve satisfaction. This finding suggests that the low satisfaction was not due to the features of either website, but due to the web-based method itself. Older adults may not be as comfortable as younger adults in using the Internet for behavioural interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], or they may prefer face-to-face social support to help motivate them to increase their activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The lower satisfaction in older adults may also be due to the Internet use not being as well integrated into their daily lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and should be considered when developing physical activity interventions for this age group.</p><p id="Par39">The results of the current study demonstrated greater effectiveness of the Web 2.0 intervention compared to the logbook intervention in older compared to younger adults, whilst effectiveness of the Web 1.0 intervention in comparison to the logbook intervention did not differ by age. The increased effectiveness of the Web 2.0 intervention in older compared to younger adults is in line with past research which found that a web-based physical activity intervention providing interactive tailored advice was more effective in older compared to younger adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This finding may be due to older adults having more time to engage with interactive website components (over just reading text on a static page, which takes less time), which motivated them to increase their activity further. The older participants may have also had more time to be active compared to the younger participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Despite the effectiveness of the Web 2.0 intervention compared to the logbook intervention, particularly in older adults, there was no interaction for age and the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention. Therefore we do not know if the Web 2.0 features significantly impacted behaviour change. Interactive features that provide peer or counsellor support improve engagement in behaviour change interventions across all ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], however further research is needed to investigate which specific Web 2.0 features are most effective at contributing to behaviour change in older adults. Furthermore, whilst our results indicate that an intervention with interactive features may be effective at improving short-term intervention effectiveness in older adults, more research is needed to investigate how such interventions can assist older adults maintain their activity levels in the long-term.</p><p id="Par40">The findings revealed that Internet self-efficacy in older adults was positively associated with usability ratings and intervention satisfaction. The lower levels of satisfaction in older adults could therefore be due to this group&#x02019;s lower levels of Internet self-efficacy. However, Internet self-efficacy was also positively associated with older adults&#x02019; time spent on the website; for which the effect was stronger for those in the Web 2.0 intervention. Therefore, as Web 2.0 features are more complex, they are likely to be better suited to older adults with a high Internet self-efficacy who have a greater understanding and confidence in using the Internet. Yet, the lower Internet self-efficacy in older adults was not enough to influence the overall effectiveness of the Web 2.0 intervention in this age group. These conflicting outcomes make it difficult to determine the importance of a high or low Internet self-efficacy for engagement and behaviour changes of web-based physical activity interventions for older adults, and other studies should also investigate this. On a positive note, Internet self-efficacy within older adults is likely to increase over the coming years as an increasing number of older adults have used the Internet for a significant portion of their working lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">This study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of a web based physical activity intervention with interactive Web 2.0 features compared to a Web 1.0 and logbook intervention in older adults. The findings are important for informing the next generation of web-based interventions with a wide reach for older adults. Strengths of the study include the objective physical activity measures, the large sample and the long-term follow up. However due to the nature of the RCT with the long term follow up, and the quickly advancing Internet technology, the Web 2.0 technology used in the intervention may already be outdated to some extent. Further, attrition may have affected the ability to detect satisfaction, usability and website usage differences by age and intervention at 12 and 18&#x000a0;months and biased physical activity outcomes at 12 and 18&#x000a0;months. Lastly, the number of older adults over the age of 65 was small, which required an age cut-off of 55 to maintain adequate statistical power. Further research is needed to test the effectiveness of web-based physical activity interventions in older adults with a larger cohort of older adults to allow further age break down (e.g. 55&#x02013;65 and 65+) and investigate the influence on other factors relevant to older adults including chronic disease status and retirement status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">The findings demonstrate that web-based physical activity interventions can be more engaging and effective in older compared to younger adults, and that interventions with Web 2.0 features are particularly engaging and effective in older adults. Although the Web 2.0 intervention was not as engaging in older adults with a low Internet self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy was not associated with older adults&#x02019; physical activity changes. Future web-based interventions targeting older adults are recommended to include Web 2.0 features to improve website usage and optimise physical activity outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec26"><p>
