Various protocols have been proposed to reduce postoperative pain. However, each one has special side effects and limitations. As green tea possesses anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of green tea mouthwash in controlling postoperative pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In a study with split-mouth and double blind design, 44 patients in need of bilateral removal of impacted third molars underwent randomized surgical extraction; following one surgery patients rinsed with a green tea mouthwash from the first to seventh postoperative day and after other extraction rinsed with placebo mouthwash in the same duration. Both patients and surgeon were blinded to the type of mouthwash. The predictor variable was type of mouthwash and primary outcome variable was postoperative pain measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) during first week after surgery. In addition, number of analgesics patients used after surgery recorded. To measure the effect of green tea mouthwash, repeated measures test with confidence interval of 95% was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Total of 43 patients with mean age of 24&#x000a0;years underwent total of 86 surgeries. VAS value had no statistically difference prior rinsing among groups (P-value&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). However, the mean value of VAS following rinsing with green tea was statistically lower than placebo in postoperative days of 3&#x02013;7 (P-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). In addition, while rinsing with green tea, patients took significantly lower number of analgesics after surgery (P-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). No side effects reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Green tea mouthwash could be an appropriate and safe choice to control postoperative pain after third molar surgery.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Camellia sinensis</kwd><kwd>Impacted third molar</kwd><kwd>Mouthwash</kwd><kwd>Oral surgery</kwd><kwd>Postoperative pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The main aim of dental practices is not only to provide appropriate treatment and restore function, but also is to remove pain and bring relief the to their patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. On the other hand, changes in lifestyle have resulted in smaller human jaw and lack of enough space for third molar eruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Hence, incidence of third molar impaction has increased and postoperative pain following surgical removal of third molar teeth has remained an important concern in need of control for many practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition to the inconvenience, the perception of patient toward dental practice would change after pain experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Various medications have been used to control postoperative pain following surgical removal of impacted molar teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Analgesics including paracetamole and diclofenac sodium in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used to control postoperative pain. However, gastrointestinal and renal complications are of possible side effects reported for NSAIDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Green tea (Camellia Sinensis) has been a popular drink in eastern countries for many years. Green tea is very rich in polyphenols including catechins which possess antioxidant, antidiabetic, antimutagenic, antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It has reported that green tea is effective on periodontal diseases and is also beneficial against cariogenic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, there exists no study to investigate benefits of green tea extract in controlling postoperative complications in oral surgeries.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to address the following question: is green tea mouthwash effective in relieving the pain following surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars? The investigators hypothesized that the pain following rinsing with green tea after surgical removal of mandibular impacted third molar would equal to the pain following rinsing with placebo mouthwash.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and method</title><p>This study was performed at Mashhad Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic.

The rinse poured into 250&#x000a0;ml dark bottles. The placebo mouthwash consisted 250&#x000a0;ml distilled water. In addition, the mint flavor added to both study and placebo rinses to make the rinse type unidentifiable for patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>All the surgeries performed by an experienced surgeon using the same protocol: povidone iodine solution was applied around the mouth; 2% lidocaine&#x02009;+&#x02009;1:80,000 epinephrine carpules were used to block the inferior alveolar/long buccal nerves; a mucoperiosteal envelop flap was created using a standard incision; if needed, bone removal, tooth sectioning, and bone recontouring were performed with a low-speed handpiece under sufficient sterile solution irrigation; following tooth removal the socket was irrigated with 60&#x000a0;ml of saline; the flap was sutured using 3&#x02013;0 silk sutures. Patients were instructed to take two pills of Acetaminophen (325&#x000a0;mg) one prior the surgery and another 4&#x000a0;h after surgery. From the next day, patients instructed to take analgesics (Acetaminophen) after VAS assessment and also to record time and number of analgesics they had taken.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient allocation</title><p>Following each surgery, patients received a bottle containing 250&#x000a0;ml mouthwash. Each patient received both green tea extract and placebo mouthwash during study period; however, the type of rinse received for the first surgery was selected by flip of a coin. Randomization of surgical side in each patient was kept unknown to surgeon and patients till the end of the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Patients were instructed to rinse with 15&#x000a0;ml of mouthwash two times per day from one day after surgery till seven consecutive days. To record the pain, patients were instructed to quantify the level of their pain by using a 100&#x000a0;mm ruler as the visual analogue scale (VAS); 0 was no pain and 100 was severe and unbearable pain. Each VAS was recorded at the morning of 7 consecutive postoperative days before taking any analgesic medication and prior to rinsing.</p><p>Two follow-up appointments, two days and 7&#x000a0;days after surgery, were held after each surgery to evaluate the healing process. In addition, the patients were told to come back if they faced persistent or increasing pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Appropriate descriptive statistics (including mean, frequency, range, or standard deviation) computed for each variable.

To relief this pain, various protocols have been proposed; none of which was based on herbal medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism of postoperative pain has dedicated to trauma during surgery as it increases biochemical mediators of pain and inflammation including prostaglandins, histamine, bradykinine, and serotonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These mediators initiate the inflammatory process. As a result, anti-inflammatory drugs, including NSAIDs, are commonly prescribed to control postoperative pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, renal function impairment, and platelet function inhibition are of possible side effects mentioned for NSAIDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Aromatic components of green tea have shown anti-inflammatory properties at the site of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Results of the current study indicated that green tea extract effectively reduced the postoperative pain after initiation of rinsing. This could be dedicated to anti-inflammatory action of green tea components at the site of surgery.</p><p>In addition to inflammation, bacterial infection following impacted molar surgery increases postoperative pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Catechins of green tea (EGC, EGCg, and ECg) possess antibacterial activities and in vitro and in vivo studies have reported effectiveness of green tea against bacteria in periodontal diseases and caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Hence, the results of the current study could be also attributed to antibacterial properties of green tea mouthwash along with its anti-inflammatory activity.</p><p>The effectiveness of green tea mouthwash was in consistent with studies using antibiotics, chlorhexidine mouthwash, or low level laser therapy (LLLT) which have shown significant reduction in postoperative complications including pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, rinsing with green tea does not possess the side effects of antibiotics (including bacterial resistancy) and chlorhexidine (including taste changes and oral discoloration). Moreover, green tea is commonly available in eastern countries and its accessibility and cost make it more appropriate in such countries in comparison to low level laser therapy.</p><p>This study was double blind as either the surgeon or the patient had no idea about rinsing solution. In addition, as the study was split-mouth, each patient served as his/her own control. This design led to elimination of age and gender as confounding variables. We also controlled for other confounding factors including difficulty of surgery, operation time, surgeon experience, and number of analgesics used after surgery.</p><p>Previous reports state that amount of trauma during surgery affect the magnitude of postoperative pain directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Two indices of trauma in molar extraction surgery are extraction difficulty score (based on radiograph) and operation time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the current study both factors had no significant differences in study and control group. Moreover, experience of surgeon could also affect the amount of trauma and hence postoperative complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This factor also eliminated as all the surgeries performed by one surgeon.</p><p>According to the results of this study, number of patients used analgesics and also number of analgesics taken, were lesser in study group in comparison to control group. This could be dedicated to effectiveness of green tea in controlling postoperative pain. In addition, as the greater proportion of analgesics was taken during first two days after surgery and control group used higher number of analgesics, the insignificant difference in VAS of second day in two study groups may be related to analgesic drugs.</p><p>Pain has a subjective nature and there exists difficulties to measure it. Seymour et al. reported that visual analogue scale (VAS) is a sensitive and reliable tool to evaluate the pain following surgical extraction of impacted molars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This scale has been used widely in the studies that investigate the effectiveness of pain interventions after oral surgeries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. According to the essence of pain, in the most of the studies the personal differences in participants play as a confounding factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, in the current study the pain scale of each participant compared to his/her own pain following rinsing with two types of mouthwash.</p><p>There were also some limitations in the current study. Rinsing with mouthwash during the day of surgery lead to blood clot resolution; hence, we had to prescribe analgesics at the day of surgery &#x02013; as the postoperative pain reaches highest level 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;h after surgery &#x02013; and instruct patients to start rinsing at the first postoperative day. This limitation is under research as investigators have designed a study to use green tea extract via slow releasing systems that is usable immediately after surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the current study indicated that daily rinsing with green tea may be beneficial to control postoperative complications of impacted molar surgery including pain. Moreover, the need for analgesics would become less and side effects following using antibiotics, NSAIDs, or chlorhexidine mouthwash could be escaped.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ME and AN designed the study and wrote the study protocol.
