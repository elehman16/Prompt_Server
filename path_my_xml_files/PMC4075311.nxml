Previous studies have tested calcium supplementation and aspirin separately to reduce
the incidence of preeclampsia but not the effects of combined supplementation. The
objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of aspirin combined with
calcium supplementation to prevent preeclampsia in women with chronic hypertension. A
double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was carried out at the
antenatal clinic of a large university hospital in S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil. A total of
49 women with chronic hypertension and abnormal uterine artery Doppler at 20-27 weeks
gestation were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 26) or 100 mg aspirin plus 2
g calcium (N = 23) daily until delivery. The main outcome of this pilot study was
development of superimposed preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes were fetal growth
restriction and preterm birth. The rate of superimposed preeclampsia was 28.6% lower
among women receiving aspirin plus calcium than in the placebo group (52.2
<italic>vs</italic> 73.1%, respectively, P=0.112). The rate of fetal growth
restriction was reduced by 80.8% in the supplemented group (25 <italic>vs</italic>
4.8% in the placebo <italic>vs</italic> supplemented groups, respectively; P=0.073).
The rate of preterm birth was 33.3% in both groups. The combined supplementation of
aspirin and calcium starting at 20-27 weeks of gestation produced a nonsignificant
decrease in the incidence of superimposed preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction
in hypertensive women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Preeclampsia</kwd><kwd>Hypertension</kwd><kwd>Ultrasonography</kwd><kwd>Doppler</kwd><kwd>Calcium carbonate</kwd><kwd>Aspirin</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="37"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are still the leading cause of maternal mortality in
developing nations. According to the most recent World Health Organization review,
hypertensive disorders accounted for 25% of all maternal deaths in Latin America and the
Caribbean, leading to 3800 deaths each year in the region (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Superimposed preeclampsia is a condition characterized by
increasing blood pressure and proteinuria after the 20th week of pregnancy in women with
pre-existing chronic hypertension (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).
Superimposed preeclampsia usually develops earlier than other hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy, tends to be more severe, and can lead to fetal growth restriction, elective
preterm delivery, and increased risk for perinatal mortality. It can also lead to severe
adverse maternal outcomes, including hypertensive encephalopathy, heart or kidney
failure, placental abruption, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets)
syndrome, and maternal mortality (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). It is estimated that approximately 14 to 78% of
all women with pre-existing chronic hypertension will develop superimposed preeclampsia
during pregnancy; those with abnormal uterine artery Doppler are at even higher risk
(<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Second-trimester uterine artery Doppler ultrasound has been used for over a decade to
screen women at high risk of preeclampsia. Increased impedance to flow in the uterine
arteries in unselected women during the second trimester of pregnancy identifies
approximately 40% of those who subsequently will develop preeclampsia. Compared to
individual baseline risk, abnormal uterine Doppler findings increase the likelihood of
preeclampsia by six times in unselected populations (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Screening is only worthwhile if there is an effective intervention available to prevent
the disease or improve outcome. In the mid 1980s, small trials suggested that the
prophylactic use of antiplatelet agents could reduce the incidence of preeclampsia
(<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, subsequent findings of larger trials did not support routine
prophylactic or therapeutic use of aspirin (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and a meta-analysis of
individual data from 31 trials involving 32,000 women of varying baseline risk concluded
that the use of antiplatelet agents during pregnancy is associated with a modest but
significant reduction of several outcomes including preeclampsia (RR=0.90,
95%CI=0.84-0.97), delivery before 34 weeks (RR=0.90, 95%CI=0.83-0.98), and any serious
adverse outcome (RR=0.90, 95%CI=0.85-0.96) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).
The use of aspirin seems to be more effective in reducing the incidence of preeclampsia
in high-risk women than in those of low to moderate risk. A systematic review on aspirin
to prevent preeclampsia in women at high risk due to abnormal second-trimester uterine
artery Doppler identified five small randomized trials that included a total of
approximately 500 women receiving 50-100 mg aspirin daily and reported a significant
reduction in the incidence of preeclampsia (OR=0.55, 95%CI=0.32-0.95) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, 2 years later, a large randomized
controlled trial that tested low-dose aspirin in 560 women with abnormal artery Doppler
at 23 weeks of gestation did not confirm those results. According to the authors,
supplementation with 150 mg aspirin did not significantly decrease the incidence of
preeclampsia (18 <italic>vs</italic> 19%, P=0.6 in the aspirin and placebo groups,
respectively), preterm delivery due to preeclampsia (6 <italic>vs</italic> 8%, P=0.36)
or birth weight below the fifth centile (22 <italic>vs</italic> 24%, P=0.4) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Supplementation with low-dose aspirin during
pregnancy is safe. The incidence of potential adverse effects associated with aspirin,
such as ante- or post-partum hemorrhage and placental abruption, were not significantly
different in over 32,000 women randomly assigned to receive aspirin versus placebo
(<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Calcium has also been tested for the prevention of preeclampsia. A systematic review of
13 randomized trials that included over 15,000 women concluded that supplementation with
1-2 g calcium carbonate starting in the second trimester significantly reduced
preeclampsia (RR=0.45, 95%CI=0.31-0.65), and this effect was greater in high-risk women
(five trials, 587 women; RR=0.22, 95%CI=0.12-0.42), and in those with low baseline
calcium intake (eight trials, 10,678 women; RR=0.36, 95%CI=0.20-0.65) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). No side effects of calcium supplementation were
reported in the 13 trials included in the review.</p><p>Despite some controversial findings, the existing evidence indicates that supplementing
high-risk women with low-dose aspirin and calcium can potentially reduce their risk of
developing preeclampsia. In 2011, the World Health Organization (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) recognized calcium and aspirin supplementation during pregnancy
as effective interventions to prevent preeclampsia and to reduce maternal mortality.
However, major questions remain unanswered, such as which specific subgroups of women
are more likely to benefit from this prophylactic medication, what is the best
gestational age to start this preventive treatment, and what is the ideal dose of the
supplements (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have analyzed the
effects of the combined administration of these two supplements on the rate of
preeclampsia in high-risk women.</p><p>Thus, the main objective of this pilot study was to test the hypothesis that the
administration of a combination of low-dose aspirin and calcium would reduce the risk of
superimposed preeclampsia in women at high risk for this condition due to chronic
hypertension and abnormal uterine artery Doppler in the second trimester. Secondary
outcomes of interest in this population were reduction in the rate of fetal growth
restriction and preterm delivery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study took place at the antenatal
clinic for hypertensive disorders of a large, tertiary, university hospital located in
the southern region of the city of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil. This clinic offers free
antenatal care to low-income women. Throughout the study period, the same team of
physicians and nurses cared for all the women enrolled in the study. All participants
delivered at the university hospital and were followed for 6 weeks post-partum.</p><p>All women receiving antenatal care and planning to deliver at the university hospital,
and carrying a live, structurally normal, singleton fetus between 20 and 27 weeks of
gestation were eligible if they had chronic hypertension and an abnormal uterine Doppler
exam. Chronic hypertension was defined as known history of pre-existing hypertension
prior to pregnancy, or blood pressure readings &#x02265;140 systolic and/or &#x02265;90 mmHg diastolic
on two occasions over 6 h apart before week 20 of gestation (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Gestational age was ascertained by menstrual dates confirmed by
obstetric ultrasound prior to 20 weeks. In case of discrepancies greater than 8 days,
sonographic gestational age was used. Doppler ultrasound screening of uterine arteries
is routinely performed at this antenatal clinic in all hypertensive women at 20 to 27
weeks. The first author performed all Doppler exams using a Diasonics Synergy Color
Doppler ultrasonography unit (OEC Diasonics, USA) with a 3.5-MHz transducer. Uterine
arteries were identified through the transabdominal route using color Doppler. The
filter was kept at 50-100 Hz, the angle of insonation was less than 60&#x000b0; and a 3-mm
caliper was placed in the lumen of the vessels. Women with a high-resistance index
(&#x0003e;0.55) and/or a protodiastolic notch in the placental side or in both uterine
arteries were diagnosed as having abnormal uterine Doppler (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and were eligible to enter the study. Women were ineligible to
participate in the study if they had increased risk of bleeding due to coagulation
disorders or placenta previa, asthma, allergy to aspirin, already been diagnosed with
preeclampsia before 28 weeks of gestation, or were planning to deliver in other
hospitals.</p><p>A single private laboratory (Farm&#x000e1;cia de Manipula&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Amarylis, Brazil) provided all the
study medications (pills containing either 100 mg aspirin or microcrystalline cellulose
and 3&#x000d7;5-cm transparent plastic envelopes containing 2 g elemental calcium in the form of
calcium carbonate powder, or cellulose). Placebo pills and powder were matched to the
study supplements for taste, color and size.</p><p>Randomization was carried out using a list of computer-generated random numbers provided
by the Brazilian Cochrane Centre. Packets containing identical looking supplements or
placebo (pills and envelopes containing a powder) were placed in individual,
consecutively numbered boxes by staff of the Cochrane Centre. Each box contained either
supplements or placebo following the sequence generated by the randomization list.
Included participants were given the next consecutive prepacked, numbered box in the
order of enrollment. The study participants and the medical team caring for them were
blinded as to the contents of the boxes.</p><p>Upon enrollment, each woman received a box with 140 identical looking oblong white pills
(containing either 100 mg aspirin or cellulose) and 140 plastic envelopes (containing
either 2 g calcium or cellulose). They were asked to keep the box at room temperature
away from direct sunlight and instructed to swallow one pill and dissolve one envelope
of the powder in a glass of water daily, in the morning, approximately 2 h after
breakfast.</p><p>All participants were specifically instructed not to take any aspirin or calcium
supplements until delivery. A prescription for acetominophen was given to all
participants to be taken in case of pain. At each follow-up visit until delivery,
patients were questioned about the use of any medication since their last visit and the
study instructions were repeated. Women were asked to return the medication boxes on
their first post-partum visit including the remaining unused pills and envelopes, which
were then counted. Adherence was classified as poor when the participant had taken less
than 50% of the prescribed daily medication prior to delivery, regular for those taking
50-69% of the medication, and good for those taking 70% or more.</p><p>The main outcome was superimposed preeclampsia, defined by <italic>a</italic>) new-onset
proteinuria (&#x0003e;300 mg/24 h) after the 20th week of pregnancy in a woman with
pre-existing hypertension without proteinuria or <italic>b</italic>) the sudden increase
in proteinuria, blood pressure, or platelet count &#x0003c;100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, in women
with pre-existing hypertension and proteinuria before 20 weeks of gestation (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Secondary outcomes were preterm delivery (before
37 weeks) and fetal growth restriction, defined as birth weight below the third centile
for gender and estimated gestational age, as described by Yudkin et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Gestational age at delivery was estimated as
previously described, by menstrual dates confirmed through sonogram prior to 20 weeks of
gestation. The investigators collected data on outcomes of interest directly from
patient charts during pregnancy and after delivery.</p><p>To calculate sample size, the records of all women with chronic hypertension who
received antenatal care in the clinic in the past 5 years were reviewed and those with
abnormal second-trimester uterine artery Doppler were selected. The incidence of
superimposed preeclampsia in this group was over 50%. Based on an expected rate of
superimposed preeclampsia of 55% in the participants, and an estimated reduction of
approximately 50% in this incidence in the group receiving aspirin plus calcium, with an
alpha of 5% and a power of 80%, a total of 22 women would have to be randomly assigned
to each group.</p><p>The two-sample test for equality of proportions, the chi-square test or the Fisher exact
test, the independent-samples <italic>t</italic>-test, and the Mann-Whitney test were
used to compare the outcomes in the placebo and study groups. P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered
to be significant. All analyses were conducted according to intention to treat. The
Ethics Committee of Universidade Federal de S&#x000e3;o Paulo (UNIFESP) approved the study, and
all participants gave written informed consent upon enrollment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 65 women with chronic hypertension and abnormal uterine artery Doppler were

women continued antenatal care, and were delivered at the study hospital. Analyses of
the main outcome (superimposed preeclampsia) were performed on the 23 treated patients

the placebo group at 20 and 27 weeks (both due to severe fetal growth restriction), and
two in the treated group at 28 and 37 weeks (both due to placental abruption). These
four cases were excluded from the analyses on fetal growth restriction and preterm
delivery but were included in the preeclampsia analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). None of the participants had eclampsia. There were no adverse

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>As expected, there was a very high rate of superimposed preeclampsia in this selected
group of high-risk women, with over 50% of all participants developing this
complication. This led to a large number of growth-restricted infants and elective
preterm deliveries. Supplementation with 100 mg aspirin plus 2 g calcium starting after
20 weeks of pregnancy reduced the rate of superimposed preeclampsia by 28.6% and the
rate of fetal growth restriction by 80.8% in these women with chronic hypertension and
abnormal second-trimester uterine artery Doppler. However, these reductions fell short
of statistical difference. The supplements did not have an effect on the rate of preterm
delivery.</p><p>We cannot compare our findings to others since this is the first study to test this
combination of supplements in the prevention of preeclampsia. Although we observed
beneficial effects in the supplemented group, the size of this effect fell short of our
prediction, which was a 50% reduction in the rate of superimposed preeclampsia. A
possible factor for this smaller effect could be the relatively late initiation of
low-dose aspirin therapy, at a mean of 22-23 weeks gestation. As previously described,
low-dose aspirin before week 16 is more effective in preventing preeclampsia (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). However, as in most developing countries, many
high-risk women in our setting book late for antenatal care. Another possible
explanation for the smaller than expected effect of combined supplementation could be an
interaction between aspirin and calcium that reduced the bioavailability of each
substance. This hypothesis cannot be confirmed or refuted because we did not assess the
plasma concentration of calcium or aspirin in the participants. Pharmacological aspects
of calcium administration could also have played a role in the lower than expected
effects of the supplements. The bioavailability of calcium depends on the type of salt
used, the daily dose, and whether the supplements are ingested with food. Calcium
citrate malate has a higher bioavailability than other forms and has a good absorption
even when consumed on an empty stomach. However, large doses (&#x0003e;500 mg/day) of this
salt are less well absorbed than lower doses (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>The etiology and physiopathology of preeclampsia are not yet completely understood.
Preeclampsia is a complex disorder caused by nutritional, environmental and genetic
factors that lead to an inflammatory state, activation of platelets, imbalance in the
production and activity of thromboxane-prostacyclin and of the free radicals nitric
oxide, superoxide and peroxynitrate by the vascular endothelium (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The probable mechanism of action of low-dose aspirin in the
prevention of preeclampsia is by inhibiting the excessive production of thromboxane by
platelets in women who are susceptible to this disorder (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Low calcium intake may cause
high blood pressure by stimulating the release of parathyroid hormone or renin, thus
leading to increased intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and consequent vasoconstriction. A possible mode
of action for calcium supplementation is that it reduces parathyroid hormone release and
intracellular calcium, and so reduces smooth muscle contractility (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The explanation of the potential benefits of offering both
aspirin and calcium to women at high risk for preeclampsia is at present hypothetical
and possibly related to reduction in inflammatory factors and oxidative stress. A recent
trial involving a small group of Iranian women at risk for preeclampsia reported that
supplementation of low-dose calcium (500 mg) plus 80 mg aspirin for 9 weeks during the
third trimester of pregnancy resulted in increased plasma levels of glutathione, total
oxidant capacity, and significantly lower change in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
in the intervention group (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>Our study had several strengths, including its originality, rigorous care to avoid bias
in all phases including selection, randomization, allocation concealment, blinding of
participants and physicians, and reporting of outcomes.</p><p>A potential limitation of our study was the lack of information on the baseline
ingestion of dietary calcium in both groups. However, since the participants were from
the same geographic setting and had similar socioeconomic characteristics, we can infer
that the eating habits of these women were probably very similar. According to the
latest national food inquiry survey, the mean dietary calcium intake of adult Brazilian
women is less than 500 mg/day and over 90% do not reach the recommended dietary calcium
intake for their age (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Only a few studies
with small sample sizes have assessed the ingestion of calcium by Brazilian pregnant
women, and they focused on specific subgroups such as overweight participants and
adolescents. According to those studies, mean daily calcium intake was below the
recommended 1200 mg/day and ranged from 586.6 to 842.9 mg/day in those specific
populations of pregnant women (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The importance of baseline dietary calcium has
been previously demonstrated in large randomized trials of calcium supplementation for
the prevention of preeclampsia (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In those studies, women with a high dietary
ingestion of calcium (&#x0003e;1200 mg/day) had no significant reduction in the rate of
preeclampsia, but those with lower dietary calcium seemed to benefit from
supplementation.</p><p>Although this study had a relatively small sample size, all participants were women with
essential chronic hypertension and abnormal uterine Doppler findings, which is not the
case in the majority of published studies. The sample size calculation was based on an
expected rate of superimposed preeclampsia of 55% in this very high-risk group of women
and an estimated reduction of 50% in the group treated with aspirin plus calcium. There
have been no previous studies to provide guidance on the expected effects of this
combination of drugs. The first part of this estimation was based on clinical records of
previous patients and it was correct. The incidence of superimposed preeclampsia was
73.1% in the placebo group. However, the effect of the supplements was overestimated.
The treated group had an incidence of superimposed preeclampsia of 52.2%, which
corresponds to a reduction of 28.6%, instead of 50%. Therefore, for this difference to
be statistically significant, it would have been necessary to include approximately 82
participants in each group, instead of 22 women. Nevertheless, the results of this pilot
study are valuable for future investigations on the use of combined supplements for the
prevention of preeclampsia in high-risk women.</p><p>This is the first study to assess the effects of the combined supplementation of calcium
plus low-dose aspirin on the prevention of preeclampsia in women at high risk for this
complication. Our results need to be confirmed by other studies involving a larger
number of high-risk participants. Besides larger sample sizes, future studies could test
the introduction of combined supplementation at an earlier gestational age (i.e.,
between 16-20 weeks), determine the dietary calcium ingestion of the participants (e.g.,
through a food questionnaire), and perform bioavailability studies to ascertain the
