Clinical outcomes after robotic training are often not superior to conventional therapy. We evaluated the effectiveness of a robot training compared with a usual gait training physiotherapy during a standardized rehabilitation protocol in inpatient participants with poststroke hemiparesis. This was a randomized double-blind clinical trial in a postacute physical and rehabilitation medicine hospital. Twenty-eight patients, 39.3% women (72&#x000b1;6 years), with hemiparesis (&#x0003c;6 months after stroke) receiving a conventional treatment according to the Bobath approach were assigned randomly to an experimental or a control intervention of robot gait training to improve walking (five sessions a week for 5 weeks). Outcome measures included the 6-min walk test, the 10&#x02009;m walk test, Functional Independence Measure, SF-36 physical functioning and the Tinetti scale. Outcomes were collected at baseline, immediately following the intervention period and 3 months following the end of the intervention. The experimental group showed a significant increase in functional independence and gait speed (10&#x02009;m walk test) at the end of the treatment and follow-up, higher than the minimal detectable change. The control group showed a significant increase in the gait endurance (6-min walk test) at the follow-up, higher than the minimal detectable change. Both treatments were effective in the improvement of gait performances, although the statistical analysis of functional independence showed a significant improvement in the experimental group, indicating possible advantages during generic activities of daily living compared with overground treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>gait training</kwd><kwd>hemiparesis</kwd><kwd>robotics</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stroke is the leading cause of death and of serious long-term disability in adults; 3 months after stroke, 20% of individuals remain wheelchair bound and 70% walk at reduced velocity (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Sakuma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Improvement in walking after stroke is a priority for many patients and is one of the most frequently demanded goals of rehabilitation, and interventions that effectively enhance locomotor function are essential to improve quality of life of many stroke survivors and their families (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Maclean <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Stroke patients, when they regain ambulatory function, walk with a typically asymmetrical gait pattern, slow and metabolically inefficient. These characteristics are associated with difficulty advancing the paretic limb and bearing weight through the more affected limb, leading to instability and increased risk of falls. Muscle weakness, muscle tonus, muscle disuse, balance and reduced cardiorespiratory capacity contribute towards decrease walking velocity and endurance and finally worsen the disability (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Perry <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>).</p><p>To restore gait, modern concepts of rehabilitation favour a repetitive task-specific approach (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">French <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In the past 10 years, it has also been shown that higher intensities of walking practice result in better outcomes for individuals after stroke (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Van Peppen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>For gait training, it is important to walk repetitively in a natural gait similar to overground gait (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Dobkin, 2004</xref>), and with proprioceptive and exteroceptive feedback (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Barbeau, 2003</xref>), which recreates conditions favourable to motor learning.</p><p>In recent years, as an adjunct to overground gait training, treadmill training has been introduced for the rehabilitation of individuals after stroke (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Moseley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Treadmill training with and without body-weight support enables the repetitive practice of a generic gait cycle (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Taveggia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Manually assisted Body-Weight Supported Treadmill Training is a contemporary approach to gait rehabilitation after stroke, whereas when a patient walks on a treadmill, the therapists manually facilitate hemiparetic limb and trunk control in an effort to normalize upright and reciprocal walk and dynamic postural control. The advantages of this approach are that reduced motion ability is required to start locomotion; thus, early poststroke training effects can be observed in overground gait, that is, gait symmetry, speed and endurance as well as motor impairment and balance scores (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">McCain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>A disadvantage of Body-Weight Supported Treadmill Training might be the effort required by therapists to set the paretic limbs and to control weight shift, thereby possibly limiting the duration of the active therapy, especially in more impaired patients. Automated electromechanical gait machines for automated assistive walking training were developed to reduce dependence on therapists and can be differentiated into end-effector and exoskeleton devices.</p><p>Selection of patients and an early application of robot-aided rehabilitation are considered a prerequisite to achieve the best results. However, the impact of other factors such as the type of technology in relationship to the patient&#x02019;s selection as well as the duration/intensity of the robot-aided treatment has not received more attention (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Mehrholz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The main aim of the present study is to compare the effects of electromechanical-assisted gait training after stroke and overground conventional physical therapy in a double-blind research for functional gait recovery of individuals unable to walk independently.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>We conducted a double-blind (evaluator and statistician) randomized-controlled trial.

The calculations were based on detecting a mean difference of 0.32&#x02009;m/s minimally clinically important difference on a 6MWT (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Westlake and Patten, 2009</xref>), a two-tailed test, an <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> level of 0.05 and a desired power of 80%. The estimated desired sample size was 12 individuals per group.</p><p>Thirty-two participants, aged 18 to 85 years, were recruited for the study from March 2012 to July 2013. All inpatients had hemiparesis resulting from a single stroke (confirmed by computed tomography or MRI) less than 6 months before the study. Diagnosis was made on the basis of a clinical evaluation, in compliance with gold criteria (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Curfman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), by an expert neurologist physician (R.L.) with 10 years of experience in this exam. Each patient underwent a subjective and physical examination performed by a Physical Therapist experienced in neurology problems and rehabilitation to evaluate inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients were diagnosed with poststroke hemiparesis (&#x0003c;6 months from onset) and were unable to walk independently (Functional Ambulation Classification scores&#x0003c;4) (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Masiero <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).

This outcome is a measure of endurance and is particularly significant to evaluate the possibility to perform continuative tasks, which are particularly important for the rehabilitation of poststroke patients and are relevant for an independent life (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Chisari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The speed was quantified using the TWT over the ground (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Dean <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).

TWT can overestimate the speed over long distances in patients with impaired aerobic capacity; thus, the combination of 6MWT and TWT was considered to evaluate the gait performances of the patients.

The physical therapist was blinded to all data that were collected for the study. The participants were assigned to experimental and control treatment groups by simple randomization. After the completion of all baseline measurements, using a computer program (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, California, USA), patients were randomly assigned by an external assistant into one of two groups: an experimental group or a control group. All participants received 25 treatment sessions scheduled on separate days, at least 24&#x02009;h apart and at the same time of day, 5 days per week, for 5 weeks.

Group data were summarized using means and SDs. The Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test confirmed the normality of the distribution of the data; thus, a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the differences in 6MWT and TWT with time (preintervention, postintervention, and follow-up) as the within-patients factor and group (experimental or control) as the between-patients factor. The main hypothesis of interest was group-by-time interaction. Between-group differences were expressed as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub>) was used to evaluate the relationship between the 6MWT distance and the other parameters evaluated. The <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> values were interpreted according to Domholdt&#x02019;s recommendations. Finally, between-groups effect sizes were calculated using Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> coefficient. An effect size greater than 0.8 was considered large, around 0.5 moderate, and less than 0.2 small. The statistical analysis was carried out at a 95% CI and a <italic>P</italic>-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Thirty-two consecutive patients (<italic>n</italic>=32) with poststroke hemiparesis, were screened for eligibility criteria.

Functional recovery is achieved through use-dependent cortical reorganization, and active participation increases levels of physiological reorganization and provides more clinical benefits. Evidence shows that the addition of a robotic intervention to usual care result in improvements in gait function and generic activities of daily living.</p><p>This randomized-controlled trial examined the effects of an additional intervention with Lokomat gait rehabilitation on subacute patients with poststroke hemiparesis versus conventional physical therapy without this device. Low-level performances are measured as gait speed and gait endurance. Gait speed is a predictor of adverse outcomes (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abellan van Kan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and the experimental group showed a significant increase in this parameter at the end of the treatment and at the follow-up. The change in speed detected is higher than the MDC, which is in the range 0.07&#x02013;0.36&#x02009;m/s (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Fulk and Echternach, 2008</xref>); thus, the improvement is also clinically significant. However, the control group showed a significant increase in gait endurance at the follow-up that was also higher than the MDC (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abellan van Kan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). A more synthetic measure of gait functional performances is introduced with the Tinetti gait scale, which confirmed the previous results: both treatments are effective and neither of them can be preferred in terms of pure gait performances (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Hidler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). An interesting result emerged when higher functional level performances were measured, that is, with FIM, which shows how the experimental treatment produced functional improvements at the end of the treatment period and also at the follow-up. These positive data on functional performances after the end of the treatment in the experimental group suggest that improvements in motor skills and functional gait, in poststroke patients, continue over time and do not lose their effectiveness even after many months of the end of the robotic training, pointing to a long-lasting motor recovery on the basis of functional relearning induced by intense and repetitive stimulations. Although this phenomenon of persistence is of great interest in neurorehabilitation, it is still relatively unknown and deserves further investigation to design better rehabilitation programmes and maintenance therapy (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Pollock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recovery walking capacity is closely related to life quality in poststroke patients (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Pohl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>): this characteristic is measured using the SF-36 (only with the Physical Function component) and both are comparable, with no preference. These functional improvements are not reflected in improvement in the quality of life, probably because of the reduced number of patients or the low sensitivity of the SF-36 scale, which produces high SD, or patient selection, which does not exclude depressed individuals.</p><p>The recovery of walking after stroke is a major goal in gait rehabilitation priority of many patients, and our patients showed an improvement in walking speed after the experimental treatment in combination with physical and rehabilitation therapy.</p><p>A recent systematic review (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Mehrholz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) provided evidence that the use of electromechanical-assisted gait training devices in combination with physiotherapy increases the chance of regaining independent walking ability for individuals after stroke.</p><p>Specifically, this type of intervention seems to be suitable for early subacute patients unable to walk. Probably repetitive robot-assisted training of locomotion intensified patient training, increasing the number of gait cycles and improving step accuracy with reduced trainer effort.</p><p>In the second analysis, we focused on the importance of determining a training intervention sufficiently intense in duration and type of rehabilitation programme.</p><p>Our patients were treated for a total duration of 12:30&#x02009;h with robot-assisted training with programmes of increasing difficulty on the basis of individual functional evolution.</p><p>This dose effect in the literature is a determining factor of the efficacy of an intervention.</p><p>We believe that the increased effectiveness of gait training could be caused by motivational support associated to virtual reality tasks.</p><p>After a stroke event, a secondary reduction of cardiorespiratory capacity emerges, due to reduced physical activity. Thus intensive training may be effective on these patients, due to aerobic effects associated with the high metabolic cost of the training. These improvements are indicative of a potential aerobic conditioning effect of treatments in patients with lower walking capacity.</p><p>This work has many limitations; first, the reduced number of patients and second, the number of sessions and the duration of the treatment were selected on the basis of experience without specific clinical trials.</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both treatments are effective in the improvement of gait performances, although only experimental treatment produced functional improvements. Further analyses should be carried out to understand why functional gait improvements are not reflected in the patients.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abellan van Kan</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Rolland</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Andrieu</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bauer</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Beauchet</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Bonnefoy</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group> (<year>2009</year>). <article-title>Gait speed at usual pace as a predictor of adverse outcomes in community-dwelling older people an International Academy on Nutrition and Aging (IANA) Task Force</article-title>. <source>J Nutr Health Aging</source>
