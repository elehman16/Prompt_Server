These findings in particular suggest that tDCS might prove useful as a post stroke rehabilitation tool. Most existing research has focused on examining how tDCS modulates corticomotor excitability and intracortical inhibition in the hand area of primary motor cortex <xref rid="pone.0101496-Nitsche3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Batsikadze1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Boros1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, the restoration of wrist function and wrist extension in particular, is equally critical during stroke rehabilitation <xref rid="pone.0101496-Squeri1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A second consideration regarding how well previous work generalizes to clinical settings is highlighted when considering how tDCS aftereffects are typically measured. Single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used to induce motor evoked potentials (MEPs) before and after stimulation in order to assess corticomotor excitability <xref rid="pone.0101496-Nitsche1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Nitsche2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and a short-interval paired pulse TMS protocol is used to measure intracortical inhibition <xref rid="pone.0101496-Hummel2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Nitsche3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Batsikadze1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Kujirai1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, with both measurements often performed with the target muscle in a resting state <xref rid="pone.0101496-Nitsche1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Nitsche2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Nitsche3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Antal1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Batsikadze1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Furubayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Boros1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Uy1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

Here we tested the influence of 20 min anodal tDCS (1 mA) over the primary motor cortex on the corticomotor excitability of the wrist extensor muscle in healthy adults.

Wrist extension force was measured by a force sensor (Load cell model 1042, TEDEA Huntleigh, USA). Visual feedback of wrist extension force amplitude was provided during the active sessions. MEPs were recorded from the right ECR with surface electromyography (EMG; Mespec 8000, Mega Electronic, UK). Two disposable Ag-AgCl surface electrodes (Blue Sensor P-00-S, Ambu, Denmark) were placed in a belly-tendon montage on the right ECR, with the reference electrode placed on the lateral epicondyle. In the first session of each condition (i.e. active versus rest), the EMG electrodes positions were marked with a semi permanent marker to ensure identical positioning of EMG electrodes across the anodal and sham sessions. EMG data were sampled at 5000 Hz (CED Power 1401, Cambridge Electronic Design, UK), amplified, band pass filtered (5&#x02013;1000 Hz), and stored on a PC for off-line analysis.</p><p>In the active sessions, each subject's isometric wrist extension maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was recorded at the beginning of the session. MVC was taken as the highest value of three maximal isometric contractions.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>3.2 TMS preparation</title><p>TMS was performed with a figure-of-eight coil (loop diameter 70 mm) connected to two Magstim Bi-Stim<sup>2</sup> stimulators (Magstim, UK). The coil was positioned over the hotspot of ECR (i.e. the location with the largest and most consistent MEPs) with the optimal orientation (i.e. the coil was positioned over the left hemisphere, tangentially to the scalp with the handle pointing backward and laterally at 45&#x000b0; away from the mid-sagittal line) for evoking a descending volley in the corticospinal tract. The same coil orientation was used for all subjects. In the first session of each condition (i.e. active versus rest), the hotspot was determined and marked with a semi permanent marker. In the following sessions, we confirmed that the previously defined hotspot was the point where the largest and most consistent MEPs were evoked prior to the main measurements. Accordingly, the hotspot location was highly consistent across sessions. The average location in each session with respect to the lateral and anterior distance from the vertex was rest-anodal 5.2&#x000b1;0.1 cm, 0.5&#x000b1;0.2 cm; rest-sham: 5.2&#x000b1;0.1 cm, 0.5&#x000b1;0.2 cm; active-anodal: 5.3&#x000b1; 0.2 cm, 0.3&#x000b1;0.2 cm; active-sham: 5.2&#x000b1; 0.2 cm, 0.6&#x000b1; 0.2 cm.</p><p>Rest motor threshold (RMT), defined as the lowest stimulus intensity eliciting MEPs &#x0003e;50&#x000b5;V in at least five out of 10 consecutive trials, was determined to the nearest 1% of maximum stimulator output. Active motor threshold (AMT) was determined as the lowest stimulus intensity eliciting MEPs &#x0003e;200 &#x000b5;V in at least five out of 10 consecutive trials while participants contracted their wrist extensor with an isometric force of 10% MVC (i.e. MEP size had to exceed the background EMG and was usually followed by a silent period).</p><p>TMS stimulation intensities were determined in a similar manner to that previously described by Byblow et al <xref rid="pone.0101496-Byblow1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In brief, an input-output curve (IO-curve) was measured prior to the main experiment in each test session. In the resting sessions, the IO-curve was determined using stimulation intensities ranging from 90%&#x02013;190% of RMT in steps of 20%. Five MEPs were collected per intensity (30 in total) in a randomized order with an inter-trial interval varying randomly between 7 to 9 s. The total procedure lasted approximately 4 min. In the active sessions, the IO-curve was measured at intensities ranging from 90%&#x02013;210% of AMT in steps of 20%. Five MEPs were collected per intensity (35 in total) in a randomized order and with an inter-trial interval between 7 and 9 s (corresponding to approximately 5 min in total). Based on the IO-curve, the suprathreshold test stimulus (TS) intensity was set to evoke MEPs with an amplitude corresponding to 50% of maximum.</p><p>Short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was measured using paired pulse TMS such that the TS was preceded by a subthreshold conditioning stimulus (CS) with the interstimulus interval (ISI) being set to 3 ms <xref rid="pone.0101496-Nitsche3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Batsikadze1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Hendy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Kujirai1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. MEP amplitude is diminished when the TS is preceded by the CS (CS+TS) indicating the influence of inhibitory circuits. However, it has been shown that this MEP reduction depends on the CS intensity and that inhibitory activity can be estimated more reliably when several CS intensities are used, i.e. a SICI curve is measured <xref rid="pone.0101496-Stinear1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-MacKinnon1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Here, three CS intensities were used: For each subject a CS intensity of 80% of motor threshold (MT; i.e. 80% AMT for active condition, 80% RMT for resting condition) was used as a starting reference. We then determined the stimulator output (to the nearest 1%) that maximally reduced the MEP amplitude (CS<sub>max</sub>). In addition to CS<sub>max</sub>, the SICI curve consisted of measurements at CS<sub>max</sub>&#x000b1;10% of MSO (CS<sub>max-10%</sub>, CS<sub>max+10%</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>3.3 Pre- and post- TMS measurement</title><p>Identical TMS measurements were executed prior to and immediately after the tDCS intervention: Three blocks of 10 unconditioned pulses (TS only, single pulse) and 20 conditioned pulses (SICI, paired pulse) were delivered.

In the active sessions participants contracted their wrist extensors for 3 s at 10% of MVC during each TMS measurement, with TMS given 2.5 s after each contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101496-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Production of the required extension force was monitored by the experimenter. During all TMS measurements, the experimenters were blinded as to whether subjects received anodal or sham tDCS. In each session one experimenter was responsible for holding the TMS coil and communicating with the subject, one was responsible for controlling the data collection computer, and another observed.

Electrodes were covered with conductive gel and then placed in saline soaked sponges. Pilot work indicated that this procedure was optimal for ensuring that low impedance between the electrodes and the scalp was maintained over the course of the experiment. In the anodal session, the current ramped up over 10 s and was maintained at 1 mA for 20 min. In the sham session, the current ramped up over 10 s and was maintained at 1 mA for 12 s, and then quickly faded. Participants were not able to distinguish between anodal and sham stimulation using this procedure.</p><p>At the end of each session, participants filled in a questionnaire to determine the level of physical activity before the test, the number of sleep hours and sleep quality during the previous night, and a discomfort score for the tDCS stimulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>4. Data analyses</title><p>For all TMS measurements, MEP size was determined by peak-to-peak amplitude. MEPs were considered outliers and excluded from the analysis if they were greater than Q3+1.5&#x000d7; (Q3-Q1) or less than Q1-1.5&#x000d7; (Q3-Q1), where Q1 and Q3 are equal to the first and third quartiles, respectively. Single pulse MEPs were pooled separately for PRE-TMS and POST-TMS (30 MEPs for PRE-TMS and 30 MEPs for POST-TMS). BgEMG was quantified by the root mean square error of the EMG signal in an interval between 10 and 110 ms before TMS stimulation. For each participant, the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the bgEMG score was calculated separately for each session. In the resting sessions, trials with a bgEMG score greater than the mean + 2.5 SDs were removed from the analysis. In the active sessions, trials with a bgEMG score greater than the mean + 2.5 SDs and/or smaller than the mean &#x02212;2.5 SDs were removed from the analysis. According to these criteria 95&#x000b1;3% of the trials were included in the analysis. All statistics were calculated with Statistica 11 (StatSoft, USA).

This allowed us to directly compare the effect of anodal tDCS between the active and resting sessions with a repeated measures analysis of variance (rm-ANOVA) including within subject factors MOTOR STATE (active, resting) and STIMULATION (anodal, sham).

Here we extend on previous work by demonstrating that similar anodal tDCS aftereffects are present when targeting a more proximal upper limb muscle (ECR) during an active motor state. In general this result is consistent with the relatively few previous studies that have measured the aftereffects of anodal tDCS on corticomotor excitability in an active target muscle. Hendy and Kidgell <xref rid="pone.0101496-Hendy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> recently reported increased corticomotor excitability in pre-contracted ECR following three weeks of strength training combined with 2 mA anodal tDCS. Jeffery et al <xref rid="pone.0101496-Jeffery1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> observed increased corticomotor excitability in pre-contracted muscles of the lower leg following 10 min of 2 mA anodal tDCS.</p><p>In the present study we only observed a trend towards increased corticomotor excitability in the resting motor state following anodal tDCS, which was not significant when compared to sham. Our results are consistent with Uy and Ridding <xref rid="pone.0101496-Uy1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> who tested the aftereffects of anodal tDCS in the first dorsal interosseous, abductor digiti minimi and flexor carpi ulnaris in healthy adults. They observed a significant difference in response to anodal tDCS in the first dorsal interosseous, but not in the forearm muscle (i.e. flexor carpi ulnaris). Another study applying 1 mA cathodal tDCS to the infraspinatus region in the left primary motor cortex showed that cathodal tDCS decreased corticomotor excitability of distal hand muscles but not the proximal shoulder muscles <xref rid="pone.0101496-BradnamL1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. This is in line with a previous study that applied theta burst stimulation to different regions of the motor cortex and found that the results obtained from the biceps muscle are highly variable compared to the same stimulation applied to a hand muscle (FDI). The authors pointed out that the magnitude and reliability of theta burst stimulation depends on which cortical region is targeted <xref rid="pone.0101496-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Together, previous work raises the possibility that the corticomotor excitability of more proximal muscles might be less sensitive to modulation through brain stimulation, possibly because intrinsic hand muscles have larger representations in human primary motor cortex<xref rid="pone.0101496-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Wassermann1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and are controlled more selectively than forearm muscles <xref rid="pone.0101496-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Moreover, our data indicate that much depends on how the aftereffects of tDCS are assessed. One aspect of general consideration when using TMS is that evoking MEPs while the subject is at rest provides good control of muscular activity but poor control about the psychophysiological state of the subject. It has been shown previously that MEP amplitudes are influenced by arousal, visual attention<xref rid="pone.0101496-SaucedoMarquez1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, sleepiness <xref rid="pone.0101496-Massimini1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, vegetative state <xref rid="pone.0101496-Rosanova1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and seemingly irrelevant visual background information <xref rid="pone.0101496-Rutiku1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Even though we tried to control these aspects during each session in addition to including a sham condition in the design, TMS measurements at rest might still be subject to greater noise due to non-specific effects. This would lead to reduced sensitivity with small modulations of corticomotor excitability failing to reach significance. This argument is supported by two of our findings: First, it is worth noting that we observed a significant difference in MEP size variability between the active and resting motor states, with the CV being significantly lower in the active motor state. Therefore it is also possible that in our data higher variability in corticomotor excitability measurements at rest prevented statistical significance being reached. Second, we also observed that the change in corticomotor excitability in active and resting anodal tDCS sessions was positively correlated. That is, interindividual differences in the response to tDCS were largely maintained across assessments in the active and the resting motor state.</p><p>Of interest is the fact that not all participants responded to anodal tDCS. We tested 16 participants and the corticomotor excitability of 2 (12.5%) did not respond to stimulation in either anodal session. These participants did not differ from the rest of the sample in terms of baseline measurements, such as sleep hours, physical activity prior to the testing sessions and self reported tDCS discomfort scores. This observation is in line with previous reports of inter-individual variability in response to anodal tDCS: Nitsche and Paulus <xref rid="pone.0101496-Nitsche1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> tested 12 participants and the increase in corticomotor excitability ranged from 0 to approximately 200%, with an average increase of about 50%. Another study which quantified the effects of anodal tDCS with recruitment curves reported that slopes increased for 4 out of 5 participants <xref rid="pone.0101496-Hummel2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. When cortical current flow was modeled using the same tDCS parameters as in our study, differences were found between participants <xref rid="pone.0101496-Datta1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. These studies (and ours) used 1 mA current applied to the primary motor cortex, which might not be sufficient to consistently induce sufficient current flow in the brain, particularly when there are substantial variations in anatomy between participants <xref rid="pone.0101496-Datta1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Miranda1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. This suggests that future studies should consider the use of subject specific intensities in order to induce more robust effects <xref rid="pone.0101496-Datta1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. It is also possible that a substantial proportion of the population does not respond to tDCS. Our finding identifying 12.5% non-responders is in line with two recent studies showing that there is considerable inter-individual variability in response to tDCS. Wiethoff et al <xref rid="pone.0101496-Wiethoff1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> reported that approximately 25% of participants did not show an increase in corticomotor excitability following the application of 10 min of 2 mA anodal tDCS <xref rid="pone.0101496-Wiethoff1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and Lopez-Alonso et al <xref rid="pone.0101496-LopezAlonso1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> found that about 50% of participants showed no increase in corticomotor excitability after the application of 13 min of 1 mA anodal tDCS <xref rid="pone.0101496-LopezAlonso1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Our criteria for determining non-responders is similar to the above studies but slightly more conservative, namely we only classified participants as non-responders if they demonstrated no increase in both the resting and active anodal sessions. Together, recent studies suggest that a substantial proportion of the population does not respond to anodal tDCS with an increase in corticomotor excitability. Depending on the criteria and which stimulation/test protocol is applied, the proportion of non-responders appears to vary between 12.5 and 55%.</p><p>We observed an approximate 15% decrease in SICI in the active motor state compared to the resting motor state. This was expected based on previous work showing that the strength of intracortical inhibition is reduced when measured with a voluntary tonic contraction of the target muscle <xref rid="pone.0101496-Ridding1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Roshan1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Anodal tDCS did not lead to any changes in SICI when tested during the active motor state, most likely due to the large reduction in inhibition that might have masked more subtle modulations of SICI caused by tDCS. SICI was decreased following anodal tDCS when tested in the resting motor state, but this decrease did not differ significantly from the sham condition, unless the two participants that did not respond to anodal tDCS in any of the two sessions were excluded from the analysis. We did not match MEP size evoked by the TS across PRE and POST sessions. TS amplitude influences the level of SICI <xref rid="pone.0101496-IliT1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Sanger1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> and some studies have demonstrated that matching TS is important for accurately measuring changes in SICI post-intervention <xref rid="pone.0101496-Cash1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. However, other experiments have indicated a lesser effect of matching TS amplitude <xref rid="pone.0101496-Rosenkranz1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Rosenkranz2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Moreover, we observed a trend towards reduced SICI only when tested in a resting motor state, i.e. when TS MEP amplitude changed only to an insignificant extent from PRE to POST. Previous studies measuring the influence of tDCS on SICI in hand muscles have revealed divergent results: Nitsche et al <xref rid="pone.0101496-Nitsche3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> found a significant decrease in intracortical inhibition following 13 min of 1 mA anodal tDCS. Another study applied 20 min of 2mA anodal tDCS to the ECR region in the primary motor cortex and showed a significant decrease in SICI when participants contracted their muscle with 20% and 50% of MVC, but no decrease during a lighter muscle contraction (5% MVC) <xref rid="pone.0101496-Hendy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Hummel et al <xref rid="pone.0101496-Hummel2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> reported reduced intracortical inhibition after applying 20 min of 1 mA anodal tDCS to chronic stroke patients. Conversely, Batsikadze et al <xref rid="pone.0101496-Batsikadze1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> recently observed no change in SICI following 20 min of 2 mA anodal tDCS. Notably, previous comparisons of SICI between upper limb muscles found that the amount of inhibition in proximal muscles to be significantly less than that observed in the intrinsic hand muscles <xref rid="pone.0101496-Abbruzzese1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Shimizu1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Furthermore, when SICI is measured at rest it is known to suffer from substantial inter-individual variability. In an attempt to account for this we measured SICI intensity curves, which are thought to provide a better indication of intracortical inhibition compared to a single measurement. We observed a decrease of about 8% in SICI, which is in line with previous studies that have reported SICI decreases of between 7&#x0223c;15% <xref rid="pone.0101496-Nitsche2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Nitsche3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Hendy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> following anodal tDCS. When considered in combination with previous work, our findings suggest that tDCS has a less robust influence on SICI in comparison to corticomotor excitability, even when SICI curves are measured. This might result from larger inter-individual variability, lower responsiveness of ECR to the SICI protocol and/or methodological details that might have influenced SICI results. More specifically, most studies cited above as well as ours used an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 3ms between the CS and TS. However, this ISI might have been suboptimal because there is a risk that SICI measurements were confounded by short interval cortical facilitation <xref rid="pone.0101496-Peurala1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Future studies should use a shorter ISI and larger cohorts to determine whether anodal tDCS affects SICI to a relevant extent and which proportion of the population responds to tDCS with changes in SICI.</p><p>There was no significant difference in cSP between anodal and sham sessions. SICI and cSP are both measures of intracortical inhibition and are thought to represent inhibitory processes mediated by different (but not mutually exclusive) pathways. SICI measures activation of the intracortical inhibitory pathways that reduce the excitability of corticospinal neurons within primary motor cortex <xref rid="pone.0101496-Kujirai1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-IliT1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-DiLazzaro1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, mainly depends on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors <xref rid="pone.0101496-Kujirai1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and seems to be responsive to anodal tDCS<xref rid="pone.0101496-Stagg1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. By contrast, cSP mainly depends on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors <xref rid="pone.0101496-Siebner1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> and does not seem to be modulated by anodal tDCS <xref rid="pone.0101496-Batsikadze1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Hendy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101496-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, a finding that is consistent with our results.</p><p>Finally, we note that there are some limitations to our study. First, we did not measure IO-curves to estimate the aftereffect of anodal tDCS and we did not test long-term aftereffects (&#x0003e;10min). However, since subjects had to produce a controlled force we decided to keep the protocol per session short to prevent muscular and mental fatigue. Second, only one forearm muscle was tested in this study, thus we could not directly compare the response of proximal versus distal muscles. Finally, our results concerning the influence of tDCS on SICI are unconvincing because we observed only a small effect when SICI was measured in the resting ECR, which is at odds with the tDCS induced increase of corticomotor excitability that was only measured when the muscle is activated. Future experiments investigating the influence of tDCS on SICI might benefit from a modified experimental protocol using a shorter ISI of 2 ms for the paired-pulse measurements and matching the MEP amplitude evoked by the TS across PRE and POST measurements.</p><p>Here we aimed to show the feasibility of measuring changes in corticomotor excitability and intracortical inhibition in the forearm area of primary motor cortex. While most previous tDCS studies targeted the intrinsic hand muscles, we investigated a proximal upper limb muscle (ECR) in order to optimize clinical relevance. We found that anodal tDCS applied to the primary motor cortex at rest induced similar aftereffects in ECR as those previously reported for the intrinsic hand muscles, however, only when aftereffects were measured while subjects performed a controlled muscle activation. This confirms that targeting more proximal muscles of the upper limb with tDCS is achievable. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the effects of anodal tDCS on corticomotor excitability can be appropriately assessed during a low-level controlled contraction of the target muscle. This outcome is positive for future studies in clinical populations such as stroke survivors, where TMS induced MEPs are mostly absent during rest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Chiara Dos Santos and Ivonne Pold for their assistance with data collection.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0101496-Nitsche1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
