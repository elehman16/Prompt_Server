Effective treatments are available but are not always delivered to the right person at the right time, with both under- and over-treatment a problem. Up to half the patients presenting to general practice report symptoms of depression, but general practitioners have no systematic way of efficiently identifying level of need and allocating treatment accordingly. Therefore, our team developed a new clinical prediction tool (CPT) to assist with this task. The CPT predicts depressive symptom severity in three months&#x02019; time and based on these scores classifies individuals into three groups (minimal/mild, moderate, severe), then provides a matched treatment recommendation. This study aims to test whether using the CPT reduces depressive symptoms at three months compared with usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The Target-D study is an individually randomized controlled trial. Participants will be 1320 general practice patients with depressive symptoms who will be approached in the practice waiting room by a research assistant and invited to complete eligibility screening on an iPad. Eligible patients will provide informed consent and complete the CPT on a purpose-built website. A computer-generated allocation sequence stratified by practice and depressive symptom severity group, will randomly assign participants to intervention (treatment recommendation matched to predicted depressive symptom severity group) or comparison (usual care plus Target-D attention control) arms. Follow-up assessments will be completed online at three and 12&#x000a0;months. The primary outcome is depressive symptom severity at three months. Secondary outcomes include anxiety, mental health self-efficacy, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Intention-to-treat analyses will test for differences in outcome means between study arms overall and by depressive symptom severity group.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">To our knowledge, this is the first depressive symptom stratification tool designed for primary care which takes a prognosis-based approach to provide a tailored treatment recommendation. If shown to be effective, this tool could be used to assist general practitioners to implement stepped mental-healthcare models and contribute to a more efficient and effective mental health system.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=367152&#x00026;isReview=true">12616000537459</ext-link>).

It is costly to individuals in terms of relationships and functioning and to society in terms of direct medical costs and costs due to loss of individual productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite significant investments in mental health globally, there is no evidence of a reduction in the burden of disease associated with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. One of the biggest challenges facing mental healthcare systems is the need to develop efficient methods of allocating clinically effective treatment in a cost-effective way to the people that need them most [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">The majority of depression cases are identified, treated, and followed up in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, general practitioners (GPs) have been criticized for both under- and over-diagnosing, and treating, depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For example, only 16% of Australians with case level depression or anxiety receive an adequate &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; of an evidence-based intervention consistent with treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. On the other hand, antidepressant prescriptions far outnumber patients for whom such medication is indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Multi-country studies report that 24&#x02013;55% of patients in primary care waiting rooms meet screening criteria for being &#x0201c;probably depressed&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, among this population of &#x0201c;probably depressed,&#x0201d; a range of illness trajectories exist which contribute to the difficulty experienced by practitioners in making a diagnosis and treatment recommendation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It may be that the heterogeneity of clinical presentation which characterizes depression in the primary care setting is leading to the simultaneous problems of both over- and under-diagnosis and treatment.</p><p id="Par32">Currently, there is a mismatch in primary care between patient need and the depression care received, possibly as a result of poor treatment allocation. For example, delivery of intensive interventions to people with minimal or mild symptoms is unnecessarily costly and risks medicalizing normal fluctuations in mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Conversely, without a targeted intensive intervention, people likely to experience severe and chronic symptoms are likely to experience significant disability, which could have been avoided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Stepped care models, in which patients are, in the first instance, provided with the least time- and resource-intensive intervention that will be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], have been promoted as a potential solution to the problem of poor treatment allocation. Although limited empirical evidence exists as to their effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], these models make intuitive sense and feature in both clinical guidelines and policy directives in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Currently, a key obstacle to the implementation of stepped care models is the lack of effective treatment allocation tools to guide GPs in matching the intensity of treatment to a patient&#x02019;s needs. In particular, current recommendations focus on matching treatment to the patient&#x02019;s current symptom severity, rather than patient&#x02019;s likely course of illness in the future. This is out of step with the management of other conditions (e.g. cardiovascular disease or cancer), which routinely take prognostic factors into account when deciding upon treatment recommendations. Further, it contrasts with calls for research, policy, and practice to make prognosis-based intervention a priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To date, there has been no quick and systematic way for GPs to identify depression outcomes that a particular person is likely to experience in the future and recommend treatment accordingly.</p><p id="Par34">One option for systematizing treatment recommendations is to use a clinical prediction tool (CPT). CPTs are based on a prognostic model that uses clinical and non-clinical information to estimate an individual&#x02019;s risk of a specific outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The prognostic model is applied in clinical practice using the CPT which stratifies patients into different treatments according to their estimated risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. While CPTs are common in many fields of medicine, they are not readily available for use in mental-healthcare settings. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]</p><p id="Par35">To address this gap, we wanted to develop a simple, easy-to-use CPT to assist primary care clinicians to triage patients presenting with depressive symptoms and allocate to appropriate treatment. First, we investigated whether an existing prognostic model for depression could be used to build the CPT. We identified several prognostic models that have been developed to predict current [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] or future major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] or treatment response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, none of these prognostic models were found to be suitable for incorporating into a CPT which could be easily administered in routine care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Therefore, we developed a novel prognostic model using data from the <italic>diamond</italic> cohort study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] to predict depressive symptom severity at three months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It comprises 17 items assessing depressive symptom severity at baseline as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]: sex; current anxiety; history of depression; presence of chronic illness affecting daily functioning; self-rated health; living alone; and perceived ability to manage on available income. Based on an individual&#x02019;s score, he or she is stratified into one of three groups based on predicted depressive symptom scores at three months; namely, minimal/mild (those predicted to have a PHQ score of&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;10 at three months), moderate (PHQ&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10 and&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;13), and severe (&#x02265;13). Cutoffs for the three groups were established during the development of the <italic>diamond</italic> CPT and are explained in full elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

The primary objective is to test for a standardized effect size of 0.2SD in mean depressive symptoms at three months between the intervention and comparison arms. However, we based our calculations on our planned subgroup analyses because the sample size required would need to be larger to test for difference between study arms within each of the three depressive symptom severity groups than combined. Therefore, we based sample size on detecting a standardized mean difference of 0.2 between arms for the minimal/mild group (given the potential floor effect we anticipate a smaller intervention effect). We hypothesized a standardized effect size of 0.5 in the moderate and severe depressive symptom severity groups as they have room for greater improvement and will receive more intensive treatments.</p><p id="Par70">Based on the CPT development work, we anticipated that 70% of participants will be classified as being likely to have minimal/mild depressive symptoms, 15% as moderate, and 15% as severe depressive symptoms at three months. We used these estimates to extrapolate the total sample size needed to ensure that we had sufficient power for the sub-group analyses. Based on these assumptions, we required 158 (78 in each arm) participants in each of the moderate and severe groups to detect a standardized effect size of 0.5 and 740 (370 in each arm) in the mild/minimal group to detect a smaller standardized effect size of 0.2, with 80% power and 5% significance level for a two-sided test.</p><p id="Par71">This leads to an anticipated sample size of 1056 participants (528 in each arm), which is also sufficient for the primary objective to detect a standardized effect size of 0.2 in the mean PHQ-9 between study arms, with 90% power and 5% significance level. A standardized effect size of 0.2 is equivalent to a mean change of 1.35 points in the mean depressive symptoms assuming a standard deviation on 6.75 (based on <italic>diamond</italic> data). This effect size is in keeping with those found in systematic reviews of interventions to decrease depressive symptom severity in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p id="Par72">We inflated the required sample size to 1320 to allow for 20% attrition at 12&#x000a0;months. Based upon documented response rates and depressive symptom prevalence gathered from our experience of recruiting participants with depressive symptoms in the primary care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], achieving this sample size at baseline requires that we invite 22,000 adults to complete the screening tool (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Expected progression of participants through the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2089_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

We will recruit general practices via our Victorian Primary Care Practice-Based Research Network (VicReN), which has around 200 GP members located in Victoria, Australia. Practices will be contacted by phone and/or email to introduce the study and establish interest. One of the Target-D researchers will then visit interested practices to determine eligibility, provide detailed information about the study, and gain consent to participate. This process will continue until sufficient practices are recruited to obtain the required sample size.</p><p id="Par74">To enhance GP and practice staff engagement in the trial and the activities necessary to make it function, we will be guided by the principles of Normalization Process Theory (NPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]; namely, coherence (meaning of the trial to GPs and staff), cognitive participation (commitment and engagement), collective action (the work GPs and staff do to make the trial function), and reflexive monitoring (GP and staff appraisal of the trial). In each participating practice, GPs and staff will be given a training session clarifying the goals and activities of the trial, in order to instill a sense that the trial is a good idea and worth committing to. In addition, we will clearly outline the trial procedures and how they are likely to affect the work of the practice, with emphasis on how the trial fits with the overall goals of the general practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Minimizing contamination</title><p id="Par75">Randomizing individuals that were recruited from the same general practice, where the clinician is not blinded to the participant&#x02019;s study arm or the intervention is implemented at the practice level, may have a greater risk of contamination between intervention and comparison arms than randomizing a group of individuals that do not belong to the same practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, the risk of contamination in this trial is expected to be minimal because of several factors. First, recruitment of participants will be conducted in the waiting room by an RA who is not involved in delivering the study intervention and has no access to the allocation schedule. While patients in the waiting room or from the same family or friendship groups may share information, it is unlikely that this will impact the intervention effect as the intervention can only be accessed by permission of the study team. Second, GPs will only be informed of participants allocated to collaborative care treatment. Even if other patients inform their GP that they are participating in Target-D, GPs will not be informed of their treatment allocation nor be able to access study interventions for UC+ patients. Third, the intervention for minimal/mild groups will be via Internet-based programs delivered outside the practice, reducing the potential for practice-based contamination. We will assess the number of UC+ participants registering for these programs to measure the degree of potential contamination. Fourth, the risk that GPs may implement some of the intervention to patients predicted to have severe symptoms and allocated to the UC+ group is small. We anticipate that fewer than ten such participants will be recruited per practice and this small number of patients will be seen by different GPs. We have successfully used a similar approach in a previous RCT in general practice; data from this trial showed very low levels of interaction between comparison participants and the GP during the study time-frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Primary care patients</title><p id="Par76">Potential participants will be alerted to the study via posters and information pamphlets displayed in practice waiting rooms; an awareness raising strategy used by the research team previously. All study materials and procedures were developed and tested with focus groups and individual feedback to ensure they are engaging and user-friendly. Upon completion of the screening survey, eligible participants will enter their name, telephone number, and email address into an online form. They will then be presented with an electronic copy of the plain language statement and provide online consent to participate.</p><p id="Par77">To achieve our required sample size, trained RAs will approach an average of 50 adults per practice per day, taking approximately 440 working days to approach our required 22,000 adults. These numbers are typical of RCTs in primary care and we have achieved similar numbers in previous successful studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. While this number may seem ambitious, several factors contribute to it being achievable. First, we have designed the trial so that participants are recruited by RAs rather than expecting already time-pressured GPs and practice staff to take responsibility for recruitment. Second, the 22,000 patients RAs will approach include all adult patients in the waiting room; RAs or practice staff are not required to identify only those patients who are presenting to the GP for mental health reasons. Finally, we have tried this approach out in a clinic and shown that on weekdays alone an RA can approach at least 50 patients per day and invite 1100 patients per month to the study. Our pilot work has shown that an RA spends only 1 or 2&#x000a0;min with each patient and can comfortably approach 150 patients in a working day. Based on this experience and after accounting for weekend recruitment in some practices, we anticipate participant recruitment to take place over approximately 18&#x000a0;months. Recruitment of participants will continue until the numbers within each depressive symptom severity group have been met.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Assignment of interventions</title><sec id="Sec28"><title>Allocation</title><p id="Par78">Consent and baseline measures will be collected prior to randomization to minimize reporting and selection bias.

One reason for this is suggested to be poor allocation of treatment, with both over-treatment for mild symptoms and under-treatment for severe symptoms common. Stepped care models, in which people receive the least time and resource intervention that will be effective, are posited as a solution to this mismatch; however, there is currently no systematic way of identifying which &#x0201c;step&#x0201d; of treatment an individual should be allocated to. In addition, mental health lags behind other fields of medicine in focusing on which step is appropriate given the person&#x02019;s current symptoms, rather than their future course of illness.</p><p id="Par104">We have therefore developed a new CPT which predicts depressive symptom severity at three months and provides an evidence-based treatment recommendation accordingly. In the Target-D trial, we will test whether using this tool to match individuals to treatment is a clinically effective and cost-efficient way of reducing depressive symptom severity, relative to usual care. If the Target-D model for depression management is efficacious and cost-effective, implementation into practice could reduce unnecessary treatment burden and improve allocation of treatment resources.</p><sec id="Sec45"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par105">At the time of submission, patient recruitment to the Target-D trial is ongoing. The anticipated study completion date is July 2018.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec46"><p>
