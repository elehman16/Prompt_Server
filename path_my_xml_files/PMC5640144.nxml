Cervical ripening by pharmacological or mechanical techniques before oxytocin administration is used to increase the likelihood of vaginal delivery. Both techniques are equally effective in achieving vaginal delivery but excessive uterine activity, which induces fetal heart rate (FHR) anomalies, is more frequent after the pharmacological intervention. We hypothesised that mechanical cervical ripening could reduce the caesarean rate for non-reassuring FHR especially in PP where fetuses are already susceptible to this.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A multicentre, superiority, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial that aims to compare cervical ripening with a mechanical device (Cervical Ripening Balloon, Cook-Medical Europe, Ireland) inserted in standardised manner for 24&#x02009;hours to pharmacological cervical ripening (Propess system for slow release system of 10&#x02009;mg of dinoprostone, Ferring SAS, France) before oxytocin administration. Women (n=1220) will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio in 15 French units. Participants will be women with a singleton pregnancy, a vertex presentation, a term &#x02265;41+0&#x02009;and&#x02264;42+0&#x02009;week&#x02019;s gestation, and for whom induction of labour is planned. Women with a Bishop score &#x02265;6, a prior caesarean delivery, premature rupture of membranes or with any contraindication for vaginal delivery will be excluded. The primary endpoint is the caesarean rate for non-reassuring FHR. Secondary outcomes are related to delivery and perinatal morbidity. As study investigators and patients cannot be masked to treatment assignment, to compensate for the absence of blinding, an independent endpoint adjudication committee, blinded to group allocation, will determine whether the caesarean for non-reassuring FHR was justified.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants.

No particular method is currently recommended for cervical ripening in PP and practices vary.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> We hypothesise that mechanical cervical ripening, which involves less excessive uterine activity, which in turn causes FHR anomalies, could reduce the rates of both caesarean sections for non-reassuring FHR and perinatal morbidity in PP.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>Mechanical cervicAl ripeninG for women with PrOlongedPregnancies&#x000a0;(MAGPOP) is a multicentre, superiority, open-label, randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups comparing mechanical cervical ripening to pharmacological cervical ripening among women with PP.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting</title><p>The study will take place in 15 French maternity units in both university and general hospitals, each with &#x0003e;2000 deliveries annually. Inclusions will start in January 2017. All maternity units are equipped with maternal and neonatal intensive care units. Obstetricians in all maternity units are familiar with and use both cervical ripening techniques (as described in the intervention section below) in their daily practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Participants</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Study population</title><p>The inclusion criteria are (1) women&#x02265;18 years; (2) pregnant with a singleton pregnancy, a vertex presentation with a term&#x000a0;&#x02265;41+0&#x02009;and&#x02264;42+0 weeks of gestation (gestational age estimated from an ultrasound performed between 11 and 13+6 weeks of gestation); and&#x000a0;(3) for whom induction of labour has been decided. The exclusion criteria are Bishop score&#x000a0;&#x02265;6 (favourable cervix), a non-vertex presentation (breech or transverse), severe pre-eclampsia, previous caesarean delivery or other uterine scar, placenta praevia, suspected genital herpes infection, known HIV seropositivity, premature rupture of membranes with either continual leaking of or a test result positive for amniotic fluid, suspected severe congenital abnormalities and a pathological FHR. The study will include the women who meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria and who are willing to participate and able to sign informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Recruitment</title><p>French guidelines call for monitoring of fetal well-being every other day in PP.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This surveillance period is monitored by midwives, sonographers and physicians, who will recruit potential participants by screening women and describing the study objectives to those who meet the inclusion criteria. Because some women are likely to go into labour spontaneously and the Bishop score is likely to change during uterine contractions, randomisation should take place just before cervical ripening is planned to begin.</p><p>On the day that cervical ripening is planned, examination will include verification of all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Cervical examination will determine the Bishop score, and fetal cardiotocography will verify the normality of FHR according to FIGO&#x02019;s revised classification.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Written consent will be obtained from all women who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, have been fully informed about the study and are willing to participate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups.</p><p>Randomisation and concealment will be ensured by a secure, computer-generated, online centralised web-based system. Randomisation will be stratified on centre (to avoid measurement biases) and parity (to avoid prognostic imbalance between the groups).</p><p>The randomisation sequence will be generated by a statistician from INSERM CIC 1415 who is not involved in patient recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Interventions</title><p>Women admitted for cervical ripening will be fasting. Only the method used for cervical ripening (silicone double balloon catheter or the slow-release system) will differ between the two groups. Midwives or medical doctors (senior and junior) are responsible for placement of the silicone double balloon catheter or the dinoprostone slow-release system. Both placements are simple procedures.</p><sec id="s2e1"><title>Mechanical cervical ripening</title><p>The mechanical cervical ripening device is a silicone double balloon catheter with an adjustable length malleable stylet (Cook Cervical Ripening Balloon, Cook Medical Europe, Limerick, Ireland, reference J-CRBS-184000), which will be inserted according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</p><p>The aim is to position the upper or uterine balloon against the internal os and the lower balloon in the vagina so that the catheter is in the cervical canal. Inflation of both balloons induces pressure against the cervix, intended to induce the release of prostaglandins and thus uterine contractions.</p><p>The first step consists in inserting the malleable stylet into the silicone catheter, stiffening the catheter and facilitating the catheter&#x02019;s introduction into the cervix. The patient should be in the gynaecological position. A speculum is first inserted to gain cervical access, and the cervix wiped with an appropriate (according to the woman&#x02019;s allergies) solution to prepare for device insertion. The catheter is introduced into the cervical canal so that both balloons reach the extra-amniotic space. Clinicians first inflate the upper (uterine) balloon with 40&#x02009;mL of saline. Once the upper balloon is inflated, the operator pulls the device back until the balloon abuts the internal cervical os. The vaginal balloon is then visible outside the external cervical os and is next inflated with 40&#x02009;mL of saline. Once the balloons are situated on either side of the cervix, saline is inserted in both balloons to a maximum volume of 80&#x02009;mL per balloon.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Pharmacological cervical ripening</title><p>The pharmacological cervical ripening procedure is the administration of a system for the slow vaginal release of 10&#x02009;mg dinoprostone (prostaglandins PGE2 Propess, Ferring SAS, Gentilly, France). The Propess slow-release system is inserted in the vagina, against the cervix, with or without a speculum, according to the local protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s2e3"><title>Intervention standardisation</title><p>Volunteer maternity units were selected to participate only if they regularly used both techniques (catheters and slow-release system) so that all physicians and midwives responsible for inserting the devices were accustomed to using both options in their daily practice. An information meeting was held in each participating unit to verify that both devices were used according to guidelines and to ensure homogeneity of practices.</p><p>To ensure the absence of bias induced by the product management, the investigator&#x02019;s pharmacy will supply all devices in each investigational site. Pharmacists at each investigational site are responsible for traceability and storage: the silicone double balloon catheters must be stored in a dry place, away from light, and the slow-release systems in a freezer at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C to &#x02212;10&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="s2e4"><title>Follow-up</title><p>After cervical ripening begins, women in both groups will be monitored identically. FHR will be monitored by external tocography for 2&#x02009;hours, as French guidelines recommend.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> If labour is not induced immediately and if the FHR is reassuring, fetal condition and uterine activity will be intermittently monitored, as recommended.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> If premature rupture of the membranes or FHR anomalies occur, the devices (either the catheter or the dinoprostone slow-release system) should be removed. If FHR anomalies persist, and uterine hyperactivity appears to be the cause of these anomalies, tocolysis can be considered.</p><p>Should the catheter be expelled, a new catheter should not be inserted: because expulsion indicates that the cervix is at least two centimetres dilated, the Bishop score is high enough to proceed to oxytocin administration. Because dinoprostone is not effective until at least 12&#x02009;hours after placement, expulsion of the system (the loss rate is expected to be 5%) during the first 12&#x02009;hours should be followed by insertion of a new one, but expulsion after 12&#x02009;hours should not. If labour starts at any time, the patient will be transferred to the labour ward. Epidural analgesia will be placed according to the patient&#x02019;s wishes and the usual medical indications and contraindications.</p><p>If labour has not started by 24&#x02009;hours after cervical ripening began, the device (catheter and slow-release system) should be removed to start the induction of labour with oxytocin/amniotomy. As recommended, perfusion of oxytocin should not start until at least 30&#x02009;min after device removal.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Blinding</title><p>The nature of the intervention makes it impossible to blind any of the physicians, midwives or women. Measures will be taken to compensate for the absence of blinding (see below &#x02018;adjudication committee&#x02019;).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Study outcomes</title><sec id="s2g1"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>We have chosen not to use either the caesarean rate or the rate of vaginal delivery at 24&#x02009;hours as principal endpoints, despite their frequent use for this purpose in clinical research, because it has already been proved that mechanical and pharmacological techniques are equally effective for these outcomes.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Our hypothesis instead is that mechanical ripening can reduce caesarean sections for non-reassuring fetal status in PP fetuses, who are more vulnerable to this outcome. Accordingly, the primary endpoint is the caesarean rate for non-reassuring fetal status (with or without arrest of labour) and it will be determined by an adjudication committee.</p></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Adjudication committee</title><p>Although caesarean delivery is an objective outcome, the decision to perform a caesarean is not. Two different physicians may take different decisions for the same obstetric situation, and physicians frequently disagree about indications for caesareans. Similarly, the same physician facing the same situation twice may decide differently each time. Our primary outcome is considered to be an outcome &#x02018;objectively measured but potentially influenced by clinician judgment&#x02019;, as defined by Savovic <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> To avoid bias due to this physician influence on outcome, we decided that a blinded independent committee would adjudicate the primary outcome at the end of the study. This committee will comprise three members, all with extensive experience in interpreting FHR and none working in a participating centre. Once inclusion is complete and all the data have been collected, the committee will adjudicate all primary outcomes, blinded to the method of cervical ripening, determining whether or not non-reassuring fetal status indicated/justified the caesarean. This is therefore a PROBE study: Prospective, Randomised, Open, with Blinded Evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s2g3"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Secondary outcomes include the following.</p><sec id="s2g3a"><title>

Mechanical ripening may be a safer procedure than pharmacological ripening in these situations.</p><p>Our ultimate aim, if our hypothesis is confirmed, will be to assess extension of the use of mechanical methods to situations of &#x02018;fragile or compromised fetuses&#x02019; besides PP, such as small-for-gestational-age fetuses or those with indicated preterm delivery. The aim is to reduce the caesarean rates for these births. Around 20% of deliveries in France are caesarean sections. This mode of delivery, which is inevitable in some situations, considerably increases perinatal morbidity and is a major public health issue.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref> Caesarean deliveries are associated with longer hospitalisation of women, thromboembolic risk, postoperative wound infection, global cost of care and long-term outcome (increased risk in subsequent pregnancies of, eg, placenta percreta). Reducing the caesarean rate would also improve neonatal health by reducing the risk of neonatal respiratory distress, admission to the neonatal ward and neonatal mortality. Limitations of this study include the impossibility of blinding and the choice of an objectively measured outcome that is nonetheless potentially influenced by clinicians.
