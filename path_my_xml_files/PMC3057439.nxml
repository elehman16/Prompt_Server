                disabling medical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102410381142">1</xref>), affecting 12% of the US population: 18% of women and
                6% of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102410381142">2</xref>).
                During the course of their illness, which often begins in childhood or adolescence,
                approximately 3% to 14% of migraine patients will progress to
                chronic migraine (CM), with more than half of the days of each month in pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102410381142">3</xref>). Despite major advances
                in understanding the pathogenesis of migraine, new pharmacologic treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102410381142">4</xref>) and the availability of
                intensive systems of care for difficult cases, in many patients migraines remain
                intractable to medical therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102410381142">5</xref>).</p><p>In 1999 Weiner and Reed reported the beneficial effects of subcutaneous occipital
                nerve stimulation (ONS) in 12 of 13 patients who they believed to have occipital
                neuralgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0333102410381142">6</xref>). Leads were
                placed in the subcutaneous tissue superficial to the cervical musculature and fascia
                transversing the occipital nerves at the level of C1. A review of Weiner&#x02019;s
                cases by author JRS at the behest of Medtronic Neuromodulation resulted in a
                challenge to the diagnosis of occipital neuralgia (unpublished results). JRS
                subsequently recommended that these patients be evaluated by author PJG using
                functional neuroimaging (positron emission tomography). These studies, performed in
                eight patients, demonstrated brain changes (phenotype and imaging signature)
                consistent with CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102410381142">7</xref>).</p><p>Published reports from open-label studies have demonstrated possible efficacy of ONS
                in a variety of primary headache disorders, including CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102410381142">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102410381142">9</xref>), cluster headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102410381142">10</xref>), occipital neuralgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102410381142">11</xref>) and hemicrania continua
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0333102410381142">12</xref>). These findings,
                those of Weiner and Reed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0333102410381142">6</xref>) and those of Goadsby and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102410381142">7</xref>) prompted the development of a feasibility
                study. The goals of the trial were to determine whether a well-designed, controlled
                study that included a valid placebo arm could demonstrate insights into the
                potential benefits and risks of this new therapy. Among the potential risks to be
                assessed were lead migration, lead fracture, skin erosion, infection, loss of
                effect, muscle spasm and battery malfunction or depletion. Preliminary results have
                been presented (American Headache Society Annual Scientific Meeting, Boston, MA,
                June 26, 2008; European Headache and Migraine Trust International Congress,
                September 2008; and American Academy of Neurology, Seattle, WA, April 2009) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0333102410381142">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102410381142">14</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-0333102410381142"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was prospective, multicenter, randomized, blinded, and placebo-controlled.
                It was designed to obtain preliminary safety and efficacy data for ONS treatment of
                CM. As a feasibility study, especially in a patient population that has been the
                focus of very few randomized controlled trials, no primary endpoint was
                prespecified; rather, a range of efficacy measures was identified and evaluated at
                three months in comparison to baseline. Among the endpoints measured were reduction
                in headache days per month, decrease in overall pain intensity (0&#x02013;10 scale)
                and responder rate (i.e. percentage of patients with a &#x02265;50% drop in
                headache days per month or a &#x02265;3-point drop in overall pain intensity from
                baseline, based on daily electronic diary data). A headache day was defined as each
                day that a subject rated his or her overall headache pain intensity as &#x02265;3.
                CM was diagnosed using the second edition of the International Classification of
                Headache Disorders (ICHD-II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0333102410381142">15</xref>). Subject enrollment criteria included (i) headaches occurring on 15
                or more days per month for more than three months in the absence of medication
                overuse, (ii) pain involving the occipital or suboccipital region and (iii) pain

                    medical management (MM), using a randomization ratio of 2:1:1, respectively.
                    After implantation, the AS group was instructed to maintain the stimulator in
                    the &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; position and to adjust the device to minimize pain.
                    Serving as the control group for the AS group were subjects who received an
                    implanted device that provided PS rather than AS. For these patients the device
                    was set at a stimulation setting for one minute each day during the blinded
                    phase of the study. A third group, also serving as a control group, received
                    only MM during the blinded phase of the study. Unlike subjects in the AS and PS
                    groups, who were required to maintain stable medication regimens (although
                    frequency and dose of acute medications could change if necessary), subjects in
                    the MM group were able to adjust, change and optimize medication regimens as
                    directed by their physicians. A fourth group, the ancillary group, met all entry
                    criteria except response to occipital nerve block (ONB), which was an entry
                    criterion for the other groups. A lack of response to ONB was defined as a
                    failure to experience at least a 50% reduction in migraine pain within
                    24 hours of the injection of 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;ml of 0.5% bupivacaine
                    into each greater occipital nerve distribution. Patients in the ancillary group

                        phase and confirmation of enrollment visit. At the preliminary enrollment
                        visit, information was collected, including health and well-being status,
                        medical history and medication history. A preliminary diagnosis was also
                        rendered. During the daily questionnaire enrollment phase, subjects
                        completed an electronic daily questionnaire (EDQ) for a minimum of nine
                        weeks, providing information about their headache, daily functional ability
                        and medications taken. During the first week, subjects familiarized
                        themselves with the questionnaire equipment. The purpose of the last eight
                        weeks before the confirmation of enrollment visit was to establish baseline
                        headache data. During the confirmation of enrollment visit, data from the
                        EDQ was evaluated for diary compliance and headache features. Subjects who
                        continued to meet eligibility requirements were given a short-acting ONB by
                        the neurologist investigator. Those with a positive response to the ONB were

                        implanted subcutaneously, superficial to the fascia and muscle layer at the
                        level of C1. Intraoperative testing was consistently performed according to
                        the ONS <italic>System Manual</italic> to determine if a subject&#x02019;s
                        response to stimulation, as judged by adequate paresthesia coverage of the
                        area of headache pain, was appropriate to receive a full implant. There was
                        no trial of stimulation treatment. If during intraoperative testing the
                        implanter believed inadequate paresthesia occurred over the location of pain
                        based on the patient&#x02019;s responses, the leads were removed, and the
                        subject was followed for 30 days for safety and then terminated from the
                        study. Subjects who felt adequate paresthesia over the target pain location
                        during intraoperative testing continued with the implant procedure. Final
                        lead placement was identified by X-ray. The implant procedure was performed
                        with additional intravenous sedation to reduce patient discomfort; after
                        lead placement was determined, the lead was locked in place using the twist
                        connector, and a winged anchor was sutured in place. Connectors and
                        extensions were used to allow placement of the neurostimulator just under
                        the skin in the abdomen to reduce lead migration; if the abdominal site was
                        determined to be inappropriate by the physician, the buttock was used. To
                        further reduce the incidence of lead migration, the lead extension was
                        placed with circular coils, creating strain-relief loops. Not all of these
                        implant techniques, such as use of strain-relief loop, were employed
                        consistently at the beginning of or during the study. However, a
                        recommendation of using strain-relief loop and preference of abdominal to
                        buttock implant location of the neurostimulator was provided to all
                        implanters during the study when a number of lead migrations were
                        reported.</p><p>The device was activated after the surgical site healed, between 7 and 14
                        days after implantation. All subjects received ONS using parameters
                        optimized by the physician on the basis of their response to treatment, but
                        the duration of stimulation differed according to group assignment. Patients
                        in the PS group received one minute per day of stimulation and were
                        instructed that their neurostimulator had been pre-programmed to deliver the
                        correct amount of stimulation as determined by their treating physician.
                        Patients in both the AS and PS groups were not informed of the predicted
                        effectiveness of their treatment. Patients in the AS and ancillary groups
                        received a device programmer allowing them to turn the neurostimulator on
                        and off and to make minor adjustments to settings, and they were instructed
                        to maintain the stimulator in the &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; position as much as
                        possible. Subjects in the PS group were not given a device programmer to

                        three-month follow-up visit. Subjects in the ancillary group were treated in
                        the same manner as AS subjects and followed the same visit schedule.
                        Subjects in the AS, PS and AG groups who were on medications were required
                        to maintain stable medicine regimens, although the frequency and dose of
                        acute medications could change if necessary. Those in the MM group were able
                        to adjust and change medication regimens throughout the three-month blinded
                        phase, as directed by their physicians. After the three-month follow-up
                        visit, all subjects, regardless of initial group, were able to adjust acute
                        and prophylactic medication regimens as needed.</p><p>The ONSTIM feasibility study has completed three-month blinded follow-up

                    subjects in the AS group and 12 subjects in each of the PS and MM groups was
                    required. In keeping with the exploratory nature of the study, it was not
                    powered for a single primary endpoint. However, according to the protocol,
                    statistical analysis was performed to allow more critical consideration of the
                    data in order to identify factors and nuances that might be helpful in further
                    studies. A per-protocol analysis, including all subjects who completed the
                    electronic diary during the three-month blinded follow-up, was used to compare
                    subjects who completed three months of stimulation therapy in the AS group with
                    subjects in the PS, MM and ancillary groups who also completed three months of

                13, 2007. A total of 110 subjects aged 18 years and older were enrolled to achieve
                the final sample size of 75 subjects assigned to a treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102410381142">Figure 2</xref>). Thirty-five
                subjects discontinued the study prior to being assigned to a treatment group. The
                most common reasons for discontinuation were failure to meet the confirmation of
                enrollment criteria, withdrawal of consent or physician-determined withdrawal prior
                to treatment assignment. After meeting the study inclusion criteria, subjects were
                randomized into the study groups: 33 subjects in the AS group; 17 subjects in the PS
                group; and 17 subjects in the MM control group (ratio 2:1:1, respectively). Eight
                subjects were entered into the ancillary group to evaluate the predictive value of
                ONB. Of the 75 subjects assigned to a treatment group, eight discontinued prior to
                the end of the three-month blinded phase of the study: four subjects withdrew
                consent prior to implant (two AS, one PS, 1 ancillary group); two subjects were
                intraoperative failures (one AS, one ancillary group); one AS subject was lost to
                follow-up prior to implant; one ancillary group subject discontinued after the
                one-month follow-up visit because of lack of efficacy. Of the 67 subjects who
                continued to the three-month blinded follow-up, one subject (AS) did not complete
                the EDQ between implant and three months; 66 subjects (28 AS, 16&#x02009;PS, 17 MM,

                carried out relatively safely and is worthy of further study for this indication.
                Although the study was not prospectively powered for efficacy evaluation, the
                39% responder rate in the AS group is comparable with response rates
                achieved with widely used preventive CM treatments, such as topiramate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0333102410381142">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0333102410381142">17</xref>). Moreover, findings from the current
                study are consistent with recent work suggesting that the response to ONB may not
                predict treatment outcomes of ONS in primary headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0333102410381142">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0333102410381142">20</xref>). However, it is important to note that
                data from the current study and others regarding the predictive value of ONB must be
                interpreted with caution because of their small sample sizes. The value of response
                to ONB as a predictive factor remains to be determined, with the results suggesting
                this issue needs resolving in future studies.</p><p>The decision to employ ONS for the diagnosis of CM rather than for occipital
                neuralgia is based on the clinical phenotyping of patients responding to therapy
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102410381142">7</xref>). This is not to
                eliminate headache of cervical origin as a candidate for ONS; indeed, a
                retrospective review of cases responding to the procedure demonstrated a substantial
                cervicogenic cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0333102410381142">21</xref>).
                Because CM is among the most refractory and costly to treat of the primary headache
                disorders and because chronic daily or near-daily headache affects up to 4%
                of the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0333102410381142">22</xref>), it
                was reasoned that if neurostimulation was effective and safe in treating this
                population, it would represent an important therapeutic contribution to quality of
                life for those who suffer from this illness and perhaps for long-term cost control
                as well.</p><p>Although the complete pathophysiology of CM remains unclear, a role for the
                trigeminocervical complex seems established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0333102410381142">23</xref>). The intermingling of fibers from
                trigeminal afferents with those from cervical inputs, especially those of C2,
                underpins the phenotype of many primary headaches, including migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0333102410381142">24</xref>). It is clear from
                experimental studies even in nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0333102410381142">25</xref>) that second-order trigeminocervical
                afferents are involved in dura-vascular nociceptive transmission. Indeed, direct
                stimulation of C2 afferents can excite second-order trigeminal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0333102410381142">26</xref>). Direct evidence of
                this can be seen in patients with greater stimulation of the occipital nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0333102410381142">27</xref>) and, indeed, from the
                distribution of pain, which ignores cutaneous innervation boundaries. Moreover,
                clinical experience whereby occipital nerve injections have been used in the
                management of both migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0333102410381142">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0333102410381142">29</xref>) and
                cluster headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0333102410381142">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0333102410381142">31</xref>)
                reinforce the potential for treatment of these disorders by manipulation of the
                nerve. Functional imaging work has demonstrated changes in thalamic activation with
                ONS in CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102410381142">7</xref>), without
                change in the underlying brainstem activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0333102410381142">32</xref>), suggesting a neuromodulatory mechanism
                for this potential therapy.</p><p>This study indicates that the adverse events from the period of implantation to three
                months are not prohibitive to further exploration of therapy. The primary ADEs
                involved lead migration or dislodgement and incision-site complications. Lead
                migrations, although not generally defined as a serious adverse event, ultimately
                require a repeat invasive procedure and therefore should not be minimized in
                importance. There was no evidence of ADEs leading to long-term complications or
                potential nerve damage. Additional studies are currently reviewing the long-term
                effects of ONS. No unanticipated ADEs occurred in this study. Moreover, from this
                study we have gained sufficient technical information to move toward reducing lead
                migration in future studies, including considerations of appropriate strain-relief
                loops, anchors, implant locations, implant procedures and lead migration assessment
                techniques.</p><p>Even if the design and power of this study were sufficient to provide statistically
                reliable results, a responder rate of 39%, or any of the other positive
                findings reported here, might not seem compelling in support of neurostimulation.
                Nonetheless, from the perspective of an often treatment-refractory population of
                patients, such a finding could represent an important therapeutic signal for at
                least a subset of patients that justifies continued study in pursuit of ultimate
                therapeutic value. Patients with CM are often left without effective treatment,
                causing patients to lead lives that are painful and compromised. Patients with CM
                often travel from physician to physician and center to center, and are prescribed
                long lists of powerful medications, many in complex combinations that both
                compromise function and impose risk. Were a well-designed, controlled, and blinded
                study to demonstrate that even a small subset of patients with CM achieved reliable,
                substantial, prolonged benefit from ONS, we believe it would represent an important
                contribution to the care of these patients.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, trial duration was short. A longer period
                of observation might reveal a different pattern of adverse events. Second, complete
                patient and investigator blinding was difficult to achieve. Although subjects and
                neurologists were blinded, implanters were necessarily unblinded for conduct of the
                study. In addition, maintaining subjects in a blinded mode is difficult in any study
                when stimulation can be perceived. The PS group did not have a device programmer,
                which also could have led to unblinding. Third, the preset stimulation might have,
                itself, had a therapeutic benefit, although this did not appear to be the case in
                the current study. Finally, the parameter of headache days could have used more
                sensitive definition, such as days with moderate or severe headache specified by not
                only intensity but also duration.</p><p>Many questions beyond basic efficacy remain unanswered for this therapy. Long-term
                safety of stimulation, durability of any positive benefit and technical and
                electronic reliability remain untested. Psychological and clinical eligibility for
                stimulation, the effect of medications on stimulation response (or lack thereof),
                interventional technique considerations and device and lead design factors have yet
                to be determined or fully explored.</p><p>There are many challenges to overcome before reliable conclusions on matters of
                efficacy and safety of ONS in medically intractable CM can be established.
                Developing a bona fide placebo group for surgical implant studies is particularly
                important&#x02014;and particularly difficult. The perception of paresthesia may be
                required to obtain pain control, but technical issues make creation of this
                sensation in a placebo group a major challenge for the design of randomized
                controlled trials. Although the PS group represents a step to address this issue,
                more must be done to assure that the placebo stimulus is not itself therapeutically
                effective. In addition, better screening criteria are needed. However, because
                medically intractable CM is a frequent cause of disability and a therapeutic
                challenge in neurological practice, attempting to overcome these in future studies
                is a worthwhile pursuit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec21-0333102410381142"><title>Conclusion</title><p>On the basis of the current findings and in light of previously published work, we
                believe further investigational pursuit to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ONS
                for medically intractable CM is justified. Further study would be enhanced by
                improved stimulator design, implanting technique and lead design and by a
                well-targeted, carefully selected study population, more robust endpoints, longer
                trial duration and improved blinding techniques. Reliable conclusions regarding
                efficacy cannot be established on the basis of this study alone. Nonetheless, the
                results of this feasibility study offer promise and should prompt further study of
                ONS in medically intractable CM.</p></sec><sec id="sec22-0333102410381142"><title>Authorship and disclosure</title><p>The study was designed by the authors and employees of Medtronic Neuromodulation. The
