GSK&#x02019;s candidate HZ vaccine containing recombinant varicella zoster virus glycoprotein E (gE) subunit and AS01<sub>B</sub> Adjuvant System (HZ/su) showed &#x0003e;90% efficacy for HZ prevention in immunocompetent adults aged &#x02265;50 years. The HZ incidence in individuals with solid tumors (ST) receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy (chemo) is estimated as 3&#x02013;4 times higher than in the overall US population (3.2/1000 person-years). We present HZ/su immunogenicity and safety in ST adults aged &#x02265;18 years.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>In this phase II/III, observer-blind, multicenter study (NCT01798056), ST adults received 2 doses of HZ/su or placebo intramuscularly 1&#x02013;2 months apart and were randomized 4:4:1:1 to receive a first dose 8&#x02013;30 days (D) pre-chemo (HZ/su &#x02013; HZ/su-PreC group, placebo &#x02013; Pl-PreC) or on chemo start (&#x000b1;1 D) (HZ/su-OnC, Pl-OnC). Vaccine response rates (VRRs) and geometric means (GMs)/means were evaluated for gE humoral immune and gE-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses 1 month (M2) and 12 months (M13) post-dose 2. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were recorded for 7 D and unsolicited and medically-attended AEs (MAEs) for 30 D post each dose. Potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) and serious AEs (SAEs) were recorded until study end.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>185 subjects (65 HZ/su-PreC, 78 Pl-PreC, 22 HZ/su-OnC, 20 Pl-OnC) were included in the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for humoral immunogenicity and 58 (27 HZ/su-PreC, 31 Pl-PreC) in the ATP sub-cohort for CMI. The most common ST were breast tumors (54% HZ/su, 49% placebo), followed by colorectal, lung, then other. Humoral and CMI VRRs were higher in HZ/su than Pl groups at M2 and M13. GM concentration (GMC) was highest at M2 in HZ/su-PreC. M13 GMCs were similar in the HZ/su-PreC and HZ/su-OnC groups (Table 1). The frequency of local solicited AEs was higher in HZ/su than Pl groups (Table 2); that of general solicited, unsolicited AEs, MAEs and SAEs was similar among groups (Table 3). 1 pIMD (Pl-OnC) and 23 fatal SAEs were reported. No SAE was considered vaccine-related by investigators.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>HZ/su was highly immunogenic in ST adults receiving chemo. No safety concerns were raised.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx163_IF0460"/></fig><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx163_IF0461"/></fig><fig fig-type="figure" id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx163_IF0462"/></fig></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Disclosures</title><p>
