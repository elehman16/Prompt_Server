Bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) primarily by increasing aqueous humor outflow via the uveoscleral outflow pathway; bimatoprost also appears to act via the trabecular meshwork.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-5-759">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-5-759">5</xref> The safety and efficacy of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% administered as an eyedrop for glaucoma treatment has been well studied and repeatedly demonstrated in trials lasting up to 48 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-5-759">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-opth-5-759">10</xref></p><p>In December 2008, bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% received FDA approval for an additional indication of hypotrichosis of the eyelashes, marketed as Latisse<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (bimatoprost 0.03% ophthalmic solution, Allergan, Inc). It is the first and only FDA-approved treatment to increase eyelash growth, as measured by length, thickness/fullness, and darkness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-5-759">11</xref> The efficacy and safety of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% to enhance eyelash prominence was established in a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled study in which bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% was applied to the upper eyelid margins of healthy subjects (n = 278) once daily (QD) for up to four months, followed by a one-month treatment-free follow-up period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-opth-5-759">12</xref> The use of bimatoprost in the treatment of eyelash hypotrichosis was recently reviewed elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-opth-5-759">13</xref></p><p>The efficacy of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% was demonstrated by statistically significant improvements in clinician ratings and digital image analysis assessing eyelash length, fullness, and darkness as compared with vehicle; these improvements were sustained during the one-month treatment-free follow-up period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-opth-5-759">12</xref> Findings were supported by statistically significant differences in patient-reported outcomes favoring bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% over vehicle, beginning at week 1 and sustained through the treatment and posttreatment follow-up periods.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-opth-5-759">12</xref> The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was generally similar between treatment groups; conjunctival hyperemia was the only AE reported in a significantly greater number of subjects receiving bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% (3.6% [n = 5]) than vehicle (0%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-opth-5-759">12</xref></p><p>Because treatment with IOP-lowering medications is expected to be lifelong in most patients, establishing the long-term safety and efficacy of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% is important to the medical community and regulatory authorities. Long-term safety of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for hypotrichosis is important because its benefit is cosmetic rather than medical. The volume of solution of bimatoprost applied to the upper eyelid is approximately 5% of that delivered as an eyedrop for glaucoma treatment (<italic>Pers comm</italic>; Allergan, Inc, 2011). Therefore, a long-term safety analysis from studies of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% QD or twice daily (BID) in glaucoma treatment, which provides a 20-fold (QD administration) to 40-fold (BID administration) increased dosing profile applied to the eye versus bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% when applied to the eyelid skin, may be interpolated to support the long-term safety of dermal application for hypotrichosis.</p><p>The long-term safety of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% in glaucoma treatment was evaluated in six previously published, double-masked, randomized, active-controlled multicenter clinical trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-5-759">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-5-759">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-opth-5-759">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-opth-5-759">17</xref> Although summarized individually, the aggregate long-term safety profile of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% as demonstrated in the six clinical studies has not previously been reported, and is of interest with respect to its new indication.

In addition, the incidence of common AEs was similar across gender and race.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This pooled analysis of safety data from six long-term studies showed that most AEs reported by patients receiving bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% QD or BID as an eyedrop were ocular in nature, mild in severity, and appeared early during treatment. The most common AEs, generally reported at an incidence of &#x02265;5%, including conjunctival hyperemia, growth of eyelashes, and eye pruritus, are consistent with AEs reported in other shorter-term studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-opth-5-759">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-opth-5-759">14</xref> Moreover, as in other studies of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03%, these AEs rarely led to discontinuation from the study. Only 4% of patients receiving QD bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% discontinued the study or treatment due to conjunctival hyperemia, which was reported by 43.7% of patients. One limitation of this pooled analysis is that it does not include data for the eyelash hypotrichosis indication.</p><p>Common AEs were expected and consistent with the pharmacological mechanisms of bimatoprost. Conjunctival hyperemia is a consequence of prostamide-induced vasodilation, and is typically transient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-5-759">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-5-759">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-opth-5-759">19</xref> In the recently completed phase III clinical study of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for treatment of hypotrichosis, the incidence of conjunctival hyperemia was approximately an order of magnitude lower (3.6% with QD eyelid application versus 43.7% with QD eyedrops) than in this pooled analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-5-759">11</xref> This difference may be attributable to the 20-fold (for QD) and 40-fold (for BID) reduction in drug exposure when bimatoprost is applied to the upper eyelid margin in comparison with application as an eyedrop (<italic>Pers comm</italic>, Allergan, Inc). Furthermore, since the bimatoprost solution is applied to the skin for the hypotrichosis indication and not instilled directly into the eye, the skin barrier may further reduce eye and systemic exposure.</p><p>The frequency of iris color change, which appears to be an irreversible side effect associated with prostamides and prostaglandin analogs, was extremely low (0.9%) among patients receiving QD bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% in these glaucoma studies. This rate is consistent with reported rates of 1.1%&#x02013;1.5% for bimatoprost and 5.1%&#x02013;10.1% for latanoprost.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-5-759">18</xref> Iris color change has not been reported in any clinical trials investigating patients receiving bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for hypotrichosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-5-759">11</xref></p><p>The incidence of skin hyperpigmentation among patients receiving QD bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% in the pooled analysis through 48 months was 6.3% from double-masked, open-label-extension studies. This side effect is most often limited to the periocular area and appears to be reversible following treatment discontinuation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-5-759">18</xref> The incidence of skin hyperpigmentation reported in a clinical study of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for eyelash growth was 2.9% and was not statistically more common than in the vehicle group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-5-759">18</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>No unexpected safety signals were identified in this pooled analysis of studies involving continuous bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% use for ocular hypertension or glaucoma treatment for up to four years. All AEs reported (incidence &#x02265;5%) were consistent with those previously encountered in clinical studies of bimatoprost. The most common AE, conjunctival hyperemia, is typically mild, transient, and rarely resulted in treatment discontinuation. Only 4% of the patients treated QD discontinued due to conjunctival hyperemia, which occurred within the first year of treatment. Based on these six long-term studies in 1409 patients with glaucoma, bimatoprost 0.03% has a favorable safety and tolerability profile when instilled in the eye.
