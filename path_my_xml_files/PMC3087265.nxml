Addition of epinephrine appears to be the most widely used additive to local anaesthetic to prolong anaesthesia. Many additives have been tried and this search led us to try an &#x000e1;<sub>2</sub> agonist like clonidine in the dose of 90&#x003bc;g as an additive to local anaesthetic comparing it with adrenaline 200 &#x003bc;g. Many theories have been postulated like clonidine may interfere with the vascular resorption of local anaesthetics by producing vasoconstriction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> or clonidine may have a direct action on neural tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, especially at spinal level or it may induce analgesia via a systemic mechanism after vascular resorption and secondary distribution to the brainstem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>. Direct action of alpha adrenergic agonists on neural tissues i.e. &#x000e1;<sub>2</sub> type receptors is suggested as clonidine when injected at peripheral nerve site has obtained earlier onset of analgesia which lasted longer than obtained with epinephrine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></p><p>The purpose of this randomized double blind study was to compare additives like epinephrine or clonidine to local anaesthetics for onset of sensory and motor block, duration of analgesia, the hemodynamic changes, level of sedation and complications in brachial plexus block.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>60 ASA physical status I and II, aged 18-65 years of either sex undergoing orthopaedic upper limb surgical procedure were included in this study after approval of local ethical committee and obtaining informed consent. Patients with history of cardiac, respiratory, liver and renal problems, pregnant women, coagulative disorders, drug allergy or sensitivity to drugs, cutaneous infection at the site of injection site were excluded from the study. All the patients were fasted for 6 hours before surgery. 18 G intravenous cannula was inserted on contralateral arm and premedication consisted of Inj. Glycopyrollate 0.2 mg intravenously 15 minutes before giving the block. The patients were randomly alloted to two groups of 30 patients each. Supraclavicular brachial plexus block was then performed by the same experienced anaesthesiologist using classical approach with 10ml 2% lignocaine and 20ml 0.5% bupivacaine. Local anaesthetic was supplemented with 1ml of either 200&#x003bc;g of epinephrine (group I) or 90&#x003bc;g of clonidine (group II). Two anaesthetist were involved to perform a double blind study and prevent observer's bias. Preoperative antianxiety and sedative drugs were avoided to study the sedative effect of the additive drug.</p><p>Following criteria were assessed in the operating room</p><p>(i) the time to onset of sensory blockade according to a three point score by pinprick method:</p><p>Grade-0: Anaesthesia- no sensation felt</p><p>Grade-1: Analgesia - dull sensation felt</p><p>Grade-2: Sharp pain felt.</p><p>Sensory score of 2 was taken as time to onset of sensory block.</p><p>(ii) the time to onset of motor blockade according to a three point scale:</p><p>Grade - 0: Complete paralysis</p><p>Grade - 1: Paresis</p><p>Grade - 2: Normal muscle force.</p><p>Motor score of 2 was taken as onset time of complete motor block. Onset of block was monitored every one minute for 20 minutes. Heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2 were measured before anaesthesia(baseline), at premedication, in operation theatre T0, at 5 minutes i.e. T5, T10, T15, T20, T25, T30, T45, T60, T75, T90, T105, T120 and postoperatively at 15, 30, 45 and 60min, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 15 and18 hours. The quality of analgesia was assessed during surgery and in the postoperative period assessed according to a VAS score. When patient began to experience pain more than 5 on the VAS (0 being no pain and 10 being unbearable pain), it was considered that the analgesic action of the drug has terminated and additional analgesic was given. Hemodynamic changes, level of sedation, any other complications were noted. Sedation score was assessed by using the sedation scale described by Culebras<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> for 8 hours postoperatively:</p><p>Grade 1 - awake and alert</p><p>Grade 2 - sedated, responding to verbal stimulus</p><p>Grade 3 - sedated, responding to mild physical stimulus</p><p>Grade 4 - sedated, responds to moderate or severe physical stimulus.</p><p>Observations recorded were tabulated and were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and compared using student's &#x02018;t&#x02019; test by Medcalc software version 11.1.1.0.

This result is in agreement with Goldfarb G<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> and Bernard's<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> study where different concentrations of clonidine were used in axillary plexus block with lignocaine. It is difficult to define the duration of analgesia, however we relied on our patient's tolerance to pain to define the end of analgesia which varied markedly among patients. Duration of analgesia suggested prolongation in clonidine group which are in agreement with Jean's<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> study using clonidine in brachial plexus block. Their duration in clonidine group was longer than our group which can be explained by the difference in the clonidine dose used i.e.150&#x003bc;g. This is comparable with Bernard's<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> study showing dose dependant prolongation of analgesia, reaching a mean of 770 min for 300&#x003bc;g group. Bernard's<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> study concluded that the best dose of clonidine to be used clinically is between 30 &#x003bc;g and 90 &#x003bc;g and the side effects of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist limits itself only to sedation in this dose which is comparable with our study. Though there was profound sedation in some patients, no episode of decrease in SpO<sub>2</sub> was noted suggesting 90&#x003bc;g to be advantageous dose as compared to higher doses used. Bernard<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> used various concentrations of clonidine and noticed fall in SpO<sub>2</sub> levels only in 300 &#x003bc;g group. Clonidine did not produce any significant hemodynamic changes suggesting no side effects with use of clonidine in 90&#x003bc;g. This is in agreement with Jean's<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> study with 150 &#x003bc;g clonidine in brachial plexus block. Also Colin's review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> suggested limited side effects at doses of clonidine upto 150&#x003bc;g. Bernard<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> observed significant fall in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate at 300 &#x003bc;g while in smaller doses no hemodynamic changes were noted. 4 patients in clonidine group and 2 in epinephrine group had inadequate block. This can be compared to Bernard's<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> study which showed incomplete blocks in saline as well as clonidine groups. Clonidine produces analgesia in animals and humans via a non opiate action on the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptors of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>. The prolongation of the duration of analgesia by clonidine when injected at a peripheral nerve site is not known. Many theories have been postulated like (1) clonidine may interfere with the vascular resorption of local anaesthetics by producing vasoconstriction but Gaumann<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> noticed that peak plasma concentration of lidocaine were higher and occurred earlier than in those treated with epinephrine which indicates the absence of a local vasoconstrictor effect of clonidine. (2) clonidine may have a direct action on neural tissues, especially at spinal level. Hutscala<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> observed that duration of action of brachial plexus block got prolonged with addition of clonidine while it did not got prolonged in the group receiving intramuscular clonidine. (3) it may induce analgesia via a systemic mechanism after vascular resorption and secondary distribution to the brainstem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>.</p><p>To conclude, our study suggests that a small dose of clonidine produced early sensory and motor onset with enhancement of the quality of the peripheral block from local anaesthetics and limits its &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> side effects to sedation. Also the addition of clonidine produced longer duration of analgesia than with epinephrine when injected into the brachial plexus block. Thus clonidine in smaller concentration remains an attractive option to prolong analgesia in the postoperative period under brachial plexus block.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group
