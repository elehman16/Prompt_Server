These guidelines recommend pushing to the rate of at least 100 chest compressions per minute. Chest compression along with breathing support is a better choice.

The average rate of correct chest compression was around 88 per minute in OTH CPR and 84 per minute for lateral CPR. Over-the-head cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a technique of chest compression, which is possibly easier to perform than standard CPR in a confined space.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Although all these techniques have a slower optimum recommended rate (at least 100 per minute), this is suggested in existing guiding principle.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] We observe the ventilation cycle time, especially first cycle (more than 6s delay) in two techniques was associated with fall of the total time for CPR. This time is longer than optimum recommended time.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] This study found that the mean of chest compression in two positions for each cycle was below the recommended time (lower 23s).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Although this condition can save time for CPR, but may be caused by incorrect chest compression.</p><p>Concerning the quality of chest compressions (hand poisoning and pressure) and ventilations in the over-the-head position CPR resulted in more incorrect chest compression and ventilation with lateral position CPR. The quality of ventilation and mask fixation did not differ between the two methods of CPR.</p><p>We found that the incorrect rate and error of the hand position or pressure on the chest compressions by participants were higher in number in the OTH CPR position in comparison to the lateral position. Lateral position CPR error was 23% and ventilation error was 37% in comparison to over-the-head CPR 26% and 41% was ventilation error during 2 min CPR in each techniques. The previous studies investigated the difference between OTH CPR and standard CPR.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Gavin <italic>et al</italic>. in their study that compared OTH CPR and standard CPR found that incorrect chest compression was greater in the STD CPR group but they concluded that this was related to a higher number of low-positioned compressions in this group. On the contrary this study found different results because the OTH CPR have more incorrect chest compression and ventilation rate. This may be due to the different structures of two studies that present studies included only BLS, and we founded that the number of delivered correct chest compressions and ventilation rate was significantly higher in the OTH CPR.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Anthony <italic>et al</italic>. in their study found that the error rate of hand positioning in the OTH CPR was more than standard CPR; they concluded that the incorrect hand placements for this technique were low and common.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] It is potentially severe error in view of the risk of internal organ damage if pressure is performed to the epigastrium.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] This result is the same as that of what this study discovered.</p><p>Handley <italic>et al</italic>. in their study in which two CPR techniques were performed by 20 health care students found the frequency of wrong hand position in the over-the-head CPR more than standard CPR position (30.4% vs. 7.7%). These results were lower than that found in this study in lateral position CPR. It may be related to the kind of devices for ventilation and difference of compression &#x02013; ventilation ratio between two studies. This study uses BVM for ventilation in lateral CPR but their study performed mouth to mask ventilation via the pocket mask.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] They did not show the same result as compared to this study.</p><p>Perkins <italic>et al</italic>. in their study compared over-the-head CPR without previous experience and standard CPR in a group of BLS instructors. Ventilation was done by the pocket mask.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Their study found no differences in quality of chest compression and ventilation between two techniques; however, they were recorded that hand positioning during chest compressions was better in the over-the-head group. In contrast to the present results, the percentage of incorrect chest compression and ventilation in the lateral position CPR were better (incorrect chest compressions 23% vs. 37% and incorrect ventilation by participants 26% vs. 41% in the over-the-head position CPR). While the correct chest compression and optimal ventilation rates were better in the over-the-head CPR versus lateral CPR.</p><p>Bolling <italic>et al</italic>. in their study that compared over-the-head CPR with lateral CPR by paramedic students and found that there were no differences between chest compression and ventilation groups in both experienced in standard CPR delivered chest compressions and ventilations while the other rescuer performed additional tasks.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] They do not show the same result.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The foundlings of this study showed the difference in chest compression and ventilation variables between two positions CPR.</p><p>All the studies cited earlier were performed using compression ventilation ratio 15:2 according to the 2000 guidelines.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Therefore, the results might differ if studies were performed using 2005 or 2010 guidelines with emphasis on compression and ventilation ratio 30:2 and importance of chest compression.</p><p>The funding of this study shows that the chest compression rate by male is more than that of female but regarding ventilation rate there is no difference between two genders. The reasons for such differences can be the difference of height, weight, length of arm, hands-off time, and physical power between genders in this study.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has some limitations such as other resuscitation simulator studies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Number of limitations in this study has to be taken into account when present results are extended to a clinical situation. The study was performed on a resuscitation manikin, which did not provide any difference in patient's size, chest wall compliance, or simplicity of achieving a mask face seal. Second, this study was impossible to blind participants to which technique they were doing. Third, we do not evaluated depth of chest compression. Fourth, the manikin was positioned on the floor and we compared two techniques during 2 min of CPR. This condition may be different with prehospital setting. This time may be short to evaluate the rescuer fatigue or their satisfaction because real CPR has stress and perhaps it is longer than this time. This time is short for additional tasks such as attaching the ECG monitor and IV access.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, we confirmed in a simulated CPR model that over-the-head position CPR led to a better BLS than lateral position CPR by a single paramedic student with a BVM device. We also concluded that by new BVM fixation method on the face of the patients in lateral position CPR can be a good alternative over-the-head mask fixation by a single trained rescuer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors wish to thank the paramedical students for participating in this study.</p><p>We thanks dr.
