There is a need for simple but effective behaviour change interventions with the potential to be implemented within the cancer care pathway. Habit-based advice encourages repetition of a behaviour in a consistent context so that the behaviour becomes increasingly automatic in response to a specific contextual cue. This approach therefore encourages long-term behaviour change and can be delivered through printed materials. &#x02018;Healthy Habits for Life&#x02019; is a brief intervention based on habit theory, and incorporating printed materials plus a personally tailored discussion, that has been designed specifically for patients with a diagnosis of cancer. The aim of this trial was to test the effect of &#x02018;Healthy Habits for Life&#x02019; on a composite health behaviour risk index (CHBRI) over 3&#x02005;months in patients with a diagnosis of breast, colorectal or prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Method and analysis</title><p>A 2-arm, individually randomised controlled trial in patients with breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. Patients will be recruited over 18&#x02005;months from 7 National Health Service Trusts in London and Essex. Following baseline assessments and allocation to intervention or usual care, patients are followed up at 3 and 6&#x02005;months. The primary outcome will be change in CHBRI at 3&#x02005;months. Maintenance of any changes over 6&#x02005;months, and changes in individual health behaviours (including dietary intake, physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking status) will also be explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained through the National Research Ethics Service Committee South Central&#x02014;Oxford B via the Integrated Research Application System (reference number 14/SC/1369).

<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of tailored, mailed print materials (eg, two 5-month workbooks and newsletters),<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and of telephone delivered sessions combined with mailed materials (eg, 11 phone calls over 6&#x02005;months combined with a participant handbook, regular motivational postcard prompts, a pedometer and a quarterly study newsletter).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These results are promising, but to date there is a lack of behaviour change interventions in a UK healthcare setting. Furthermore, these approaches are fairly labour intensive. In order to benefit enough cancer survivors to have a significant public health impact, an intervention must be cost-effective and feasible to implement in the current clinical pathway. In other words, it needs to be both brief and inexpensive so that it can be delivered to all eligible patients by health professionals within the National Health Service (NHS), where time and resources tend to be limited.</p><p>A potential strategy, which combines elements from previous successful approaches but within a briefer format, is to use standard print materials containing guidelines and simple behavioural skills as the &#x02018;first-line&#x02019; intervention, and combine this with a single individually tailored, brief, telephone discussion. This maximises coverage, takes advantage of patient preferences for print materials<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and simple advice<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and also capitalises on patients' desire to receive personalised advice, which is viewed as more relevant than generic communications.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Furthermore, tailoring can enhance the effects of health-promoting messages, through stimulating greater cognitive activity than messages that are not tailored.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A recent systematic review also demonstrated the effectiveness of the telephone for the delivery of lifestyle interventions to cancer survivors.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Previous lifestyle interventions with cancer survivors have not had a consistent theoretical basis. For example, the study of mailed tailored materials<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> drew on Social Cognitive Theory<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and the Transtheoretical Model,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> whereas the combination of telephone-delivered sessions and mailed materials<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> was based on Acceptance Commitment Therapy.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Studies within other patient populations suggest that an ideal theoretical basis for providing behaviour change advice in a brief format is the habit model.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> According to habit theory, the essential feature of habits is that they are &#x02018;automatic&#x02019; (ie, require minimal willpower or deliberate effort), and therefore are well maintained.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Psychological research shows that repetition of an action in a consistent context enables it to become automatic, and once automatic, it is more resistant to extinction than deliberative (intentional) actions; increasing the likelihood the action will become a habit and therefore continue over the longer term.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> There has therefore been increasing interest in the application of habit theory within the healthcare context.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Providing individuals with advice on how to try and form habits for specific health behaviours (ie, by integrating simple actions into their existing routines, and associating the new action with a specific context, such as always taking a walk straight after lunch) is less time consuming to explain, and easier for patients to implement than traditional behaviour change strategies.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> There is growing evidence that brief habit-based interventions can encourage positive changes in dietary and physical activity behaviours for a range of populations, including older adults and patients with obesity.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In particular, one recent study demonstrated the potential for combining printed materials on habit-based health behaviour change with a brief discussion with a health professional.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> However, this approach has not been tested with cancer survivors.</p><p>The proposed study therefore explores the impact of a behaviour change intervention that has been developed based on habit theory and which can be delivered via printed materials and a brief tailored discussion to all eligible patients with a diagnosis of breast, colorectal or prostate cancer. This is an individually randomised trial to evaluate behavioural outcomes. If successful, it will lead on to a future, large-scale, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) with cancer-relevant outcomes (biomarkers, physical function, adverse effects of treatment, survival) and a full cost-effectiveness analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aims</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Primary research objective</title><p>To test the effects of an intervention incorporating tailored advice plus patient materials on a composite health behaviour risk index (CHBRI) over 3&#x02005;months in patients with a diagnosis of breast, colorectal or prostate cancer, compared with the effects of &#x02018;usual care&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Secondary research objectives</title><p>The main secondary research objectives are to test for differences in individual health behaviours (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet, smoking and alcohol) and body mass index (BMI) over the trial period, and examine whether any changes in CHBRI observed at 3&#x02005;months are maintained at 6&#x02005;months.

NHS Trusts were initially recruited through London Cancer (five trusts) and two additional trusts were recruited following the posting of the study on the Clinical Research Network Portfolio. Participating sites mail a health and lifestyle questionnaire to all patients diagnosed with breast, colorectal and prostate cancer in 2012/2013. On the final page of the questionnaire, patients have the opportunity to express their interest in taking part in a trial of a lifestyle programme and to provide their contact details. Interested patients will be checked for eligibility based on their responses to the survey. Eligible patients will be mailed an information sheet and consent form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011646F1">figure 1</xref>), and receive a reminder telephone call if this is not returned. The information sheet states that the study is concerned with promoting a healthy lifestyle among people who have been diagnosed with breast, prostate or colorectal cancer, and that we have developed a lifestyle programme (consisting of a lifestyle booklet, and telephone call) and are interested in finding out what patients think about it. No further details of the intervention will be given. Recruitment is expected to take place over 18&#x02005;months to achieve the required sample size.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>The study will be restricted to adults (age &#x02265;18) who are able to consent for themselves (presumed from completion of the consent form). Individuals who report a diagnosis of non-metastatic (stage I&#x02013;III) breast, prostate or colorectal cancer or report that their cancer has not spread (as a proxy measure for stage), and who state they are no longer receiving active cancer treatment (with the exception of oral cancer treatments taken at home) will be included. If patients report that they do not know the stage of their disease or whether it has spread, this will be checked with the NHS Trust from which they were initially recruited. Similarly, any lack of clarity around receipt of treatment will be queried with the appropriate NHS Trust.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients will be excluded if they (1) are unable to provide informed consent due to severe cognitive impairment, (2) have metastatic disease (stage IV, their cancer has spread) or (3) are receiving active cancer treatment requiring hospital admission. Although these groups may also benefit from lifestyle change, they are likely to require a different interventional approach with a higher level of input and supervision. There is not an upper age limit because previous studies have demonstrated that interested older patients are able to benefit and are important to include given the impact of cancer on functional decline.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Randomisation</title><p>The unit of randomisation will be the patient, and the allocation ratio will be 1:1. Allocation will be determined based on minimisation using the software MinimPY (an open-source customisable minimisation program for allocation of patients to parallel groups in clinical trials)<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> after the participant has provided informed consent and baseline data. Randomisation will be stratified by cancer type (breast, colorectal or prostate). The first participant will be randomly allocated, then each subsequent participant, will be allocated based on the imbalance scores (calculated as a function of current allocations after a hypothetical allocation of the new participant in each study arm). The new participant will be allocated to the arm with the lowest imbalance score.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> A 20% random element will be included in the algorithm.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>The researcher responsible for randomisation will inform the trial assistant and trial manager of treatment allocation using a password-protected spreadsheet. Once allocated, the trial assistant will inform participants of their allocation by mailing the intervention materials or making a brief phone call to those allocated to usual care stating that all of their data have been received, and they have not been allocated to receive the booklet.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>The intervention</title><p>The &#x02018;Healthy Habits for Life&#x02019; intervention consists of a self-guided printed booklet designed to help cancer survivors make healthy lifestyle behaviours habitual (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary material 1</xref>). The intervention was developed through an iterative process with input from patients, health professionals and experts in the field. A social marketing company designed the booklet, which includes a description of recommended health behaviours and their potential benefits based on the WCRF recommendations for cancer survivors.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Specifically, it gives advice on nine target areas that participants might set goals around. These are: (1) being active every day for 30&#x02005;min or more (and aiming for 10&#x02005;000 steps a day), (2) getting stronger and fitter (doing strength, balance and stretching exercise twice per week and two 30&#x02005;min sessions of vigorous exercise per week), (3) increasing fruit and veg (five portions or more a day, mostly vegetables), (4) maximising fibre (choosing wholegrain and adding fruit, vegetables and pulses to meals), (5) watching out for high calorie foods and drinks (reducing fat and sugar and cutting out sugary drinks), (6) reducing red meat (no more than 500&#x02005;g across the week), (7) cutting out processed meat, (8) quitting smoking, and (9) cutting back on alcohol (no more than 2&#x02013;3 units per day for women and 3&#x02013;4 for men, with at least 2&#x02005;days alcohol free). For each target behaviour, there is a list of new actions that could be incorporated into a daily routine to help participants meet their goals (ideas for everyday change).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011646.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary material 1</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-011646supp_1.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>In addition to the description of the recommended health behaviours and their benefits, the booklet contains advice on forming healthy habits (eg, repeating the new actions in a similar context), in line with habit theory.

Participants are also encouraged to reward themselves for progress made. During intervention development, some patients reported a desire for more information. Because of the need to keep the booklet brief, there is therefore a corresponding simple website with additional information on habit theory, the scientific evidence base behind the recommendations, suggestions for home exercise, a frequently asked questions section and sources of additional information and support.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011646.supp2</object-id><label>Supplementary material 2</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss2" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-011646supp_2.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>Participants in the intervention group will receive a telephone call from a researcher who will talk participants through the printed booklet, to check understanding, answer any questions and encourage engagement with the material.

Participants will be encouraged to start with between one and three behaviours, and then add other changes as and when they feel able to do so.

These behaviours will be measured as described above. Since a number of key health behaviours are being targeted within the intervention, rather than assess single behaviours the CHBRI assesses simultaneous overall change in more than one. Discussion with oncologists has also indicated that an overall health behaviour change score would be of more value than individual behaviours in convincing health professionals to introduce a lifestyle intervention into the care pathway.</p><p>Furthermore, the use of a composite score allows tailoring of the intervention to patient need and choice. This scoring system (a composite score based on adherence to the WCRF guidance vs not) was used previously in the Iowa Women's Cohort, and in 2017 cancer survivors was sensitive enough to show lower all-cause mortality in those with higher scores<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> and to show, in cancer-free participants, that those who followed 0&#x02013;1 vs 6&#x02013;9 of the guidelines had significantly 35% increased risk of developing cancer.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> Additionally, using a composite score, each additional AICR/WCRF guideline met was associated with 5% reduced risk of developing cancer in the EPIC cohort.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> A CHBRI has also been successfully used in a previous lifestyle study in those at risk for colorectal cancer &#x02018;Project PREVENT&#x02019; and was sensitive enough to detect change in response to a lifestyle intervention involving mailed materials.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></p><p>Details for the measurement of each behaviour are given above. All measurements are made using reliable and valid tools. Physical activity behaviours (recommendations 1 and 2) will be calculated from pedometer data, and from the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire if pedometer data are missing. Dietary and alcohol behaviours (recommendations 3&#x02013;8) will be calculated from dietary recall data, and from self-report questionnaire measures if recall data are missing. Tobacco behaviour (recommendation 9) will be calculated from the self-report questions described above. Cut-offs for the target behaviours will be based on the WCRF recommendations (where available) or UK national guidelines. Participants will be classed as meeting the recommendations as follows:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Daily physical activity</italic>: physically active for at least 30&#x02005;min a day or a daily average of 10&#x02005;000 steps a day;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Fitness</italic>: two 30&#x02005;min sessions of vigorous, aerobic exercise a week;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Fruit and vegetables</italic>: five a day or more;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Red meat</italic>: 500&#x02005;g per week or less;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Processed meat</italic>: no processed meat;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>High calorie foods and drinks</italic>: fat 33% or less of total energy intake, and total sugar &#x02264;50&#x02005;g per day for women, 70&#x02005;g per day for men;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Fibre</italic>: 18&#x02005;g per day or more;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Alcohol</italic>: two or more alcohol-free days a week, and average units per day of 2&#x02013;3 for women, 3&#x02013;4 for men;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Tobacco</italic>: non-smoker/non-tobacco consumer.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The nine individual behaviours will be equally weighted. To calculate CHBRI, at baseline participants will be assigned an individual score from 0 to 9 dependent on the number of WCRF guidelines met. The same will be calculated at 3 and 6&#x02005;months follow-up. In addition to the composite score, change in each behaviour will be reported as secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3k"><title>Sample size</title><p>This is a large behavioural outcomes trial aimed at determining whether the &#x02018;Healthy Habits for Life&#x02019; brief intervention has an impact on health behaviours, in order to carry out a future trial including biomarkers and clinical outcomes. Based on previous lifestyle randomised trials that have used a CHBRI, the aim is to detect a modest increase in CHBRI of 0.2 SDs at 3&#x02005;months, and with 80% power and 5% two-sided statistical significance, which will require around 700 participants (350 per group). This will allow for a modest effect size to be detected in an intention-to-treat analysis, to take into account people in the intervention group who do not follow the intervention, as well as those in the control group who change their habits (both of which would dilute the effect). Based on a previous study using the same measure,<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> a modest-sized effect (namely, a difference of 0.2 SDs between the conditions) at 3&#x02005;months would represent an increase of 0.24 on the CHBRI among participants who received the &#x02018;Healthy Habits for Life&#x02019; intervention. In real terms, this would mean that these participants would be 24% closer to meeting an additional WCRF recommendation.</p><p>The recruitment target is 450 patients into each arm (there is no aim to recruit specific numbers of patients by cancer type). This will allow for drop-out, particularly at the 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. To minimise loss to follow-up, patients will receive two telephone call reminders over 6&#x02005;weeks if they do not return their pedometers or questionnaires and/or do not complete their dietary recalls.</p></sec><sec id="s3l"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The primary end point (CHBRI at 3&#x02005;months) will be analysed by a researcher blind to treatment allocation. Unblinding will occur after the primary data analysis is complete and has been checked and verified by a second researcher. A full data analysis plan will be developed and published prior to completion of data collection. Briefly, baseline characteristics will be reported by each arm using descriptive statistics. The primary analysis will be intention to treat. Linear regression analysis will be used to assess change in CHBRI at 3&#x02005;months, with baseline CHBRI scores and treatment group as covariates. Repeated measures analyses (eg, mixed modelling) will be used to analyse the baseline, 3-month and 6-month CHBRI scores together. Missing data will be explored to see if they are missing at random, and various sensitivity analyses performed after making different assumptions about the missingness.</p><p>Other continuous factors (eg, individual behaviours) will be analysed using linear regression, and categorical factors using frequency tables and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests, and logistic regression. Exploratory subgroup analyses will be carried out to examine intervention interactions with gender, age, education/socioeconomic status, treatment and tumour type.</p><p>With respect to cost-effectiveness, costs associated with the intervention will be recorded (printing of the booklet, phone and postage charges, staff time). A full economic analysis will be conducted within a future, large-scale, RCT with cancer-relevant outcomes. For the qualitative data, thematic analysis will be used to identify the main themes that will form the basis of our results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations that should be noted. With the exception of pedometer and dietary recall data, the outcome measures for the present study will be self-reported and thus may introduce bias into the data collection process. For example, participants may under-report frequency of alcohol consumption on the AUDIT-C owing to fear of being judged on drinking habits. Participants may apply similar reporting strategies when completing other questions relating to health behaviour. However, all outcome measures have been developed using reliable and valid tools. For convenience, the study sample will be recruited from London and the surrounding areas, which may limit the representativeness of the sample to the rest of the UK. A further limitation is the use of research staff to deliver the intervention and the detailed assessment on which the tailored telephone call will be based. If this intervention is to be rolled out within the cancer care pathway, this assessment will need to be shortened. If the current trial demonstrates an effect of the intervention on health behaviours, a pragmatic trial will be needed to determine the effectiveness of this intervention if delivered by health professionals within the cancer care pathway. Future studies will also be required to explore the importance of the individual components of the intervention for promoting change. Finally, because of the nature of the intervention, it will not be possible to blind participants, but all follow-up data will be collected and entered by researchers blind to treatment allocation. Statistical analysis of the primary outcome will also be performed by a researcher blind to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Strengths</title><p>The &#x02018;Healthy Habits for Life&#x02019; intervention is a novel approach to improving the health behaviours of people diagnosed with cancer. Based on habit theory and providing evidence-based advice on a healthy lifestyle post diagnosis in a booklet format, it has the potential to meet an identified need for an intervention that can be delivered within the cancer care pathway without prohibitive costs. It is hoped the tailored discussion will encourage patient engagement and could be replicated by a health professional within the end of treatment discussion that patients currently receive as part of their standard care. This intervention could also be incorporated within the Living With and Beyond Cancer Programme introduced in 2014, which includes health and well-being clinics and cancer care review discussions with a general practitioner.</p><p>The results of this study will assess the impact of &#x02018;Healthy Habits for Life&#x02019; on behaviour (an intermediate outcome) over 3&#x02005;months and will provide information on whether any changes are sustained up to 6&#x02005;months. If this brief intervention can promote sustained behaviour change, this will provide the basis for a definitive, large-scale, national, pragmatic RCT to examine effects on cancer outcomes of use of the programme in routine clinical care. Additional funding would be sought for such a trial from Cancer Research UK. If proven to be effective in this context, &#x02018;Healthy Habits for Life&#x02019; could make a highly cost-effective contribution to improvements in the long-term survival of people diagnosed with cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethical considerations and dissemination</title><p>NHS Research and Development approval has been obtained from all participating NHS Boards prior to the start of the trial.
