All patients completed treatment as planned with no major acute toxicity from either chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Subsequently 52 patients with stage T4 breast cancer were randomised in a phase III trial to receive either radiotherapy alone (RT) or this chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CHOP + RT). A significantly higher complete response rate was achieved in the CHOP + RT treatment arm (P = 0.03). However a larger proportion of the RT arm achieved loco-regional control after salvage treatment for relapse such that 50% of the RT arm and 57% of the CHOP + RT arm had no evidence of loco-regional disease at the time of last follow-up or death. There was no statistical difference in time to distant relapse or overall survival. Analysis of the pilot study showed results comparable to the trial CHOP + RT arm. This trial suggests that this cytotoxic therapy used in conjunction with radiotherapy has only marginal value in improving prognosis in locally advanced breast cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="761" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="762" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="763" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="764" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="765" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
