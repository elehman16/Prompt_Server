These drugs are frequently administered and their systemic effects have been elaborately studied but their psychological and behavioral side effects in the postoperative period are not well studied.

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Well-being represents the subjective patient condition, measured and analyzed by various methods.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Also, it has been proposed as a useful surrogate end point in anesthetic quality assessment.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, in the context of general anesthesia, attempts to evaluate possible difference of quality, as related to patients behavioral effects between the different anaesthetic techniques have not been made very often. Also, with these general anesthetic agents used via I.V. as well as inhalational routes, the changes in vital parameters during anesthesia and their recovery criteria have been extensively studied in the recent years, but their psycho-behavioral changes on the patients have frequently been overlooked. These aspects are especially important since these patients are going to be discharged on the same day. There have been few reports of these changes in the literature but these are not properly studied and compared between TIVA and VIMA.</p><p>In this study, we have found that there are no psycho-behavioral changes either in the immediate or late post-operative period on administration of propofol in lower doses for TIVA (&#x0003c;150 mg). This concurs with some of the other studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Also, there were no complaints of nausea and vomiting, as is seen in other studies,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] most likely due to anti-emetic property of propofol. But when it is given in higher doses (&#x0003e;150 mg), it produced various side effects like unpleasant intra-operative dreams, crying, headache, body ache, amnesia, sedation, nightmares, hallucinations, disturbed sleep in the early, and intermediate post-operative period. This compares well with various findings in some of the studies.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The finding of gender variability with these drugs also compares well with available evidence.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The female gender does seem to require less recovery time from propofol rather than as compared to the sole volatile agents, which does not seem to have any relation with the gender. However in combination (PS) group the males required less recovery time, as compared to the females; also, a significant percentage of female patients receiving propofol, had dreams of sexual fantasies in the intra-operative period; whereas, most of the previous studies have reported that there is no evidence of intra-operative recall with propofol anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>When sevoflurane was administered as VIMA, various side effects were observed in the early post-operative period i.e., shivering, restlessness, increased muscle tone, sedation, and amnesia, whereas, in intermediate post-operative period, patients presented with headache, body aches, and hallucinations. These findings compare with those of various authorities.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] There was no difference observed in the recovery time (awakening) between males and females. However, a study by Tercan and colleagues[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] showed that early recovery times were longer for female patients than for male patients after anesthesia based on sevoflurane or desflurane. Some efforts have also been made to find the quality of recovery after anesthesia and use it as a measure of the early postoperative health status of patients,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] but still much needs to be done.</p><p>There has been synergism of psycho-behavioral changes in early and intermediate post-operative period when propofol was administered as induction and sevoflurane as maintenance agent (combination group PS). In same group, GTCS and sexual fantasies (female patient) were noted in a few patients in intermediate post-operative period. But there was delayed recovery of the female patients in the early post-operative period as compared to propofol. No psycho-behavioral changes have been noted in the late post-operative period in any of the three groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From our study, we conclude that:</p><p>
