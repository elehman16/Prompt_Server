In a way, that it is estimated that 81% of obese children worldwide were from developing countries especially Asian ones.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus are the most common preventable complication of childhood obesity. Evidences indicated that the presence of some biochemical indicators such as insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperhomocysteinemia are associated with the early phase of mentioned conditions and proper interventions could prevent the development of such complications.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>It has been described that the high level of homocysteine (Hcy) is associated with CVD, obesity, and other clinical conditions such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The relation between plasma Hcy concentrations and insulin resistance in different groups of patients, including obese ones has been reported in some epidemiological studies.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It is well established that hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with childhood obesity and hyperinsulinism, and moreover there are evidences for increased level of the two mentioned factors among obese children.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Evidences have documented a negative relationship between serum Hcy and folate, as well as insulin and folate.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Accordingly the concept of effectiveness of folic acid administration for reducing Hcy level and consequently its related risk factor has been developed and some studies have demonstrated the improving effect of mentioned supplement use in this regard. The usefulness of folic acid in decreasing both Hcy and insulin level among obese patients have been reported in previous studies mainly among the adult population.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] There were few studies in this field for pediatrics population.</p><p>Thus, considering the worldwide increasing trend of childhood obesity and the subsequent burden of the disease and importance of early life interventions for preventing obesity related complication from early life period and low side effects of folic acid than other pharmacologic agents, this study aimed to investigate the effect of two different doses of folic acid on Hcy level and insulin resistance of obese and overweight children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial study, 60 obese and overweight children aged 5&#x02013;12 years, attended to endocrinology clinic, affiliated to Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, were enrolled.</p><p>Children with body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;85<sup>th</sup> percentile were included in the study.

Our findings indicated that folic acid in both low and high dose administration could decrease the level of Hcy and insulin resistance among overweight and obese children.</p><p>It is well established that obesity in children is associated with increased risk of CVD in adulthood. Previous studies have indicated the higher level of metabolic risk factors among obese children.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] There were also evidences regarding the elevated level of homocystein and insulin resistance in this group of patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The specificity and importance of Hcy and insulin resistance in children and adolescents is due to the fact that, they are considered as independent determinant of metabolic risk which are not influenced by puberty and different Tanner stage and can identify the subjects prone to complications.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Some studies indicated the positive correlation between Hcy and insulin resistance among obese children. Gallistl and associates in Austria have shown for the 1<sup>st</sup> time that the level of Hcy in obese children is significantly correlates with the level of insulin. They concluded that possibly hyperinsulinemia could result in Hcy metabolism impairment in this group of population.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, there are evidences regarding the role of some environmental factors such as dietary folate on the level of Hcy.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In a study in Turkey, Atabek <italic>et al</italic>. have investigated total plasma Hcy in obese children. They reported a higher level of Hcy in this group of patients compared with control nonobese children. They also indicated that Hcy could have a crucial role in the higher risk of CVD in obese children, and it correlates with decreased folate state but not insulin. They suggested the possible role of decreased folate in the impairment of Hcy metabolism in childhood obesity.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Regarding the fact that obese children have a higher level of Hcy, it seems that folate administration possibly could have a protective effect on hyperhomocysteinemia among obese children. Thus, this study was designed to evaluate the improving effect of two different doses of folic acid on mentioned risk factors.</p><p>There are some studies, which investigated the effect of folic acid on the level of Hcy and insulin resistance among the obese adult population.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Studies among children population were scarce. It has been hypothesized that folic acid supplementation may improve the oxidative stress and consequently reduce the risk of CVD and diabetes mellitus, possibly by decreasing the level of Hcy and insulin.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The results of the current study demonstrated that both high and low dose folic acid administration for 8 weeks reduce the level of Hcy, insulin resistance, and insulin level.</p><p>Solini <italic>et al</italic>. in Italy have investigated the effect of 12 weeks folic acid treatment on insulin sensitivity and some biochemical parameters such as Hcy. After that period Hcy decreased, and insulin sensitivity increased significantly among obese adults.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Pe&#x000f1;a and Associates in Austria have indicated that administration of folic acid (5 mg daily) in 53 obese children increased serum folate and decreased total Hcy.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>In a study in Greece, Papandreou <italic>et al</italic>. showed that oral folic acid (5 mg twice per week) could efficiently reduce serum Hcy level and increase serum folic acid level in healthy children with hyperhomocysteinemia.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Gargari <italic>et al</italic>. in Tabriz-Iran showed that folic acid supplementation decreased plasma level of homocysteine and insulin resistance, as well as improved glycemic control in overweight patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>According to the results, of a meta-analysis regarding the effectiveness of different vitamin supplements including folic acid on Hcy level, an appropriate dose range of folic acid for this purpose is 0.5&#x02013;5 mg.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Furthermore, Smith <italic>et al</italic>. have reported that a higher dose of folate could be harmful.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Though 5 mg daily folic acid is an acceptable dose, not high dose, but in this study we aimed to compare the lower dose of folic acid 1 mg/daily with its higher dose, that is, 5 mg/daily to determine whether lower dose has the same effect or not. The results of our trial demonstrated that there were not any significant differences between the effectiveness of two administrated doses of folic acid on studied variables. Both of them had a similar effect.</p><p>Studies among patients with chronic renal failure relieved that there was not any significant difference between different doses of folic acid for reducing the level of Hcy.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] It seems that saturation of erythrocyte by folate prevents further reduction of Hcy level.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, more studies for investigating the exact causes of the findings are necessary.</p><p>The limitations of the current study were small sample size of studied population, lack of evaluation of different metabolic risk factors and the effectiveness of folic acid on them and lack of follow-up evaluation for the long-term effect of folic acid administration in this field.</p><p>In sum, considering the similar effectiveness of high and low dose folic acid in decreasing the level of Hcy, insulin and insulin resistance, it is suggested that low dose of folic acid could be a safe and effective supplement for obese children for improving the mentioned factors, which consequently could prevent obesity-related complications including cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. For obtaining more conclusive results in this field, more studies with consideration of mentioned limitations is recommended. Further, the role of folic acid deficiency in the path physiology of obesity in children could also be investigated.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and
