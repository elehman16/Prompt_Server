This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was performed to investigate how ingestion of MSG affects muscle pain sensitivity before and after experimentally induced muscle pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sixteen healthy adult subjects participated in 2 sessions with at least 1-week interval between sessions. In each session, two injections of glutamate (Glu, 0.5&#x000a0;M, 0.2&#x000a0;ml) and two injections of saline (0.9&#x000a0;%, 0.2&#x000a0;ml) into the masseter and temporalis muscles, respectively, were undertaken, with a 15&#x000a0;min interval between each injection. Injections of saline were made contralateral to Glu injections and done in a randomized order. Participants drank 400&#x000a0;mL of soda mixed with either MSG (150&#x000a0;mg/kg) or NaCl (24&#x000a0;mg/kg, placebo) 30&#x000a0;min before the intramuscular injections. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT), autonomic parameters and pain intensity were assessed prior to (baseline) and 30&#x000a0;min after ingestion of soda, as well as 5&#x000a0;min and 10&#x000a0;min after the intramuscular injections and at the end of the session. Whole saliva samples were collected prior to and 30, 45, 60, and 75&#x000a0;min after the ingestion of soda.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>MSG administration resulted in a significantly higher Glu level in saliva than administration of NaCl and was associated with a significant increase in systolic blood pressure. Injections of Glu were significantly more painful than injections of NaCl. However, ingestion of MSG did not change the intensity of Glu-evoked pain. Glu injections also significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, but without an additional effect of MSG ingestion. Glu injections into the masseter muscle significantly reduced the PPT. However, pre-injection MSG ingestion did not significantly alter this effect. Interestingly, PPT was significantly increased in the trapezius after MSG ingestion and intramuscular injection of Glu in the jaw muscles.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The main finding in this study was that systemic intake of a substantial amount of MSG does not influence either pain intensity or pressure pain sensitivity in the masseter and temporalis muscles into which Glu injections were made.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Monosodium Glutamate</kwd><kwd>Myofascial temporomandibular disorders</kwd><kwd>Muscle pain sensitivity</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>We have previously reported that injection of glutamate (Glu) into the masseter muscle of healthy subjects causes experimental muscle pain with features comparable to the pain suffered in myofascial temporomandibular disorder (TMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Specifically, intramuscular injection of Glu produces pain in healthy subjects that is not different in intensity and quality from pain reported by patients with myofascial TMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Injection of Glu into the masseter muscle also produces punctate mechanical sensitization which is similar, though of a lesser magnitude, to that reported by myofascial TMD patients. We have suggested that experimental designs based on glutamate injection into masticatory muscle can provide an appropriate model for studying myofascial TMD pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>One of the reasons that intramuscular Glu injections may replicate symptoms of myofascial TMD pain in healthy subjects is that interstitial Glu concentrations have been shown to be elevated in patients with myofascial TMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. One way that Glu concentrations can be elevated is by consumption of excessive amounts of monosodium glutamate (MSG) containing foods. In healthy subjects, a single oral ingestion of 150&#x000a0;mg/kg of MSG resulted in subjective reports of peri-cranial muscle tenderness and increased headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Oral administration of 150&#x000a0;mg/kg of MSG increases interstitial Glu concentration in the masseter muscle by up to 750&#x000a0;% over baseline concentrations for a period of about 90&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recent work indicates that repeated daily administration of MSG orally to healthy individuals leads to more frequent reports of adverse effect, such as headache and nausea and results in a transient but significant lowering of pressure pain threshold and tolerance in the masseter muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was to investigate whether prior oral ingestion of MSG could alter pain and mechanical sensitivity induced by intramuscular injection of Glu into the masseter muscle. We hypothesized that increased interstitial Glu concentration in the masseter muscle after oral ingestion of MSG would increase Glu-evoked pain and jaw muscle mechanical sensitization compared to placebo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Sixteen healthy adult (&#x0003e;18&#x000a0;years old) participants (8 women and 8 men, mean age&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD: 24.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.7&#x000a0;years old, mean bodyweight&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD: 62.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13.7&#x000a0;kg) participated in this study.

Each participant participated in 2 sessions with at least 1-week interval between sessions. The participants were asked to fast at least 2&#x000a0;h before the experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Sessions began with the participants sitting comfortably on a dental chair in supine position. The participants first drank 400&#x000a0;mL sugar-free lemon soda (Spirit light&#x000ae;, Coop, Denmark) mixed with either MSG (150&#x000a0;mg per kg bodyweight) or sodium chloride (NaCl; 24&#x000a0;mg per kg bodyweight; placebo), in a randomized order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Experimental muscle pain in both the masseter and temporalis muscles was produced by injection of a sterile solution of glutamate (Glu: 0.5&#x000a0;M, 0.2&#x000a0;mL) 30&#x000a0;min after the systemic administration of MSG or placebo. On the contralateral side of the injected side in both the masseter and temporalis muscles, isotonic saline (IS: 0.9&#x000a0;%, 0.2&#x000a0;mL) was administered as a control. Four injections in total were given with 15&#x000a0;min interval (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The injections were performed manually over a 10-s period with a 27-gauge hypodermic needle and a disposable syringe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Both the examiner and participants were blinded to the order and type of the injections that were given. Injection of Glu or IS were randomized for each subject. A research assistant prepared both the injections and the drink in a separate room.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The experimental design of this study is shown.

The participants were asked to draw painful area at the same time points as NRS. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) was also measured in the left and right Masseter (MAL, MAR), left and right Temporalis, the right Trapezius (TRP), the left Thenar (TH), together with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sBP, dBP) and heart rate (HR). The participants were asked to report adverse effects 15&#x000a0;min after the systemic intervention.

A kit of Salivette&#x02122; consists of a plastic tube that has a partition dividing upper and lower part, a cotton roll sheathed in the upper part of the tube, and a lid. The participants were asked to chew the cotton roll for 1&#x000a0;min and put it back into the tube. There was a small hole in the partition of the tube so that saliva absorbed into the cotton roll was stored in the bottom part of the tube after the tube was centrifuged at 1000&#x000a0;g for 2&#x000a0;min. The sample was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

The main finding in this study was that systemic intake of a substantial amount of MSG does not influence either pain intensity or pressure pain sensitivity in the masseter and temporalis muscles into which Glu injections were made. Unexpectedly, the systemic intake of MSG decreased mechanical pain sensitivity in the trapezius muscle after Glu was injected into either the masseter or temporalis muscles.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>In a previous study, healthy subjects who ingested 150&#x000a0;mg/kg of MSG had significantly elevated interstitial concentrations of Glu in their masseter muscles between 40 and 80&#x000a0;min after ingestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The average peak masseter muscle interstitial concentrations of Glu after a single ingestion of MSG was&#x02009;~&#x02009;75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, and the Glu concentration remained above 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M for at least 60&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The present study was designed so that all four intramuscular injections were applied while interstitial Glu concentrations in the masseter would be significantly higher than baseline. Although there was no correlation between peak levels of Glu in dialysate samples and saliva samples, Glu concentrations in saliva and muscle both increased after oral administration of MSG in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, the salivary Glu levels measured in this study could differentiate the MSG and placebo sessions, and indicate that subjects would have had substantially increased muscle interstitial concentrations of Glu after ingestion of MSG. Thus, the lack of difference in pain intensity and mechanical sensitization when the two sessions were compared is unlikely to be a result of failure of the subjects to be exposed to increased systemic levels of Glu. Further, it has been shown in rats that when the concentration of interstitial Glu in the masseter muscle was increased to ~75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, mechanical sensitization of the muscle nociceptors was maintained until the concentration dropped below 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, in previous studies in healthy subjects, a single oral dose of MSG (150&#x000a0;mg/kg) did not result in a significant lowering of the PPT in the masseter or temporalis muscle, but subjects did report subjective pericranial muscle tenderness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is possible that in healthy human subjects, glutamate concentrations in the masseter muscle would need to be greater than those produced by ingestion of a single dose of 150&#x000a0;mg/kg MSG to produce measurable changes in PPT. This may have contributed to the lack of difference in PPTs in the masseter and temporalis muscles when oral consumption of MSG and placebo were compared.</p><p>It is possible that injection of a different noxious substance, rather than Glu, into the masseter or temporalis muscle might have resulted in a different outcome. For example, the pain intensity and area of pain drawings were both significantly greater when capsaicin was injected into the masseter muscle 25&#x000a0;min after injection of Glu (1&#x000a0;M), when compared with injection of isotonic saline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, no difference in mechanical sensitization was seen when capsaicin injections preceded Glu injections. There is also the potential for prolonged maintenance of elevated Glu concentrations in skeletal muscles to cause desensitization of Glu receptors after ingestion of MSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which might explain why we failed to see an effect of MSG on Glu evoked masseter and temporalis muscle pain. In anesthetized rats, repeated injection of Glu into the same temporomandibular joint at intervals of less than 30&#x000a0;min resulted in substantially decreased reflex jaw muscle responses, which suggests that clearance of Glu out of the muscle may be required to restore full nociceptive responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>It needs to also be considered that only healthy subjects participated in this study. As already discussed, it is possible that glutamate concentrations in the muscles of healthy individuals were not elevated sufficiently to produce measurable mechanical sensitization after a single ingestion of MSG. Nociceptors in the masticatory muscles of TMD patients with chronic muscle pain might be far more sensitive to changes in interstitial glutamate concentrations than those in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Effect of systemic glutamate administration on perceived pain intensity and PPT</title><p>Among various risk factors for TMD, we hypothesized that daily food consumption, especially excessive MSG intake, might change muscle sensitivity to experimental pain. A significantly higher interstitial concentration of Glu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] could trigger severe muscle pain more often in TMD patients than the healthy individuals. However, the systemic administration of MSG in this study did not result in higher glutamate-evoked pain intensity, compared to placebo. Also, consistent with past studies, a lower value of the PPT in the masseter was observed in this study, but this occurred regardless of the session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus, in this model of TMD-like myofascial pain, we found no evidence that MSG alters pain sensitivity.</p><p>The trapezius muscle is one of the most reported referred pain areas in patients with TMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Glu injection into the craniofacial region caused decreased sensitivity to pressure stimuli in the trapezius muscle after ingestion of MSG. Hypoalgesia in a heterotopic site of painful muscles has been previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Glu evoked pain may have recruited diffuse noxious inhibitory control mechanisms (DNIC), which could have decreased the excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons that receive sensory input from the trapezius muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This mechanism could explain the increase in the PPT in the trapezius muscle, even though it is located outside the painful area in the temporalis or masseter muscle. However, it is also possible that this finding of hyposensitivity in the trapezius muscle could be biased by a type II error and the multiple comparisons of PPT data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Effect of MSG administration on autonomic parameters</title><p>In previous studies, it has been found that oral ingestion of 150&#x000a0;mg/kg MSG increases sBP by 5-10&#x000a0;% for 30&#x02013;60 min, with a more variable effect on dBP and heart rate, although heart rate usually declines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the present study, it was found that sBP and dBP were significantly increased by intramuscular injection of Glu into the masseter or temporalis muscle. It is possible that the increase observed in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure 5&#x000a0;min after Glu injections was due to the muscle pain produced by the injections. In rats, injection of NMDA, a selective Glu receptor subtype agonist, into the temporalis muscle was shown to significantly increase mean blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This effect is likely due to a combination of the nociceptive input from the injection of NMDA into the muscle, coupled with a positive inotropic effect of NMDA on the heart after it is cleared from the muscle into the systemic circulation. It is uncertain whether the increased blood pressure observed in the present study after intramuscular Glu injection in healthy subjects is a result of pain alone, or is also reflects a positive inotropic effect of the injected Glu on the heart.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study suggests that acute experimental intake of excessive MSG does not greatly affect muscle pain sensitivity in healthy subjects. Similar to results in previous studies, the most significant effect of systemic MSG administration was to increase blood pressure. As Glu injection into the masseter muscle can replicate some of the symptoms reported by patients with myofascial TMD, this study suggests that elevated dietary intake of MSG would likely not affect pain sensitivity in TMD patients. Future research on the relationship between MSG consumption and pain in TMD is required to confirm this assumption.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interest</bold></p><p>The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest in the publication of this manuscript.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>AS participated in collecting data and drafted the manuscript.
