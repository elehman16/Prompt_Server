Complex interventions have multiple interacting components and are recognised in the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance as having varied and challenging issues in their design, evaluation and implementation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> This guidance recognises that intervention fidelity is underevaluated. Intervention fidelity is defined as the use of methodological strategies to monitor and enhance the reliability (ie, the consistency) and validity (ie, the appropriateness) of behavioural programmes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></p><p>The construct of &#x02018;intervention fidelity&#x02019; originated from concerns about the &#x02018;treatment integrity&#x02019; of psychotherapeutic interventions expressed in the 1980s and 1990s.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4 R5 R6">4&#x02013;6</xref> The monitoring, measurement and assessment of intervention fidelity is important as it has been demonstrated that fidelity is a mediator of study outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7 R8 R9 R10">7&#x02013;10</xref> The analysis of intervention fidelity can provide explanations of research findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>; for example, where interventions lack impact, this may reflect implementation failure rather than genuine ineffectiveness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> The assessment of intervention fidelity is significant in the maintenance of internal and external validity. Internal validity may be compromised by &#x02018;type III errors&#x02019;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> that arise from the evaluation of a programme that has been inadequately implemented. External validity may be improved by rigorous fidelity assessment that facilitates treatment replication across studies and assists the evaluation and development of treatments in applied settings.</p><p>In the past 20&#x02005;years, the notion of intervention fidelity has become increasingly differentiated and multilayered.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13 R14 R15">13&#x02013;15</xref> There is an emerging science of intervention fidelity relating to complex interventions presenting researchers with a number of conceptual, methodological and operational challenges.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16 R17 R18 R19 R20">16&#x02013;20</xref> There is an ongoing debate about how core elements of fidelity are defined and measured<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></p><p>There is little consensus about the key elements that contribute to intervention fidelity, possibly because it is a multidimensional construct.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Recent work has identified five domains of fidelity: study design, training, intervention delivery, intervention receipt by participants and intervention enactment, defined as the extent to which participants apply the skills learnt.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></p><p>In this article, we focus on the domain of intervention delivery or integrity, defined as the monitoring and assessment of behaviours at the point of intervention delivery. Intervention integrity is often considered to be the heart of fidelity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> The effectiveness of complex interventions may be dependent on the &#x02018;skills&#x02019; of those delivering them.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> &#x02018;Skills&#x02019; can be characterised by separate but related constructs of adherence and competence. Adherence is defined as: the extent to which a person delivers the essential content, delivery strategies and theories prescribed by the intervention designers and avoids activities proscribed by them. Competence refers to the level of &#x02018;skill&#x02019; demonstrated by those delivering an intervention and may include the ability to respond appropriately to a wide variety of contextual cues. Competence is less likely to be assessed than adherence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> This may be a reflection of the ongoing debate surrounding the definition of competence and &#x02018;skill&#x02019;,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> the methodological difficulties surrounding the monitoring and measurement of competence,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> and the significant expenditure of time and resource required to collect and analyse competence data.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></p><p>The association between the levels of adherence and levels of competence is unclear,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> and the impact of varying levels of adherence on outcomes is unresolved. Some studies have concluded that high levels of adherence may reflect a lack of flexibility and compromise outcomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>; however, others have concluded that high levels of adherence are associated with improved outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> This suggests that the relationship between outcomes and adherence is not linear, and that flexibility and deviation from predefined protocols may result in lower levels of adherence but produce optimal results.</p><p>It has been argued that the significant resource costs of maintaining a high level of vigilance in treatment fidelity are more than outweighed by the scientific, economic and stakeholder consequences of disseminating inadequately tested interventions or of implementing potentially effective programmes poorly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> Recent evidence suggests that the assessment of intervention fidelity is not being conducted widely or systematically.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>

It is a self-management course aimed at enabling participants living with long-term musculoskeletal pain to improve the quality of their lives. COPERS is a 3-day course run for groups of between 8 and 16 people. Specifically trained facilitators, one a healthcare professional and another a lay facilitator with experience of living with long-term pain, conduct the groups. We tested the course's effectiveness in a randomised controlled trial (RCT; ISRCTN 24426731). As part of the trial we developed, tested and implemented a methodology to assess the intervention integrity of the COPERS course as it was delivered to trial participants. In this article, we describe how we assessed fidelity, the challenges we encountered while measuring integrity, competence and adherence.

To our knowledge, this is the most systematic and rigorous published evaluation of the intervention integrity of a complex, theory-based behaviour change intervention until now. Overall, the results suggest that the COPERS course was delivered competently and as intended. We describe the opportunities, challenges, achievements and limitations of this work and discuss these in the context of the emerging science of fidelity assessment with regard to intervention integrity and make recommendations based on our experience, which may assist other trialists evaluating complex interventions.</p><p>Our work supports the suggestion that effective adherence in complex interventions may involve not only the delivery of prescribed &#x02018;surface&#x02019; content, but also adherence to the essential but non-content related &#x02018;core&#x02019; theoretical/structural elements.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> For example, component10: &#x02018;Unhelpful Thinking&#x02019; in the COPERS programme illustrates the challenges in defining adherence in complex interventions. This component was intended to help participants recognise and change patterns of automatic negative and self-limiting thoughts. The course manual outlines the informational content of this component, as well as the structure, sequence, timing and mode of delivery of the various elements to be used by the facilitators. To deliver this component as prescribed, a high level of adherence to the content and structure of the session was required. Component 10 had a relatively low adherence score, which was primarily caused by the facilitators&#x02019; difficulty in maintaining the complex structure of the tasks involved in this component rather than a failure to deliver the prescribed content. High levels of adherence to protocols may be associated with a mechanistic, inflexible or unresponsive delivery style and are therefore associated with low levels of competence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Conversely, sometimes facilitator &#x02018;failure&#x02019; to deliver the component content as prescribed, that is, low adherence was directly related to low levels of competence. Parts of the course were designed to promote group participation, but if poorly sequenced or timed, they often resulted in a didactic/mechanistic delivery style that inhibited rather than encouraged group disclosure and discussion.</p><p>Seemingly low levels of adherence, however, may not necessarily be associated with poor intervention delivery. For example, some facilitators deviated from instructions (and were, by definition, non-adherent), but these deviations can be reinterpreted positively as the facilitators altered the delivery in response to individual or group intervention receipt. Some of our facilitators subtly changed delivery from the prescribed content in the manual, but they still achieved the component's overall aims and objectives. This may be a demonstration of high levels of facilitator competence despite being rated as non-adherent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> There is, as yet, little empirical work that demonstrates the conditions that may influence adaptation or reinvention or whether, and in what circumstances, these deviations from prescribed protocol may enhance outcomes or decrease effectiveness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></p><p>The monitoring and assessment of competence within the COPERS study illustrated the difficulties associated with its measurement. Recent work has identified competence as a complex construct that includes the ability to establish collaborative relationships and form alliances with participants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> through the use of responsive tailoring of programme content,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> the pacing of delivery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> and the use of positive verbal and non-verbal behaviours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></p><p>The findings from the COPERS study support those who consider that levels of competence are more sensitive to contextual factors than adherence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> The greater variability in our competence scores, compared with those for adherence, reflect, in part, the diversity of facilitator skills required to deliver the COPERS programme and the recognised practical and methodological difficulties in measuring what may seem to be a subjective concept.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></p><p>Our work supports the hypothesis that competence is a multidimensional construct. Effective intervention delivery may be influenced and moderated by many factors such as: positive or negative individuals and/or groups, individual intervention receipt, component content, facilitator and cofacilitator coherence or incoherence, issues related to the use of computer hardware and software, the venue, the distribution of handouts, use of flip charts, the coordination and organisation of group activities, feedback and time management. Experience also influences competence and we noted that our facilitators appeared to improve with each course they conducted. Our ratings might also reflect the inexperience of the facilitators who were delivering a new initiative.</p><p>The overall impression measure was, in part, designed to reflect some of the &#x02018;non-facilitator determined&#x02019; factors not evaluated by the adherence and competence measures. This subjective measure assessed the extent to which the component achieved its specific aims and was consistent with the goals of the wider programme. The overall impression measure proved to be challenging to use and the data difficult to interpret. Evaluators found it relatively straightforward to assess a component as either &#x02018;Excellent&#x02019; or &#x02018;Did not go well&#x02019;, but the intermediate scores were less reliable.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>Within the emerging science of fidelity assessment, there is a recognition of the need for reliable measurement instruments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> The varying levels of inter-rater and intrarater reliability found in our work reflect the conceptual and methodological difficulties of measuring interventionist behaviours at the point of programme delivery. We consider that our adherence, competence and overall impression measures are developmental, and that in the future the use of triangulated data from multiple sources and more differentiated, contextually sensitive measures specifically designed for complex interventions may prove to be of great value. We used audio recordings to evaluate the components, but it is doubtful if sound recordings alone can capture the subtleties of facilitator competence involving non-verbal behaviours, the dynamics of facilitators as well as individual and group interactions. Although the assessment of adherence and competence was carried out by evaluators not directly involved in the delivery of each assessed component, the overall evaluation of the COPERS intervention was conducted by members of the study team, which may have led to bias. The adherence measures were designed to assess the fundamental requirements of course delivery; however, the use of a generic competence measure may not have reflected the range of skills required to deliver the various course components. The absence of standardised definitions and the lack of valid and reliable measures of adherence and competence made assessments of the impact on outcomes difficult.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Lessons learnt</title><p>Our experience of assessing fidelity enabled us to gain valuable insights which may be of use to others evaluating the fidelity of complex interventions; these are summarised in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>.
