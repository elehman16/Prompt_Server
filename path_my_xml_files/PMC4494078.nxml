The main objective of this study was to assess the prognostic impact of preoperative TACE on the long-term survival outcomes in patients undergoing preoperative PVE and right liver resection for solitary HCC.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients who underwent macroscopic curative right liver resection of solitary HCC that lied between 3.0 and 7.0 cm (n=113) with or without preoperative TACE and PVE were selected for the study, making these subjects were divided into three groups; the TACE-PVE group (n=27), the PVE-alone group (n=13), and the control group (n=73).

However, since a majority of HCC lesions are hypervascular, preoperative PVE carries an additional risk of rapid tumor growth from the buffering increase of the ipsilateral hepatic arterial flow. To prevent such a detrimental effect from the preoperative PVE as well as to facilitate FRL regeneration, a precedent performance of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended before preoperative PVE for major hepatectomy.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We previously presented that sequential TACE and PVE before surgery is a safe and effective method to increase the rate of hypertrophy of FRL and leads to longer overall and recurrence-free survival in patients with HCC.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>TACE is one of the available locoregional therapies for HCC. TACE often improves long-term outcomes in patients with unresectable HCCs, thus TACE is considered as an acceptably effective treatment for inoperable patients with large or multifocal HCCs.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, there were several reports supporting that preoperative TACE does not improve the post-resection prognosis - it even worsens it.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Currently, most of the existing clinical studies regarding preoperative PVE with or without precedent TACE have been carried out in the form of a double-arm study with one control group of PVE only.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The prognostic impact from TACE was primarily focused on the beneficial prevention of buffering increase of the hepatic arterial flow, but the potential detrimental effect of TACE-associated tumor spread was not taken into account. Therefore, this study was intended to shift the focus by assessing the prognostic impact of TACE before preoperative PVE on long-term survival outcomes in patients undergoing right hepatectomy for solitary HCCs through a triple-arm study comparing among the TACE-PVE group, PVE-alone group, and na&#x000ef;ve control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The HCC database at our institution was searched to identify patients who underwent primary liver resection for HCC in 9 years from January 2003 to December 2011, and 3582 patients were initially identified. Of them, 654 patients underwent right liver resection including right hepatectomy, extended right hepatectomy or right trisectionectomy. The detailed profiles of patients who underwent resection for solitary HCC and right liver resection were presented previously.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>The 654 patients undergoing right liver resection were primarily screened according to the following criteria in order to avoid unnecessary bias from important prognostic factors: solitary HCC between 3.0 and 7.0 cm in diameter, right hepatectomy and extended right hepatectomy, macroscopic curative resection with tumor-free surgical margin, no macroscopic vascular invasion, no extrahepatic metastasis, no preoperative HCC treatment other than TACE within 3 months prior to PVE, hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated background liver, and patient survival &#x0003e;3 months after resection. Through these screening processes, 113 patients (17.3%) were selected. Additionally, they were divided into three groups with respect to preoperative TACE and PVE as follows: the preoperative PVE group with precedent TACE (TACE-PVE group: n=27 [23.9]), the PVE-alone group (n=13 [11.5%]), and the na&#x000ef;ve group without any preoperative preparation (control group: n=73 [64.6%]). Artificial selection of the control group patients through a propensity score-matching was not performed because these screening processes themselves worked as a strict patient selection process comparable to the usual propensity score-matching.</p><p>Medical records were reviewed retrospectively after approval by the Institutional Review Board of our institution. Patients were followed up until December 2014 through reviewing of medical records, therefore making the patient follow-up period &#x02265;36 months or until death. All patients were completely followed up for identification of patient survival status through the assistance of the National Health Insurance Service.</p></sec><sec><title>Preoperative evaluation and surgical procedures</title><p>The Korean general population with chronic liver diseases have been regularly followed up for detection of HCC according to the guideline of Korean Association for the Study of the Liver.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Routine preoperative evaluation for HCC included abdomen and chest computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 2-<sup>18</sup>F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

During follow-up, majority of our patients showed undetectable HBV DNA and only a small proportion of patients showed very low HBV DNA titers.

After further division according to TACE an PVE, the tumor size cutoff at 5 cm showed significant survival difference only in the TACE-PVE group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <italic>p</italic>=0.018), but no difference in the PVE-alone group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <italic>p</italic>=0.698) and the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <italic>p</italic>=0.669).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The basic concepts of sequential TACE and PVE include two aspects as follows: The first is to prevent detrimental effects from preoperative PVE, which, according to the viewpoint of surgical oncology, is the most significant challenge. The second is to facilitate further FRL regeneration. Since the interventional radiologists often emphasized the latter, there are several clinical studies supporting this concept in literature.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Interestingly, TACE has even been attempted even after PVE for the very purpose of FRL regeneration.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> According to these theoretical advantages, preoperative TACE-PVE may increase the probability of resectability for major hepatectomy and may decrease the risk of postoperative hepatic failure.</p><p>This study was focused on the potential prognostic effect from TACE combined with PVE. There are four randomized controlled trials that have assessed the prognostic effects of preoperative TACE so far,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and they similarly concluded that pretreatment with TACE alone did not improve post-resection survival. We also presented similar results after retrospective analysis.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Due to this reason, the patient who underwent preoperative TACE alone was not included as a separate study group, thus being excluded from this study.</p><p>In the results of this study, the TACE-alone group definitely showed inferior survival outcomes than the TACE-PVE and control groups, which gives two clinical implications. The first is that PVE alone may have a negative prognostic effect. It might be associated with the potential tumor growth from PVE-associated buffering increase of the hepatic arterial flow, and subsequently it may also increase the risk of tumor cell spread.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In contrast, it is well known that HCC tumor cell spread usually occurs through the portal venous system. We had initially presumed that PVE induces nearly complete blockage of ipsilateral hemiliver portal venous system thus transportal HCC tumor cell spread is effectively prevented, but this concept could not clearly explain the prognostic differences between the TACE-PVE and PVE alone groups. Nevertheless, preoperative performance of PVE alone would not be recommended due to inferior postoperative prognosis. The second is regarding on the working mechanism of precedent TACE to offset the detrimental effects from TACE alone and PVE alone. It might be associated with several factors. First, given that the combined treatment may induce higher tumor necrosis, there would be a lower chance of incomplete tumor resection or tumor cell dissemination during surgery<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> TACE alone induces complete tumor necrosis in approximately 50% of patients.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> It was presented that sequential TACE and PVE achieved complete tumor necrosis in more than 80% of their patients compared with only 5% after PVE alone.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Second, the combined treatment with TACE and PVE may decrease the rate of early recurrence, which usually develops due to undetected or residual microscopic tumor after resection.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Currently, we presume that the cytoreductive effect from precedent TACE may offset the risk of PVE-induced tumor growth, thus it may be reasonable to perform TACE before preoperative PVE. Therefore, TACE is highly recommended before preoperative PVE for major hepatectomy.</p><p>It is generally accepted that there is no size limit that precludes liver resection especially for solitary HCCs if these tumors are resectable.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, the size of HCC tumors has been traditionally considered as one of the most important risk factors for tumor recurrence and overall survival. However, the concept was modified after a multi-center study demonstrated that survival outcomes were independent of tumor size in patients who underwent resection of solitary HCC without microvascular invasion.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In a meta-analysis of prognostic indicators in HCC treatment, tumor size was one of the most significant risk factors in 57% of good-quality studies.<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Therefore, these studies overruled the previous modification on the insignificance of tumor size on survival outcomes. We also presented that independent prognostic factors for resection of solitary HCCs were non-anatomical resection, tumor size &#x0003e;5 cm and microvascular invasion for tumor recurrence, and hypermetabolic uptake on FDG-PET, non-anatomical resection, tumor size &#x0003e;5 cm and microvascular invasion for overall patient survival.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In this study, our patients were divided by a tumor size cutoff at 5 cm. The prognostic impact from HCC size was not overt in the PVE alone and control groups, but evident only in the TACE-PVE group. It is difficult to explain this finding clearly, but we presume that the degree of TACE-induced tumor necrosis in larger tumors would be different comparing with the smaller tumors.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> We presented that complete necrosis after repeat TACE for post-resection intrahepatic recurrence was attained more commonly in patients with smaller tumor size and lower tumor number at first TACE and favored longer survival in recurrent patients.<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Thus, we presume that the TACE response would be reflected at the prognostic difference in the TACE-PVE group. From the oncological viewpoint of TACE response, partial tumor necrosis induced by preoperative TACE increases the risk of tumor recurrence after resection, which may be because of tumor cell dislodgement into the bloodstream.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The extent of tumor vascularization is significantly associated with the degree of TACE efficacy, and a high degree of vascularization is thus considered to be a predictive sign for response to TACE.<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Thus preoperative TACE may be permissible only in HCC patients with a high degree of tumor vascularity.<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In contrast, if incomplete tumor necrosis happens, the remaining viable tumor cells are less firmly attached, and thus are more likely to be dislodged into the bloodstream before surgery and to promote the hematogenous spread of residual tumor cells during LR,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> thus suggesting that preoperative TACE should be avoided when incomplete tumor necrosis is anticipated. We think HCC vascularity would be considered before performing preoperative sequential TACE-PVE.</p><p>The present study has several limitations. First, it is a retrospective study, thus it might be involved with some inherent flaws. Second, the sample size of the PVE groups was not large enough, thus it were not balanced with that of the control group. A uniquely strong point of this study is that the survival status of all patients was completely followed up. A prospective and randomized control trial will be required to reach definite conclusions regarding the clinical efficacy of sequential TACE and PVE before surgery.</p><p>In conclusion, preoperative sequential TACE and PVE appear to be compliant to the conventional oncological concept in addition to induction of the FRL liver regeneration. Therefore, we suggest that preoperative TACE should be come first whenever preoperative PVE for major hepatectomy is planned, especially in patients with hypervascular HCC tumors.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
