in the early poststroke phase would stimulate the intact hemisphere, thereby influencing
the hemisphere of the infarcted side and improving the performance of the hemiplegic limb.
[Subjects and Methods] Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (8&#x02013;10 weeks of age, weighing
250&#x02013;300&#x02005;g, n=12) were used and randomly divided into 3 groups: nonaffected forelimb
exercise for 3 days and treadmill exercise 7 days after ischemia (ETF, n=6), resting for 3
days and treadmill exercise 7 days after ischemia (ETN, n=6), and after ischemia 10 days
resting group. To validate nerve growth factor (NGF), western blot analysis was performed.
The results were analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 18.0. and expressed as mean &#x000b1;
standard deviation (SD). [Results] Early treadmill exercise increased the expression of
NGF protein level in both ETE and ETN groups. Comparing between the nonaffected forelimb
exercise and infarct hemisphere in NGF protein expression, the ETE group showed higher
increase of NGF protein level in right hemisphere than ETN group, but there was no
statistical significance. [Conclusion] The early treadmill exercise increased NGF protein
expression levels in both hemispheres and the nonaffected forelimb exercise in the early
poststroke recovery phase could enhance neuronal recovery after focal ischemia in rat
models.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Focal cerebral ischemia</kwd><kwd>Early phase exercise</kwd><kwd>Nerve growth factor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A stroke is a destructive cerebrovascular disease, which results in neurological deficits
and long-term physical disabilities. Despite major advances in medical technology in recent
years, most stroke survivors experience motor and cognitive dysfunction, as well as other
neurological deficits<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercise interventions can enhance recovery after a stroke by direct electrical stimulation
of the brain, which promotes the brain&#x02019;s intrinsic plasticity mechanisms (i.e.,
neuroplasticity)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several recent
studies demonstrated beneficial effects of exercise and training in the early poststroke
phase on ischemic brain recovery<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. These effects are thought to be due to
exercise increasing the activation of motor cortical areas in the undamaged hemisphere,
which, in turn, compensates for nonactivation in areas that are damaged or disconnected.</p><p>The contralesional intact cerebral hemisphere contributes to motor function recovery in
stroke patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study showed that the corticospinal tract (CST) was the
main pathway for voluntary movement and that this pathway was connected to motor neurons in
the spinal cord, either directly or indirectly<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the study, the authors reported that the midline crossing CST
fibers originated from the contralesional hemisphere correlated with behavioral outcomes
after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in an animal model<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in the present study, we hypothesized that
exercise of the nonaffected forelimb in the early poststroke phase would stimulate the
intact hemisphere, thereby influencing the hemisphere of the infarcted side and improving
the performance of the hemiplegic limb.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Experimental procedures were performed according to the protocols established by the
Institution of Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Daegu University, based on the
NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH, 1996).</p><p>Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal occlusion of the right middle
cerebral artery (MCA)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Briefly, middle
cerebral artery is occluded by a 4&#x02013;0 nylon monofilament coated with a silicone tip, the
monofilament was inserted into the internal carotid artery from the external carotid artery
until mild resistance was felt. Reperfusion was established by completely withdrawing the
nylon monofilament after 120&#x02005;min of occlusion.</p><p>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (8&#x02013;10 weeks of age, weighing 250&#x02013;300&#x02005;g, n=18) were used and
randomly divided into 3 groups: non-affected forelimb exercise for 3 days and treadmill
exercise 7 days after ischemia (ETF, n=6), resting for 3 days and treadmill exercise 7days
after ischemia (ETN, n=6), and after ischemia 10 days resting group (Control, n=6).</p><p>Early non-affected side exercise in early phase was performed by skilled reach task.
Skilled reach task as known as beneficial effect on neurotrophic factor expression that were
conducted in a Plexiglas chamber containing of a 1&#x02005;cm by 10&#x02005;cm window in front wall which is
allowed for one of the rat&#x02019;s paw to reach through for a pellet<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sugar-flavored food pellets placed on the shelf placed in a small
indentation 3&#x02005;cm from the inside wall of the chamber and trained in 30 minutes per 1 day for
3 days based on previous reports<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pellets are aligned the right window
side for nonaffected forelimb exercise.</p><p>The validate nerve growth factor (NGF), western blot analysis was performed. In brief,
proteins extracts from brain tissues that were divided right/left hemisphere and separated
by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis. Protein separation was
performed then transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blots were probed with anti-NGF
1:1,000 (E-12, cat# sc-365944, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Peroxidase anti-mouse was used as a
secondary antibody. The thickness of the bands was photographically measured by Scion Image
software Beta 4.0.3 (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD, USA). The results were analyzed using SPSS
for Windows version 18.0. and expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). Comparisons
between groups were performed via the Bonferroni-Dunn test. P values less than 0.05 at the
95% confidence level were considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Early treadmill exercise increased the expression of NGF protein level in both ETE and ETN

recovery in rats in an MCAO model. Furthermore, the findings suggested that ETE
significantly increased the protein expression level of nerve growth factor (NGF) of both
hemispheres of MCAO rats. Previous experimental rat models and clinical studies also
demonstrated that rehabilitative exercise promoted neurological recovery and functional
recovery after a stroke<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, high-intensity exercise or excessive use of the affected limb can
exacerbate ischemic injury<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
moderate-intensity exercise, combined with an appropriate training protocol, can be an
effective poststroke treatment. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether ETE
exercise would improve ischemic recovery. As shown by the comparison between the ETE groups
and the control group, the NGF protein expression level was significantly increased in the
ETN and ETE groups as compared to that of the control group.</p><p>The corpus callosum (CC) is a white-matter structure and is the major commissure connecting
the cerebral hemispheres. Thus, we hypothesized that the addition of nonaffected forelimb
exercise in the early phase would influence both the infarcted hemisphere and intact
hemisphere. The results showed that NGF protein expression was slightly increased in the ETN
group as compared to that in the ETE group, but the finding was not statistically
significant. The results do not explain the neurological mechanism underlying the
correlation between nonaffected forelimb exercise and recovery of an infarcted hemisphere.
However, in common with the findings of a previous study<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, they point to the possibility of exercise having an influence on
hemispheric connections<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present showed that early treadmill exercise increased
NGF protein expression levels in both hemispheres and suggested that exercise of the
nonaffected forelimb in the early poststroke recovery phase could enhance neuronal recovery
after focal ischemia in rat models. Further studies are needed to provide neurological
evidence of hemispheric communication and develop methods for a clinical approach in stroke
patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Saxena</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Ng</surname><given-names>TP</given-names></name><name><surname>Koh</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Is improvement in impaired cognition and depressive
