</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editors-summary"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Every year, more than 200 million cases of malaria occur worldwide, and more than 600,000 people, mainly children living in sub-Saharan Africa, die from this parasitic infection. Malaria parasites, which are transmitted to people through the bites of infected night-flying mosquitoes, cause a characteristic fever that needs to be treated promptly with antimalarial drugs to prevent anaemia (a reduction in red blood cell numbers) and organ damage. Prompt treatment also helps to reduce malaria transmission, but the mainstays of global malaria control efforts are the provision of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for people to sleep under to avoid mosquito bites, and indoor residual spraying (IRS) of houses with insecticides, which prevents mosquitoes from resting in houses. Both approaches have been scaled up in the past decade. About 54% of households in Africa now own at least one ITN, and 8% of at-risk populations are protected by IRS. As a result of the widespread deployment of these preventative tools and the increased availability of effective antimalarial drugs, malaria-related deaths in Africa fell by 45% between 2000 and 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Some countries have chosen to use ITNs and IRS in combination, reasoning that this will increase the proportion of individuals who are protected by at least one intervention and may provide additional protection to people using both interventions rather than one alone. However, providing both interventions is costly, so it is important to know whether this rationale is correct. In this cluster randomised controlled trial (a study that compares outcomes of groups of people randomly assigned to receive different interventions) undertaken in the Muleba District of Tanzania during 2012, the researchers investigate whether ITNs plus IRS provide more protection against malaria than ITNs alone. Malaria transmission occurs throughout the year in Muleba District but peaks after the October&#x02013;December and March&#x02013;May rains. Ninety-one percent of the district's households own at least one ITN, and 58% of households own enough ITNs to cover all their sleeping places. Annual rounds of IRS have been conducted in the region since 2007.</p></sec><sec><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers allocated 50 communities to the ITN intervention or to the ITN+IRS intervention. Dwellings allocated to ITN+IRS were sprayed with insecticide just before each of the malaria transmission peaks in 2012. The researchers used household surveys to collect information about ITN coverage in the study population, the proportion of children aged 0.5&#x02013;14 years infected with the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (the prevalence of infection), and the proportion of children under five years old with anaemia. IRS coverage in the ITN+IRS arm was approximately 90%, and 50% of the children in both intervention arms used ITNs at the start of the trial, declining to 36% at the end of the study. In an intention-to-treat analysis (which assumed that all study participants got the planned intervention), the average prevalence of infection was 13% in the ITN+IRS arm and 26% in the ITN arm. A per-protocol analysis (which considered data only from participants who received their allocated intervention) indicated that the combined intervention had a statistically significant protective effect on the prevalence of infection compared to ITNs alone (an effect that is unlikely to have arisen by chance). Finally, the proportion of young children with anaemia was lower in the ITN+IRS arm than in the ITN arm, but this effect was not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings provide evidence that IRS, when used in combination with ITNs, can provide better protection against malaria infection than ITNs used alone. This effect is likely to be the result of IRS providing added protection to ITN users as well as compensating for inadequate ITN use. The findings also suggest that the combination of interventions may reduce the prevalence of anaemia better than ITNs alone, but this result needs to be confirmed. Additional trials are also needed to investigate whether ITN+IRS compared to ITN reduces clinical cases of malaria, and whether similar effects are seen in other settings. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness of ITN+IRS and ITN alone needs to be compared. For now, though, these findings suggest that national malaria control programs should consider implementing IRS in combination with ITNs if local ITN strategies alone are insufficiently effective and cannot be improved.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these websites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001630">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001630</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Information is available from the World Health Organization on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/topics/malaria/en">malaria</ext-link> (in several languages), including information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/malaria/areas/vector_control/core_methods/en/">insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying</ext-link>; the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2013/en/"><italic>World Malaria Report 2013</italic></ext-link> provides details of the current global malaria situation</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria">malaria</ext-link>, on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/itn.html">insecticide-treated bed nets</ext-link>, and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/irs.html">indoor residual spraying</ext-link>; it also provides a selection of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/stories/index.html">personal stories</ext-link> about malaria</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information is available from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/">Roll Back Malaria Partnership</ext-link> on the global control of malaria and on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/gmap/index.html">Global Malaria Action Plan</ext-link> (in English and French); its website includes fact sheets about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/cmc_upload/0/000/015/370/RBMInfosheet_3.htm">malaria in Africa</ext-link> and about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/cmc_upload/0/000/015/368/RBMInfosheet_5.htm">nets and insecticides</ext-link>

The percentage of households that owned at least one ITN in Africa increased from 3% in 2000 to 54% in 2013. The World Health Organization (WHO) policy that ITNs should be provided to everyone in malaria risk areas (universal coverage) <xref rid="pmed.1001630-World1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> has been adopted by 34 of the 44 malaria endemic countries in Africa <xref rid="pmed.1001630-World2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Indoor residual spraying (IRS) of houses, the second major vector control tool used to prevent malaria, has similarly been scaled up. The proportion of at-risk populations protected by IRS increased from less than 5% in 2005 to 8% in 2012 <xref rid="pmed.1001630-World2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. As a result of the increase in the deployment of these preventive tools and the increased availability and use of artemisinin-based combination therapies, malaria-related mortality fell by 45% between 2000 and 2012 in Africa, but there remained an estimated 165 million cases and 562,000 deaths due to malaria in 2012 <xref rid="pmed.1001630-World2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>In an attempt to reduce the malaria burden further, a number of countries have chosen to use ITNs and IRS in combination.

This is particularly significant now, since it is estimated that global funding for malaria is less than half of what is needed to attain universal coverage of malaria vector control, i.e., access to either ITNs or IRS <xref rid="pmed.1001630-World3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>It is unclear from current evidence whether combined use of ITNs and IRS provides an additional benefit compared to using either intervention alone, and whether this will be similar across transmission settings <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Kleinschmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Yakob1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Corbel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Okumu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

There was also some evidence that anaemia prevalence was lower in communities with the combination. Exposure to infectious mosquito bites was about one-sixth in communities with the combined intervention compared to those in the ITN only arm. Two rounds of IRS with bendiocarb were conducted to overcome the short residual activity of the insecticide <xref rid="pmed.1001630-World5" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and to ensure that there was active ingredient on the walls of sprayed homes throughout the transmission season.</p><p>IRS coverage in the ITN+IRS arm was high at approximately 90% in both spray rounds, which would have optimised its effectiveness <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Rehman1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. On the other hand, whilst 85% of households owned at least one ITN, use of ITNs was modest, declining to 36% by the end of the study. The low usage of ITNs means that the addition of IRS may have simply protected those who were not using an ITN, thus compensating for low ITN usage rather than offering additional protection to net users. This interpretation is contradicted by the results of a per-protocol analysis, which excluded those not using ITNs, showing strong evidence that ITN users whose houses were sprayed were additionally protected by IRS. The estimated reduction in <italic>Pf</italic>PR associated with the combination of interventions was greater in the per-protocol analysis than in the ITT analysis in each survey. Per-protocol analysis excludes non-compliers (for IRS and ITN) and therefore may have been influenced by confounders. It is likely that the observed overall effect of the intervention combination was a result of both IRS protecting those not using ITNs, and IRS additionally protecting ITN users.</p><p>A potential negative impact of the combination of interventions is that having their house sprayed may encourage some residents to stop sleeping under an ITN. This was not observed in this study; ITN usage was similar between the villages with and without IRS in each post-intervention survey.</p><p>ITN usage and ownership was slightly higher at baseline in the ITN+IRS arm compared to the ITN only arm, but the 95% confidence intervals for these estimates overlapped. This non-significant difference could have led to a slight overestimation of the effect size. <italic>Pf</italic>PR was slightly lower at baseline in the ITN+IRS arm compared to the ITN only arm, but the effect size did not change after adjusting for <italic>Pf</italic>PR at baseline. This suggests that baseline <italic>Pf</italic>PR was not confounding the relationship between study arm and <italic>Pf</italic>PR (the outcome). In the baseline year, malaria prevalence was higher in June&#x02013;July after the long rainy season than in February&#x02013;March after the short rains. In the intervention year, the prevalence similarly increased in June&#x02013;July (survey B) in the ITN only arm, but prevalence in the ITN+IRS arm remained low, suggesting IRS and ITNs in combination prevented the seasonal increase in infections.</p><p>The added protective effect of IRS peaked in the second survey, at the height of transmission after the long rains. This was probably the optimal time for the insecticide to reduce the abundance of the mosquito population (N. Protopopoff, personal communication) and thus to observe the impact of IRS on the prevalence of malarial infections. The limited residual activity of bendiocarb IRS has been shown to reduce its protective effectiveness 3&#x02013;5 mo after spraying, which probably accounts for the loss of added benefit seen in the third survey, which was 6 mo after the last spray round at the beginning of the short rains <xref rid="pmed.1001630-World5" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Implementing IRS with long-lasting insecticide formulations might be necessary to maintain the effectiveness of the combination throughout the year. Alternatively, the time between IRS rounds could be reduced, but this would considerably raise the cost of the combined intervention <xref rid="pmed.1001630-World8" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>The secondary outcomes anaemia and EIR also pointed to added protection being provided by the combination of IRS and ITNs, but the evidence for these endpoints was weaker. The combination intervention was associated with higher haemoglobin levels in children under 5 y, particularly at the peak of the transmission season. The study had been powered to show a difference in the primary outcome (<italic>Pf</italic>PR), and therefore may have been underpowered for these secondary outcomes. Nevertheless, the results for all outcomes are consistent.</p><p>One of the limitations of this study is that clinical incidence of malaria could not be recorded in addition to infection prevalence because recording of confirmed malaria cases was unreliable because of stock-outs of RDTs at health facilities. Implementing both IRS and universal coverage of ITNs is obviously considerably more costly than ITNs alone. Estimating the cost-effectiveness of the combination compared to ITNs alone was beyond the scope of this particular research. Although IRS is known to be highly cost-effective <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Yukich1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Goodman2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, the marginal cost per case averted through using IRS in combination with ITNs should ideally be assessed in future studies. This is particularly important in light of the funding gap that has been identified for meeting the demand for universal coverage of vector control for populations in malaria endemic regions <xref rid="pmed.1001630-World2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Previous studies have investigated the combined use of multiple vector control methods versus one method alone, but the results have been inconsistent <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Kleinschmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Okumu2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The only published trial data are from a 28-cluster, four-arm CRT carried out in Benin that compared (1) targeted coverage of LLINs (pregnant women and children only), (2) universal coverage of LLINs, (3) targeted coverage of LLINs combined with bendiocarb IRS, and (4) universal coverage of LLINs combined with bendiocarb-treated wall linings <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Corbel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The study found no difference in malaria incidence, geometric mean parasite density, or mosquito abundance between any of the study arms. The lack of any evidence of an added benefit of the combined interventions over the use of LLINs alone has to be viewed against the modest sample size, and hence potentially low power of this trial <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Lines1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and the lack of a comparator arm with universal coverage of ITNs.</p><p>There are a number of differences between the Benin trial and the current study that may have contributed to the discordant results. In the Benin trial, the interval between IRS rounds was 8 mo, whereas it was only 4 mo in the current study, as IRS was timed according to the seasonal peaks in cases, and taking account of its short residual duration on walls. The first two cross-sectional surveys for the current trial were timed to coincide with the seasonal peaks in cases and were only 2 mo after each IRS round, whereas in Benin the cases were recorded at 6-wk intervals for 18 mo, so that the measured effect of the additional IRS may include a period when the insecticide, which is known to have a short residual duration, was no longer effective. In the Benin trial, LLINs were given only to target groups in the reference arm and in the study arm with IRS, whereas in the current trial ITNs were distributed to all age groups.</p><p>Large CRTs have recently been conducted in the Gambia <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Pinder1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Pinder2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and in Sudan <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Kafy1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> comparing villages with IRS and LLINs to villages with only LLINs, but the results have not yet been published.</p><p>Evidence of an added benefit from the combination intervention compared to IRS or ITNs alone has been shown in a number of observational studies <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Kleinschmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Hamel1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Kleinschmidt2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Nyarango1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. For example, children 2&#x02013;14 y old consistently received added personal protection from using nets in addition to IRS on the island of Bioko, Equatorial Guinea (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59&#x02013;0.86), and in Zambezia, Mozambique (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50&#x02013;0.79) <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Kleinschmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In Pakistan, nets provided added protection against <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in refugee camps where IRS was conducted <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Rowland1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. However, other studies observed no additional benefit from the combination compared to one intervention alone <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Protopopoff2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Keating1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.</p><p>One interpretation of these divergent conclusions is that if the intervention present in both study arms is compromised or poorly implemented, the second method compensates for the deficiency of the first, providing apparent added protection that would otherwise not be seen. On the other hand, if the reference arm intervention is well implemented and efficacious in both study arms, there may be little or no scope for additional protection by a second intervention. ITN usage in the present trial was moderate, and hence the IRS protected many people who were not using a net in the ITN+IRS arm, whilst non-users in the ITN only arm remained unprotected. Any community or &#x0201c;mass effect&#x0201d; of ITNs on mosquito population size would have been limited because of the low community net usage. Therefore, the protective effect of ITNs in this study was possibly suboptimal. In Bioko, ITNs provided personal protection in the presence of IRS that was rendered only partially effective by moderate coverage (77%&#x02013;79%) and use of an insecticide that did not outlast the long malaria season <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Kleinschmidt2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Protopopoff et al. reported that in Burundi there was no additional reduction in infection prevalence in children from adding LLINs to IRS because high coverage (90%) of IRS had already reduced the sporozoite rate to a level where nets had no further impact <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Protopopoff2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. In Sao Tome, where the IRS programme was poorly implemented, with low coverage and long intervals between spray rounds, there was an additional benefit from using ITNs and IRS compared to IRS alone <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, on the neighbouring island of Principe, where IRS coverage was high (85%) and implemented on schedule, there was no added protection from ITNs in combination with IRS compared to IRS alone <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p>Insecticide resistance may be another reason why differences have been seen for the effectiveness of the combination of IRS and ITNs, resulting in either an apparent &#x0201c;added&#x0201d; effect of the second effective intervention, if the first was ineffective due to insecticide resistance, or no added effect if the second intervention was ineffective due to insecticide resistance. In the study area of this trial, there was evidence for high levels of resistance to pyrethroids in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> s.s. The epidemiological impact of pyrethroid resistance on the effectiveness of ITNs is currently not known <xref rid="pmed.1001630-World9" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. However, if the effectiveness of the ITNs was compromised <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Protopopoff1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> because of insecticide resistance, this would have enhanced our estimate of the additional benefit of non-pyrethroid IRS. If pyrethroid-treated nets were to be rendered partially ineffective in the presence of resistance, there would be a compelling case for combining ITNs with non-pyrethroid IRS.</p><p>An experimental hut trial in an area of Tanzania where the main vector is <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> found that if ITNs were used, the addition of IRS using insecticides with high irritancy such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or lambda-cyhalothrin did not increase mosquito mortality or repel mosquitoes from the house <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Okumu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the addition of IRS using pirimiphos-methyl, an organophosphate that has high toxicity and low irritancy, did increase mosquito mortality. These findings underscore that the interaction between the two interventions is complex and that the added protective effect will be dependent on the feeding and resting behaviours of particular malaria vectors, on the type of IRS insecticide used, on the susceptibility of local vectors to each of the insecticides in the combination, and on ITN usage <xref rid="pmed.1001630-Chitnis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Yakob1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001630-Okumu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. As a result, added protection may not be observed in all situations. A systematic review of all the trial results estimating the effectiveness of the combination of ITNs and IRS should be undertaken once the results of the trials in Sudan and the Gambia are available.</p><p>Nevertheless, this trial provides encouraging evidence for an additional benefit from applying IRS in combination with ITNs compared to ITNs alone. To our knowledge it is the first CRT to do so. The added protection from the supplementary use of IRS may in the case of bendiocarb be limited to only a few months, raising the question of whether residual insecticides of short duration are cost-effective when used in combination with ITNs. This study was conducted as an effectiveness study and not an efficacy study. The LLINs were distributed by a national UCC and therefore represented a real-life malaria control programme, including the challenges faced in achieving high coverage and usage of ITNs.</p><p>In conclusion, national malaria control programmes should consider implementing IRS in combination with ITNs if local ITN strategies alone are insufficiently effective and cannot be improved. A key consideration would be the additional cost of providing the combined intervention. Given the inconsistent trial evidence and the unproven generalisability of the findings of all studies that have investigated this question, it would be prudent for malaria control programmes implementing the two methods simultaneously to monitor the impact and cost-effectiveness of the combination to verify whether the additional resources have the desired effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001630.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
