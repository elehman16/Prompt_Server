Introduction</title><p>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia caused by either abnormal control of insulin secretion in pancreatic cells or the deterioration of the action of insulin in peripheral tissues [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In particular, hyperglycemia after meals is induced by diastatic enzymes such as several proteins including hemoglobin, and it is a key factor in the etiology of many chronic diabetic complications including microvascular complications. The current classes of hypoglycemic agents used for the treatment of diabetes include insulin secretagogue, liver gluconeogenesis inhibitor, insulin sensitizer, and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase inhibitor. The latter delays glucose absorption in the alimentary canal, and is widely used to lower postprandial glucose [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Intestinal <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase is an enzyme located in the microvillus membrane of the tunica mucosa and is essential for the digestion of carbohydrates. It breaks down polysaccharides into monosaccharides; for example, starch consumed via a meal is broken down into oligosaccharides by <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-amylase and further metabolized into glucose by <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-Glucosidase inhibitors decrease postprandial glucose and effectively compensate for the insufficient insulin secretion in noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus by combining with the enzyme and disturbing the dissolution and absorption of monosaccharides (i.e., glucose). While the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase inhibitors currently on the market (acarbose and voglibose) advantageously do not induce hyperinsulinemia or hypoglycemia, it has been reported that their long-term use can cause side effects such as abdominal distention, vomiting, and diarrhea [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Recently, substitutional foods and natural products have been attracting attention owing to their potential for effective inhibitory action on postprandial hyperglycemia with decreased side effects. Many researchers are actively conducting studies to develop a hypoglycemic agent from natural products and food resources [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. With a solution to the opening of imports in the rice market and changes in consumer perceptions about functional foods, their interest in functional coated rice, where bioactive substances are added gradually to the food, has increased; thus, to improve the quality of life of diabetic patients, the development of functional rice coated with antiglycemic agent has been attempted.</p><p>Intake of high glycemic index (GI) foods is restricted in diabetic patients with high blood glucose, owing to concern about the rapid rise of postprandial glucose. Developing a grain that does not increase blood glucose rapidly, and maintains taste, would have a profound impact on the quality of life of diabetic patients and quasi-healthy individuals (individuals with fasting blood glucose disorder, impaired glucose tolerance, obesity, and hyperlipidemia) and others who are concerned about their blood glucose.</p><p>
<italic>Morus alba</italic> is a deciduous plant belonging to the family Moraceae. Its leaves contain flavonoids, steroids, triterpenes, amino acids, vitamins, and large quantities of minerals. In particular, the N-containing sugar deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) has been separated and identified from the<italic> M. alba</italic> leaf [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As a traditional herbal medicine, it is used to prevent and treat diabetes as well as quench thirst [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The water-soluble fractions of the<italic> M. alba</italic> leaf have been demonstrated to suppress blood glucose levels, via <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucohydrolase suppression and the reduction of blood lipid concentrations [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several biological activities including the antioxidant activity of these water-soluble extracts and animal model have been reported [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition,<italic> Allium cepa</italic> (onion) is a liliaceous biennial plant, which is known to have important biological activities such as the reduction of blood cholesterol, and effects on hypertension and diabetes [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>This study aims to investigate the inhibitory activity of a standardized extract of<italic> M. alba</italic> leaf 50% ethanol extract (SEMA) on <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase, blood glucose reduction in both a normal animal model and a streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetes model, and the acute toxicity, as well as evaluate its postprandial antihyperglycemic effect in impaired glucose tolerance patients and healthy individuals with cooked coated rice (CCR) contained SEMA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Quantification of DNJ in a Standardized Extract of<italic> M. alba</italic> and Stability of Coated Rice after Heat Treatment (Cooking)</title><p>The DNJ content of the SEMA was measured with a method by Kimura et al. with some modification [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The supernatant was obtained via ultrasonic extraction (30&#x02009;min) and centrifugation (7500&#x02009;rpm, 30&#x02009;min) with 50% acetonitrile (pH 5.5). 6.5&#x02009;mM ammonium acetate as an extractant was used as a specimen of an analysis and the DNJ content, a functional component in rice coated with SEMA changed (stability) in the process of cooking, was investigated. A 300&#x02009;mL solution of 50% acetonitrile (pH 5.5) and ammonium acetate (6.5&#x02009;mM) was mixed with the coated rice, and ultrasonic extraction was conducted for 30&#x02009;min. After nitrogen enrichment, the total volume was adjusted to 100&#x02009;mL. After centrifugal separation (7500&#x02009;rpm, 30&#x02009;min), the supernatant was used as a specimen of analysis. To test the component concentrations after cooking, the rice (500&#x02009;g) was first cooked using an electric rice cooker with distilled water (1500&#x02009;mL); considering the weight ratios before and after cooking, the calculation was made by a conversion into the ratio of DNJ content to the weight of the rice. The extraction method was the same as that for the rice. A quantitative analysis of DNJ content was conducted using HPLC. The HPLC equipment consisted of the Agilent 1100 series with the TSK gel Amide-80 column (4.6 &#x000d7; 250&#x02009;mm, 5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m, Tosoh bioscience, Japan) as the column of analysis.

Quantification of DNJ Content in SEMA and the Stability of Coated Rice after Heat Treatment (Cooking)</title><p>In order to quantify the DNJ contained in SEMA, HPLC-ELSD analysis was used. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>, roughly 5.20&#x02009;mg DNJ is contained in 1&#x02009;g of SEMA. DNJ, a known hypoglycemic of the several bioactive substances contained in<italic> M. alba</italic> leaf, is a representative <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase inhibitor that inhibits the enzymatic reactions of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase and mannose dehydrogenase, which decompose the disaccharides maltose, sucrose, and lactose into glucose [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In order to verify the stability of DNJ after cooking, HPLC-ELSD analysis was used. With the DNJ standard preparation, a standard calibration curve of peak area value obtained at each concentration was drawn, and, as a result, a regression equation, <italic>y</italic> = 1020<italic>x</italic> &#x02212; 73.16, and correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic> = 0.999 were obtained. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>, raw coated rice (RCR) contained 12.27&#x02009;mg DNJ per 100&#x02009;g rice, while cooked coated rice (CCR) contained 11.7&#x02009;mg DNJ per 100&#x02009;g rice. DNJ content tended to decrease slightly after cooking, but there was no statistically significant difference. DNJ in the functional rice coated with SEMA did not undergo any significant changes after cooking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. Inhibitory Effect of SEMA on <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-Glucosidase</title><p>An<italic> in vitro</italic> investigation of the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activity of SEMA revealed that it inhibited 83.14% of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase activity at a concentration of 0.8&#x02009;mg/mL, while acarbose used as a positive control inhibited activity at a somewhat lower rate (69.38%). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>, while SEMA and acarbose both inhibited <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, SEMA showed about 4.5 times higher inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub>) at 91.63 and 402.33&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL. SEMA is a preparation containing the highest ratio of<italic> M. alba</italic> leaf 50% ethanol extract, and it is suggested that its high <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activity is attributable to DNJ.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Effect of SEMA on Blood Glucose</title><p>A considerable number of beta cells in the pancreas necrotize owing to the cytotoxic insult by STZ, and it is by the subsequent insulin depletion that hyperglycemia and diabetic phenomena are induced. A small number of beta cells in the pancreatic islet show excessive insulin secretion (early phase) in response to the hyperglycemic environment, but cell proliferation and differentiation are inhibited and the beta cells are exhausted by continued glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. An irreversible deficit of beta cells is caused in the pancreatic islets by this secondary injury caused by glucose toxicity [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, adjusting the blood glucose concentration is an important challenge for maintaining beta cell viability and preventing the progression of diabetes. In the diabetes model induced by STZ, changes in blood glucose after SEMA and starch administration were observed. The body weight of the rats tended to decrease rapidly after administration of STZ in all three groups (data not shown). It is hypothesized that the weight decreased as energy metabolism imbalance was induced by the destruction of pancreatic tissues by STZ administration. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>, if SEMA was administered with starch in the diabetes model, at 60&#x02009;min when the blood glucose of the experimental animals reached its maximum value, blood glucose was maintained at a lower level as compared to that of the control group (478.3&#x02009;mg/dL). In other words, in the STZ-diabetic animal model after the administration of starch, blood glucose rapidly increased to 451.0 and 478.3&#x02009;mg/dL at 30 and 60&#x02009;min, respectively, in the control group, while the SEMA administration group maintained a significantly lower level of blood glucose at 393.0 and 399.3&#x02009;mg/dL (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) over the same time period. Ultimately, the SEMA administration group showed an increase in blood glucose from 451.0 to 478.3&#x02009;mg/dL and 393.0 to 399.3&#x02009;mg/dL at 30 and 60&#x02009;min, respectively. As compared to the control group, there was a blood glucose reduction of 20.1% and 28.8% at 30 and 60&#x02009;min after starch administration. Acarbose showed changes in the blood glucose of 431.2 and 419.5&#x02009;mg/dL at 30 and 60&#x02009;min, respectively, and there was a marked effect on blood glucose reduction, but no significant difference from the control group was observed (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). When the AUC was compared between groups, the SEMA group significantly showed 27.74% reduction (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>3.4. Effect of SEMA on Blood Biomarkers</title><p>The results of a hematological analysis of total protein, albumin, AST, ALT, and creatine are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>. There was significance in the total protein content; it was higher in the SEMA and acarbose administration groups than in the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The albumin concentration followed the total protein results, with no significant difference between the experimental groups. Ju et al. noted that the plasma protein concentration is not easily affected by insulin and reported that the level of plasma protein in a normal rat is similar to that in a diabetic rat [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The level of serum AST activity significantly tended to decrease by 30.52% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and 12.64% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and the level of serum ALT activity tended to significantly decrease by 28.95 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and 9.30% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the SEMA and acarbose administration groups, respectively, as compared to the control group, and statistical significance was confirmed. AST and ALT are discharged out of the cells after hepatocyte damage, increasing their concentration in the blood; hence, they are used as an index of liver injury; the AST and ALT activity increased with STZ administration in the present study and decreased after SEMA administration. The blood creatine concentration was high, but no significant difference was observed. Creatine is measured as indicator reflecting the status of renal function prior to diabetic nephropathy, with creatine being a substance that is generated as a result of the creatine phosphate metabolism in the muscle. Under normal conditions, creatine is isolated from the muscle at a relatively constant speed, so the blood creatine concentration is constant when filtered through the glomerulus and is neither reabsorbed nor metabolized [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In a chronic kidney disease due to diabetes, the glomerular filtration rate decreases and the concentration of blood creatine increases; in the present study, the creatine concentration tended to increase in the diabetes-induced group, but there was no significant difference. The degradation of kidney function can be assumed, but no serious complications appeared.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>3.5. Effect of SEMA on Acute Oral Toxicity</title><p>The LD<sub>50</sub> value is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>. Clinical signs and weight change were observed by conducting an evaluation of the acute toxicity of SEMA through a single-time administration. After administration, rats were observed frequently on the first day, with clinical observation conducted more than once each day. No rats died or demonstrated any specific abnormal symptom over observation for 14 days. At all administration concentrations, no weight change had significance as compared to the control group (CMC), but a certain increase in weight was confirmed. Thus, LD<sub>50</sub> of standardized extract of<italic> M. alba</italic> was demonstrated to be over 2&#x02009;g/kg, and, within this range, no toxicity was observed. Throughout the present study, it was found that glycemic control by SEMA after a meal was caused by suppression of carbohydrate absorption by inhibiting <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase activity, and no toxicity of the extract was observed.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><title>3.6. Impact of SEMA on Changes in Postprandial Glucose in Patients with Impaired Glucose Tolerance</title><p>The seventy subjects were contacted and invited to take part in the trial. A total of seventy subjects attended clinic, five failed to respond to initial contact efforts, four did not attend the appointment, and three have other reasons. Twelve subjects were excluded: three subjects did not meet inclusion criteria, four participants were excluded due to protocol violation, and five subjects were excluded because of injuries and misdiagnoses. Forty-six cases successfully completed the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Changes in blood glucose before and after breakfast in the subjects are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>. There was no difference in the morning fasting glucose levels in the subjects of normal groups and experiment groups, but the level of blood glucose at 30&#x02009;min after a meal of rice coated with SEMA (Exp. A) and cooked rice without SEMA (Exp. B) was 142.17 and 173.47&#x02009;mg/dL, respectively; the blood glucose levels were significantly decreased (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in Exp. A in comparison to Exp. B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>). This difference was maintained 1 or 2&#x02009;h after a meal. In addition, the fasting glucose level was similar in normal groups, but the level of blood glucose at 30&#x02009;min after a meal was not significantly about 11&#x02009;mg/dL lower in Nor. A. When the AUC was compared between groups, Exp. A showed 49.28% reductions, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), compared to Exp. B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>). In the rice coated with SEMA, it was observed that there was a phenomenon in which the rapid rise in blood sugar after meals is effectively controlled. The above method was applied to lunch in the same way, and changes in blood glucose are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(c)</xref>. When blood glucose measured 30&#x02009;min before a meal was compared between Exp. A and B, a high level of blood glucose was maintained at 13&#x02009;mg/dL after breakfast in the Exp. B. Comparison between Exp. A and Exp. B 1&#x02009;h and 2&#x02009;h after lunch showed significantly decreased glucose of about 22&#x02009;mg/dL in Exp. A after 30&#x02009;min (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and this was similar to that observed 30&#x02009;min after breakfast. It was observed that, in control groups, a glucose reduction effect of about 12&#x02009;mg/dL was observed 30&#x02009;min after lunch in group A that took rice coated with SEMA, while there was no difference between the groups 1&#x02009;h or 2&#x02009;h after lunch. While this was a randomized double-blind test, it is judged that SEMA has a clear effect on reducing postprandial glucose.</p><p>
<italic>M. alba</italic> leaves are materials that have been widely used for diabetes and hyperglycemic control. This study found the antidiabetic effectiveness of SEMA. SEMA 1&#x02009;g contains DNJ 5.20&#x02009;mg and it showed about 4 times higher inhibitory activity against car <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase as compared to control medication acarbose. In STZ-diabetic animal model, blood glucose reduction effect was confirmed. In addition, in the acute toxicity evaluation, no toxicity was observed.<italic> M. alba</italic> extracts have been previously reported to have antihyperglycemic effect in STZ-induced diabetic rats [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and in diet-induced obese mice [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and to block inflammatory response in STZ-diabetic mice model [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and in STZ-induced diabetic rats fed high-fat diet [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Among them, Jeszka-Skowron et al. have reported that DNJ may suggest additional roles in the gut to reduce or inhibit intestinal glucose digestion and absorption [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. According to Kimura et al. analysis of the intake of healthy adults (average 25 years old) who were divided into four groups randomly showed that postprandial hyperglycemia was controlled more clearly in the group that took higher amount [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover,<italic> M. alba</italic> leaves have been shown to exhibit antiglycation and antioxidant activity and postprandial hyperglycemia [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These results were shown to be similar to our antihyperglycemic effect.</p><p>In addition, it is very important for persons with glucose tolerance disability or diabetic patients to control their blood sugar so that postprandial glucose does not significantly increase [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For this reason, substances or foods effective for reduction of postprandial glucose can play an important role in the treatment of persons with glucose tolerance disability or diabetic patients. This study investigated the stability of SEMA and postprandial glucose reduction effect on patients with IGTP and a group of normal persons based on the results of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activity of rice (grain) coatings (SEMA) made of standardized extracts and reduction of postprandial glucose in a model of STZ-induced diabetes. As a result, there was no change in the content of DNJ, a functional component of SEMA after cooking, so its stability was confirmed. In addition, in an evaluation of inhibitory effects of SEMA on reduction of postprandial glucose in a group of IGTP and a group of normal persons, there was a clear inhibitory effect of SEMA on postprandial hyperglycemia in both the group of IGTP and the group of normal persons that took SEMA. However, our results have been affected by small number of participants due to participants dropping out. Therefore, our results need more clinical trials which evaluate the diabetic patients including various types (ages, symptoms, and many diabetic patients) to confirm long-term efficacy and safety of<italic> M. alba</italic> in diabetic patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Conclusion</title><p>In summary, considering the present study and previous data, the results suggest that, at least in part,<italic> M. alba</italic> can be used as a nutraceutical agent to ameliorate hyperglycemic effect and can be used as an dietary supplementation for treatment of diabetic patients. Therefore, this study found that the plant extracts SEMA developed as a material for glycemic control have an excellent potential as a material improving postprandial hyperglycemia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2015R1D1A1A01059199) and Hallym University Research Fund (HRF-201607-013).</p></ack><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>Seung Hwan Hwang and Hong Mei Li as well as Jae-Seung Hong and Bo Huang have contributed equally to this work.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moller</surname><given-names>D.
