The vaccine was manufactured in eggs by the Torlak Institute of Virology, Vaccines and Sera, Belgrade, Serbia and contained A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B viruses. The clinical trial took place at the Clinical Center of Serbia in Belgrade. Sixty healthy volunteers, aged 18&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years, were enrolled in the trial. On the day of immunization, volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of the trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of hemagglutinin per strain) or placebo (phosphate-buffered saline). Subjects were monitored for adverse events through a clinical history and physical examination, and blood was taken for testing at screening and on day 8 to assess vaccine safety. Serum samples obtained before and 21&#x000a0;days after immunization were tested for influenza antibody titers using hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) tests. No serious adverse events were reported. Pain and tenderness at the injection site were the most commonly reported symptoms in both vaccine and placebo groups. Overall, serum HAI responses of fourfold or greater magnitude were observed to H1, H3, and B antigen in 80%, 75%, and 70% of subjects, respectively. Seroprotection rates as measured by HAI were also high (100%, 100% and 86.67%, respectively, for H1, H3 and B). Thus, Torlak's seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine was not associated with adverse events, was well-tolerated and immunogenic. It should be further evaluated in clinical trials to provide sufficient safety and immunogenicity data for licensing in Serbia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Seasonal influenza vaccine</kwd><kwd>trivalent inactivated split</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Serbia</kwd><kwd>Torlak</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">WHO</named-content></funding-source><award-id>IDSEP130015-01</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">PATH from the US Department of Health and Human Services/BARDA</named-content></funding-source><award-id>IDSEP130018-01-06</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>Financial support for the study was provided to WHO and to PATH from the US Department of Health and Human Services/BARDA (Grant Numbers: IDSEP130015-01 and IDSEP130018-01-06).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="5"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="19"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza is a significant cause of respiratory morbidity and mortality, with the highest burden of severe disease occurring in at-risk populations.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> In temperate regions, seasonal influenza epidemics occur each year during the winter months, generally between November and April, causing tens of thousands of deaths in Europe alone.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Because of the ability of the influenza virus to mutate, the strains included in seasonal vaccines need to be updated on a regular basis.

It was the first time that a clinical trial for a vaccine was performed in Serbia. PATH and WHO supported initiation of a collaboration between the Serbian Ministry of Health, the national regulatory agency &#x0201c;Medicines and Medical Devices Agency of Serbia (ALIMS)&#x0201d; and Institute Torlak through the WHO Country Office (CO) in Serbia. The goal was to engage in monthly meetings with Torlak and PATH through facilitation by the WHO Serbia office to ensure that the vaccine programme was moving along and any issues were resolved immediately. Capacity building included the strengthening of the ALIMS to assist with vaccines regulation (GMP enforcement of the domestic vaccine manufacturer, approval of clinical trials). Strengthening capacity to conduct clinical trials in Serbia was also provided to ensure that clinical sites assessed would be able to perform the phase 1 clinical trial of Torlak's seasonal influenza vaccine under Good Clinical Practices (GCP). An assessment visit by an independent GCP auditor from Switzerland at the selected clinical site was performed and a Corrective Action Preventive Action (CAPA) plan was shared with the site prior to study initiation. These recommendations were addressed through equipment purchases and specific training activities. WHO/PATH/Torlak developed a crisis communications plan and trained relevant staff for the seasonal vaccine phase 1 trial to deal with any crisis or media enquiries that could have arisen during the trial. Finally, PATH team provided technical assistance to Torlak in all clinical trial documentation preparation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="s0002-0001"><title>Demographic and other baseline characteristics</title><p>Sixty-six (66) volunteers were screened for enrolment in the study.

GMTs at baseline were low and there was no rise in antibodies among those given placebo in either test (point estimate for fold rise for all antigens tested by either test was &#x02264; 1.5). In the HAI assay, the highest GMT was observed for H3 (439.67) and the highest fold rise for H1 (18.49). While the GMT for B antigen was the lowest, it still showed a 7.25-fold increase, from 10.47 (baseline) to 75.95 (post-vaccination). The MN assays showed similar trends with regard to fold changes. However, the strongest GMT response was to B antigen (331.28), followed by H1 (211.12) and H3 (125.53) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0004">Table&#x000a0;4</xref>).

Testing also needs to include individuals at higher risk, such as the elderly, individuals with pre-existing conditions and pregnant women. Such testing can be conducted through post marketing surveillance, once the vaccine has been further evaluated in healthy adults and licensed.</p><p>The results also indicated that the Torlak vaccine is capable of eliciting robust immune responses, both in na&#x000ef;ve subjects and in those previously primed by infection or vaccination.

Similarly, substantial rises in GMTs were observed in the HAI assay in the vaccine group between baseline (pre-immunization) and 21&#x000a0;days after immunization for all three strains, indicating a strong immune response against all three vaccine antigens. GMT ratios (vaccine/placebo) measured by MN assay were also significantly high, the lowest being &#x0003e;4 for the B antigen. Overall, there was a close correlation between HAI and MN results in terms of seroconversion and seroprotection rates and at the individual level.

During the first week following vaccination, subjects were asked to record local and systemic signs and symptoms using pre-printed Memory Aids, a thermometer, and a small ruler. In addition to solicited signs, subjects were asked to report any other adverse events. The volunteers returned to the clinic seven days after vaccination at which time the study staff reviewed the Memory Aids and transcribed all solicited reactogenicity and other adverse events onto the case report forms. At this visit blood was taken for biochemical and hematological blood tests. Participants returned again for the clinic for their final visit on Day 21 post vaccination where blood was taken again for immunogenicity analyses. Participants were followed up for 90&#x000a0;Days post vaccination with a final phone call to volunteers on Day 90 (&#x000b1; 5&#x000a0;days). The schedule of events are shown in (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;1). The vaccine was used in accordance with Research Protocol of Vaccine Clinical Trial, Protocol Number: TORLAK-100.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-0002"><title>Study population</title><p>Sixty-six healthy Serbian male and female adult volunteers aged 18&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years were screened for inclusion in the study. Inclusion criteria were that subjects were literate (by self-report), healthy (as established by the medical history, physical examination, and screening laboratory evaluations), capable and willing to complete a Memory Aid, and willing to return for all follow-up visits. In addition, the women had to have a negative pregnancy test, not be breastfeeding, and be willing to use reliable birth control measures (e.g. intrauterine device, hormonal contraception, condoms) for three weeks from the day of vaccination. Exclusion criteria included: presence of any acute or chronic illness, taking immunoglobulin or medication that could interfere with assessment of safety or immunogenicity, participating in any other clinical trial, hypersensitivity to any vaccine, chicken or egg protein, and drug or alcohol dependence. Subjects who had received influenza vaccine in the previous year were also excluded. Participants needed to be available for vaccination and all follow-up visits.</p><p>This study was approved by the ethics review committees of the Clinical Centre of Serbia, the World Health Organization and the National Regulatory Agency (ALIMS). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before any study-related activities took place.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-0003"><title>Treatments</title><p>Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either vaccine or placebo. The seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine tested was manufactured by the Torlak Institute using embryonated chicken eggs and supplied in prefilled, single-dose, disposable syringes. It was a split virion vaccine, inactivated with Beta-propiolactone (BPL) and the virion split with Triton X-100. The vaccine contained 15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of hemagglutinin antigen of each virus strain recommended for the 2014&#x02013;15 season in the northern hemisphere: X-181 reassortant of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1); X-223A reassortant of A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2), and NYMC BX-51B reassortant of B/Massachusetts/2/2012. The placebo, which was also manufactured by the Torlak Institute, consisted of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, also supplied in prefilled, single-dose, disposable syringes. The vaccine and placebo were stored in a refrigerator at a temperature between 2 &#x000b0;C and 8 &#x000b0;C. The shelf-life was estimated to be 12&#x000a0;months under these conditions. Storage temperature was monitored daily and documented. Back-up power or storage was available in case of primary power failure. The vaccine and placebo syringes were identically packaged and labelled so that the study could be conducted in a double-blind manner. Randomization was performed by an individual not involved in the conduct of the study. In the case of any unblinding, researchers were required to report this in writing to the overseeing Ethics Committee. The allocation code of the product injected into each subject was recorded on the case report form.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-0004"><title>Safety assessment</title><p>Solicited local and systemic reactions and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were collected and recorded. Solicited reactions are local or systemic AEs, typically associated with intramuscular influenza vaccination, that were specifically asked about during the 7-day post-vaccination period. Unsolicited events were reported by the subject or observed by study staff during clinic visits. Such events were recorded up to 21&#x000a0;days post-vaccination, except for serious adverse events (SAEs), which were recorded throughout the entire study period of 90&#x000a0;days. If a new solicited event was reported by the subject more than 7&#x000a0;days post-vaccination, it was recorded as an unsolicited AE. Blood was collected for basic clinical chemistry and hematology at screening and on day 7. Laboratory analyses included bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), creatinine, total protein, white blood cells, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and platelets. All clinically significant laboratory findings were reported as unsolicited adverse events. All clinical safety evaluations were made by a qualified clinician. Any clinical sign, symptom or laboratory finding that at any time met the established criteria for an SAE was categorized as such.</p><p>Any solicited local or systemic reaction that occurred during the 7-day period post-injection was regarded as related to product administration.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the rules for good clinical practice (GCP), including International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines, directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament, and the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Assessment of immunogenicity</title><sec id="s0005-0001"><title>Serum antibodies detected by hemagglutination inhibition</title><p>Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) is the most frequently used serological test for determining immunological responses to influenza vaccination.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Serum specimens obtained before, and 21&#x000a0;days after, vaccination were tested at the Torlak Diagnostic Laboratory for the presence and titer of HAI antibodies to each of the influenza strains in the vaccine. They were re-tested by VisMederi, laboratory (Siena, Italy) using a validated assay. HAI antibody titers to the three influenza antigens (H1, H3 and B) were determined in duplicate on separate days, with paired specimens tested simultaneously. The HAI used 0.5% turkey red blood cells with the three separate antigens. Serum samples were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme and pre-adsorbed on human red blood cells before testing. HAI assays were performed at a starting dilution of 1:10, with subsequent serial twofold dilutions. Each antigen was diluted to eight HA units (with 50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l). Titers were determined by identifying the last well with a total lack of agglutination. If the results for duplicate samples were more than 2-fold different, the test was repeated. Samples for which the titer was greater than the last dilution were diluted further and retested. The final results are given as the reciprocal titer of the lowest duplicate value.</p></sec><sec id="s0005-0002"><title>Serum antibodies detected by microneutralization</title><p>The serum samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to each of the influenza strains in the vaccine using a microneutralization (MN) test. For this, serial dilutions of serum, along with fixed amount of live influenza vaccine virus, were added to a culture of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Virus-infected cells exhibit a cytopathic effect that can be detected by staining. Titers of neutralizing antibodies are expressed as the greatest dilution of serum inducing 50% neutralization of the cytopathic effect in tissue culture (TCID<sub>50</sub>). At the end of the incubation period, each well of the 96-wells microtiter plate is checked under an optical microscope to assess the presence of local lesions (Cytopathic effects &#x02018;CPE&#x02019;) in the cell lawn. Cytopathic effects (CPE) were defined as complete destruction of the cell lawn in the well or the presence of hole(s) in the cell lawn, surrounded by destroyed cells. An incomplete or not overgrown cell lawn with hole(s) surrounded by intact cells is not regarded as CPE. Cell control was characterized by an intact cell lawn, meaning that the cells have not been infected. When compared with the cell control, the wells which show CPE are regarded as &#x0201c;positive&#x0201d; (infected), while the wells which don't show CPE are defined as &#x0201c;negative&#x0201d; (protected).</p><p>The method used to perform the microneutralization test is based on the production of serum dilution series and on the fact that each dilution step of the single serum is repeated in 8 wells into the single microtiter plate (8 repetitions). This results in a very reliable determination of the neutralization titre (Nt).</p><p>The Nt in this particular test is defined as the serum dilution by means of which 50% of the wells are protected against a virus-induced cytopathogenic effect (CPE). The Spearman-K&#x000e4;rber formula is used to calculate the NT, providing correct results where:</p><p>&#x02013; a lowest dilution with 100% protection;</p><p>&#x02013; a highest dilution with 0% protection, and</p><p>&#x02013; at least one dilution with over 0% but less than 100% protection are involved.</p><p>In the event that no well exhibits protection at all (meaning that all wells exhibit CPE) the neutralization titre is determined as the exact half of the titre that would result if one single well was protected.</p></sec><sec id="s0005-0003"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of one dose of the vaccine. The sample size was selected based on logistical considerations. Immunogenicity requirements were not considered in the choice of sample size since this was a secondary objective. Sample size for this study was 60 healthy male and female adults, 18 to 45&#x000a0;years old, 30 subjects per group.</p></sec><sec id="s0005-0004"><title>Safety analysis</title><p>The vaccine safety profile was assessed in terms of the number and percentage of subjects with: (1) adverse events occurring within 30&#x000a0;minutes after vaccination; (2) solicited local and systemic reactions within seven days post-vaccination; (3) unsolicited adverse events within 21&#x000a0;days post-vaccination (including changes in clinical laboratory parameters); and (4) SAEs occurring within 90&#x000a0;days post-vaccination.
