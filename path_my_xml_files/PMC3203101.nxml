The disease is characterized by a reduction in the lubricating and viscoelastic properties of the synovial fluid, accompanied by progressive destruction of the cartilage surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. When simple analgesics, such as acetaminophen, prove ineffective for reducing the pain of OA, the most common therapy for treating the signs and symptoms of OA is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs have proven efficacy for the relief of pain and inflammation of OA, but their use may be restricted by adverse gastrointestinal effects, including serious occurrences of bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Hyaluronic acid present in the synovial fluid and cartilage of the knee imparts viscoelastic properties that allow for the efficient movement of articular joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Hyalgan<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(Fidia, S.p.A., Abano Terme, Italy) is a sodium hyaluronate preparation, with a molecular weight of 500-730 kDa, which is naturally derived from rooster combs and has the same molecular structure as the endogenous hyaluronic acid present in the human body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This sodium hyaluronate restores the viscoelastic properties of the synovial fluid and stimulates synthesis of endogenous hyaluronic acid by synoviocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, this sodium hyaluronate may also mediate therapeutic effects in OA by a number of other biochemical actions within the joint, including the induction of proteoglycan aggregation and proteoglycan synthesis, inhibition of inflammatory mediators, and analgesic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy and tolerability of intra-articular (i.a.) injections of this sodium hyaluronate have been established in many clinical trials conducted worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In a large, controlled clinical trial conducted in the United States, a 5-injection course of sodium hyaluronate was shown to provide effective pain relief for as long as 26 weeks after initiation of the therapeutic course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Accordingly, i.a. injections of sodium hyaluronate are considered by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) to be an alternative to NSAIDs for treatment of pain in patients with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Hyalgan<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1997, and this therapeutic agent is now available in over 43 countries worldwide. However, only one study has been published evaluating this sodium hyaluronate in an Asian population; these investigators found that 4 weekly doses decreased pain and increased mobility over a 49-day follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of this 20-mg/2 mL sodium hyaluronate administered as 5 i.a. injections at weekly intervals, for relieving the pain of OA of the knee in the Asian population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Patients eligible for the study were males or females &#x0003e; 50 years of age, diagnosed with OA of the knee according to ACR criteria (knee pain with one or more of the following conditions: age &#x0003e; 50 years, crepitus, or morning stiffness &#x0003c; 30 minutes in duration). Eligible patients also had radiographic evidence of OA with Kellgren-Lawrence score of II to III (mild to moderate) on x-ray, with predominance in the tibio-femoral compartment and visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores of &#x02265; 40 mm on a 50-foot walking test. It was required that any acute disease or trauma leading to secondary OA must have occurred at least 5 years before study entry. Major exclusion criteria included severe degeneration of the knee joint with marked joint narrowing, varus, or valgus deformity of the knee (&#x0003e; 12&#x000b0;) or other joint deformities, or other joint disorders (eg, inflammatory joint disease, specific arthropathy, severe axis deviations or instabilities, joint or skin infections, joint prostheses of the lower limbs or symptomatic hip).

The study was conducted at 3 hospitals: the National Taiwan University Hospital, the Taipei Medical College Hospital, and the Tri-Service General Hospital, in Taipei, Taiwan. Six investigators enrolled patients. Efficacy was defined as improvement from baseline to Week 25 after initiation of treatment in 100-mmVAS pain on the 50-foot walking test. After a screening period, eligible patients were randomized to 5 weekly injections with either sodium hyaluronate or placebo, and were then evaluated at Week 5, Week 13, and Week 25. Patients who required further pain treatment were permitted to take acetaminophen as needed, but not exceeding 3 g/day. Patients were not permitted to take any acetaminophen on the day before the study visit. Oral and parenteral corticosteroids, i.a. corticosteroid injections, NSAIDs or analgesics other than acetaminophen, topical analgesic preparations, rehabilitation, physical therapy, or acupuncture were not permitted during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition of the primary outcome and the secondary outcome</title><p>The primary efficacy outcome was defined as the change from baseline (Week 0) to Week 25 in patients' evaluation of pain, measured by a 100-mm VAS during the 50-foot walking test (0 = "No Pain" and 100 = "Maximum Pain"). The secondary efficacy measures included: (1) the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) OA scales for pain, stiffness, and physical function, by VAS; (2) time taken in the 50-foot walking test; (3) volume of synovial effusion of the enrolled knee, if present; (4) overall effectiveness evaluated by patients and investigators on a scale of 1 to 6 (1 = Gravely worsened and 6 = Excellent improved); and 5) acetaminophen tablet count.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size</title><p>The sample size required was estimated based on results from the UK study conducted by Huskisson and Donnelly, in which the adjusted means difference between treatment groups for VAS pain on movement at 6 months was equal to 15.04 mm, and the corresponding effect size was equal to 0.52 for completers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Sixty patients in each group were required to ensure adequate power to detect a similar between-groups difference.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Treatment groups were compared with respect to the primary efficacy variable using an analysis of variance, including treatment, investigator, and treatment-by-investigator interaction as factors. The analysis was based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) for patients who did not complete the study. Improvement in WOMAC index and improvement in time taken for the 50-foot walking test were analyzed using the same approach as for the primary variable. Volume of synovial fluid effusion was evaluated using the student's t-test. Patients' and investigators' overall effectiveness evaluations were analyzed by Chi-square test. Between-group comparison for acetaminophen consumption was conducted using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Safety was assessed by adverse events, laboratory findings, and vital signs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient Characteristics and Disposition</title><p>Of 227 patients screened, 200 patients were randomized in the study.

More patients in the placebo group compared with the sodium hyaluronate group experienced at least 1 adverse event (48% versus 39%). The nature of adverse events reported was comparable between these two treatment groups. All reported events were mild or moderate in intensity, and none were considered related to study treatment. The most frequently reported adverse events in both treatment groups were in the respiratory system, the most common of which were acute bronchitis and bronchitis combined, occurring in a total of 10 patients in the study. No patients discontinued from the study because of an adverse event. Five serious adverse events were reported in the study: 3 in the sodium hyaluronate group and 2 in the placebo group. These included a forearm fracture, intestinal obstruction, and aggravated urinary incontinence in the sodium hyaluronate group, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding and joint sprain in the placebo group. All were considered to be unrelated to study treatment.</p><p>A statistically significant treatment difference was seen in change from baseline for platelet counts at Week 5 (p = 0.027), with standardized counts decreasing slightly in the sodium hyaluronate group and increasing slightly in the placebo group. However, this difference was not considered clinically relevant nor was it apparent at other timepoints during the study. No other significant laboratory results or vital signs findings were observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Power of the Current Trial</title><p>Based on the current observed results of primary outcome (change from W0 to W25) and the sample size for each group, this study give a power of 91.3% to identify the change in VAS score between groups.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Hyaluronan (HA), a large glycosaminoglycan composed of repeating disaccharides of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-glucosamine, is a ubiquitous component of the extracellular matrix. Intra-articular (i.a.) injection of HA is now applied worldwide for the treatment of arthritis. The efficacy and tolerability of i.a. injections of Hyalgan<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>have been established in many clinical trials conducted worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, little study has specially addressed in evaluating the effect and safety of this sodium hyaluronate on an Asian population.</p><p>The primary aim of this clinical trial was to study the efficacy and safety of 5 weekly i.a. injections of sodium hyaluronate (Hyalgan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), as compared with the placebo, in Asian patients suffering from OA of the knee. The duration of this study comprised a 5-week treatment period followed by a 20-week follow-up period. The results demonstrate that the Hyalgan treatment group showed a significantly greater improvement from baseline to Week 25 in VAS pain on the 50-foot walking test than the placebo group. Our findings were further supported by a previous pivotal clinical trial involving 218 completed patients (103 for Hyalgan<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>versus 115 for placebo) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. At Week 26 of follow-up, the statistically significant treatment difference for pain intensity on the 50-foot walking test (assessed by a 0-100 mm VAS) was 8.8 mm in favor of sodium hyaluronate, similar to the magnitude of effect seen here (8.07 mm). Their sample size and the result of VAS difference are quite comparable to our study. That means the current study provide a similar power as theirs. As to the sample size and the accepted absolute changes of VAS, Huskisson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] conducted a randomized control trial to examine the efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction of i.a.HA in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. They used a sample size of 50 patients for each group to give a power of around 90% for the detection of a mean treatment change of 15.4 mm in VAS score. In the current study, our sample size is 100 patients for each group that provide a similar power of 91.3% for the detection of mean treatment change of 8.07 mm in VAS score.</p><p>In the present study, the reduction in pain intensity was apparent at one week after the first dose of sodium hyaluronate. This finding was further confirmed by some recent reports. Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] conducted an open-label, randomized, multicentre clinical trial to compare the clinical effects between high and low molecular weight HA. They indicated that the symptom relief could be as soon as one week after HA injection, in terms of significantly reducing the VAS and improving the WOMAC pain, function, and stiffness scores. A similar finding was shown in another clinical trial by Kirchner M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We may attribute the rapid reduction in pain intensity to the mechanism of anti-inflammation through the synovium, which was further supported by a recent review article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the secondary outcome estimated by WOMAC scores, we found that the pain and function sub-scales were significantly reduced as early as at Week 5, by compared with placebo group. Furthermore, the significant difference was maintained throughout the study. As to the subjective evaluations, more patients in the sodium hyaluronate group compared with the placebo group were considered "slightly improved", "improved", or "excellent improved" by both patient's and investigator's judgment of effectiveness at Week 25. These results all imply that i.a. administration of Hyalgan<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>can improve joint function and ameliorate pain in Asian patients with knee osteoarthritis.</p><p>Concerning the estimation of safety, both sodium hyaluronate and placebo were well tolerated in this study. There were no instances of any severe local inflammatory reactions, such as have been reported with growing frequency in the literature for another hyaluronate product, hylan G-F 20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Aside from an apparently isolated difference between the treatment groups in platelet counts at Week 5 (not clinically significant), no changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, pulse rate, or body temperature were observed in either treatment group.</p><p>In the present study, efficacy of sodium hyaluronate, as measured by the primary outcome variable, did not show signs of waning at the 25-week timepoint. Therefore, we might have seen a longer-term benefit of this sodium hyaluronate had the follow-up period been extended. This finding of a relatively long-term pain relief is also consistent with findings of controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials that found continuing benefits with sodium hyaluronate treatment for at least 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and, in some cases, for 1 or more years after completion of the treatment course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>To sum up, our results showed that a 5-injection course of this sodium hyaluronate was effective, in terms of a significantly greater improvement from baseline to Week 25 in VAS score, WOMAC pain and function score than the placebo group. The whole course was safe and well tolerated both in sodium hyaluronate treatment group and the placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrated that intra-articular administration of Hyalgan<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is safe and can improve joint function and ameliorate pain in Asian patients with knee osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.</p><p>TL H drafted the manuscript, interpreted of data and participated in its design and coordination.
