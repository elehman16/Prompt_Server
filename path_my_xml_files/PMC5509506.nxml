Deficiency of vitamin D contributes to many diseases that involve systemic or CNS inflammation, and vitamin D deficient adults have worse outcomes after stroke (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Most vitamin D studies in neonates have focused on its role in mineral metabolism. Little is known about vitamin D status, immunomodulatory function, or effects of hypothermia on vitamin D binding protein (DBP) in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).</p><p id="P6">The significance of vitamin D as an immunomodulator and regulator of pro-inflammatory Th17 lymphocytes has been well established in adult stroke. Adult patients have demonstrated an increased proportion of Th17 lymphocytes within 24 hours (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and one week after stroke (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). These findings may be pertinent to neonatal HI, as na&#x000ef;ve T cells develop into Th17 cells more readily in infants than adults, and may contribute to neonatal inflammatory response to HI injury (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Vitamin D has been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory Th17 differentiation and proliferation, and IL-17 cytokine production (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), while promoting anti-inflammatory IL-10 and T regulatory cells (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, vitamin D degradation is increased in neuroinflammation (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), which may limit its effect as a Th17 immunomodulator after HI. In addition, vitamin D deficiency (&#x0003c;20 ng/ml) and insufficiency (&#x0003c;30 ng/ml) is widespread in human neonates (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In the only other report on vitamin D status in neonatal HIE, Mutlu et al. demonstrated lower serum 25(OH) vitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in 31 cooled HIE infants in Turkey compared with healthy term control infants (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In this study all HIE infants had serum 25(OH)D &#x0003c; 20ng/ml on day of life 1, and 30% infants had persistently low serum 25(OH)D on day 5.</p><p id="P7">Circulating concentrations of prohormone 25(OH)D are important for the maintenance of CNS concentrations of active 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D), which is synthesized in many extra-renal cells, including neuronal and glial cells that contain 1-&#x003b1;-hydroxylase (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Thus, serum concentrations of 25(OH)D may be crucial for vitamin D&#x02019;s neuroprotective and immune functions after HI injury, in addition to endocrine roles in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). We hypothesized that vitamin D metabolism would be increased with neonatal HIE, and that low serum 25(OH)D concentrations would adversely affect Th17 cytokines. We further hypothesized that hypothermia therapy would alter vitamin D metabolism and specific cytokines involved in Th17 activation. Using samples from neonates with moderate to severe HIE in the first 3 days after HI birth, we explored 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D serum concentrations, vitamin D binding proteins (DBP and albumin), and circulating cytokines related to Th17 function in addition to calcium and phosphorus relationships.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>METHODS</title><p id="P8">We investigated serum 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, DBP, albumin, Th17 related cytokines, calcium, and phosphorus concentrations in serum samples stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C from a multicenter randomized trial of systemic hypothermia in neonates with HIE (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This study was approved by Institutional Review Boards at all seven participating centers (Medical University of South Carolina, Eastern Virginia Medical School, University of Virginia, Albany Medical Center, State University of New York, Medical College of Georgia, and University of Saskatchewan). Entry criteria and demographic data of this cohort have been published in detail (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).

Concentrations were based on 5 parameter logistic fit of a 7 point standard curve. Serum levels of IL-17F, IL-22, IL-23, and TNF-&#x003b2; were below detectible limits, and IL-21 was only analyzed up to 12h due to low numbers of patients with detectible levels after this time.</p><p id="P10">25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels were measured in available samples from 0&#x02013;72h after hypothermia initiation using a rapid, direct radioimmunoassay in Dr. Hollis&#x02019; laboratory with a lower limit of detection of 2ng/ml for 25(OH)D and 15pg/ml for 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, as previously described (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).

Lower limit of detection of the DBP assay was 6.5ng/ml. On a subset of samples (n=17) from HIE infants at the Medical University of South Carolina, we performed a chart review and determined daily vitamin D intake in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for the first 72h (pediatric multivitamins, ergocalciferol 400 IU/day =10 mcg/day or 417 ng/h).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Clinical Labs</title><p id="P11">Cord or initial neonatal gases were obtained at or within 1h of birth (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).

Total serum calcium was positively predicted by serum 25(OH)D at 0h (p=0.034), but not at 48 and 72h, perhaps due to intravenous calcium replacement therapy in 35 infants to correct initial hypocalcemia. Serum phosphorus was positively predicted by serum 25(OH)D concentration after pH had normalized at 48 and 72h (p&#x02264;0.025). This data suggests that vitamin D&#x02019;s role in phosphorus homeostasis is functional 2&#x02013;3 days after HI birth.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Survival relates to serum Phosphorus but not 25-OH Vitamin D</title><p id="P28">Infants who died in the neonatal period had significantly lower pH (p=0.0002) and higher serum phosphorus over the 72h study period than those who survived (p=0.00006, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>) with a survivaltime interaction for serum phosphorus (p=0.041).

Therefore, serum 25(OH)D did not demonstrate a direct relationship with survival in this cohort of infants with severe HIE, and the sample size was too limited for further analysis of developmental outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S17"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P30">25(OH)D insufficiency was present in the majority of our HIE infants, and half of these infants had decreasing 25(OH)D over the initial 72h of treatment, in spite of administration of 417ng/h ergocalciferol in TPN, which did not appreciably increase serum 25(OH)D concentrations. This data agrees with findings in a Turkish cohort of hypothermic mild to moderate HIE infants, in whom the incidence of serum 25(OH)D &#x0003c;5ng/ml increased from day 1 to 5, and was significantly greater at day 5 than in the healthy term controls (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In our cohort, hypothermia treatment did not affect either 25(OH)D or 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D serum concentrations compared to normothermic infants.</p><p id="P31">Vitamin D is a well-known regulator of inflammatory Tcells, and inhibits Th17 cell activation(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In our neonates low serum 25(OH)D was associated with reduced anti-inflammatory IL-17E after HIE. Another anti-inflammatory cytokine that may oppose Th17-induced inflammation, IL-27 was also correlated with 25(OH)D levels in normothermic HIE infants, providing additional evidence that vitamin D insufficient infants may have limited ability to mitigate post-HI Th17 inflammation. However, even in the face of low serum 25(OH)D, hypothermia treated patients had increased IL-27, indicating direct modulation of this serum cytokine by hypothermia treatment (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These data suggest the immunoregulation of TH17 activation after HIE depends on the mediator, with IL-17E primarily affected by vitamin D deficiency, while IL-27 was primarily affected by hypothermia therapy.</p><p id="P32">Serum 25(OH)D also serves as the main source for local CNS production of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D. Similar to our study in neonates with HIE, serum 25(OH)D concentrations are known to decrease after stroke in adults (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Although serum 25(OH)D has a two week half-life under physiologic conditions (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), inflammation contributes to accelerated depletion of serum 25(OH)D, which in turn limits 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D production by leukocytes and neural cells (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The net effect of increased vitamin D metabolism in inflamed CNS tissue is to reduce the circulating substrate, 25(OH)D (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), while circulating 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D may initially be more stably maintained.</p><p id="P33">Urinary losses may contribute to low or decreasing serum 25(OH)D concentrations in HIE infants. HI-induced renal injury is common, involves tubular dysfunction with proteinuria, and takes days to resolve. Renal reabsorption of 25(OH)D-bound DBP occurs in proximal tubular cells upon binding to megalin, a transmembrane receptor found on many cell types, including brain capillary endothelial cells, neurons and astrocytes (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Ischemia reperfusion down-regulates renal megalin expression (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), which may result in excessive urinary losses of vitamin D and DBP (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). As DBP binds 25(OH)D with higher affinity than 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, renal injury after HI birth may not have the same effect on serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In fact, the tight correlation of serum 25(OH)D and DBP at 0&#x02013;12h is consistent with either urinary loss of the bound 25(OH)D or tissue distribution. One of the limitations of this study is a lack of urine samples to verify urinary losses of DBP and 25(OH)D in our patients.</p><p id="P34">Taken together, our data and other studies of vitamin D in stroke suggest that HI injury increases the conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, and both 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and 25(OH)D may be subject to increased degradation as shown post-stroke and in neuroinflammatory conditions (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Along with increased urinary losses (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), uptake of 25(OH)D into tissues for intracellular production of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, may also contribute to low and declining 25(OH)D serum concentrations (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Although we did not obtain serum samples from time points later than 72h, with evidence of insufficient serum 25(OH)D levels regardless of 25(OH)D supplementation, it is possible that at some point in the first days or week of life, the uptake of 25(OH)D and conversion to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D in neural and immune cells may be compromised in some HIE infants.</p><p id="P35">25(OH)D insufficiency is under-recognized in HIE, and is not part of standard of care HIE protocols in research or clinical practice(<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Our data indicate the vitamin D insufficiency is present in more than 70% of HIE infants on admission, and may not be significantly improved by vitamin D supplementation in TPN. Both human and animal investigations indicate that pre-existing vitamin D deficiency exacerbates neurological injuries, and severe 25(OH)D deficiency is associated with increased stroke risk and worse outcomes in both adult humans and rodent models (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Even in the absence of HI, vitamin D deficiency during a critical perinatal window in rodent models results in behavioral and learning deficits (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Thus, 25(OH)D insufficiency could be an aggravating factor after neonatal HIE. Although 25(OH)D concentrations were not independently associated with survival in our infants, only 2 of our infants had 25(OH)D levels &#x02265; 30ng/ml, and we were not able to analyze neurodevelopmental outcomes by degree of 25(OH)D insufficiency due to sample size. Vitamin D effects may also have been overshadowed by the marked severity of HI injury in this cohort, with greater than 70% of infants with severe HIE.</p><p id="P36">By convention we define &#x02018;sufficiency&#x02019; and &#x02018;insufficiency&#x02019; for circulating 25(OH)D levels according to previous reports in neonatal blood using established endocrine concentrations for bone growth and homeostasis (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, the circulating levels of 25(OH)D that are sufficient or deficient for neurodevelopment or other intracrine roles after injury have yet to be determined. Circulating 25(OH)D concentrations required for immune function appear to be significantly higher than for bone homeostasis (20 ng/ml) and prevention of rickets (10 ng/ml) (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In addition, the relationship of DBP and whether it limits the tissue bioavailability of free, unbound 25(OH)D in the serum or enhances uptake in disease states, such as neonatal HI, have not been explored (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). DBP also has independent roles as a macrophage activating factor and scavenger of extracellular actin, unrelated to its vitamin D ligand function, and seems to be independently regulated by hypothermia at 36h, as we have shown with other serum chemotactic factors (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p id="P37">Vitamin D deficiency can result in increased Th17 cell activation (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), while treatment with vitamin D down-regulates Th17 activation (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In HIE neonates, 25(OH)D levels correlated with circulating Th17 inhibitory cytokines IL-17E and IL-27, but for IL-27, this effect was overridden by hypothermia treatment itself. Hypothermia up-regulated anti-inflammatory IL-27 production and release from antigen presenting cells in the serum from 36 to72h, even while the total circulating leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts were decreasing (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Thus, increased circulating anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17E and IL-27, may contribute to the neuroprotective mechanisms of hypothermia and yet be impacted by 25(OH)D levels.</p><p id="P38">In conclusion, this study provides insights into 25(OH)D insufficiency and effects in infants with HIE and under hypothermic conditions over the first 72 hours. Without routine monitoring, vitamin D insufficiency goes largely undiagnosed in neonatal HIE. Our data indicate that 25(OH)D insufficiency is common on admission and may decline further during the acute phase after HI injury. As treatment with vitamin D has been shown to provide neuroprotection in animal models of neonatal HI and in a small pilot trial in human adults after stroke(<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), the potential for beneficial effects of vitamin D replacement in this at risk population deserve further study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S18"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media xlink:href="NIHMS849251-supplement-supplement_1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e699" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke R01 NS38602.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN2"><p><bold><italic>Disclosure Statement:</italic></bold> The authors have nothing to disclose.</p></fn><fn id="FN3"><p>This work was published in abstract form and presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies Annual Meeting.
