As time pressure increases as a result of high workload and decreased resources, there is a need to examine how adherence to guidelines is affected.</p><p>Evidence from the cognitive sciences suggests that in situations with high time pressure or increased ambiguity, experts use intuitive decision-making strategies rather than structured approaches.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> It is therefore more likely for practicing physicians to rely on intuitive processes rather than evidence-based information, when formulating a decision under time pressure. In addition, evidence from psychological studies has systematically shown that time pressure influences risk assessment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3 R4 R5">3&#x02013;5</xref> the ability to learn<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> and complex cognitive processing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Under time pressure, individuals process information faster, while use of analytic thinking is reduced.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Additionally, when faced with time-constraint conditions, individuals rely more often on emotional cues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></p><p>Several studies have suggested that time pressure is one of the most important barriers to the use of evidence-based medicine in primary care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> A systematic review on observational studies showed that longer consultations were associated with reduced medication prescriptions and increased advice on lifestyle changes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Similarly, Tamblyn <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> showed that general practitioners (GPs) tend to prescribe inappropriate medications during shorter office visits. The study of Campbell <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> showed that the most powerful predictor of the quality of management of chronic disease was the length of the consultation.</p><p>Although the above studies suggest a possible link between time pressure and evidence-based practice, their predictive validity is restricted by the fact that time pressure was assessed using self-reports or observational methods. In addition, shorter time visits were treated as synonymous to time pressure. To our knowledge, there is no experimental study on how time pressure impacts on physicians adherence to guidelines.</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine the influence of time pressure on GPs&#x02019; adherence to guidelines concerning: history taking, clinical examination and advice giving.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Research design</title><p>To increase power and decrease the error variance associated with differences among doctors, a within-subjects experimental design was used. Participants were assigned to two experimental conditions (time pressure vs no time pressure) consecutively. In each condition, participants were presented with two scenarios involving virus respiratory tract infections (RTIs). They were asked to respond to questions concerning medical history taking, clinical examination, referrals for lab tests, likelihood and certainty of final diagnosis, and treatment recommendations. In the experimental condition participants were given a specific time for each question. Participants in the control condition received no time constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013002700F1">figure 1</xref>). In order to avoid the effects of learning associated with within-subjects&#x02019; designs, the counterbalancing technique was used to define the order of presentation of each condition.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013002700F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Experimental design and procedure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013002700f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Clinical scenarios</title><p>For the purposes of the study, four clinical scenarios concerning the diagnosis and treatment of virus RTIs were developed, using expert focus groups.

Participants were recruited using an advertisement in the electronic newsletter of the General Practitioner Society of Thessaloniki, Greece. They were invited to participate in a study concerning medical decision making in general practice. Of the 198 GPs working in primary healthcare in the Thessaloniki metropolitan area, 73 responded to the advertisement and finally 34 participated in the study. In total, 38% of participants were male, while the mean age of participants was 38.41&#x02005;years (SD=0.97).

Participants were informed about the procedure and instructed to respond to the questions in the same way they would manage a patient in their daily practice. Demographic information was collected before the experiment. During the experiment, information on the presenting case appeared on the screen gradually followed by each question (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013002700F1">figure 1</xref>).

The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>tests also compared the two conditions in terms of the correct diagnosis as well as confidence associated with the diagnostic decision.</p><p>Second, the number of correct responses in each phase were added for each participant to produce four continuous indicators, namely, number of questions asked on present illness (range 0&#x02013;10), number of signs sought in clinical examination (range 0&#x02013;6), number of times lifestyle advice was given (range 0&#x02013;3) and number of other necessary advice (range 0&#x02013;2).

p=0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study examined the influence of time pressure on compliance with national guidelines, and diagnostic certainty.</p><p>Overall, GPs&#x02019; adherence to guidelines in the management of viral RTIs was low in both the experimental conditions regarding history taking, and advice concerning lifestyle. This is in agreement with previous studies indicating that evidence-based guidelines, are still not being adequately implemented in daily clinical practice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> It is also related to the shift of modern medical practice towards more technocratic models of diagnosis and treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></p><p>However, under time pressure, participants were asked less questions concerning symptoms of the presenting illness, and conducted less-thorough clinical examinations, as indicated by the national guidelines. For example, participants were less likely to ask about consciousness disorders during history taking, and less likely to examine the nervous system during the clinical examination, to exclude the possibility of meningitis. Since symptoms of viral respiratory infection (VRIs) can also be the presenting symptoms of both types of meningitis (bacterial and viral) the Greek Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Infectious Diseases, have included investigation of consciousness disorders, and nervous system examination as standard practice of the medical consultation. Failure to differentially diagnose meningitis can seriously compromise patient's safety. This finding suggests that under time pressure GPs were more likely to overlook less-frequent conditions (availability heuristic).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> This tendency could have been exacerbated by the fact that the study was conducted during the time of influenza pandemic in Greece.</p><p>In addition, under time pressure participants were less compliant with guidelines on giving advice on lifestyle, especially, concerning smoking habits. This finding is in accordance with a study by Wilson <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> showing that when the consultation time was increased, advice on smoking cessation, and alcohol reduction was more frequent. Failure to give advice on lifestyle changes compromises patient's recovery, especially, since evidence shows that in terms of treating VRIs lifestyle advice including smoking cessation, and increased fluid intake is the main treatment option.</p><p>Time pressure did not increase the ordering of diagnostic tests, a finding which is in contradiction with previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> This could be because of the fact that in previous studies simulated patients were used instead of clinical scenarios, which increases the fear of malpractice and the tendency for defensive medicine. It could also be attributed to the content of the scenarios themselves which was consistent and therefore not requiring further testing.</p><p>In terms of diagnostic decisions no differences were observed between the two experimental conditions in terms of diagnostic accuracy. However, under time pressure participants felt less confident with their diagnosis. These findings are in accordance with studies showing that time pressure has a strong negative effect on information seeking, while diagnosis confidence was negatively related to the amount of information accessed in an experimental study in airplane pilots.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study used an experimental design based on clinical scenarios. However, decisions taken in everyday clinical practice are more complex, and influenced by a multitude of explicit and implicit factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> The use of simulated patients instead of clinical scenarios would have increased the ecological validity of the study. Another limitation concerns the nature of the scenarios used. RTIs represent routine clinical cases with limited management options. It is possible that the effect of time pressure on guidelines adherence and on diagnostic accuracy, would have been more pronounced in more clinical ambiguous situations. Further research, using a broader content of clinical cases is needed in order to investigate the effect of time pressure on GP's diagnostic accuracy and confidence. Given that guideline adherence is a complex psychological phenomenon shaped by the individual as well as by the context, future research should further examine the reasons of non-adherence to guidelines. For example, the concept rule violation could provide an interesting framework for examining the role of high expertise, lack of rule relevance or situation constraints on non-adherence in a time pressure situation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> The present study showed that under time pressure, adherence to guidelines concerning history taking and advice giving is compromised. In an attempt to decrease the effects of time pressure on healthcare delivery, it has been suggested that consultation times should be increased, especially in primary care. However, despite the fact that there is a tendency to increase consultation time in some countries (ie, UK)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> this is not a standard practice mainly because of the associated financial cost. For example, in a study conducted by Deveugele <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> in primary care settings across six European countries, it was shown that the mean length of consultation decreased by about 6.5&#x02005;s for every increase of 10 contact units a week in a doctor's workload. In addition, evidence on the effect of extending consultation times on health outcomes and patient satisfaction is limited and contradicting. A recent systematic review of Wilson and Childs (2009)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> concluded that several aspects of doctors&#x02019; behaviour (prescribing, referral, investigation and reconsultation) remain unchanged, despite major changes in appointment length.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> However, the small number of the studies included in the above review and their methodological limitations do not allow drawing a safe conclusion for the link between consultation times and quality of care. Consultation time may play a major core role in patients with psychological problems or comorbidities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></p><p>Overall, simply increasing consultation times is not enough to decrease the effects of time pressure. This is also owing to the increased workload, and decreased resources which significantly increase the pressures of clinical practice in primary care. It is therefore important to safeguard the accuracy and efficiency of the diagnostic and treatment process, in order to reduce medical errors and increase patient's safety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e188" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002700.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e189" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002700.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> For the preparation of this paper, PE designed the study, supervised the data analysis and interpretation of results.
