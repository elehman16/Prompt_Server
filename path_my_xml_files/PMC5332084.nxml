In most of the western hemisphere, patients are typically treated with in-center hemodialysis, delivered in 4-hour treatment sessions thrice weekly.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> There is a high cost associated with delivering dialysis and it has continued to rise; it now exceeds Can $80,000 per patient per year, and comprises more than 2% of the health care budget. These costs are even more impressive when one considers that only 0.1% of Canadians have kidney failure.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Over the past 2 decades, there has been a strong trend toward earlier initiation of dialysis (that is, starting dialysis at a higher level of remaining kidney function) in patients whose kidneys are progressively failing (ie, progressive chronic kidney disease [CKD]).<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In a recent Canadian study that examined trends in dialysis initiation, the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at initiation of dialysis increased from 9.3 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in 2001 to 10.2 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in 2007, and the secular increase in the starting eGFR has continued. Similarly, the proportion of patients starting dialysis &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; (defined in clinical trials by an eGFR &#x0003e; 10.5 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) increased from 28% to 36% in the same time period, and is now greater than 40%.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> After accounting for patient characteristics that influence dialysis initiation, it is estimated that the average patient started dialysis approximately 5 months (147 days) earlier in 2007 when compared with 1997. For patients older than 75 years who represent the fastest growing segment of the dialysis population, this mean difference in timing was estimated at 8 months (233 days).<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>There are several proposed reasons for the trend toward earlier initiation of dialysis. Most focus on the aging population of patients with advanced CKD and suggest that the frail elderly patient with multiple comorbid conditions develops symptoms that mimic uremia (eg, fatigue and lower appetite), for which dialysis therapy is offered.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> As such, these patients are early starts and have a worse prognosis, in large part due to their underlying age and comorbidity.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In fact, mounting evidence from multiple observational studies and a large randomized trial indicates that the early initiation of dialysis may be harmful or at minimum not beneficial.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="bibr12-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr13-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>It is important to appreciate that the general trend toward earlier initiation of dialysis may not be uniform across all jurisdictions. Recently, we conducted a large retrospective cohort study examining the variation in the timing of dialysis initiation across Canada.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Although adjustments for case mix and other patient- and dialysis facility-level characteristics decreased the magnitude of the between-center variation, a significant effect remained. These results suggest that some centers are more likely to initiate dialysis earlier in patients than others, and this tendency cannot be explained by measured characteristics of both patients and their dialysis facilities.</p><p>In early 2014, the Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN), in collaboration with the Canadian Kidney Knowledge Translation and Generation Network (CANN-NET), developed and published the first Canadian guideline on the timing of dialysis initiation.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The principle recommendation of the guideline was adoption of an intent-to-defer strategy for the initiation of chronic dialysis: Patients older than 18 years with an eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> are to be monitored closely by a nephrologist, and dialysis initiated with the first onset of a clinical indication or a decline in eGFR less than or equal to 6 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. This recommendation weighed the evidence from the observational studies and the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) randomized trial, and concluded that early initiation of dialysis was not beneficial for patient outcomes or system resources.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The guideline was delivered as a strong recommendation supported by evidence of moderate quality.

A cluster randomized design was chosen for multiple reasons, including practical/administrative convenience of applying the active KT intervention, and reducing the potential for treatment contamination. We chose to stratify clusters based on region to account for additional clustering within regions and to facilitate subgroup analyses. We also chose to stratify clusters based on facility size in order to ensure balance across the 2 arms of the trials because facility size may be associated with the outcome of interest.</p><p>Given the publication of the IDEAL Study,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and the release of the CSN timing of dialysis guideline,<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> which is available to all clinics, we will evaluate secular trends in dialysis initiation in both groups using an interrupted time series design as a sensitivity analysis.

To adjust for individual and cluster level covariates as well as correlation within clusters, we will use generalized estimating equations to obtain the population average effect of the intervention in the presence of clustering. To assess the intervention by cluster, we can implement a multilevel (hierarchical) model, which provides a random effect for each cluster. Subgroup analysis will be conducted for patients who start dialysis in the first 6 months post intervention versus the remainder of the study period to determine if the effectiveness of the active KT intervention changes over time. For continuous outcomes (such as mean eGFR at dialysis initiation), mixed-effects generalized linear models will be utilized. These models will allow us to examine the effects of the active KT intervention, while adjusting for potential confounding variables and accounting for the clustering of observations within dialysis facilities.

In particular, the effect of audit and feedback in reducing practice pattern variation (median 4.3% [0.5%-16%] absolute increase in health care provider compliance with desired practice) for management of chronic conditions (nondialysis) has been well validated in recent Cochrane reviews.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Meta-regression from these reviews shows that audit and feedback is most effective when baseline performance is low, the source is a supervisor or colleague, it is delivered in both verbal and written formats, and when it includes both explicit targets and an action plan.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, detailing by a medical expert/key opinion leader has been shown to greatly enhance the effect of audit and feedback interventions, and there is an evidence base for local opinion leaders being important in KT.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Given the collective support, we believe our active KT intervention (which addresses patient, health care provider, and system-level factors) is likely to be effective in reducing the proportion of early dialysis starts, when compared with the control group, and that an absolute reduction of 10% in early dialysis starts is justified.</p><p>We acknowledge that the study has limitations, with the first being the passive dissemination of the guideline through publication. The Canadian clinical practice guideline recommending an intent-to-defer strategy for dialysis initiation has been published in CMAJ.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> If the guideline is widely adopted, it may decrease the proportion of early starts in the control group. In addition, practices may have changed even before guideline publication as a result of the publication of the IDEAL Study. To account for the possible change in physician/team behavior due to peer-reviewed publication alone (ie, without a KT strategy), we will examine trends in dialysis initiation in both groups using an interrupted time series design as a sensitivity analysis. A second limitation is that the lead-time and survivor bias favors delayed dialysis initiation. It is possible that early initiation is associated with harm as patients with advanced CKD and patients with a delayed initiation plan may die before starting dialysis, and therefore only survivors are able to defer dialysis initiation. However, we believe this to be improbable, given that the IDEAL Study did not find any evidence of harm with an intent-to-defer strategy.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Nonetheless, we will examine for unintended consequences of an intent-to-defer strategy (crash starts) and hospitalizations and death predialysis with our outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2054358116665257" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Another factor to consider is the potential occurrence of a rapid decline in early starts in the active KT intervention group, followed by regression of intervention effect. It is possible that there will be an acute decline in early dialysis starts in the months immediately following the medical detailing visit, with a dissipation of the effect over time. As such, we have incorporated multiple follow-ups from the KT broker, identified a local champion at each site, and will analyze the rate of change in early dialysis starts as a secondary efficacy outcome.</p><p>With the successful completion of this study, there will be potential economic, health, and scientific benefits. If the active KT intervention is shown to be effective in reducing early dialysis starts, we can implement it nationally within 12 months of trial completion, and therefore successfully translate our findings. A modest impact of a 10% absolute risk reduction in early starts will yield a minimum cost savings of Can$12 million from a payer perspective annually. These cost savings would be primarily driven by a reduction in dialysis days from later dialysis starts, which have major implications on patient morbidity, mortality, and health-related quality of life. Also, other aspects of clinical practice, such as appropriateness of care, may be evaluated in the future to yield further cost savings. Finally, our study will provide a framework for future KT interventions and will have utilized a novel and important national network of CKD clinics across Canada. The study will demonstrate how such a network can be used and how it has the potential to transform the kidney clinical research environment in Canada.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Selina Allu and Sarah Gil (Division of Nephrology, Health Sciences Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada) and Michelle Di Nella (Chronic Disease Innovation Centre, Seven Oaks General Hospital, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) for conducting and/or assisting with study activities.
