Towards a human adjuvant therapy to decrease non-unions, we evaluated rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> safety and efficacy in a clinically relevant canine femoral allograft model. Adult female mongrel hounds (n = 20) received a 5cm mid-diaphyseal osteotomy reconstructed with a plated allograft, and were randomized to: 1) Placebo (n = 5; daily saline), 2) Continuous rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> (n = 7; 5 &#x003bc;g/kg/day s.c. from day 1&#x02013;55 post-op), or 3) Delayed rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> (n = 8; 5 &#x003bc;g/kg/day s.c. from day 14&#x02013;28 post-op). Safety was assessed by physical behavior and blood calcium monitoring. Cone beam CT (CB-CT) was performed on days 14, 28 and 56 post-op to assess 2D cortical healing, 3D bone volume, and Union Ratio. Biomechanical testing and dynamic histomorphometry were also performed. The high drug dose was poorly tolerated, as most dogs receiving rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> had to be given intravenous saline, and one dog died from hypercalcemia. Continuous rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> significantly increased 2D healing and callus volumes at 4-weeks versus Placebo, and sustained the significant increase in cortical union at 8-week (p&#x0003c;0.05). These rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> effects were confirmed by histomorphometry, revealing significant increases in mineral apposition rates (MAR) on host bone and graft-host junctions (p&#x0003c;0.05). Delayed rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> significantly increased callus volume and MAR at 8 weeks (p&#x0003c;0.05). Although no biomechanical differences were observed, as expected for early healing, the results demonstrated that 2D RUST scoring significantly correlated with torsional biomechanics (p&#x0003c;0.01). In conclusion, 8-weeks of intermittent high-dose rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> treatment significantly increases callus formation and accelerates bony union of intercalary massive allografts in a clinically relevant canine model, but with serious side-effects from hypercalcemia.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 AR069655</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>Edward M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 AR054041</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>Edward M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DE019902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>Edward M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AR070613</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>Edward M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (grant no.

Despite surgical advances, transplantation of massive allografts remains a general orthopaedic procedure due to graft availability, and donor site morbidity issues with the other approaches [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185446.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, the quest for a practical adjuvant therapy remains a high priority. One possibility is teriparatide (recombinant parathyroid hormone<sub>1-34</sub> (rPTH<sub>1-34</sub>), which is FDA-approved for the treatment of osteoporosis) [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which has been investigated in normal facture healing, delayed unions and non-unions [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, a recent systematic review of these clinical studies concluded that evidence of efficacy remains anecdotal [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, many groups have demonstrated significant rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> effects on bone healing in various small animal models [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], with high doses (~100x the FDA approved 20 &#x003bc;g (~0.3&#x003bc;g/kg/day) subcutaneous dosing regimen for osteoporosis therapy). Interestingly, we failed to see efficacy with lower doses, and observed that only 2-weeks (days 14&#x02013;28 post-op) of high dose therapy was necessary to see significant healing in a murine femoral allograft model [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. High doses (5 &#x003bc;g/kg/day) were also needed for efficacy in canine models of implant fixation, bone grafting, and prosthesis osteointegration [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, given that canines are an ideal large animal model of massive allografting due to the clinical significance of veterinary care for osteosarcoma, and this species is known to be particularly sensitive to PTH-induced hypercalcemia [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], formal safety and efficacy studies of high dose rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> are warranted.</p><p>Another major challenge is the lack of a clinically relevant, translational, and objective outcome measure to prove massive allograft healing, which in animals is primarily assessed by ex vivo torsion testing. Since this cannot be performed on humans, most clinical studies use subjective semi-quantitative radiology (union of 3 or 4 cortices from x-rays) as their primary outcome measure [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185446.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To improve this, we developed the 3D-CT based Union Ratio, which quantifies connectivity between the host and allograft bone, and correlates with the torsional biomechanics of murine femoral allografts [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185446.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We also demonstrated the utility of the Union Ratio to assess biomechanical healing of canine femoral allografts, and corroborate the results with dynamic histomorphometry [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185446.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Based on these advances, we hypothesized that high dose intermittent rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> therapy following massive allografting: 1) is well tolerated, 2) significantly increases callus volume and accelerates host-allograft healing, and 3) only needs to be given from 2 to 4 weeks post-op to achieve maximum efficacy. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of continuous rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> therapy (every day follow surgery), and delayed-short course rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> therapy (daily from 2-weeks to 4-weeks after surgery), versus placebo, on radiographic, biomechanical and histological healing of a 5cm mid-diaphyseal intercalary allograft over 8-weeks, in a canine femur critical defect model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol (UCAR 2012&#x02013;027) was approved by the University Committee on Animal Resources of the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY. All surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. The canines were housed as a group before surgery under the consideration of the sociality of the animal, but housed separately after surgery to avoid excessive stress on the affected limb. Skeletally mature mongrel hounds (n = 20, 23.0 &#x000b1; 1.5 Kg) were purchased from Marshall BioResources (Hamilton, NY, USA), and their general good health was confirmed by veterinarians from physical exams and x-rays.

Group 3: Delayed rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> (n = 8; 5 &#x003bc;g/kg/day) from day 14 to 28 post-op. This experiment was performed in three independent periods during 3 years.

Under a general anesthesia, a lateral incision was made on the right thigh from the level of the proximal end of the greater trochanter to the proximal end of the lateral condyle. The superficial leaf of the fascia lata muscle was incised and thebiceps femoris muscle was retracted laterally to reveal the femur. A 5 cm femoral segment was removed at the midshaft of the femur diaphysis using cold saline irrigation and reconstructed with a fresh frozen cortical allograft (Veterinary Transplant Services, Inc, Kent, WA, USA), which was stabilized using a 12-hole titanium 3.5 DCP plate and screws (gift of Synthes Inc. West Chester, PA) by using the AO compression technique. Antibiotics (cefazolin) were given prior to the skin incision and every 2 hours during surgery. Post-operative analgesia was achieved with a fentanyl patch placed before surgery, and oral morphine (1&#x02013;2 mg/kg orally) delivered every 8 hours as needed. Recovery was monitored every 12 hours for one week using a semiquantitative scoring system, which based on the pain and activities [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, the recovery score consists of lameness (0: not detectable&#x02013; 6: no ambulatory), swelling (0: none&#x02013; 3: sever), pain on palpation (0: none&#x02013; 4: dog will not allow examination) and pain on joint motion (0: none&#x02013; 4: dog will not allow examination). Blood calcium was measured 1&#x02013;2 hrs after rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> injection, and dogs with hypercalcemia (serum ionized calcium level 1.60 mmol/L), or dehydration symptoms perceived to be drug-related, received i.v. saline infusions. In vivo cone beam CT (CB-CT) scans were taken on days 14, 28 under general anesthesia [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

While we document the first confirmed case of lethal rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> hypersensitivity of a dog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185446.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), it should be noted that Daugaard et al also observed deaths of two dogs in their study with this dosing regime [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Although these observations do not establish causation, we interpret these remarkable findings to mean that canines may be highly sensitive to PTH-induced hypercalcemia, in contrast to other large animal models (i.e. rhesus monkeys that tolerate 25 &#x003bc;g/kg/day PTH(1&#x02013;84) for 16 months [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]), and further high dose studies with this formulation of rPTH in dogs should be pursued with caution. Moreover, this toxicity highlights the need for a modified rPTH, such as recently FDA-approved abaloparatide, which has different PTH receptor bind and downstream signaling [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], decreased catabolic activity, and potentially lower incidence and severity of hypercalcemia than that seen with teriparatide [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>In terms of efficacy, our findings that continuous rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> induces robust callus formation and accelerated cortical healing at the graft-host junctions in this clinically relevant massive allograft model mirrored our prior results in the murine femoral allograft model [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mechanistically, rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> accelerates angiogenesis, intramembranous bone formation and endochondral ossification in the early phases of fracture healing, and then it promotes remodeling of the new bone into lamellar bone with structural integrity. However, while only 2-weeks of delayed rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> was sufficient to observe maximal femoral allograft healing in mice [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], a similar treatment in our canine model had some significant effects, but was not equivalent to 8-weeks of continuous rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> treatment. Most notably, delayed rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> treatment had minimal callus remodeling, no increase in bone formation at the graft-host junction, and decreased cortical unions at 8-weeks compared to the continuous treatment group. This finding also highlights the importance of large animal studies to identify efficacy in small animal models, such as healing of the 4-5mm allograft used in mice that does not translate to clinically relevant critical defect healing.</p><p>Another important finding from our study comes from a comparison of the radiographic outcome measures of biomechanical healing. Based on our murine studies that showed the superiority of the 3D Union Ratio algorithm to predict biomechanical allograft healing over other CT based outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185446.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and the demonstration of its translational potential to quantify fracture healing in patients [<xref rid="pone.0185446.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185446.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], we hypothesized that the Union Ratio is a more accurate biomarker of biomechanical healing versus the established 2D semiquantitative scoring systems that merely evaluate the presence of callus and fracture lines subjectively. However, at the early 8-week time point, we found that the most powerful radiographic parameter of biomechanical healing is the fracture line, as we routinely found that energy to failure was best predicted by the number of bridged cortices. Interestingly, RUST score yielded better ICC (0.83) versus RUSH (0.73), and RUST also had a greater correlation with the biomechanical parameters. Thus, although the volumetric analysis allows for a wholistic appreciation of massive allograft healing from the 3D renderings, which produced convincing evidence that bridging callus across a 5cm intercalary allograft can be induced by rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> in only 8-weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185446.g002">Fig 2</xref>), we do not find this approach to be cost-effective for assessment of early critical defect healing.</p><p>In addition to our negative findings, there are several noteworthy limitations of our study. First, 8-weeks is too short a recovery period to assess significant biomechanical healing. This was known during the planning phase of this study, which included a second 3 Group arm in which biomechanical healing was to be assessed at 24-weeks. However, based on the incidence and severity of the hypercalcemia observed in the rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> treated dogs out to 8-weeks, the longer study was canceled due to animal welfare concerns. Second, it is possible that some significant effects of rPTH therapy were missed due to multiple saline transfusions that were administered to treat hypercalcemia, which could have altered rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> pharmacokinetics. Third, while the proposed rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> adjuvant therapy for massive allografting might be appropriate in trauma patients, it is important to note that teriparatide is contraindicated for use in patients with a previous history of cancer.</p><p>In conclusion, we find that continuous rPTH<sub>1-34</sub> treatment significantly increases callus formation at 4 weeks, and has the potential to induce bridging callus across a 5cm intercalary allograft at 8 weeks, which has never been observed in untreated or placebo controls. 2D radiographic scoring of four cortices healing (RUST) is a reliable cost-effective outcome of early intercalary allograft healing. Based on the demonstrated feasibility and efficacy, development of a rPTH formulation with reduced hypercalcemic side effects is warranted towards the development of a safe high dose therapy for critical defects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec011"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185446.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Fluorescent imaging of undecalcified double-labeled bone sections and automated histomorphometry to quantify the mineral apposition rates (MAR) on host, callus, graft-host junction and allograft bone.</title><p>(A) Photograph of the unstained histology section of Dopey&#x02019;s allografted femur highlighting the 8 regions of interest (ROI) that were analyzed for dynamic histomorphometry (H1, H2 = proximal and distal host bone; C1, C2 = proximal and distal callus bone; J1, J2 = proximal and distal junctions; A1, A2 = allograft cortices). (B) 10x fluorescent image of the calcein green and alizarin red double labeling is shown to illustrate the primary data used for automated histomorphometry. To segment alizarin and calcein labels and quantify the mineral apposition rate (MAR = distance between adjacent labeling lines representing bone growth during the 7 day interval between alizarin and calcein injections), a fully automated algorithm was developed. Briefly, a series of spectral filters were applied to enhance and normalize alizarin and calcein fluorescence in each image. Alizarin and calcein channels were subsequently separated and processed using boundary smoothing, hole filling, and area/length-based filters. The resulting alizarin and calcein masks were &#x0201c;skeletonized&#x0201d; (with pruning), creating 1-pixel thick lines along the medial axis of each labeling line (C). A k-neighbor search algorithm (with the maximum distance set to 100 &#x003bc;m) was then applied to match each alizarin skeletal pixel to the closest proximity calcein skeletal pixel. This process produced a bone growth mask representing distances between labeling lines. To quantify growth (i.e., the width or thickness of each growth region), a Euclidean distance filter was applied to the bone growth mask and then subsequently &#x0201c;multiplied&#x0201d; by the skeleton of the bone growth mask, such that the intensity along the resulting 1-pixel lines represented the growth distance between the medial axes of the adjacent alizarin and calcein labeling lines. Bone growth regions were pseudo-colored based on their thickness values and superimposed upon a grayscale representation of the original input image (D) with accompanying thickness heat map. Measurements of the intensity of these skeletonized lines (both on a pixel-by-pixel basis and by distinct connected regions), raw bone growth distances (accompanied by the corresponding length of each distinct region), and average/standard deviations of mineral apposition rates (&#x0201c;MAR&#x0201d;; bone growth distance/interval in mm/day) were quantified. Additionally, the overall length and area of calcein and alizarin were also quantified.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185446.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185446.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Case report of a canine death associated with complications from hypercalcemia following 3 doses of rPTH (5 &#x003bc;g/kg).</title><p>La, a dog in Group 3, Cohort 2, underwent femoral allograft surgery on September 11, 2013, and had a good recovery. La commenced the delay rPTH therapy (5 &#x003bc;g/kg/day s.c.) on day 14 post-op as scheduled. The day after the 3<sup>rd</sup> rPTH injection, La had lethargy and diarrhea, and rPTH treatment was discontinued. Hypercalcemia peaked at a serum ionized calcium level of 1.69 mmol/L on day 18 post-op, which was treated with fluids, and attitude improved. However, general health continued to deteriorate with poor appetite, oliguria, tachycardia and low blood pressure, culminating with shock/lateral recumbency and death on day 19 post-op. Immediate necropsy included histopathology evaluation of the colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, pancreas, small intestine, spleen and stomach. In summary, the animal had metastatic calcification in the kidneys, heart, vasculature and stomach, which was found to be consistent with excessive exogenous PTH administration. The hypercalcemia in this animal may have caused significant arrhythmias and subsequent myocardial failure and shock. Acute tubular necrosis in the kidney and necrohemorrhagic gastritis were also observed, and may have been the result of the calcification and/or shock. Acute alveolar injury in the lungs was observed and most likely the sequelae to shock.
