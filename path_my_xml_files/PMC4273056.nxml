risk of postures as well as the effects of stretching exercise on the work-related
symptoms and pain of bus drivers. [Subjects and Methods] Eighty-one drivers were randomly
recruited from a bus corporation for this study. Information about pain levels, painful
regions, and general characteristics of subjects was obtained using the symptom research
form (KOSHA Code H-30-2003). The level of pain was assessed on a scale of numeric rating
scale (NRS) which is divided by 10. Ergonomic posture assessment was conducted using the
rapid upper limb assessment (RULA). Self-stretching exercise was performed for 4 weeks by
the bus drivers who suffered from neck and shoulder pain. [Results] Musculoskeletal
symptoms were present in the order of shoulder, neck, lower back and lower extremities.
Compared with other jobs, the final score, and the action level of bus drivers were very
high, showing 57.6% of action levels 3 and 4. A statistically significant decrease of pain
was shown after the self-stretching intervention. There was also a significant decrease of
musculoskeletal symptoms in the neck and shoulders after the self-stretching exercise.
[Conclusion] Performing stretching for musculoskeletal symptoms had a positive influence
on the symptoms and reduced pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stretching</kwd><kwd>MSDs</kwd><kwd>Bus driver</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Industrialization has changed industrial structure and production methods. In addition the
migration of the population between regions has greatly influenced the development of public
transportation. Consequently, the number of people working in the transportation industry
has been on the rise. According to the National Statistical Office of Korea, 95,488 people
were engaged in bus driving in 2011, and 77.8% of them drove intra-city buses, 14.6% drove
the inter-city buses, 4.2% drove the express buses and 3.4% drove buses in farming and
fishing communities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Bus drivers are exposed to physical and chemical risk factors such as vibration and exhaust
emissions. Furthermore, they are heavily stressed by having to continuously concentrate on
road conditions and by staying alert for unexpected incidents<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The fatigue caused by driving should be focused on, because 25% of fatal accidents result
from fatigue, and 30% of drivers driving business vehicles complain of chronic fatigue
symptoms. In addition, it has been reported that the attention decreases with increasing
driving time, resulting in higher risk of traffic accidents<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has also been reported that more than half of accidents on
expressways are caused by fatigue accumulation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The fitness of drivers has an important effect on not only the
driver&#x02019;s safety but also on passenger safety, and it has been reported that most traffic
accidents are caused by drivers in many previous studies. Thus, the health management of bus
drivers is a very important issue for the prevention of traffic accidents<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In recent years, musculoskeletal disorders (MSDSs) have been increasing. In previous
studies, MSDS was studied in manufacturing businesses such as the car, ship and heavy
industries due to characteristics such as collective occurrence, incidence of industrial
accidents, and economic damage. Recently, the study of MSDS has expanded to hospitals,
transportation businesses and nonmetallic mineral manufacturing<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most previous studies of MSDSs focused on factors related
to lower back pain. It is reported that 81.9% of bus drivers have experiences lower back
pain, and that it is closely related to the working conditions and the whole-body vibration
received from the vehicle and road<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Moreover, it has also been reported that some factors such as the increased age of workers,
working time and psychological stress are highly related to lower back pain<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Regular stretching exercise can reduce and prevent the symptoms of MSDS. Stretching is
known to be an effective and simple exercise which increases flexibility<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stretching exercise is reported to be
effective at not only improving neuromuscular coordination and flexibility, but also at
reducing pain and muscle weakness<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Stretching exercise may improve physical activity by encouraging correct posture of body and
increasing muscle endurance<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Compared to other countries, there is a lack of information on bus drivers&#x02019; health,
especially physical and psychological fitness, in Korea<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and there has been no ergonomic assessment of posture and body
parts related to MSDSs in bus drivers. In addition, changes in symptoms of pain and the
musculoskeletal system in bus drivers have not been studied. Thus, this study was conducted
in order to investigate not only musculoskeletal symptoms, pain and risk of postures, but
also the effects of stretching exercise on the work-related symptoms and pain of bus
drivers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Eighty-one drivers were randomly recruited from a bus corporation for this study. Pain

This study was conducted after sufficient explanation about its purpose
and method had been given to the subjects, who provided their written informed consent
prior to participation in the study, in accordance with the ethical principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A general questionnaire was used in this study in order to investigate the general
characteristics and the work-related characteristics of the bus drivers. A musculoskeletal
symptom research form was used to assess individual characteristics and pain was also
assessed in this study. Subjects were informed of the contents and purpose of the
questionnaire and instructed to complete it by themselves. The examiner interviewed the
subjects and confirmed the questionnaire answers. The level of pain was measured on a
10-cm numerical rating scale. A score of 0 meant &#x02018;no pain&#x02019; and 10 meant &#x02018;severe pain&#x02019;. The
musculoskeletal symptom research form and pain assessments were conducted before and after
the intervention.</p><p>The general assessment questionnaire included items on physical strain and general
characteristics such as age, gender, height, weight, working time and break time.
Musculoskeletal symptoms were defined as: symptom criteria 1, a symptom lasting for one
week or occurring more than once a month within a year; symptom criteria 2, a level of
pain greater than moderate in addition to symptom criteria 1; and symptom criteria 3, a
level of pain greater than severe in addition to &#x02018;symptom criteria 1&#x02019;.</p><p>The questionnaire about musculoskeletal symptoms assessed body parts such as the neck,
hand/wrist, upper limb/elbow and shoulder regions. If a symptom was present in any of
these body parts, it was decided that there was a musculoskeletal symptom in the upper
extremities. Thirty drivers who reported symptoms in the neck and shoulders were recruited
for the experimental group which performed the intervention.</p><p>Ergonomic posture assessment was conducted using the rapid upper limb assessment (RULA).
Posture score was marked using the RULA coding system. The assessment was divided into
four action levels based on the sum of the score of all items. The action level was
classified as level 1 to 4, according to the desired improvement. Action levels 3 and 4
were defined as levels that required immediate improvement, and action level 2 as needing
long-term improvement in the ergonomic assessment of the work of the bus drivers.
Overloaded posture and the most frequent posture were selected in the ergonomic assessment
based on two recordings of the bus drivers&#x02019; work.</p><p>In the experimental group, bus drivers who suffered from neck and shoulder pain according
to their responses to the musculoskeletal symptom research form performed self-stretching
exercises for 4 weeks. Subjects in the experimental group were provided with documents
demonstrating the method of the self-stretching exercise and a self-check list. In
addition, physical therapists educated subjects on the stretching method and related
precautions. Physical therapists visited the subjects in the experimental group once a
week and continuously educated them about stretching.</p><p>Self-stretching exercise was performed in two ways. In one exercise the levator scapulae,
upper trapezius muscle and sternocleidomastoid muscle were stretched<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and in the other the subjects performed a
self-stretching exercise described by Kim and Lee consisting of seven movements<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each stretching movement was performed
three times per set, three times a week for four weeks, and the subjects were instructed
to maintain maximum stretch for more than 25 seconds and then relax in order to obtain the
benefits of stretching.</p><p>Descriptive statistics and frequency analysis were used to analyze the distribution of
individual posture scores and each item of the questionnaire. The paired t-test and
crossover analysis were also used to investigate the effects of the intervention. SPSS WIN
(version 20.0) was used for the statistical analysis with a significance level of
0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Most of the bus drivers were male and liked to play sports, but they did not have enough
time or a place to relieve fatigue or stress in their break times (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Their physical strain was severe. The physical load
caused by long hours of driving and irregular rest was found to be high, because the sum of
the &#x02018;slight hardness&#x02019; and &#x02018;severe hardness&#x02019; items accounted for 28.8% of the total.</p><p>The bus drivers often complained of pain which resulted from increased muscle tone of the
upper extremities, because the upper extremities are not fixed when driving a bus (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Musculoskeletal symptoms of the bus drivers (N=80)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Musculoskeletal symptoms</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Frequency (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Neck</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 (33.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Shoulder</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34 (42.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Arm / Elbow</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (6.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hand / Wrist / Finger</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (6.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lumbar</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 (33.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Leg / Foot</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 (18.8)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>). Musculoskeletal symptoms were reported in the order of the shoulder, neck,
lower back and lower extremities. Moreover, an assistive device which could reduce the
muscle tone of the upper extremities was not used.</p><p>Because of the work-related characteristics, abduction and adduction of the shoulder joint
repeatedly occurred, and excessive flexion and extension of the wrist joint also repeatedly
occurred when moving the steering wheel. Bus drivers didn&#x02019;t use any assistive devices which
could support the neck and the neck was maintained in flexion because the drivers needed to
keep looking forward during driving. There was a lack of education about the proper driving
posture and self-stretching methods. Also the steering wheel and driver&#x02019;s seat were not
designed to be suitable for the driver&#x02019;s body. Compared with other jobs, the final scores
and action levels of the bus drivers were very high, action levels 3 and 4 accounting for

Korea, musculoskeletal disease became a health issue in the late 1980. Work-related
musculoskeletal disease was included in the law for the prevention of musculoskeletal
disease, legislated and revised under Article 24 of the Occupation Safety and Health Acts in
Dec 2002, which came into effect in July 2003<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Ergonomic evaluation of working postures and the environment of workers for the prevention
of musculoskeletal disease in Korea first began to be studied mainly in manufacturing
sectors such as the car, shipping, and heavy industries, and prevention policies and
programs for managing musculoskeletal patients were introduced. Although musculoskeletal
disease was mostly identified in manufacturing industry, the seriousness of musculoskeletal
disease in non-manufacturing sectors including the service industry has only been recognized
recently<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Traffic accidents can be caused by decreased concentration and by delay in judgment due to
the musculoskeletal disease of a driver<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The main reasons for musculoskeletal disease are overwork, wrong
working posture, repetitive tasks, misallocation of resting and working times, lack of
education about correct working posture, job stress etc<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The working environment of bus drivers can be improved by adopting regular resting times
and providing places where bus drivers can recover from fatigue. In addition, a driver&#x02019;s
seat with a neck support which can fix the cervical vertebrae should be provided to improve
bus drivers&#x02019; musculoskeletal symptoms, and armrests to reduce muscle tension around the
shoulder joints.</p><p>Easily adjustable steering wheels should be provided for the ergonomical improvement of bad
posture and for the prevention of excessive movement of the shoulder and wrist joints.
Unnecessary movement of the upper extremities while driving should be prevented by changing
the size of the steering wheel to match on the physical features of a driver. The positions
of outside mirrors should be properly controlled and a backup camera should also be equipped
to remove the need for excessive cervical extension and rotation.</p><p>The driver&#x02019;s seat should be adjusted to maintain the trunk joint angle in the range of 90&#x000b0;
to 110&#x000b0; in order to improve the overall driving posture, and drivers should be educated to
avoid greater than 90&#x000b0; of hip extension and greater than 60&#x000b0; of knee flexion to prevent
excessive trunk joint extension while driving. Furthermore, a continuous management program
by physical therapists is needed to teach exercise methods and postures that can relieve
upper limb fatigue while driving.</p><p>As well as the improvements mentioned above, therapeutic intervention is also important.
The advantage of stretching is that it can be conducted regardless of time, place, physical
conditions, and special skills. In addition, continuous stretching can reduce
musculoskeletal disease symptoms through flexibility improvement by decreasing muscle
tension and pain<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research on the effects of stretching on musculoskeletal pain has
reported that the pain score decreased from 5.52 before the intervention to 4.80 after
stretching was performed for 4 weeks<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In addition, Kim study on the effect of stretching on VDT workers&#x02019; upper extremity pain also
reported a decrease in upper limb pain after the performance of stretching<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Neck and shoulder musculoskeletal subjective symptoms and pain were decreased by 4 weeks of
stretching in this study. Post-intervention, there was a statistically significant decrease
of 25% in subjective symptoms in the neck, and of 28% in the shoulder. The pain level of the
most painful part of the neck and shoulders also significantly decreased. These findings are
in agreement with Kim&#x02019;s study that reported a significant decrease in the pain level of
workers at an automobile workspace<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
Lee&#x02019;s study that reported a significant decrease in shoulder pain after stretching had been
performed<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, stretching
is able to decrease the pain of occupational musculoskeletal disease.</p><p>In conclusion, performing stretching to treat musculoskeletal disease had a positive effect
on subjective symptoms and reduced pain. Stretching treatments for musculoskeletal disease
can prevent the lowering of concentration and impairment of judgment. Furthermore, the
physical management of drivers can reduce their work load and the risk of traffic
accident.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, the results are difficult to generalize because of
the small number of subjects. Since stretching was performed only by subjects following the
instructions of physical therapists, the treatment was not continuously managed. In
addition, we are not sure whether or not subjects performed stretching regularly, because
exercise compliance was only evaluated with a self-administered check list. Besides, the
correlation between musculoskeletal subjective symptoms and the incidence of traffic
accidents was not investigated in this study. Based on the results of this study, research
