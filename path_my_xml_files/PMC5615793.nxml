This study investigated the effect of pre-operative oral simvastatin administration on <italic>MCP-1</italic> gene expression and serum MCP-1 protein levels in patients with endometriosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A prospective, randomized, controlled study was conducted at the Reproductive Endocrinology Unit of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital. Forty women (mean age: 18&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years) scheduled for laparoscopic surgery who had been diagnosed with endometriosis were recruited and randomly assigned to either a treatment group (20&#x000a0;mg/d of orally administered simvastatin for 2&#x000a0;weeks before surgery) or an untreated control group.

The prevalence of endometriosis is approximately 10% in reproductive-age women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Endometriosis is defined as the presence of ectopic endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Clinical presentations include dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Diagnostic laparoscopy is the standard method used for the diagnosis of endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several theories have been proposed for the pathophysiology of the disease. These include retrograde menstruation, embryonic rests, and induction theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although eutopic endometrium in most women sloughs through the patent fallopian tubes into the abdominal cavity during menstruation, it is unclear why endometrial tissues implant and grow in the peritoneal cavity only in some women. Recently, scientific evidence has suggested that immunological dysfunction may be associated with endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The immune cells present in peritoneal fluid are composed of macrophages, lymphocytes, mesothelial cells, and mast cells. The concentration of leukocytes is about 0.5&#x02013;2.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup>/ml, and approximately 85% of leukocytes are macrophages. The concentration of peritoneal macrophages in endometriosis patients appears to fluctuate during the menstrual cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Macrophages likely play an important role in the production of peritoneal inflammatory factors, such as monocyte chemoattractant proteins (MCP), plasminogen activators, adhesion molecules, heme oxygenase, cytokines, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Most of these inflammatory factors stimulate the process of endometrial adhesion and proliferation, as well as neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Several medications, mainly hormones, are prescribed to treat endometriosis. However, patient tolerability rates are not high because of the side effects of these drugs. Novel alternative treatments for endometriosis have been proposed. For example, these include aromatase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, anti-oxidants, and pro-apoptotic agents. Simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, has been recently proposed to treat endometriosis. It acts by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, resulting in a decrease in mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Aceto-acetyl-coA is metabolized by HMG-CoA reductase to mevalonate. The other beneficial effects of statin include anti-inflammation, decreased angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], decreased MCP-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the potential use of simvastatin for treating endometriosis has only been studied in vitro and in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">MCP-1 is a chemo-attractant for mononuclear phagocytes. It is one of the products of the mevalonate pathway and is secreted by white blood cells, macrophages, eutopic endometrial tissues, and endometriotic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. MCP-1 binds chemokine (C-C motif) receptors (CCR)-2 or CCR-4 to attract monocytes to target tissues. It promotes the migration of monocytes from the peripheral blood to the peritoneal cavity where they transform into macrophages and contribute to the local peritoneal inflammation commonly observed in endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For these reasons, MCP-1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.</p><p id="Par15">We hypothesized that orally administered simvastatin in patients with endometriosis might reduce serum MCP-1, endometriosis-associated MCP-1, and cluster of differentiation-68 (CD68), a surface marker for macrophages, expression. We conducted this prospective study to investigate the effect of oral simvastatin (20&#x000a0;mg/d) on CD68 and MCP-1 endometriotic cyst expression, and on serum MCP-1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par16">This prospective, randomized, controlled study was conducted at the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital of Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand.

Retrograde menstruation is the most accepted theory for the development of endometriosis, and this idea was proposed by Sampson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Local inflammatory responses and abnormalities in immunity also likely play important roles in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, specifically innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The association between endometriosis, inflammation, and immunity has been well-recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, immune dysfunction was theorized to be related to infertility problems experienced by patients with endometriosis, which has been demonstrated by the rejection of early implantation of embryos in women with infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Macrophages, the major immune cells in the innate immune system, are the key cells contributing to the local inflammatory response in endometriosis. Monocytes are recruited to the endometriotic lesion by the chemotactic chemokine MCP-1, and they are then transformed into mature macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages secrete several cytokines regulating cell proliferation, activation, adhesion, chemotaxis, and transformation. Several cytokines are also released into peritoneal fluids, such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&#x003b1;. These are all associated with the pathogenesis of endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Medical treatments, such as hormonal treatments, have commonly been used to treat endometriosis. However, many patients cannot tolerate their adverse effects. Therefore, new approaches to endometriosis treatment have emerged, such as aromatase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, anti-oxidants, and pro-apoptotic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Novel therapeutic strategies to reduce inflammation and/or immune responses have also been proposed. MCP-1 is a chemokine that creates the inflammatory environment associated with endometriosis, which induces monocytes to differentiate into macrophages and directs peripheral macrophages to the peritoneal cavity. Moreover, MCP-1 may stimulate endometrial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and endometrial cell attachment. Therefore, targeting MCP-1 might be an effective way to inhibit inflammation, reduce cell-mediated immune responses, and cure endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs commonly used worldwide. They are potent inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA), which inhibits MCP-1 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In vitro studies showed that simvastatin inhibits cell growth, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, endometrial cell attachment. It also induces apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In vivo studies by Bruner-Tran et al. evaluated the effects of simvastatin (5 and 25&#x000a0;mg/kg/d for 10 d) in a nude mouse model of endometriosis. They demonstrated a potent inhibitory effect of simvastatin on the development of endometriosis and on matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Cakmak et al. investigated the effects of simvastatin (5 and 25&#x000a0;mg/kg/d for 10 d) in a nude mouse model of endometriosis, and observed a significant decrease in MCP-1 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, no studies have reported the effect of simvastatin on endometriosis in humans. The current research is a pioneering study that compares serum MCP-1 protein levels and <italic>MCP-1</italic> gene expression in women with endometriosis after oral administration of simvastatin. Our work is the second clinical trial of simvastatin for treating endometriosis. The first published clinical trial was conducted by Almassinokiani et al. (2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our findings showed that simvastatin administered at a dose of 20&#x000a0;mg/d for 2&#x000a0;weeks did not reduce <italic>MCP-1</italic> gene expression. The discrepancy among the in vitro studies, animal studies, and our human clinical trial could be explained by several reasons. The duration of treatment would not be one of these reasons because it seemed to be sufficient to reduce <italic>MCP-1</italic> gene expression. The duration of simvastatin treatment for the participants in the present study was longer (14 d) than that in the animal studies (10 d). The administration of simvastatin for 10 d in the nude mouse model for endometriosis created using human endometrium demonstrated the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on the size and number of endometriotic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and on endometriotic MCP-1 protein expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, the dose of simvastatin would be a significant factor influencing the medication&#x02019;s effects. The result of treatment in the animal models in both studies showed a dose-response characteristic. A higher dose of simvastatin (25&#x000a0;mg/kg/d) achieved a better outcome than the lower dose (5&#x000a0;mg/kg/d) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The dose of simvastatin from nude mice to human or human equivalent dose (HED) was calculated using the following formula: HED (mg/kg)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;animal dose (mg/kg) &#x000d7; animal Km / human Km. The Michaelis constant, Km, is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of Vmax. Vmax represents the maximum rate achieved by the system at maximum (saturating) substrate concentrations. The calculated dose of simvastatin in the present study was (5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3)/37&#x02009;=&#x02009;20&#x000a0;mg/d (if a woman&#x02019;s weight averages 50&#x000a0;kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We calculated the dosage of simvastatin based on an animal dose of 5&#x000a0;mg/kg/d. Therefore, according to the result from the animal studies, if we choose simvastatin with a higher dose, such as 25&#x000a0;mg/kg/d in mice model, we would probably observe a successful outcome. A simvastatin dose of 25&#x000a0;mg/kg/d in mice would be equivalent to 100&#x000a0;mg/d in humans. However, a dose of simvastatin higher than 80&#x000a0;mg/d is not recommended by the US FDA to prescribe to patients because of the high risk for myopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, these contradictory results could be caused by the different species and models used in the experiments.</p><p id="Par33">Almassinokiani et al. (2013) conducted the first randomized clinical trial for simvastatin in women with endometriosis. They recruited 60 women diagnosed with endometriosis. These patients underwent conservative laparoscopic surgery and were then randomly assigned to receive either simvastatin (20&#x000a0;mg/d for 4&#x000a0;months) or GnRHa (Decapeptyl 3.75&#x000a0;mg IM each 28-d period for four doses). The authors demonstrated that treatment with simvastatin (20&#x000a0;mg/d for 4&#x000a0;months) reduced pain after conservative laparoscopic surgery to a similar extent as GnRHa treatment. However, many issues in the article were criticized. This included the blinding process for patients and physicians, and the allocation of the treatment modalities. In addition, women who wanted to conceive were more often chosen for simvastatin treatment than GnRHa treatment in order to avoid fetal abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. There were many differences between our study and Almassinokiani&#x02019;s study. We compared simvastatin and no treatment for endometriosis before conservative surgery, while Almassinokiani et al. compared simvastatin and GnRHa treatments after conservative surgery. Moreover, the primary outcomes of our study and Almassinokiani&#x02019;s study were different (MCP-1 expression vs. pain score). Almassinokiani&#x02019;s outcome was more subjective than our primary outcome.</p><p id="Par34">Simvastatin had no effect on macrophages in endometriotic tissue. We demonstrated that <italic>CD68</italic> gene expression in endometriosis was not affected by simvastatin administration. CD68 is a glycoprotein expressed in macrophage lineages. This result was supported by <italic>MCP-1</italic> gene expression analysis. No correlation between serum MCP-1 protein and <italic>MCP-1</italic> gene expression was demonstrated in our study. This suggests that MCP-1 is not only produced by endometrial cells, but also other cells, such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, mesangial cells, astrocytes, monocytes, macrophages, mesothelial cells, and microglia.</p><p id="Par35">One limitation of the present study is that we did not investigate peritoneal fluid MCP-1 levels. Although the primary source of MCP-1 is endometriotic cysts, it is possible that MCP-1 is produced by other cells. Assessing peritoneal fluid MCP-1 concentrations would also provide more information than serum MCP-1 levels alone. Future studies should focus on peritoneal fluid and cells. The stage of endometriosis development and the presence of DIE did not have any significant effect on the target genes of simvastatin. However, we did not analyze data from pelvic endometriotic tissues, endometriotic cysts, or DIE. Future studies will need to address this.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">We conclude that oral simvastatin (20&#x000a0;mg/d) does not reduce chemokine MCP-1 levels or macrophage gene expression in women diagnosed with endometriosis. A higher dose of simvastatin would promote favorable outcome for endometriosis patients. However, the higher the dose of simvastatin, the higher the risk of side effects, such as myopathy. Furthermore, serum MCP-1 is an unsuitable biomarker for predicting endometriosis.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CCR-2</term><def><p id="Par6">Chemokine (C-C motif) receptors type 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCR-4</term><def><p id="Par7">Chemokine (C-C motif) receptors type 4</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>COX-2</italic></term><def><p id="Par8">Cyclooxygenase type 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>MCP-1</italic></term><def><p id="Par9">monocyte chemoattractant proteins</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>MMP-3</italic></term><def><p id="Par10">matrix metalloproteinase-3</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Apilada Ojaroen for her excellent technical help.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par37">The project described was supported by Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi hospital.
