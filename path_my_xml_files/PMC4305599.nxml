vibration training and an unstable base of support on lumbar stabilization. [Subjects]
This study assigned healthy adults in their 20s to a bridge exercise with a sling and
vibration group (BESV, n=20) and a bridge exercise with a sling group (BESG, n=20).
[Methods] Electromyography was used to comparatively analyze the activity of the internal
obliques (IO), external obliques (EO), and rectus abdominis (RA) when local vibration was
applied during a bridge exercise that used a sling as an unstable base of support.
[Results] There were statistically significant increases in the activity of the IO and EO
within each group after the intervention. The activity of the IO and the EO was
significantly higher in the BESV group than in the BES group after the intervention.
[Conclusion] The bridge exercise performed using vibration training on an unstable base of
support increased the activity of the IO and the EO, which improved lumbar
stabilization.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Bridge exercise</kwd><kwd>Vibration</kwd><kwd>Lumbar stabilization</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>According to the 2011 data from Statistics Korea, lumbar pain is a chronic disease with a
high incidence rate, 86.2%, in the population, with the rate being 86.9% for men and 85.5%
for women<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are diverse factors
related to lumbar pain, but self-treatment without help from an expert makes complete
recovery difficult<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reason for this
is that most people with lumbar pain reduce their activity in order to decrease their pain,
and this decrease in activity leads to weakening of muscles and rigidity of the joints,
which can lead to chronic back pain. Lee<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>
noted that when patients avoided bed rest for a long time and received appropriate
therapeutic exercise during the acute phase, they obtained positive outcomes.</p><p>There are existing therapeutic treatment methods for lumbar pain, including Williams
exercise, McKenzie exercise, Pilates exercise, and Feldenkrais exercise programs, but spinal
stability exercises that enable patients to adjust to large and small movements of the
joints, both consciously and unconsciously, have recently been researched<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dynamic spinal stability exercise program,
which is an exercise treatment method for lumbar pain that was first used in the US in the
1980s, has recently been spotlighted. This exercise program provides special training of the
muscles around the lumbar vertebrae, which are considered to play an important role in
adjusting spinal segments and providing dynamic stability, with the treatment focus on the
instability of the spinal segments<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
effects of lumbar stabilization exercise on an unstable base of support have been verified
in various studies, and recently, a sling exercise using a rope has been recognized as an
effective exercise for stabilizing the spine<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The vibration training provided as an intervention in this study is a type of isometric
exercise, and it has been reported to have positive effects in terms of improving motor
function and increasing energy metabolism and blood flow; as a result, this training has
been drawing a lot of attention<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Rittweger et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that a group
with lumbar pain that was treated with vibration and exercise together saw a decrease in
pain and an enhanced ability to control nerve roots.</p><p>As shown above, research on the effects of exercise using a sling as an unstable base of
support has been reported, but research on the effects of vibration training on lumbar
stabilization is lacking. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to look at the effects of
the bridge exercise with vibration training and an unstable base of support on stabilization
of the lumbar region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were randomly and equally allocated to a bridge exercise with a
sling and vibration group (BESV group; n=20) and a bridge exercise with a sling group (BES
group; n=20). Age, height, and weight in the BESV group were 21.5&#x000b1;2.5&#x02005;years, 167.0&#x000b1;8.5&#x02005;cm,
and 62.4&#x000b1;11.2&#x02005;kg, respectively, while they were 22.4&#x000b1;3.9&#x02005;years, 170.8&#x000b1;7.9&#x02005;cm, and
61.8&#x000b1;11.3&#x02005;kg, respectively, in the BES group. No significant differences were found between
the two groups when a test of homogeneity was performed on the two groups (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>Those with neurological or orthopedic disease and those who could not perform supine/prone
bridge exercise due to pain or other disease were excluded as subjects. All included
patients understood the purpose of this study and provided written informed consent prior to
participation, which is in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>The BESV group received vibration training using vibration equipment (Redcord<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>
Stimula, Redcord AS, Norway) devised by Norwegian physical therapists at frequencies of
15&#x02005;Hz, 20&#x02005;Hz, and 30&#x02005;Hz. The vibration equipment was installed on both ropes of the sling
supporting the bilateral lower extremities, and local vibration was applied only during the
bridge exercise. The exercise was repeated four times per session. The subjects conducted
nine sessions of the supine/prone-position bridge exercise. They rested for 30 seconds after
each session. For the first three sessions, a vibration of 15&#x02005;Hz was applied; for the next
three sessions, a vibration of 20&#x02005;Hz was applied; and for the last three sessions, a
vibration of 30&#x02005;Hz was applied. The subjects conducted the supine-position bridge exercise
first. Prior to the exercise, the subjects lay in a supine position on a table, supported
both hands on the floor, maintained the hip joints and knee joints at 90 degrees, and put
both ankles on the sling support. During the exercise, the subjects placed their weight on
the bilateral lower extremities, and they raised their hips so that the trunk, pelvis, and
lower extremities formed a straight line. Then, they performed the prone-position bridge
exercise. Before the exercise, the subjects lay in a prone position on the table, maintained
their shoulder and elbow joints at 90 degrees, rested their weight on their elbows, and
raised their bilateral ankles on the sling. Here, the height of the sling was adjusted so
that the lateral malleolus, hips and shoulders were level. During the exercise, the subjects
rested their weight on their bilateral lower limbs and elbows, and they raised their hips,
so that the trunk, pelvis, and lower extremities were level. The BES group conducted the
exercises without the vibration equipment.</p><p>For measurement, a pressure biofeedback unit (PBU, Chattanooga Stabilizer PBU, DJO Global
Inc, Vista, CA, USA) was situated below the umbilicus between the subjects&#x02019; lumbar region
and the floor. An assistant set the pressure at 40 mHG according to the operating
instructions book of the PBU<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Then the
subjects conducted a drawing-in maneuver within a range in which the PBU&#x02019;s gradation did not
change, and their muscle activity was measured. For muscle activity measurement, wireless
surface electromyography (EMG, TeleMyo DTS, Noraxon U.S.A. Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA) was
used, and ground electrodes were attached to the internal obliques (IO), external obliques
(EO), and rectus abdominis (RA). EMG signals were converted into %MVIC and then recorded. In
addition, to reduce skin resistance at the electrode attachment site, the hair was removed
using a razor, and the site was rubbed 3&#x02013;4 times with fine sandpaper and with alcohol swabs
to remove the corneum. Measurements were taken three times, and the average values were
calculated.</p><p>For statistical processing of the experimental results, SPSS 12.0 was used. In order to
examine muscle activity within each group, a paired t-test was used, and in order to compare
muscle activity between the two groups, an independent sample t-test was employed. The
significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the study results, the activity of the IO and EO significantly increased in
both the BESV group and BES group (p&#x0003c;0.05). In comparing the two groups after the
intervention, the activity of the IO and EO was significantly higher in the BESV group than
in the BES group (p&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in the Activity of the IO, EO, and RA in the BESV and BES groups (unit:

enables exercise of multiple joints rather than a single joint, which makes the exercise
motions unstable. Such movements lead to interaction between antagonistic two-joint muscles
and enable changes in spinal form by maintaining the tension relationship between joint
movements and muscle length<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Kim and Kim<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that lumbar
stabilization exercise in a quadruped position on an unstable base of support using a sling
greatly increased the activity of the IO and EO, but it did not much enhance the activity of
the RA; they noted that the RA did not contribute much to lumbar stabilization<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Vera-Garcia et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> asserted that the curl-up exercise on a static base of
support increased the activity of the RA, which made actual lumbar stabilization difficult,
but that the curl-up exercise on an unstable base of support boosted the activity of the
deep muscles, increasing lumbar stabilization. In the present study, as with previous
research, the activity of the IO and EO increased in each group after the intervention, as
did lumbar stabilization, but there was no significant difference in the RA in either group
after the intervention. Choi and Kang<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that the muscle activity of the internal oblique, the rectus abdominis, the
multifidus, and the erector spinae increased more in a group that used manual vibrations on
unstable surfaces using slings than in a group that did not use manual vibrations. Brumagne
et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that local vibration
applied to chronic lumbar pain patients during lumbar exercise enhanced their proprioceptive
stimulation and deep muscle adjustment. Muceli et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that vibration for a short time period was effective in
strengthening and stabilizing deep muscles. Therefore, it is considered that local vibration
improved the proprioceptive stimulation and deep muscle adjustment in the BESV group, given
that although there was no change in the activity of the RA, the activity of the IO and EO
was significantly higher in the BESV group (which received local vibration) than in the BES
group.</p><p>Based on the above results, the bridge exercise with a sling and vibration is considered to
be effective for lumbar stabilization by increasing the muscle activity of the IO and EO,
and it can be presented as an exercise intervention for patients who complain of lumbar
pain. The effects of the frequencies used, 15&#x02005;Hz, 20&#x02005;Hz, and 30&#x02005;Hz, for the vibration
equipment on lumbar stabilization could not be identified. In future studies, the effects of
each of the frequencies (15&#x02005;Hz, 20&#x02005;Hz, and 30&#x02005;Hz) on muscle activity should be studied.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><person-group><name><surname>Korea</surname><given-names>Statistics</given-names></name></person-group>: Korean working conditions survey.
