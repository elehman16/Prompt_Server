Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 10 g/day purslane seeds with 240 cc low-fat yogurt (intervention group) or only 240 cc low-fat yogurt (as a control group) for 5 weeks. After a 2-week washout period, subjects were moved to the alternate arm for an additional 5 weeks. At baseline and end of each phase of the study, fasting blood samples were collected to quantify plasma glucose levels, as well as serum insulin and lipid profiles.

The beneficial effects of this medicinal plant on insulin resistance have also been shown in rats.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] As clear, most previous studies have been limited to animal models and we are aware of only one clinical trial that has investigated the effect of purslane seed on lipid profile and glycemic status of persons with type 2 diabetes, in which consumption of 10 g/day of purslane seed for 8 weeks was comparable to 1500 mg/day metformin in influencing fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and serum insulin levels.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>It must be kept in mind that most persons with type 2 diabetes take oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) for their glycemic control. The additional effects of purslane seeds along with diabetic medications have not yet been assessed. Because of the limited information about the effects of purslane seeds on metabolic control of persons with type 2 diabetes, this study aimed to examine the effects of purslane seeds on lipid profiles and glycemic status of persons with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>This study was a randomized cross-over clinical trial in which 48 subjects with type 2 diabetes aged 35-65 years, attending Endocrine Research Center of Isfahan University Medical Sciences, were included. This study was carried out in Isfahan, Iran, during January 2012 to July 2012. On the basis of sample size formula suggested for cross-over clinical trials,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] we considered the type I error of 5% (&#x003b1; =0.05) and type II error of 10% (&#x003b2; = 0.20; Power = 80%) and FPG as a key variable. We reached the sample size of 38 patients for the whole trial. Given the high dropouts in cross-over trials, we enrolled 48 patients in the trial. Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was done based on the criteria of American Diabetes Association;[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] those with one of the following criteria were considered as having diabetes: FPG &#x02265;126 mg/dL, blood sugar 2-h postparandial &#x02265;200 mg/dL. To be enrolled in the study, participants need to be a person with type 2 diabetes, who were nonsmokers, do not use alcohol, were nonpregnant and nonlactating women and those who did not change the dosage and type of medications in the last 2 months prior to the study. Individuals with a history of hepatic, renal, lung, and cardiovascular disease, as well as those with kidney stones, thyroid diseases, and gastrointestinal bleeding, were not included in the current study.</p><p>Totally, 48 persons with type 2 diabetes with the above-mentioned inclusion criteria were included in the study. The study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the declaration of Helsinki. All subjects completed written informed consent forms.

Blood samples were taken according to a standard protocol and centrifuged within 30-45 min of collection. The analysis of samples was performed using Selectra-2 auto-analyzer (Vital Scientific, Spankeren, Netherlands). FPG was measured on the day of blood collection with an enzymatic colorimetric method using glucose oxidase. Serum triglyceride concentrations were assayed with the use of triglyceride kits (Pars AzmoonInc, Tehran, Iran). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were measured after precipitation of the apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins with phosphotungstic acid. Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were also measured using available kits. Serum insulin levels were measured by ELISA using enzyme-linked immunoassay kits. All inter- and intra-assay CVs for biochemical indicators were &#x0003c;5%. Homeostatic model of assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated based on the formula suggested by Matthews <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Assessment of blood pressure</title><p>To measure blood pressure, participants were initially rested for 15 min and then we measured blood pressure with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer while the subjects were in a seated position. The systolic blood pressure was defined as the appearance of the first sound (Korotkoff phase 1), and the diastolic blood pressure was defined as the disappearance of the sound (Korotkoff phase 5) during deflation of the cuff at a 2-3 mm/s decrement rate of the mercury column.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Assessment of anthropometric measures</title><p>Weight was measured with a Seca scale while the subjects were minimally clothed and not wearing shoes.

Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviation, and range) for general characteristics of the study participants were reported. Data on dietary intakes were compared by paired <italic>t</italic>-test. For each dependent variable, we computed the changes from baseline by subtracting the baseline value from the end-of-trial value. With-in and between-group changes in dependent variables were compared by the use of paired samples <italic>t</italic>-test. We also assessed if the carry-over effect was significant. The carry-over effect was tested for by computing the average of the two treatments and comparing the two treatment orders using <italic>t</italic>-test.

Despite a slight reduction in FPG levels, we failed to find any significant effect on serum insulin levels and HOMA-IR score following the purslane seeds intake. Furthermore, purslane seeds consumption decreased serum triglyceride levels but could not affect serum HDL-C, LDL-C, and total cholesterol levels. Consumption of purslane for 5 weeks led to a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure and a borderline significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure in persons with type 2 diabetes. To our knowledge, this study is among the first investigations examining the effects of purslane seeds intake on serum lipid profiles and glycemic status of persons with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Recent research indicated that purslane, due to containing biologically active compounds, might have a favorable effect in human health.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] We found that purslane seeds intake for 5 weeks could not affect FPG and serum insulin levels. This finding is in contrast to earlier studies done in animals and humans. Almost all experimental studies have indicated an antihyperglycemic effect of purslane consumption. In an experimental study, Gong <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed a significant antihyperglycemic effect of purslane polysaccharides in diabetic rats. Other studies have indicated that the purslane extract might improve insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in diabetic rats.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] However, few data are available indicating the effect of purslane on metabolic control of persons with type 2 diabetes in human beings. We are aware of just one report in humans in which El-Sayed[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found that consumption of purslane in patients with type 2 diabetes, compared with the use of metformin, resulted in a significant reduction in FPG and serum insulin levels. Different findings of our study with others might be explained by the discrepancies in methodology. We used purslane seeds in this study, as El-Sayed did, but other studies used different preparations, like purslane leaves or extracts. The only processing that was done on purslane in our study was powdering. No evidence is available indicating that powdering can alter the composition of purslane. However, combination with yogurt might alter the bioavailability of some components of purslane. Furthermore, the cross-over design of our study might also provide some other explanations for discrepant findings. This is the first cross-over study reporting the effect of purslane seeds. Earlier studies have been experimental or parallel clinical trials. Discrepancy in duration of intervention, dosage of purslane used, study sample size along with compliance of the study participants to the purslane might also help explain the different findings.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>We found that purslane consumption led to a significant reduction in serum triglyceride levels but failed to influence serum HDL-C, LDL-C, and total cholesterol levels significantly. Antihyperlipidemic effects of purslane have earlier been reported by experimental studies.</p><p>Movahedian <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] have reported that the use of the purslane extract might significantly reduce serum LDL-C and total cholesterol levels in rabbits fed a high cholesterol diet, but could not affect serum HDL-C. The same findings have also been shown in rats.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Few studies have also assessed the effects of purslane on lipid profiles of human. Consumption of 6 g/day freeze-dried purslane leaves in hypercholesterolemic subjects for 4 weeks led to improved total cholesterol levels while it did not influence serum triglycerides.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Others have also demonstrated the antihyperlipidemic effect of purslane leaves.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In the only available report on persons with type 2 diabetes, consumption of purslane seeds was associated with decreased levels of serum triglycerides, LDL-C, and total cholesterol levels.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Lack of any significant effect of purslane seeds on serum cholesterol levels in the current study might be attributed to the normal levels of serum lipids at the study baseline. Almost all earlier previous studies that reported the cholesterol-reducing effects of purslane, patients were hypercholesterolemic.</p><p>We found a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure and a borderline significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure after purslane intake. No earlier study has reported the effect of purslane intake on blood pressure and to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first reporting the beneficial effects of purslane seeds intake on blood pressure. However, the effect of omega-3 fat intake on blood pressure has been shown by previous investigations.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Given the beneficial effect of purslane on blood pressure, the inclusion of this medicinal plant in dietary management of hypertension could be recommended. However, to reach a definite conclusion in this regard further studies are warranted.</p><p>The mechanisms through which purslane intake might affect glycemic status and lipid profiles of persons with type 2 diabetes have been unknown. Several mechanisms might explain its beneficial effects. The weight reduction might be due to the effect of purslane seeds on insulin resistance.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Some documents have also attributed the lipolytic effect of purslane to its content of nor-adrenaline.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Antihyperglycemic effect of purslane could be attributed to its effect on increased insulin secretion through closing the K<sup>+</sup>/ATP channels, influencing membrane depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Another study showed that purslane seeds intake could significantly increase glucagon-like peptide-1 levels in persons with type 2 diabetes.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Purslane seeds contain high amounts of flavonoids.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] The beneficial effects of flavonoids on serum lipid profiles have earlier been shown.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] The effect of purslane intake on lowering serum triglyceride levels might be explained by its high content of omega-3 fatty acids as reported in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</p><p>Our findings should be interpreted while considering some limitations. It must be kept in mind that some biomarkers including FPG, HOMA-IR, insulin, total and HDL-C levels were reduced in both intervention and control groups slightly. This indicates that the patients may not be tightly controlled prior to the commencement of the research or were newly diagnosed and did not reach the desired levels of serum biomarkers. This fact might influence our findings and should be considered in the interpretation of the study results. One of our study limitations is the method of assessment of compliance to purslane seeds intake. We assessed compliance through phone interview as well as asking participants to deliver the empty sachets to study personnel. Future studies are better to assess the compliance through the use of an appropriate biomarker. Although findings a suitable biomarker for purslane intake is difficult, measurement of the alpha-linolenic acid content of red blood cells&#x02019; membranes might provide some information in this regard. Another limitation of our study is the short duration of intervention. Longer intervention periods might lead to a greater number of dropouts; however, the effects might better be reflected in such interventions. Single measurement of metabolic profile in the current study might lead to misleading findings due to day-to-day variations in these biomarkers. Limited patients who had not a good control of their blood glucose which can effect on our results. Unfortunately, we were not considered duration of diabetes in participants that might influence on finding of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This cross-over clinical trial revealed that consumption of purslane seeds for 5 weeks in persons with type 2 diabetes might improve their anthropometric measures, serum triglyceride levels, and blood pressure. Further studies are required to determine the appropriate dosage for these patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTION</title><p>AE, ShJ and EZ contributed to conception, design, statistical analysis and manuscript drafting.
