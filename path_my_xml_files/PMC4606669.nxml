In man's constant battle against pain, the greatest achievement was the discovery of anesthesia. Since then the search for an ideal anesthetic agent is in progress.

Certainly pain in difficult, if not impossible, to quantify and OKESON has stated that &#x0201c;pain is personal psychological experience and observe can play no legitimate part in the direct measurement. The overall control of pain in minor oral surgical procedures, besides of the tissue handling, consists of the ability to place accurately an anesthetic solution in proper anatomical relationship to the structures to be operated upon. Despite this, there is no doubt that the majority of patients who now attend for treatment can be managed without resort to anything other than the conventional method of regional blockage or local analgesia.</p><p>The present study was done to determine the effectiveness of 2% mepivacaine with 1:80,000 adrenaline in comparison with lidocaine hydrochloride with 1:80,000 adrenaline, as local anesthetics in surgical extraction of bilateral mesioangular impacted third molars. Mepivacaine belongs to amide group of local anesthetics, which acts by decreasing the rate of depolarization of action potential in nerve fibers by impending the initial rise in sodium conductance, thus preventing the generation of conduction of nerve impulses.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The lipid solubility is the most important determinant of anesthetic potency. The potency of mepivacaine is approximately slightly more or equal to that of lidocaine.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The degree of the protein binding of a local anesthetic directly determines the duration of anesthesia. Mepivacaine has got a high affinity for the protein components of nerve and, therefore, is less liable to diffuse from the injection site and be absorbed into systemic circulation. The mean duration of anesthesia for mepivacaine in this study was 177.17 min. Thus, the duration of action of mepivacaine is slightly greater than the duration of lignocaine.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This does not coincide with the earlier studies of Gabreilo,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Bella.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Mepivacaine was found to provide satisfactory anesthesia in the present study without the occurrence of any complication or side effects. The depth of anesthesia of intra-operative anesthesia with mepivacaine has been found to be superior to that with lidocaine in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Postoperative pain assessments were made using a standard VAS and VVS, which are sensitive to and simple means of pain assessment. The result showed there was a significant reduction in pain, experienced by mepivacaine group between 2 and 3 h postoperatively. Maximum postoperative pain is usually experienced in the first 6&#x02013;8 h. The use of mepivacaine with a longer duration of action reduces the postoperative pain, discomfort, and analgesic intake during the immediate postoperative period. In the present study, the mean analgesic consumption for the first 4 days shows less for mepivacaine group (4.000 tablets) compared to lidocaine group (4.170 tablets). The difference was found to be statistically insignificant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.335). This is in tune with the earlier studies of Porto <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Although the anesthetic agent does not have effect on pain and inflammation directly, longer-acting local anesthetics may allow the patients to rest more easily and thus permit the body to withstand pain more effectively during the 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained relatively constant in the current study, and no statistically significant differences were found between the two local anesthetic agents. This is in agreement with other authors who reported no change in blood pressure with the administration of adrenaline containing a local anesthetic.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Lidocaine and mepivacaine with the same vasoconstrictor have similar action and both solutions are effective in surgical procedures.
