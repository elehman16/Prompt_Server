Participants (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;159) were 65 percent male, 40 percent Hispanic, and an average age of 30 (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9.8).

Injury from alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes is a leading cause of premature death and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Even after individuals with a first offense attend required alcohol education programs, rates of recidivism are high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite a decline in recidivism between 1990 and 1996 in California, rates of DUI incidents in the state have remained stable since 2010.</p><p>In California, individuals with a first-time DUI conviction must complete a state-licensed DUI program in order to regain their driver&#x02019;s license [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Programs are didactic and lecture-based and provide strategies to reduce drinking and driving, education about alcohol, and presentations by panels of victims whose lives have been affected by a DUI incident [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Unfortunately, DUI programs have had only modest effects on recidivism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In 2011, there was no significant difference in the rates of 1-year crash and DUI incidents in California between individuals with a DUI conviction who were court-assigned to a DUI program and those who were not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This finding is consistent with the general literature showing that educational-type lectures do not have any effect on behavior change among individuals with alcohol use disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>A more effective approach towards behavior change may be a counseling method that focuses on exploring an individual&#x02019;s reasons for change and helping them develop a change plan that is meaningful for them. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a collaborative counseling style that strives to strengthen a client&#x02019;s commitment to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; it is grounded in theories of self-determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Treatment approaches grounded in these theories empower an individual&#x02019;s motivation to change, reaffirm their autonomy, and guide people toward change if they are ready. MI could be particularly acceptable among individuals with DUI convictions who may vary considerably in their motivation to change. For example, some individuals may be ambivalent about changing their drinking and driving behaviors, whereas others may be very motivated to change because of the adverse event or &#x0201c;teachable moment&#x0201d; they experienced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>MI is flexible and tailors the intervention content based on the individual&#x02019;s readiness to change. Counselors use processes such as engaging (establishing a connection), focusing (establishing goals such as behavior change), evoking (eliciting the client&#x02019;s motivations to change), and planning (committing to change and developing a plan) to individualize sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Within the context of a DUI program, individuals who are not ready to change may benefit most from counselors who spend time engaging the individual and establishing rapport; individuals in later stages or those who are already moving toward change may be better helped by planning when to use problem-solving strategies and in ways to increase their commitment to action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Although many studies have shown the effectiveness of MI in other settings (e.g., college, primary care, substance abuse treatment) compared to no treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], in-person interventions are limited by the availability of trained counselors, training costs, and the challenge of implementing the approach uniformly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For example, research shows that counselors attending MI workshops often lose MI proficiency over time unless they receive ongoing feedback and coaching post-training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, it is important to think about ways to utilize MI that may be more cost-effective and consistent. Web-based interventions that utilize MI principles (web-MI) may be a promising approach.</p><p>Web-MI makes it possible to disseminate evidenced-based approaches with high fidelity because the content is programmed and automated. Web-MI has been shown to be effective in reducing at-risk drinking among college students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and adults in the general population and military [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Web-MI has also been effective in reducing smoking among English and Spanish speakers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], as well as drug use among postpartum women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While some web-MIs are being explored in criminal justice settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], web-MI has not been tested in DUI settings. Few studies have compared the effectiveness of web-MI to active comparison groups (i.e., other interventions that include alcohol content) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Existing research studies have typically compared the effects of a stand-alone web-MI to an assessment-only group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and they generally show small effect sizes at short-term follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Although even small effects may be clinically meaningful, more research is needed to improve their comparative effectiveness and determine whether these interventions may serve as an adjunct to more intensive approaches.</p><p>The current study evaluated the acceptance and efficacy of web-MI and in-person MI interventions among a diverse sample of individuals with a first-time DUI offense. This Stage 1b trial focused on determining participant acceptance of the intervention and intervention feasibility, and predicting the likely size of intervention effects for future trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We randomly assigned individuals enrolled in a DUI program to usual-care (UC-only), in-person MI plus UC, or web-MI plus UC. Given the pilot nature of this work, our primary aims were to evaluate the acceptance and efficacy of these MI interventions on alcohol-related outcomes compared to UC-only. We hypothesized that participants in the in-person and web-MI interventions would have greater acceptance and reduced alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences compared to UC-only.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting and design</title><p>Project REACH (Rethinking Avenues for Change; in Spanish, <italic>REtomondo Avenidas para el Cambio Hoy</italic>) was conducted in collaboration with the Los Angeles County Alcohol and Drug Program Administration (ADPA) and three private DUI programs under ADPA&#x02019;s regulatory authority. All clients received UC. Consenting clients were randomized to one of three conditions: UC-only, UC plus in-person MI, or UC plus web-MI using randomized block sampling with equally-sized blocks of six.</p><p>All procedures were approved by the institution&#x02019;s IRB. Because of the sensitivity of collecting data while clients were enrolled in the DUI program, participants were told that our Certificate of Confidentiality protected their privacy from any civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding at the federal, state, or local level and that participation in the study would not affect the services to which they were entitled.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study conditions</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Usual care</title><p>UC consisted of nine 2-h group sessions, twelve 1-h educational classes, and six community-based 12-step meetings. The 2-h group sessions were unstructured support groups that encouraged participants to examine their own personal attitudes and behavior and receive support for their alcohol or drug problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the beginning of the study, we conducted focus groups with UC clients who reported that sessions were focused mainly on the consequences of DUI and heavy drinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention conditions</title><p>We conducted focus groups with DUI program staff and clients to develop the in-person MI intervention for this population. Next, we adapted the in-person intervention for the web, and then conducted individual usability testing interviews with web-MI clients who were already enrolled in the DUI program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We used the usability feedback to iteratively revise the interventions. We developed the interventions simultaneously in English and Spanish in order to create interventions that were culturally equivalent. The current pilot study evaluates the final revised intervention created from these formative assessment procedures.</p><p>Both the in-person MI and web-MI interventions consisted of one 45-min individual session and two 10-min booster sessions that were delivered by the same facilitator. Each session was different. The goals of the MI interventions were to reduce drinking and alcohol-related problems. The content of both the in-person and the web-MI intervention was adapted from earlier MI work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and covered similar content, but the efficacy of the revised interventions had not been tested until the current pilot study. The first session included normative personalized feedback in the following areas: (1) how their drinking and estimates of others&#x02019; drinking compared to other men/women their age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]; (2) their positive beliefs about drinking and the balanced placebo design experiment, which describes how alcohol expectancies (i.e., actual vs. expected effects) can influence drinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]; (3) their negative consequences from drinking, including their estimated blood alcohol content values; and (4) strategies for avoiding consequences in the future. Participants who were ready to change their drinking were asked to discuss a drinking-related goal they wanted to work on before the next booster session. We then used rulers to assess their confidence and willingness to work on that related goal. If the participant was not ready to change, the facilitator went straight to the rulers.</p><p>The in-person and web-MI booster sessions were formatted similarly and included a check-in about the participant&#x02019;s drinking and goals from the previous session (e.g., &#x0201c;Last session, you said that you would try to stop your drinking by not going to happy hour. How did that go for you?&#x0201d;). Booster sesssions provided an opportunity to talk about new strategies to stop drinking, if they were willing, and to discuss their confidence and willingness to change using rulers with a 1&#x02013;10 scale (e.g., not confident to very confident).</p><p>The style of the MI interventions was as important as the content. Both web-MI and in-person MI interventions used core MI skills, such as open-ended questions, affirmations, reflective statements, and summaries to convey a nonjudgmental and non-confrontational style [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For example, the in-person MI manual had examples of open-ended questions and reflective statements that facilitators could use, and these same statements were used by the narrator in the web-MI intervention. Both interventions emphasized the underlying spirit of MI (e.g., collaboration, evocation, acceptance, compassion).</p><p>While the web-MI intervention incorporated the same sections of the in-person MI intervention, we used artificial intelligence (e.g., automatic responses tailored to the participant&#x02019;s responses) and personalized feedback to tailor the intervention to the participant so that each session was interactive. For example, we used audio recordings and videos to share personalized feedback from the participant&#x02019;s baseline survey (e.g., &#x0201c;We asked you what your drinking was like and you said you drank 4&#x000a0;days a week.&#x0201d;); asked questions that participants could respond to and receive tailored audios/videos based on those responses [e.g., &#x0201c;What do you think of this information?&#x0201d; (participant clicks &#x0201c;I&#x02019;m surprised&#x0201d;); &#x0201c;It is very common to be surprised by this information and wonder if the numbers are correct&#x02026;&#x0201d;]; used interactive exercises (&#x0201c;Click a number that best describes your mood when you start to drink. What happens to your mood as you continue to drink?&#x0201d;); and elicited change talk (e.g., &#x0201c;For the confidence ruler, why a 4 and not a 0?&#x0201d;). The web-MI intervention was narrated by a female Latina, and text captions were also available at the bottom of the screen. It was programmed at a 5th-grade reading level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>Participants were individuals 21 and older convicted of a first-time DUI offense and who had entered one of the three participating 3-month DUI programs. Upon enrolling in the program, program staff asked clients if they could be contacted about a research study. Interested clients completed a consent-to-contact form. Consenting clients were contacted and screened for 5th-grade completion (because of the nature of our self-report instruments) and at-risk drinking, using a score of 3 or higher for women or 5 or higher for men on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test consumption questions (AUDIT-C; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]). These cut points perform well, with high sensitivity and specificity in screening for at-risk drinking in the general population (men: &#x0003e;90&#x000a0;%, women: 80&#x000a0;%; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]). Approximately 52 percent were ineligible for the study based on low AUDIT-C score and education (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram. *Denominator is total screened for eligibility (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;387); **denominator is number eligible (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;185); ^denominator is number randomized (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;159); ^^denominator is number allocated to each group (IP-MI n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;51, web-MI n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;54, UC n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;54)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13722_2015_39_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Participants (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;159) were randomized to one of the three conditions. Participants assigned to either of the two MI interventions were asked to complete their first individual session by the third week of entering the DUI program, and their booster sessions by their ninth and eleventh week in the DUI program, respectively. The timing of these intervention sessions was meant to correspond with the beginning, middle, and end of a participant&#x02019;s 3-month DUI program. As noted earlier, participants in both MI interventions had the same number of sessions as participants in the UC-only condition because their MI sessions replaced two 12-step meetings. All MI intervention sessions were delivered in a private office at the DUI program where UC groups took place. A total of 138 participants were successfully assessed at follow-up (86.8&#x000a0;%).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Procedures</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Client data collection</title><p>We used in-person interviews to assess DSM-IV criteria for past-year alcohol abuse and dependence.

Raters met weekly to discuss coding discrepancies and reconcile questions to maintain inter-rater agreement. UC sessions were not coded because not all individuals attending these groups were enrolled in the study, so it was not possible to record these sessions.</p><p>To monitor web-MI intervention fidelity, our web program measured the number of minutes each participant spent in each session.

We collected client acceptance/satisfaction data immediately following the first session. At baseline and at 3-month follow-up, we collected data on alcohol use.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Client ratings of quality and satisfaction</title><p>Participants in all three conditions answered questions about the quality of and their satisfaction with the experience. Participants were asked, &#x0201c;How would you rate the quality of your session?&#x0201d; on a 4-point Likert scale, with a higher score representing higher quality. Satisfaction was measured using 22 items that were averaged (e.g., This program was respectful of my background; I felt the program respected where I was at with my alcohol and that any change was up to me; The program valued my opinion). Additional items included questions about the usefulness, quality, impact, and helpfulness of the session. They also were asked nine questions rating their session facilitator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>MI intervention fidelity</title><p>MITI 3.1 was used to code competency and adherence to in-person MI, and integrity was measured through global scores and behavioral counts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The MITI 3.1 has five global scales (evocation, collaboration, autonomy/support, direction, and empathy) that are scored from 1 (low) to 5 (high), with a score of 3.5 indicating beginning proficiency and 4 indicating competency. The rater also counts the number of specific behaviors that occur during each coded segment, including the number of open questions and closed-ended questions, MI-adherent and nonadherent statements, and simple and complex reflections. Whereas global scores have a limited range (1&#x02013;5), behavioral counts utilize a running tally with no upper end on the scale; thus, these scores can vary by session.</p><p>Twenty percent of the in-person MI sessions (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10) were randomly selected for double-coding. We calculated prevalence-adjusted, bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] to assess inter-rater agreement for each global score by dichotomizing the 1&#x02013;5 scale into 1&#x02013;3 (MI beginning proficiency) and 4&#x02013;5 (MI competent). The PABAK scores for the global scores of evocation, collaboration, autonomy/support, direction, and empathy were 0.6, 0.2, 0.6, 1.0, and 0, respectively, while the agreement averaged 72 percent across the global scores. We also calculated intraclass correlations (ICCs) between raters for each behavioral count. These ICCs ranged from 0.30 (MI-adherent) to 0.91 (closed questions), and averaged 0.69 across the behavioral counts. Since the distribution of MI-nonadherent behavioral counts was skewed toward 0 (with only one value among the coders that was neither 0 nor 1), a kappa statistic was computed instead to assess inter-rater agreement for reporting any versus no MI-nonadherent behaviors (PABAK&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Client outcomes</title><p>Outcomes included changes in drinking behaviors and related consequences in the past 3&#x000a0;months. We examined the intensity and frequency of drinking in the past 3&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Drinking frequency was measured by asking how often participants drank alcohol in the past 3&#x000a0;months. Reponses ranged from 0 (&#x02018;Never&#x02019;) to 10 (&#x02018;Every day&#x02019;). We converted these response categories to a pseudo-continuous variable to easily interpret the results as the number of days. Drinking frequency ranged from 0 to 90&#x000a0;days (e.g., &#x02018;Never&#x02019;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0&#x000a0;days, &#x02018;Less than Once a Month&#x02019;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;days). Drinking quantity was measured by asking the respondent the typical number of drinks on a given occasion. Days of reported heavy drinking, defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men, was also transformed from a categorical variable to a pseudo-continuous variable ranging from 0 to 90&#x000a0;days, as described above for drinking frequency. Drinking and driving in the past 3&#x000a0;months was reported on a categorical scale ranging from 0 (&#x02018;Never&#x02019;) to 10 (&#x02018;Every day&#x02019;). Due to the skewed distribution of this variable, we created a dichotomous version to indicate any drinking while driving in the past 3&#x000a0;months.

To compare the baseline characteristics of clients assigned to each condition, we used Chi squared tests for categorical variables and one-way ANOVAs for continuous variables.

Covariates included in the model were those characteristics identified as significant (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.1) in bivariate analyses with the outcomes. These included days of marijuana use in the last 3&#x000a0;months and average number of drinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

Dummy variables for web-MI and in-person MI, with the comparison condition as the hold-out category, were included in all models.

Participants in both the in-person and web-MI intervention conditions rated the quality of and satisfaction with their session higher than participants in the UC-only condition, suggesting that clients were more receptive to the MI interventions. Clients viewed the in-person MI more favorably than web-MI, which may be related to the stronger therapeutic alliance often found in the in-person interactions compared to web-based interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, we did not find statistically significant differences in outcomes between the MI conditions and UC-only condition. In fact, regardless of study condition, participants reported significant reductions in both alcohol consumption and risk behaviors. Thus, at program completion, participants from all three study conditions reported reduced alcohol consumption, DUI, and fewer alcohol-related consequences.</p><p>There were at least two unexpected results from our study. First, despite recruiting individuals with a first-time offense into the study, 67 percent of our sample met criteria for alcohol dependence, and the majority of participants in all three study conditions continued to report alcohol-related consequences at follow-up. From our previous discussions with DUI providers, we anticipated a larger percentage of at-risk versus dependent drinkers, and therefore designed the MI intervention for an at-risk population rather than a population with dependence. Our second unexpected result was that participants from each of the MI interventions did not report differences in their outcomes when compared to UC-only. We had hypothesized that because our MI interventions were focused on exploring behavioral change and developing a change plan, we would see significant improvements in individuals who received the MI interventions compared to individuals who only received UC.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for these findings. First, the extensiveness of UC services (i.e., 36 program hours) in these DUI programs may have been sufficient to improve outcomes in the short term, and an additional 3-session MI (i.e., about 65&#x000a0;min) may not have had an additive effect on outcomes. Second, our follow-up timeframe was short. We were only able to measure outcomes at the conclusion of clients&#x02019; 3-month DUI program. Receiving a DUI and having to deal with the numerous financial, emotional, and social consequences (e.g., vehicle impoundment, jail time, probation, injury) related to this type of event may be significant enough to reduce a client&#x02019;s alcohol-related behaviors in the short term, but might not be enough to sustain long-term changes such as reductions in recidivism (D&#x02019;Amico et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). This speaks to the challenge of conducting research in DUI programs that have strong behavioral expectations and high sanctions for failing those expectations. Longer follow-up assessments (e.g., 6&#x000a0;months to one year after program completion) may be needed to better understand whether MI interventions and UC are differentially associated with sustained behavior change after a client completes a DUI program. Finally, MI interventions may not be the best fit for individuals with a first-time DUI offense, given the high levels of dependence that were reported in this study. Future studies should evaluate whether alcohol dependence is as common in other first-time DUI offense programs. If dependence rates are similarly high in other programs, more intensive treatment approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy or medication-assisted therapy may be more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. MI interventions may still be used to enhance engagement prior to these more intensive and long-term approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] or they may be a better fit as a preventive intervention with individuals who are at risk for a future DUI but who have not yet been convicted. Determining which therapy or combination of therapies is associated with long-term changes should be the subject of future research.</p><p>In conducting community-based work, it is always important to examine lessons learned to help inform future research. Although MI is an evidence-based treatment that has been successful as a brief intervention in a variety of settings, it may be important to have more sessions for this more severe population. The population and providers were very receptive to MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and it could perhaps be integrated into the lengthy UC treatment and provided in this group setting as with other mandated populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Given that clients felt that the MI intervention was of higher quality and were more satisfied with it than UC, integrating MI into UC could help standardize services provided to clients, help make the program more acceptable to them, and perhaps increase attendance, which could lead to better outcomes.</p><p>Our sample was recruited from DUI programs in California and may not be representative of clients in DUI programs nationally. Of note, about 52 percent of our sample was excluded mostly due to low AUDIT-C at program entry, which also affects generalizability. In addition, inter-rater agreement on the MITI was low for five measures, suggesting improvements in measure performance and/or the process for coding those items are needed for future studies. It is also important to note that under-reporting of DUI behaviors might be an issue, given the setting. The limitations of self-report data are well-known, although much research has shown that self-report is valid when procedures such as those used in the current study are implemented (e.g., establishing rapport and discussing confidentiality) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p>This pilot study addresses an important policy question by examining whether individuals with a first-time DUI offense find MI interventions acceptable in a DUI setting and whether clients who receive an MI intervention have improved outcomes relative to UC. Findings suggest that participants from all three conditions experienced improved outcomes, regardless of study condition. Although it is possible that a longer follow-up may provide insights into whether within-group differences are sustained, we hypothesize based on our effect sizes and confidence intervals that between-group differences in a larger future trial with this population are not supported by the data. Instead, given that individuals with a first-time DUI offense are likely a unique population of individuals who may be experiencing consequences related to alcohol dependence, future research is needed to better understand the potential heterogeneity of this population and to determine the most appropriate level of care for these high-risk individuals to reduce long-term recidivism.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>In some cases, individuals might enter the DUI program more than 3&#x000a0;months after their DUI arrest.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KCO, KEW, EJD, and SMP conceptualized the study and obtained funding.
