Theory-based process evaluations conducted alongside pragmatic randomised trials address this by assessing whether the intervention changes theoretical constructs proposed to mediate change. The Ontario Printed Educational Materials (PEM) cluster trial was designed to increase family physicians&#x02019; guideline-recommended prescription of thiazide diuretics. The trial found no intervention effect. Using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), we hypothesised that changes in thiazide prescribing would be reflected in changes in intention, consistent with changes in attitude and subjective norm, with no change to their perceived behavioural control (PBC), and tested this alongside the RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We developed and sent TPB postal questionnaires to a random sub-sample of family physicians in each trial arm 2&#x000a0;months before and 6&#x000a0;months after dissemination of the PEMs. We used analysis of covariance to test for group differences using a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3 factorial design. We content-analysed an open-ended question about perceived barriers to thiazide prescription. Using control group data, we tested whether baseline measures of TPB constructs predicted self-reported thiazide prescribing at follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Four hundred twenty-six physicians completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires. Baseline scores on measures of TPB constructs were high: intention mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.9 out of 7 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.4), attitude mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.8 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1), subjective norm mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.8 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1) and PBC mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.2 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0). The arms did not significantly differ post-intervention on any of the theory-based constructs, suggesting a possible ceiling effect. Content analysis of perceived barriers suggested post-intentional barriers to prescribing thiazides most often focused on specific patient clinical characteristics and potential side effects.

In the province of Ontario in Canada, 21&#x000a0;% of the adult population has an elevated blood pressure, with prevalence rising as a function of age to 52&#x000a0;% in those aged 60&#x02013;79 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Rates in Ontario are largely consistent with prevalence rates across Canada as a whole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While numerous hypertension medication options are available for managing hypertension, thiazide diuretics are among the most well tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], have cardiovascular protective effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and have been consistently recommended as first-line agents in clinical practice guidelines for managing uncomplicated hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. They are also the least expensive and, if more widely used, would result in substantial annual savings if used over more expensive drug options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In spite of this, thiazides are not prescribed as often as other antihypertensive drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Reviews of disseminating printed educational materials (PEMs) suggest that they can be effective in promoting health professional behaviour change in some instances but not in all, and there is wide variation in effectiveness and methodological rigour between existing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The large factorial cluster randomised Ontario Printed Educational Messages (OPEM) trial (and associated TRY-ME sub-trial) for promoting thiazide diuretic prescription was designed to address the limitations of previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This trial tested the effectiveness of short and long educational messages (in this case, PEMs) for increasing thiazide prescription to elderly patients with uncomplicated hypertension, a recommended antihypertensive drug that is at least as effective as other classes of antihypertensive at reducing morbidity and mortality while being less expensive. The trial found <italic>no evidence</italic> that PEMs increased the number of patients receiving thiazide diuretics. While the size and rigour of the trial provide convincing evidence that the PEMs were not effective for changing this clinical behaviour, the trial was not designed to investigate the reason for this lack of effect. There is a need to better understand the possible mechanisms that mediate intervention effects in RCTs of implementation interventions to gain insight into how effective interventions change behaviour and why ineffective interventions do not. A challenge for implementation researchers is to develop methods for exploring these causal mechanisms alongside rigorous tests of implementation interventions.</p><p id="Par8">There is increasing recognition of the value of process evaluations alongside trials of complex interventions such as professional behaviour change interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Process evaluations complement outcome evaluation by investigating how an intervention may work; how it is delivered, the mechanisms through which effects may operate and its contextual moderators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Process evaluations can offer robust explanations of why an intervention fails to improve health care (or even does harm) by assessing whether or not the intervention changes the proposed mediators of improved outcomes. Process evaluations often involve the ad hoc selection of context-specific indicators of process and use quantitative and/or qualitative methods to provide a detailed assessment of processes rooted in the context of the trial. Rather than ad hoc selection of process indicators, selecting indicators informed by theories of behaviour is an arguably superior approach to understand the determinants of the outcome. In turn, this could increase the ability to generalise findings to other clinical problems, professional groups and settings.</p><p id="Par9">Behavioural science has systematically operationalized theories concerning determinants of behaviour and how they are associated with each other. This may be useful for understanding the mechanisms underlying implementation interventions designed to change clinicians&#x02019; behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Such theories employ standard definitions of constructs and measurement methods, which may be useful for exploring causal mechanisms of implementation interventions by testing whether intervention effects operate via hypothesised mediating pathways. Theory-based process evaluations can therefore contribute to the accumulation of a knowledge base of how implementation interventions might operate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Using theory to explore mediating mechanisms of behaviour change interventions is commonplace in some fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and shows promise for greater use in exploring the mechanisms of action in implementation interventions where healthcare professional behaviour change is involved. For example, Ramsay and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] conducted a post-intervention theory-based process evaluation of two interventions aiming to reduce inappropriate test-ordering evaluated within a randomised trial. The process evaluation focused upon investigating the causal mechanisms of the intervention for three of the targeted tests. They showed that behavioural intention partially mediated the intervention effect in two of the three tests assessed and suggested that the lack of mediation for the third test may have partly been an function of a ceiling effect on intention. Hrisos and colleagues conducted a theory-based process evaluation alongside an intervention designed to change physicians&#x02019; intentions and found that a persuasive communications intervention was mediated by theory-based constructs (attitude and subjective norm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These examples demonstrate the utility of drawing upon behavioural theory to hypothesise and test the mediating mechanisms of interventions for promoting health professional behaviour change.</p><p id="Par11">When interventions are explicitly theory-based, the selection of a particular theory upon which to base the process evaluation is straightforward and can explicitly tie the intervention to potential mediating pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, many implementation interventions are designed pragmatically without an explicit theoretical basis but likely involve an implicit model of how the intervention may change clinicians&#x02019; behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Such implicit models can be to some extent reverse-engineered by examining the description of the intervention content, which provides an indication of the factors the intervention designers assumed needed to change. Thus, with sufficient intervention description, implicit models can be mapped onto theoretical constructs that are likely to be changed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Linking these constructs back to a theoretical model that includes such constructs provides a basis for assessing mediating mechanisms through which the intervention effects can be hypothesised to operate regardless of whether the intervention itself is explicitly theory-based.</p><p id="Par12">The theory of planned behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] (TPB) is a social cognition model of behaviour with well evidenced predictive utility across a number of populations and behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Applied to clinicians&#x02019; thiazide prescribing behaviour, the TPB proposes that the most proximal antecedents of whether a clinician will perform a behaviour (in this case, prescribing thiazides) are their intention to perform the behaviour (whether they want to prescribe thiazides) and their perceived behavioural control (PBC) over the behaviour (whether they believe that they can prescribe thiazides). Their intention is in turn determined by three underlying cognitive constructs: their attitude (i.e., are they in favour or against prescribing thiazides), their subjective norm (their views of whether others think they should prescribe thiazides) and their PBC (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A systematic review showed that studies using the TPB explained 59&#x000a0;% of the variance in intention and 35&#x000a0;% of the variance in health professional behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Behavioural theory has also been used to evaluate the process of trials of implementation interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] suggesting that behavioural theory may contribute to building a cumulative understanding of why implementation interventions are successful or not.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The theory of planned behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2016_485_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par13">PEMs are a mode of delivering information. An implicit model might suggest a direct relationship between knowledge and behaviour change; however, such a model is not consistent with evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The relationship between providing information and achieving behaviour change is more complex. When information is evidence-based and presented by a credible and influential source, it may be persuasive and could plausibly improve clinicians&#x02019; motivation to prescribe by altering their beliefs about consequences (e.g. attitude) and highlighting the social influences (e.g. subjective norm) of prescribing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The TPB captures the motivational constructs that PEMs might plausibly influence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Given the TPB&#x02019;s evidenced predictive validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], it was arguably an appropriate model for evaluating the process of behaviour change in the pragmatic intervention tested in the OPEM trial.</p><p id="Par14">That said, the TPB is not without its limitations and critics, and there is debate in some literatures about whether to retire the theory altogether [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, the TPB is not the only behavioural theory that could be selected to explain the process of behaviour change in implementation interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Nevertheless, given the plausibility that PEMs may change behaviour through a motivational process, the TPB provides a replicable mediation model and measurement methods for understanding how behaviour change might operate through a motivational process in health professionals. Furthermore, using the TPB as a basis for process evaluation using an experimental design provides an opportunity to test the tenets of the theory itself, further contributing to the evidence to inform the utility of the theory moving forward. And irrespective of the theory itself, the TPB provides a potentially useful methodological exemplar for hypothesising and investigating mechanisms of action alongside trials of implementation interventions. We hypothesised that the OPEM intervention would be most likely to operate by changing physicians&#x02019; intention to prescribe thiazides to elderly patients due to improved attitude or subjective norm with little or no change in perceived behavioural control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Summary of the main OPEM trial and OPEM TRY-ME sub-trial intervention</title><p id="Par15">The detailed methods of the OPEM trial, the OPEM TRY-ME sub-trial and this theory-based process evaluation are available in the published protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

The Target was &#x02018;this woman&#x02019; (referring to a description provided in the contextualising scenario); &#x02018;prescribing thiazide diuretics&#x02019; was the Action; the Context was the 4th visit since her last annual physical (described in the scenario); and Time was (implicitly) during the consultation described in the scenario.</p><p id="Par22">We supplemented TPB measures with context-specific items and self-reported past behaviour.

We used a non-parametric analysis (Kruskal-Wallis test) to see whether results were robust against violations of assumptions. Low levels of missing data (&#x0003c;7&#x000a0;%) on TPB variables suggested that listwise deletion to handle missing data would be appropriate. We tested the appropriateness of the missing data strategy by re-running the analyses using two modified versions of the data: one which replaced all missing TPB values with data most supportive of our hypotheses and another replacing with data most opposed to our hypotheses.</p><p id="Par26">We extracted demographic data from a physician database for a random sample of 20&#x000a0;% of respondents and non-respondents to the pre-intervention questionnaire to test for non-response bias.

Nevertheless, the theoretical basis of this process evaluation provides a viable foundation for interpreting the trial&#x02019;s null findings, which may inform and help to optimise future interventions. This process evaluation contributes to and builds on the growing literature on theory-based process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] by developing methods, employing them alongside the OPEM trial, and hypothesising a priori the process through which trial effects would operate.</p><p id="Par37">At baseline, the sample of physicians reported strong intention (they wanted to prescribe thiazides), positive attitude (they believed prescribing thiazides is a good idea), high subjective norm (people important to them thought they should prescribe thiazides), and strong PBC (they believed that they could prescribe thiazides) over prescribing thiazides. Medium/large changes in intention are often reflected in small/medium changes in behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; given how high the reported intention was in the process evaluation in all trial arms, we would expect that a ceiling effect precludes even a medium effect in the main trial. The theoretical basis suggests that PEMs were ineffective because they aimed to educate and persuade physicians about performing a behaviour that they already strongly intended to do.</p><p id="Par38">In open-ended questions, family physicians highlighted patient-related clinical complications as reasons why elderly patients <italic>may</italic> not be prescribed thiazides, reflecting beliefs about negative consequences associated with prescribing to patients with complications or side effects. However, attitude towards prescribing was positive, suggesting these negative beliefs did not represent overall attitude towards prescribing thiazides and therefore may not be influencing motivation and behaviour. Such findings nevertheless suggest that future intervention to improve thiazide prescribing could involve patients&#x02019; views and behaviour as well.</p><p id="Par39">Despite strong intention to prescribe, self-reported (6.63 of last 10 patients) and observed (28&#x000a0;% in main trial data) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] thiazide prescription rates at baseline and follow-up did not reflect guideline recommendations. While prescription to every elderly patient with newly diagnosed uncomplicated hypertension may not always be appropriate and self-reported rates are likely an over-estimation of actual prescribing rates of thiazides, there nevertheless remains considerable room for improving thiazide prescription. This also suggests that while intention played a necessary role in prescribing thiazides, additional factors may have moderated the translation of these strong intentions into higher prescription rates. The TPB focuses largely on the predictors of intention (&#x02018;pre-intentional&#x02019; factors) but does not include any post-intentional factors to explain how intention is translated into action. This may have implications for interventions that only include techniques designed to increase motivation: had the OPEM interventions increased physicians&#x02019; intention to prescribe thiazides, post-intentional barriers may still have limited actual behaviour change had it been observed.</p><p id="Par40">This process evaluation provides an inherent test of the TPB in two ways: predictive utility and explanation of behaviour change. We showed that the TPB&#x02019;s predictive efficacy was consistent with systematic review evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, we could not assess whether the TPB explains behaviour change, as there was none to explain. Support for the TPB would require both a change in behaviour and a change in one or more TPB constructs, while evidence against the TPB would require a change in behaviour without any associated change in TPB constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; neither were possible here. Nevertheless, whether the TPB sufficiently captures all possible routes to behaviour change that a PEM may provide is debatable. There have been increasing calls from the literature to consider theories of behaviour that move beyond the TPB towards focusing on (in addition to attitudes, subjective norm, PBC and intention) post-intentional factors, habit, and automaticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and the role of team and organisational factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Lessons learned and recommendations for conducting theory-based process evaluations</title><p id="Par41">This process evaluation may help to advance methods of conducting theory-based process evaluations alongside RCTs of implementation interventions to help to understand the mechanism of effect (or lack thereof). We offer the following recommendations based on our experience. Theory-based process evaluations conducted alongside randomised controlled trials should in as far as is possible:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par42">
<italic>Reflect the trial&#x02019;s design, including comparison and control group(s)</italic>: For the OPEM process evaluation, this involved surveying a random sample of physicians from each of the main trial&#x02019;s arms to meet the sample size requirements.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">
<italic>Collect data from trial participants pre- and post-intervention to control for baseline differences</italic>: We surveyed physicians at two time points, before and 6 months after the intervention, in all trial arms. We showed this to be feasible, and the pre-test data demonstrated that there was little room for improvement in process measures from the start, which would not have been possible using a post-test only design.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">
<italic>Use previously tested theoretical models to provide&#x000a0;consistency with the literature, generalizability, and foster a cumulative knowledge base</italic>: A key purpose of a scientific theory is to summarise existing knowledge. By selecting an established theory with constructs that could plausibly explain the mechanism of action of an education-focused intervention, the findings can be compared against the existing literature, thereby facilitating future evidence syntheses and informing future PEM-based interventions.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">
<italic>Hypothesise the mediating mechanism a priori and conduct a mediation analysis if effects detected on primary and/or secondary trial outcomes</italic>: We demonstrated how drawing upon a theory of behaviour provides the basis for hypothesising how the intervention&#x02019;s mechanism of action might operate through this model. The challenge, particularly for interventions developed without a theory, remains in selecting and operationalizing a plausible theory for explaining the intervention effect. Whether the most plausible theory was selected in the present study is not clear given the lack of change in either process or outcome measures. Nevertheless, selecting a theoretical model that proposes a mediation pathway provides a basis for testing its mechanisms of action when possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">
<italic>Conduct formative theory-based investigations of determinants of the targeted behaviour prior to the trial</italic>: The present study was conducted opportunistically alongside a pragmatic trial, and the findings helped to clarify why the intervention as specified was not effective in increasing thiazide prescribing. Ideally, the content of the PEMs might have been informed by formative research to investigate potential barriers and enablers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. While such approaches were not commonplace at the time the trial was conducted, future PEM-based interventions would benefit from assessing and addressing (in as much as is possible within the PEM-based method of delivery) the factors that may prevent change. Such formative investigations can also inform theory selection and early phase questionnaire research to ensure that there is &#x02018;room for improvement&#x02019; in the anticipated mechanism of change prior to the trial and its process evaluation.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">
<italic>Assess the fidelity with which the intervention has been received, read, and responded to by the target participant</italic>: In the present study, we could not assess the extent to which recipients read the PEMs, which could be an effect modifier. Building in fidelity assessment alongside mechanistic process evaluation is advised when possible.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par48">This process evaluation provides a theoretical basis upon which future implementation interventions targeting increased thiazide prescription could draw instead of &#x02018;going back to the drawing board&#x02019;. In well-informed and motivated health professionals, if PEMs only deliver content targeting motivation, this may not be sufficiently potent. Instead, methods of delivering techniques that address post-intentional barriers to prescribing thiazides may be preferred. In such instances, theories of behaviour change such as the health action process approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and dual process models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] that include and go beyond motivation would be more informative than motivational models such as the TPB.</p><p id="Par49">A strength of this study is its use of a well-tested theory of behaviour operationalized according to best recommended practice to investigate the underlying mechanisms of an implementation intervention. By matching the 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3 factorial design of the OPEM trial and assessing TPB cognitions before and after the intervention was delivered, we quantified existing levels of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, and intention, providing an explanation for the lack of change in behaviour observed in the OPEM trial. While we showed strong internal consistency on all measures, some social desirability bias may have led to over reporting. However, this seems unlikely given the relatively low self-reported behaviour (mean six of last ten patients) and confidential nature of the data collection. Future research would benefit from assessing social desirability bias in questionnaires to health professionals. This study is also limited by an inability to link theory-based constructs to objective measures of behaviour from the main trial. This process evaluation is also limited by an observed response bias towards physicians who are part of a university and part of the College of Family Physicians of Canada, who may have had greater access and exposure to evidence prior to the OPEM trial and may have had more positive attitude and intention relative to the full trial sample. Our response rate was a further limitation, despite our evidence-based efforts to maximise recruitment to this study. However, the response rate was similar to other theory-based studies with health professionals and underscores the recognised challenge of recruitment and retention of health professionals in such studies. Our qualitative analyses helped to supplement our quantitative findings with additional contextual insight. Future theory-based process evaluations could be well served to also assess such contextual factors quantitatively to investigate whether they may operate as moderators of the intervention alongside the mediated mechanisms of change.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par50">By conducting a pre-post theory-based process evaluation matched to the factorial design of the main trial, this study advances the methodology of conducting process evaluations alongside randomised trials of implementation interventions and demonstrates the potential utility of drawing upon theory for interpreting the results of pragmatic trials. In this case, pre-existing strong intention, subjective norm, and positive attitude provide a theory-based explanation of why dissemination of printed educational materials may not result in a change in physicians&#x02019; prescribing behaviour. The use of printed educational materials for increasing prescription rates may therefore be ineffective when physicians&#x02019; pre-existing motivation to prescribe is strong. Future efforts at increasing prescription rates should consider targeting post-intentional factors.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par57">
