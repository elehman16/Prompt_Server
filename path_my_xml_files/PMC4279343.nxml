Propofol, an ultra-short-acting sedative agent, has been used widely for endoscopy. It can provide safe and effective sedation for all gastrointestinal procedures;[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, the related airway obstruction and apnea may be risky, especially in geriatric patients. Sevoflurane (fluorinated methyl isopropyl ether) is a nonpungent inhalational anesthetic with a rapid induction and quick elimination.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Because of these characteristics, sevoflurane was successfully used for sedation.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sevoflurane-based sedation technique for colonoscopy in geriatric patients as compared with that using propofol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The Ethical Committee of Burjeel Hospital approved this prospective randomized study. Sixty patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II, &#x02265;60 years old), who were scheduled for colonoscopy during a 6-month period (October 2013-March 2014), formed the study group, and their informed written consents were obtained. The patients with body mass index &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or obstructive sleep apnea were excluded. The patients were randomly allocated (using closed envelope technique) into two groups; P and S. All patients were sedated using either propofol in P group or sevoflurane in S group.</p><p>On arrival to the endoscopy room, an IV line was inserted, the basic standard monitoring lines were applied (non-invasive blood pressure [BP], oxygen saturation [SaPO<sub>2</sub>], electrocardiogram) and the basal readings were recorded. In both groups, 0.5 mg/kg propofol IV was administered. In P group, a clear plastic mask was applied. In S group, a nasal airway was inserted and connected to a semi-closed anesthesia circuit (Datex-Ohmeda Aespire view) (GE Healthcare3030 Ohmeda Drive P.O. Box 7550 Madison, WI 53707-7550 U.S.A.). A low flow rate of 4 L/min of 100% O<sub>2</sub> was started for both groups. A capnogram sample line was placed under the oxygen mask in P group and connected to the circuit in S group. The sedation was maintained using propofol increments (0.25 mg/kg) in P group and with sevoflurane (started at 1%) in S group. The sevoflurane concentration and the frequency of propofol increment injection were adjusted to achieve a sedation level 3 of observer alertness assessment score (OAAS) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Fentanyl 25 mcg supplementation was used in the event of pain.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>observer alertness assessment score</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-9-19-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Apnea, the need for airway intervention, the occurrence of general anesthesia (GA) and other complications (laryngospasm, oxygen desaturation, and postoperative nausea and vomiting [PONV]) were recorded. The mean arterial blood pressure (MBP), heart rate, SaPO<sub>2</sub> and respiratory rate (RR) were recorded at four intervals; baseline, insertion of colonoscope, cannulation of the cecum, and at the end of the procedure. The fentanyl requirement and the times of the procedure, recovery, and discharge were also recorded. Apnea was defined as a lack of spontaneous respiratory effort for 20 s, detected by visual monitoring and capnogram. Airway intervention was defined as any action taken to improve and/or restore ventilation including; jaw thrust, insertion of nasal or oral airway, and ventilatory-assist maneuvers. The airway intervention was undertaken on the judgment of the operator anesthetist. When unarousable, the patient was considered to have GA. Oxygen desaturation was defined as SaPO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;90% for &#x0003e;60 s. The procedure time was defined as the time between colonoscope insertion and withdrawal. The recovery and discharge times were defined as the time between withdrawal of the colonoscope until postanesthesia care unit (PACU) transfer (OAAS = 5) and until the patient discharge from PACU (ability to walk unassisted), respectively.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Based on previous results (dd), a sample size estimate was calculated.

The safety was assessed by the frequency of apnea, degree of desaturation, the need for airway intervention and occurrence of GA, laryngospasm, and the hemodynamic instability. The effectiveness was determined by the ability to achieve grade 3 OAAS with early recovery and discharge.</p><p>The elderly population represents a heterogeneous group of individuals with widely variable functional and reserve capacities. Aging is associated with a gradual deterioration of organ function furthermore, in some patients, there is a wide disparity between their chronologic and physiologic ages.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The patients&#x02019; safety is of utmost and important priority during anesthesia and/or sedation. Many sedation techniques have been described for colonoscopy.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Sevoflurane sedation has been used safely during administration of regional or local anesthesia;[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] however, to our knowledge, it has not been used for colonoscopy yet. Propofol is considered as the standard agent for sedation in colonoscopy. Compared to other traditional sedative agents, propofol can provide an adequate depth of sedation with rapid recovery, high postanesthesia recovery score, and good patient cooperation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It also decreases the incidence of PONV and improves the patient's satisfaction.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Therefore, propofol sedation has been considered as a safe technique that can be administered by nurses under physician-endoscopist monitoring.</p><p>In this study; the apnea, occurrence of GA and the need for airway intervention were more frequent with the use of propfol than that with sevoflurane. This difference may be due that propofol lacks any analgesic activity and so a high dose is required to perform a painful procedure.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This usually results in a deep level of sedation, respiratory and cardiac depressions.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] When propofol sedation is administered by nonanesthesia personnel, the incidence of occurrence of GA (or a deeper sedation level) may reach up to 88%. This increases the risk of respiratory depression, airway obstruction, and hemodynamic instability.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The use of propofol may be also associated with oxygen desaturation (SapO<sub>2</sub> &#x02264;90%) which incidence may reach 9%. The use of supplemental oxygen delays the occurrence of hypoxemia and consequently the detection of apnea during which the CO<sub>2</sub> level may rise to a dangerous level.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Therefore the CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring is important to allow early detection and intervention; however, its exact value is false low (because of dilution occurring in the nasopharynx and under the open O<sub>2</sub> mask).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In this study, both groups were comparable as regards the hemodynamics stability. In contrast, some studies showed that propofol was associated with significant hypotension (BP decrease &#x0003e;20 mmHg) in 27% of patients.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Even a very low dose of propofol (0.4 mg/kg) was associated with 17 mmHg decrease in BP.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This may be attributed to a combination of decreases in basal sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and in the reflex control of SNA.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Minimizing the sedation recovery time may improve acceptance of colonoscopy use for cancer screening and prevention.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In this study, both group had a comparable the recovery and discharge times.</p><p>All the above drawbacks may have more serious consequences in geriatric patients (with associated co-morbidities) and supportive intervention may be necessary. In spite of the sevoflurane safety, it was delivered using a nasal airway which is a convenient way and well tolerated. However carful insertion is required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In colonoscopy, sevoflurane can provide safe and effective sedation alternative to
