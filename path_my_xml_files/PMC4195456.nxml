Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction plays a major role in CHF and progression of most cardiac diseases. The current recommended goals can theoretically be accomplished via exercise and pharmacological therapy so the aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of cardiac rehabilitation program on diastolic dysfunction and health related quality of life and to determine the correlation between changes in left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Forty patients with chronic heart failure were diagnosed as having dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The patients were equally and randomly divided into training and control groups. Only 30 of them completed the study duration. The training group participated in rehabilitation program in the form of circuit-interval aerobic training adjusted according to 55&#x02013;80% of heart rate reserve for a period of 7&#x000a0;months. Circuit training improved both diastolic and systolic dysfunction in the training group. On the other hand, only a significant correlation was found between improvement in diastolic dysfunction and health related quality of life measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. It was concluded that improvement in diastolic dysfunction as a result of rehabilitation program is one of the important underlying mechanisms responsible for improvement in health-related quality of life in DCM patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cardiac rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Dilated cardiomyopathy</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a multi system syndrome. Although initiated by a reduction in cardiac function, it is characterized by the activation of compensatory mechanisms, which involve the whole body: hemodynamic, autonomic and neuro-humoral changes may be initially beneficial, but subsequently becomes dominant and lead to perpetuation of the syndrome <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a primary myocardial disease of unknown cause characterized by left ventricular or biventricular dilation and impaired myocardial contractility <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Patients with DCM have both increased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction of less than 45%. By definition, diastolic dysfunction refers to abnormalities in ventricular relaxation and filling (right ventricle, left ventricle, or both) with prolonged or incomplete return to pre systolic length and force <xref rid="b0015 b0020" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref>. Three stages of diastolic dysfunction are recognized based on Echo-Doppler transmitral flow. Stage I is characterized by reduced left ventricular filling in early diastole with normal left ventricular and left atrial pressures and normal compliance (E/A ratio less than 0.8, E wave deceleration time more than 200&#x000a0;ms). Stage II or pseudo-normalization is characterized by a normal Doppler Echocardiography transmitral flow pattern because of an opposing increase in left atrial pressures (E/A ratio 0.8&#x02013;1.5, E wave deceleration time more than 200&#x000a0;ms). Stage III or reversible restrictive pattern, the final and most severe stage, is characterized by severe restrictive diastolic filling with a marked decrease in left ventricular compliance (E/A ratio more than 1.5, E wave deceleration time 150&#x02013;200&#x000a0;ms), stage IV or irreversible restrictive pattern ((E/A ratio more than 1.5, E wave deceleration time less than 150&#x000a0;ms) <xref rid="b0025 b0030" ref-type="bibr">[5,6]</xref>. In patients with heart failure, the exercise capacity may be limited by the number of frequently coexisting factors such as decreased contractility, diastolic dysfunction, chronotropic incompetence, oxygen metabolism or skeletal muscle mass <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. During peak exercise, the heart should increase the cardiac output and the diastolic mechanisms must adjust to the decrease in time to fill. Patients with heart failure may not be able to achieve this necessary increase in diastolic relaxation to accommodate the preload increase <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Severity of effort intolerance is linked with left ventricular filling pressure and so the strong relationship between diastolic abnormalities and exercise limitation should be not underscored <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Exercise training has become an accepted adjunct therapy for patients with systolic dysfunction. It is considered to be beneficial in terms of improved mortality and morbidity, quality of life and functional capacity <xref rid="b0050 b0055 b0060" ref-type="bibr">[10&#x02013;12]</xref>. Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a detailed, disease-specific health status measure that encompasses domains including physical limitation, symptoms, disease severity, and change in status over time, self efficacy, social interference and quality of life <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Although health related quality of life (HRQoL) and functional capacity may be correlated, they are not synonymous and represent different components of health status <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Functional status is a direct measure of the ability to carry out specific tasks with significant physical or symptom limitation. In contrast, HRQoL reflects the discrepancy between the patient&#x02019;s current function and their expected health status so it increases with increasing concordance between the actual and expected health <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Previous studies showed a significant improvement in all aspects of HRQoL after comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program for ischemic and non ischemic heart failure patients <xref rid="b0050 b0080" ref-type="bibr">[10,16]</xref>. On the other hand decreased exercise capacity is a main factor restricting every day life of chronic heart failure patients, thus compromising their quality of life <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Exercise training could improve the exercise capacity of these patients. Although this improvement is primarily due to peripheral adaptations, and partly due to central adaptations <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, the contribution of left ventricular diastolic filling to the improved quality of life had not been well defined .As many patients with advanced heart failure give greater importance to quality of life than do to duration of life, so the purpose of this study was primarily to determine the effect of cardiac rehabilitation program on diastolic dysfunction and quality of life; an important end point in the assessment of cardiac rehabilitation program and to investigate the correlation between improvement in both measurements in DCM patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Subjects and method</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Subjects</title><p>Forty male patients with symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy and only 30 of them completed the study. They were diagnosed by echocardiography and coronary angiography. Patients were recruited from National Heart Institute in Imbaba, Giza, out patient clinic which accepts and follows many of chronic heart failure patients daily and had to have expertise cardiologists. Their ages ranged from 50 to 65&#x000a0;years old. The patients had more than an 8-month history of DCM and had been clinically stable for more than 3&#x000a0;months prior to the onset of study period. The patients were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: The diagnosis of DCM was made by: (i) the lack of history of typical chest pain, (ii) the absence of signs of ischemia or myocardial infarction at the electrocardiogram; (iii) global dilation of both ventricles at the echocardiogram with no regional left ventricular dyskinesia; and (iv) the presence of normal thallium scintigraphy and normal coronary angiogram, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension &#x0003e;5.5&#x000a0;cm and end-systolic diameter &#x0003e;4.5&#x000a0;cm, fractional shortening &#x0003c;25% and ejection fraction &#x0003c;45%, sinus rhythm, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II&#x02013;III, Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in the form of reversed, pseudo normal or restrictive pattern (grades I, II, and III, respectively). The exclusion criteria included the following; significant coronary disease by history or angiography to exclude ischemic causes, evidence for secondary causes of cardiomyopathy as long standing or uncontrolled hypertension, primary valvular disease, atrial fibrillation (AF), severe functional mitral regurgitation (MR), clinical evidence of pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive lung disease, moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension).</p><p>They were on optimal medical therapy with no major changes in treatment regimen during the study. All patients in the training and control groups were medically controlled by expertise cardiologist who was blinded to grouping assignment. Patients were under chronic non-selective beta blocker; Carvedilol (Dilatriol 6.25&#x000a0;mg, twice daily). Also all patients were on Digitalis (0.25&#x000a0;mg), Furosemide (40&#x000a0;mg), and Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Patients were randomly assigned into training and control groups and they were informed about the nature and effects of trial. All of them were under medical treatment. For the training group, periodic adjustment of intensity throughout the training program was done according to the individual&#x02019;s progression of exercise capacity. The training subjects received information regard the benefits of regular aerobic exercise and were asked to report any side effects during the treatment session. The patients in the control group remained on their individually tailored cardiac medication supervised by their physicians and to keep them motivated through the study through frequent visits each 2&#x000a0;weeks to receive the simple disease information sessions. The activities of the patients in the control group were checked to avoid any extra unadjusted effort by applying of the questionnaire interview every 2&#x000a0;weeks (physical limitation domain, question number 15 for quality of life domain which revealed their usual activities). The patients were also instructed not to perform extra unadjusted effort over the ordinary effort (some of these patients had mild limitation with the ordinary daily living activities and others had marked limitation with the ordinary daily living activities) as this may affect their results on the final assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Patient randomization</title><p>According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, forty patients were eligible to participate in the study. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups (training and control groups) by arrangement into numerical numbers from 1 to 40, then odd numbers were allocated as a training group and the even numbers were allocated as a control group. The training group consisted of 20 patients who received interval aerobic training program for 3&#x000a0;days/week (day another day) for 7&#x000a0;months, in addition to simple disease information sessions aimed to reinforce patient education about chronic heart failure signs and symptoms, ensure compliance with medications, identify recurrent symptoms amenable to treatment, advice on how to live with heart failure and special emphasis was given to dietary counseling (recognition and self management of fluid overload). The control group consisted of 20 patients who received only the same disease information sessions received by the training group through frequent visits every 2&#x000a0;weeks.

Each patient was examined in the supine, left lateral position, according to the standards of the American Society of Echocardiography <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Ejection fraction was calculated using two dimension view (2D). Pulsed Doppler mitral flow velocity analysis was obtained from the apical four chamber view. Care was taken to position the cursor line through a plane traversing the left ventricle from the apex to mitral valve annulus in order to achieve the smallest possible angle between left ventricle inflow and the orientation of the ultrasound beam. The sample volume was set in the mitral orifice on the atrial side between mitral leaflet tips during diastole. In each patient, Left ventricular diastolic flow velocity from five cardiac cycle&#x02019;s waves was obtained and averaged. The duration between echocardiography examination and cardiopulmonary exercise testing was not more than 1&#x000a0;week. The assessment was done by a single senior member of cardiology team (consultant) who was blinded to patient allocation and the contact between him and the patients was limited to the day of evaluation procedure before and after the study period. E/A ratio was considered to be normal if it was 0.78&#x02013;1.78 and E wave deceleration time 150&#x02013;200&#x000a0;ms <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Peak valsalva maneuver was applied using forceful expiration against closed nose and mouth as a preload reduction maneuver to differentiate pseudo normal pattern from true normal pattern in patients with E/A ratio in the range of 0.8&#x02013;1.8. The patient must generate a sufficient increase in the intrathoracic pressure. A decrease of 20&#x000a0;cm/s in mitral peak E wave velocity was considered an adequate effort. Using valsalva maneuver, pseudo normal pattern was reverted to stage I diastolic dysfunction (impaired relaxation phase) and this group was confirmed to be pseudo normal pattern instead of true normal.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)</title><p>The test was done by a single specialized physical therapist consultant, expertise in cardiopulmonary fitness assessment for cardiac patients and he was blinded to the patient allocation as the patients&#x02019; contact with the investigator was generally limited to the day of procedure before and after the study period. Before conducting the exercise tolerance test, all participants had to visit the laboratory to be familiarized with the equipment and to be cooperative during conducting the test. Brief explanation of the procedures was done, reminding the patient to wear loose-fitting comfortable clothes and suitable shoes for exercise. Patients were also instructed to avoid eating a heavy meal at least 3&#x000a0;h, coffee or cigarettes before testing. Pleasant environment is needed to obtain maximum confidence and performance by the patients. Patients continued to take routine medications before exercise testing.</p><p>The test was terminated in the following conditions: hypertensive blood pressure response greater than 200/110&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg, failure of systolic blood pressure to rise as the intensity of the work increases, fall of diastolic blood pressure about 15 or 20&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg, reached heart rate to target heart rate [(220-age)&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;85%], chronotropic incompetence dizziness, unusual shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle fatigue, leg pain, pallor or cold sweating, being unable to maintain cycling revolution above 40&#x000a0;rpm, ECG changes: arrhythmia, (e.g. AF, premature ventricular contraction more than 10/min), deviation of ST segment.</p><p>Spirometry test was conducted to exclude patient with obstructive lung disease: FEV1/FVC ratio &#x0003c;70&#x02013;60% of predicted and as a prerequisite for cardiopulmonary exercises testing. The patient mounted an upright electronically beaked computerized bicycle ergo meter with gas exchange analysis (breath by breath test). First, the metabolic parameters as (oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production) and heart rate were measured every minute. Blood pressure was also measured every 2&#x000a0;min by cuff sphygmomanometer. The measurement was also taken at rest for 3&#x000a0;min. All patients were subjected to a sub maximal symptom limited exercise testing on stationary ergo meter of the cardiopulmonary exercise test unit before the beginning of training programs according to Wasserman protocol <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Heart rate and ECG were continuously monitored during the test. The work rate was increased by a uniform amount each minute until the patient was limited by symptoms or unable to continue safely. The patient pedaled at constant rate of 40&#x02013;60&#x000a0;rpm, unloaded (0&#x000a0;W) for 3&#x000a0;min then an increment of 5, 10, 15&#x000a0;W/min for 10&#x000a0;min, depending on the expected performance of the patient, observing the patient&#x02019;s facial expression, checking the blood pressure and ECG recording for untoward changes and verbally encouraging the patient to maximize his performance. The resistance of the cycle was removed if any of the previous contraindicated signs and symptoms occurred. Resting heart rate, maximal heart rate and oxygen consumption during the recovery phase which should be continued for about 3&#x000a0;min or until the values measured before were reached. Oxygen consumption at peak exercise (peak VO<sub>2</sub>) was calculated as the average of VO<sub>2</sub> value over the final 30&#x000a0;s of exercise. All patients quit the test because of dyspnea or leg fatigue, and in all patients, the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was more than or equal to 1.33 and anaerobic threshold was reached.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire (KCCQ)</title><p>It is a self-administered 23-item questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

Whereas systolic dysfunction can be considered a defect in the ability of myofibrils to shorten against resistance, diastolic dysfunction results from an increased resistance to left ventricular filling leading to an inappropriate upward shift of the diastolic pressure&#x02013;volume relation <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.The ability to accommodate high volume loads has been demonstrated in athletes. This is done at low filling pressure; rather, the early relaxation is increased to provide for a suction force and high left ventricular compliance <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. A study done by Hamlin et al. <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> concluded that in patients with heart failure, the decreased ability to augment the diastolic relaxation is responsible for the inability to accommodate the increase in estimated preload during exercise, resulting in higher filling pressure. Patients with heart failure have a stiffer heart with inability to relax and accept the large volume of blood in shorter period of diastole at high heart rate <xref rid="b0160 b0165" ref-type="bibr">[32,33]</xref>. A recent meta-analysis of 14 trials that included 812 heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction, those in exercise training groups tended to maintain their left ventricular function (ejection fraction and end-systolic and end-diastolic value) better than patients in the control arm of these studies. Interestingly, when exercise training combined with resistance training, the anti remodeling effects were no longer present. Perhaps the pressure overload associated with resistance exercise training negatively counter balances the favorable adaptations associated with exercise training <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The work of Belardinelli et al. <xref rid="b0175 b0180" ref-type="bibr">[35,36]</xref> showed improvement in diastolic dysfunction represented in early and late diastolic filling after 2-month exercise training study of heart failure patients with moderate to severe systolic dysfunction. Similarly improved left ventricular stiffness <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and reduced filling pressure <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> in heart failure patients had been reported in two other randomized, controlled trials of exercise training.</p><p>One of the earliest signs of diastolic heart failure is exercise intolerance due to exertional dyspnea <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In addition to that, patients who had systolic dysfunction, regardless to severity, diastolic dysfunction influences clinical signs and symptoms and the degree of exercise tolerance <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In an attempt to resolve this issue, the present study was conducted to evaluate the impact of cardiac rehabilitation program mainly on diastolic dysfunction and health related quality of life and to determine the correlation between changes in left ventricular functions and domains of health-related quality of life. Regarding aerobic fitness; there was statistical significant difference in peak VO<sub>2</sub> between both groups in favor of the training group. The results also revealed a high statistical significant decrease in resting heart rate along with decrease in the maximal heart rate in the training group only with significant difference between both groups in the resting heart rate only. The results of this study were supported by numerous studies over the past two decades which have consistently demonstrated that exercise capacity of heart failure patients, best quantified by oxygen consumption at peak exercise which is 15&#x02013;40% below that of age-matched healthy subjects <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Based on Fick equation, an appropriate increase in peak VO<sub>2</sub> is dependent on both an increase in cardiac output (which depends on both appropriate heart rate and stroke volume responses) along with a concomitant widening of arterial-venous oxygen content difference (so increased oxygen extraction). The plethora of peripheral abnormalities in heart failure patients that limit oxygen supply and/or extraction by active skeletal tissues had been also described in these studies <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The results of the present study also go a head with Smart and Marwick <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> who conducted Meta-analysis on the functional capacity in heart failure patient after exercise training. His study concluded an increase by about 15&#x02013;17% following exercise training and peak VO<sub>2</sub> changes appear to be independent of the type of exercise training undertaken, for example, aerobic, intermittent or resistance training. The significant reduction in the resting heart rate showed in the present study could be related to decreased activation of adrenergic drive to the heart and vessels with augmentation for parasympathetic and decreased renin-angiotensin aldesterone system activation associated with enhanced vasodilative endothelial response <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. For echocardiography systolic parameters, the results showed high statistical significant difference between both groups in favor of the training group. The improved ejection fraction in the present conceded with Haykowsky et al. <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> who determined the effect of exercise training and type of exercise (aerobic versus strength versus combined training) on left ventricular remodeling in heart failure. The study was represented as meta-analysis and reviewed 14 trials reported on ejection fraction (EF) data, seven trials on both end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes data. Aerobic training significantly improved EF, end systolic volume (ESV), and end diastolic volume (EDV). Combined aerobic and strength training was not associated with significant improvements in EF, EDV, or ESV. The magnitude of the improvement in EF was consistent with the magnitude of benefits seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or cardiac resynchronization therapy. The improved ejection fraction may be attributed to reduction in left ventricle internal dimensions, increased left ventricular wall thickness with a greater contractile reserve along with reduction in total peripheral resistance which can be inferred from the decline of resting and maximal heart rate seen in the present study. Regarding the diastolic parameters, the study showed high statistical significant difference between both training and control groups with reversed diastolic pattern (grade I) in favor of the training group as regards to the percent of change in E wave, A wave and E/A. The results of the present study go a head with that reported by Belardinelli et al.<xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> who studied the effect of aerobic training on diastolic filling pattern in 55 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (18 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and 37 patients with DCM). The patients were prospectively assigned to three subgroups before beginning of the training program according to the diastolic filling pattern dysfunction. Most of the idiopathic DCM in this study had a restrictive filling pattern. The training group underwent a supervised program of exercise training with the intensity adjusted to be 60% of peak VO<sub>2</sub>, three times per week for 8&#x000a0;weeks. The results revealed that training-induced significant improvement in exercise capacity in patients with DCM and a pattern of abnormal LV relaxation (grade I).The results of Belardinelli et al. contradicted with the present study in that, his study showed no change in left ventricular ejection fraction or chamber dimensions. The difference may be attributed to the sample in the previous study included both ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy patients and most of the DCM patients in the previous study had a restrictive filling pattern. On the other hand, most of DCM patients in the present study had reversed and pseudo normal patterns. As diastolic dysfunction progresses, reduction in left ventricular compliance coexists with impairments in myocardial relaxation leading to large increases in the left atrial pressure. Elevations in left atrial pressure increase the pressure gradient between left atrium and left ventricle, ultimately enhancing early filling as manifested by high E wave velocity, so increase in E wave velocity alone(rapid filling phase) seen in the present study after training in patients with grade I diastolic dysfunction cannot determine improvement or worsening of the cases. Patients grade I diastolic dysfunction usually do not have symptoms at rest but may experience mild functional impairment. On the other hand, patients with grade II and III diastolic dysfunction experience moderate functional limitation and severe functional limitation, respectively. Maximal exercise capacity as well as symptoms triggered by exercise is directly related to increased pulmonary capillary pressure and therefore, to increase left ventricular filling pressure. Filling pressures so are directly related to left ventricular diastolic function <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Mura et al., <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> concluded that peak oxygen consumption correlated significantly with left ventricular filling pattern estimated by transmitral Echo-Doppler E/A ratio and A wave velocity. Based on the previous literature and the results of the present study which showed a significant increase in peak oxygen consumption in all patients of the training group (except for one patient in grade III) and significant increase in E/A ratio in grade I diastolic dysfunction (median value, 0.98) associated with significant decrease in A wave velocity (median value, 73), as showed in <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. It could be concluded that cardiac rehabilitation program caused an improvement in diastolic dysfunction, especially for patients with grade I. This improvement was also associated with improved exercise capacity. This was confirmed by the results of Belardinelli et al. who stated that dilated cardiomyopathy patients who had cardiac events had significantly higher values on E wave, rapid filling fraction, resting heart rate associated with lower values on peak VO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>The improvement seen in the present study could by the consequence of augmented left ventricular early relaxation with an increase of suction of blood from the left atrium. This adaptation may help to accommodate the increase in the filling rate at low filling pressures at higher heart rate <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In patients with diastolic dysfunction, an increased heart rate and shortened diastolic time can lead to abnormal increase in left atrial filling pressure and an inability to increase forward flow <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Exercise training can affect diastolic function by decreasing heart rate, altering calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and inducing physiological hypertrophy <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Exercise training can also induce time-dependent reduction in sarcoplasmic-triphosphatase pump which accelerate Ca<sup>+2</sup> uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum along with facilitation of internal exchange of Ca<sup>+2</sup> between sarcoplasmic reticulum and alternate Ca<sup>+2</sup> stores <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. All of the above findings can accelerate early ventricular relaxation. Regarding the percent of change in functional and clinical summary scores of KCCQ, there was high statistical significant difference between both training and control groups with reversed diastolic pattern (grade I) in favor of the training group (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0004, 0.0001, respectively).</p><p>Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire (KCCQ) is a recently developed disease-specific instrument for measuring health-related quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure. It reports on more dimensions and is more sensitive to change than some other questionnaires <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In out patients with heart failure complicating an acute myocardial infarction, KCCQ overall score was strongly associated with subsequent cardiovascular events in that those with a score &#x02a7e;75 had an 84% 1-year event free survival compared with 59% for those with a score &#x0003c;25 <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In a study designed by Heidenreich et al. and Sullivan et al. <xref rid="b0250 b0255" ref-type="bibr">[50,51]</xref>, there were significant association between KCCQ scores and a range of clinical variables; 1&#x000a0;year mortality was fourfold greater and hospitalization was fivefold greater, in those scoring less than 25 compared with those scoring 75 or above. This sample included broad range of heart failure etiologies, increasing the generalisability of these findings. There was a significant association between peak VO<sub>2</sub> and KCCQ quality of life score, while ejection fraction did not have strong association with KCCQ domains, in a study conducted to evaluate association between peak VO<sub>2</sub>, clinical measures and commonly used symptom and functional tools in patients with heart failure and to determine the extent to which of these tools could be used to predict peak VO<sub>2</sub>
<xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In the present study, there was significant proportional relationship between percent of change in E/A ratio and functional summary score along with significant inverse relationship between percent of change in A-wave velocity and functional summary score in the training group only. Also there was the same relation between percent change in clinical summary score of KCCQ, percent change in A-wave velocity and E/A ratio in the training group. On the other hand no correlation was detected between percent of change in ejection fraction and percent of change in both summary scores in both groups. Rector et al., <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> supported the results of the present study; they concluded that symptoms of heart failure explain a substantial proportion of the variation in the effects of heart failure on patient quality of life. Pathologic measures of heart failure including ejection fraction correlates with the risk of hospitalization and death but not strongly related to symptoms or quality of life. It is therefore apparent that traditional physical measures and quality of life measures assess different constructs and should not be substituted for one another <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Clinical outcomes focused mainly on mortality rates, but interest in HRQoL has developed as the patient have expressed preferences for quality over quantity of life. On the other hand, ejection fraction values in the present study seemed to cluster around certain values, rather than representing a smooth continuum, suggesting the possibility of clinical estimation. From the above findings, it could be concluded that improvement in diastolic dysfunction in dilated cardiomyopathy patients after cardiac rehabilitation program in the form of individualized aerobic exercise training program (circuit-interval training) may be one of the principal factors responsible for improved quality of life along with exercise capacity in chronic heart failure patients diagnosed as having dilated cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec id="s0135"><title>Limitations</title><p>Three noteworthy limitations exist in this study; the generalization of these results outside a clinical trial setting may be limited. It is possible that patients in this study received more attentive follow up and better treatment that would occur in other out patient clinical practice setting. Left ventricular diastolic filling patterns assessed by transmitral Echo-Doppler are influenced by a variety of factors such as valvular insufficiency, loading conditions, viscoelastic properties of the myocardium and ventricular compliance. However all patients in this study were controlled by medications that were not changed through the study period and all of them had mild degree of mitral regurge. Also the training induced reduction in the resting heart rate was evident in all DCM patients. By contract, improvement of diastolic dysfunction in grade I diastolic dysfunction was more apparent, suggesting that factors other than training-induced bradycardia can be involved in diastolic dysfunction improvement. Although the number of patients with reversed diastolic pattern (grade I) in the training group was more than that in the control group, the statistical analysis showed no significant difference in the measured diastolic parameters before the study between both groups with high statistical significant difference after the study, so it is unlikely that this could affect the results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s0140"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation program is beneficial for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy in terms of improving systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction and health-related quality of life.
