Prevalence of severe anaemia varied from 12% in Kenya to 41% in eastern Uganda. 1,387/3,082 (45%) children were transfused (81% within 8&#x000a0;hours). Adherence to WHO transfusion guidelines was poor. Among severely anaemic children who were not transfused, 52% (54/103) died within 8&#x000a0;hours, and 90% of these deaths occurred within 2.5&#x000a0;hours of randomisation. By 24&#x000a0;hours, 128/1,002 (13%) severely anaemic children had died, compared to 36/501 (7%) and 71/843 (8%) of those with moderate and mild anaemia, respectively. Among children without severe hypotension who were randomised to receive fluid boluses of 0.9% saline or albumin, mortality was increased (10.6% and 10.5%, respectively) compared to controls (7.2%), regardless of admission Hb level. Repeat transfusion varied from &#x02264;2% in Kenya/Tanzania to 6 to 13% at the four Ugandan centres. Adverse reactions to blood were rare (0.4%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Severe anaemia complicates one third of childhood admissions with serious febrile illness to hospitals in East Africa, and is associated with increased mortality. A high proportion of deaths occurred within 2.5&#x000a0;hours of admission, emphasizing the need for rapid recognition and prompt blood transfusion. Adherence to current WHO transfusion guidelines was poor. The high rates of re-transfusion suggest that 20&#x000a0;mL/kg whole blood or 10&#x000a0;mL/kg packed cells may undertreat a significant proportion of anaemic children. Future evaluation of the impact of a larger volume of transfused blood and optimum transfusion management of children with Hb of &#x0003c;6&#x000a0;g/dL is warranted.</p><p>Please see related article: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-014-0248-5">http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-014-0248-5</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12916-014-0246-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Africa</kwd><kwd>Anaemia</kwd><kwd>Blood transfusion</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>FEAST trial</kwd><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd>Sepsis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>In sub-Saharan Africa, severe anaemia in children is a leading cause of hospital admission, a major cause of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and is responsible for a high proportion of the 660,000 malaria-related deaths that are estimated to occur each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although timely transfusion can be lifesaving, equitable access to adequate supplies of safe blood for transfusion remains a key challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. In order to preserve this scarce resource and to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections, guidelines developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) encourage the rational use of blood transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, adherence to the guidelines is variable, and transfusion recommendations vary between countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Hb was measured using the HaemoCue Hb 301 system (HaemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden), a portable point of care Hb testing kit that is factory calibrated (without need for recalibration), and using disposable microcuvettes that require no calibration between batches. The measurement range is 0 to 25.6&#x000a0;g/dL, and results are available in 10&#x000a0;seconds. Children were managed on general paediatric wards, with no facilities for ventilation other than short-term &#x02018;bag and mask&#x02019; support. Training in triage, identification, and definitions of adverse events related to fluid management (including transfusion) were given prior to and throughout the trial, and were included in the trial manual of operations that was given to every team member.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Blood transfusion</title><p>Clinicians at all sites followed national and WHO blood transfusion guidelines (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Hb levels were checked at 8, 24, and 48&#x000a0;hours post-randomisation, and at any other time point if there was clinical suspicion of severe anaemia or deterioration. Repeat blood transfusion was permitted when Hb levels fell below transfusion thresholds.

The prevalence of anaemia, jaundice, and malaria, number of blood transfusions, and mortality at 48&#x000a0;hours and 28&#x000a0;days were summarised by site.

To assess adherence to WHO guidelines within the FEAST trial, we therefore examined the factors most strongly associated with blood transfusion in children with Hb &#x02265;5&#x000a0;g/dL. A time-updated Cox regression model for time to first transfusion was fitted for those with baseline Hb of &#x02265;5&#x000a0;g/dL. Regression models were first calculated for each risk factor individually, adjusting for randomisation arm, Hb at baseline, and most recent Hb at 8 or 24&#x000a0;hours. A multivariable, time-updated Cox regression model, similarly adjusted, was then constructed by stepwise backwards elimination, including study site and clinical indications for transfusion, where available (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Using variables found to be risk factors for time to first transfusion, multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for randomisation arm, was used to describe baseline risk factors for re-transfusion.

All children recovered fully.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have used data from a large randomised clinical trial of fluid resuscitation strategies to describe the prevalence, clinical features, and blood transfusion management of anaemia in children presenting to six hospitals in malaria-endemic regions of Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania with severe febrile illness and clinical signs of impaired peripheral perfusion. The majority (76%) of the 3,082 children in this study were anaemic on admission, while one third (33%) were severely anaemic. The prevalence of severe anaemia varied from 12% in Kenya to between 23 to 43% in Uganda, where an increased proportion of children presented with jaundice, severe pallor, and haemoglobinuria. Almost half of all patients (including 94% of those with severe anaemia) were transfused, while 10% received two or more transfusions. The frequency of repeat transfusion varied between sites, from &#x02264;2% in Kenya and Tanzania to between 6% and 13% at the four sites in Uganda. Adherence to WHO transfusion guidelines was poor. There was no evidence of an association between randomisation arm and risk of subsequent transfusion. Adverse reactions to blood were rare (0.4%). In-patient mortality at 48&#x000a0;hours was 10%, while 91% of all deaths (92% among severely anaemic children) occurred within 24&#x000a0;hours of admission. Among severely anaemic children who were not transfused, 52% (54/103) had died by 8&#x000a0;hours, and 90% of these deaths occurred within 2.5&#x000a0;hours of randomisation. Mortality among children randomised to receive fluid boluses with saline or albumin was significantly increased by 3.3% compared to controls, regardless of admission Hb level.</p><p>Globally, the prevalence of anaemia and severe anaemia is highest among young children in low- and middle-income regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although micronutrient deficiencies, infectious and parasitic diseases, and haemoglobinopathies contribute to the multifactorial aetiology of severe childhood anaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], malaria plays an important role in endemic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The prevalence of severe anaemia in our study sites was lowest in Kilifi, Kenya, where malaria transmission is seasonal and of intermediate intensity, and highest in Mbale and Soroti (Eastern Uganda), where malaria transmission is perennial and intense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The prevalence of confirmed bacteraemia (sepsis) was similar across all anaemia categories.</p><p>To be eligible for the FEAST trial, children had to have respiratory distress or impaired consciousness, plus one or more signs of impaired perfusion. &#x0201c;Respiratory distress&#x0201d; is a term used to describe the subjective clinical impression of increased work of breathing. Historically, respiratory distress in children with severe malarial anaemia has been considered synonymous with congestive cardiac failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], though subsequent work suggests that metabolic acidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and hypovolaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] may be central to the pathophysiology. The increased proportion of severely anaemic children in this study with clinical signs of dehydration, impaired peripheral perfusion, hypotension, and severe lactic acidosis supports this hypothesis. In contrast, the prevalence of chest indrawing, an accepted feature of acute lower respiratory tract infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], was similar across each of the anaemic and non-anaemic groups. Mortality of hospitalised children with asymptomatic severe malarial anaemia is ~1%, increasing to 35% when associated with deep breathing and/or lactic acidosis and impaired consciousness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Clinicians participating in the FEAST trial were free to follow WHO and national transfusion guidelines. WHO guidelines (on which most national guidelines are based) advise transfusion for all children whose Hb level is 4&#x000a0;g/dL or less, regardless of concomitant symptoms. Transfusion guidance for children with Hb of 5 to 6&#x000a0;g/dL is less clear-cut, since it depends upon the presence of one or more additional clinical or laboratory criteria, for which the evidence base is limited. Several of these criteria (&#x0201c;shock&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;clinical dehydration&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;impaired consciousness&#x0201d;) are not defined in the guidelines, while others (&#x0201c;cardiac failure&#x0201d;) cannot be accurately diagnosed at the bedside. Malaria parasitaemia (&#x0201c;malaria parasitaemia &#x0003e;10%&#x0201d;) is not routinely quantified in many hospitals throughout Africa. When guidance is ambiguous, or in situations where clinicians lack confidence in the accuracy of Hb results produced by their local laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], their decision to transfuse may be based on a subjective assessment of clinical severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our multivariable Cox regression model suggests that transfusion of children with Hb &#x02265;5&#x000a0;g/dL was associated with pallor, prolonged capillary refill time, lactate, and chest indrawing, but not with malaria parasitaemia, deep breathing, respiratory distress, prostration, coma, or dehydration. Pallor is an unreliable predictor of anaemia in hospital-based studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. There is an urgent need to obtain robust evidence on which clinical criteria (if any) should be used to guide transfusion of children with Hb levels of 5 to 6&#x000a0;g/dL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>As far as we are aware, this is the first report to document the frequency of repeat blood transfusion among patients with severe anaemia. Nearly half (45%) of all children in this study were transfused, while 23% of transfused children required re-transfusion. Children presenting with severe anaemia in Uganda were 5 to 8 times more likely to receive a second transfusion than children in Kenya or Tanzania, likely reflecting lower admission Hb levels (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) and an increased proportion of children (particularly in Mbale and Soroti) whose clinical presentation suggested intravascular haemolysis, highlighting the importance of repeat Hb measurement after blood transfusion, particularly in children with malaria parasitaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The highest proportion of repeat transfusions occurred in Mulago hospital, Uganda (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), the only site in which packed red cells were routinely available. Although this may reflect the increased ease of access to blood banking facilities within this tertiary level teaching hospital, it is possible that transfusion with 10&#x000a0;mL/kg of packed red cells provided inadequate treatment for children with severe anaemia.</p><p>The high proportion of repeat transfusions also suggests that 20&#x000a0;mL/kg whole blood may be insufficient for children with severe anaemia and ongoing haemolysis. Current WHO transfusion guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] recommend 20&#x000a0;mL/kg of whole blood or 10&#x000a0;mL/kg packed cells for children with Hb &#x02264;6&#x000a0;g/dL, yet standard calculations indicate that this under-treats children with profound anaemia (Hb &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;g/dL) by ~30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] Other researchers have shown a modest rise in Hb of 2.5 to 3.3&#x000a0;g/dL following initial transfusion of 20&#x000a0;mL/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], with post-transfusion Hb remaining &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;g/dL in ~25% of severely anaemic children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], as we found here. Multiple, low volume (20&#x000a0;mL/kg of whole blood) transfusions are wasteful, inefficient, and may expose children to an increased risk of transfusion reactions and blood-borne infection. Recent evidence suggests that transfusion of children with Hb &#x0003c;6&#x000a0;g/dL (median Hb 4.2&#x000a0;g/dL; interquartile range, 3.1 to 4.9) with 30&#x000a0;mL/kg of whole blood or 15&#x000a0;mL/kg of packed red cells is safe, and is associated with accelerated haematological recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This needs to be confirmed in a larger number of children, including those with Hb &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;g/dL, who may be compromised by the cardio-depressant effects of profound metabolic acidosis.</p><p>Although rapid blood transfusion in children with severe decompensated anaemia can be lifesaving, the majority of hospitals in sub-Saharan African have inadequate blood banking facilities and transfusion may be delayed until a donor is found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Consequently, ~60% of deaths among children with severe malarial anaemia occur within 4 to 6&#x000a0;hours of admission, often before transfusion can be administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In our study, 90% of severely anaemic children were transfused during the first 8&#x000a0;hours of admission, reflecting the efficiency of local transfusion services. By 8&#x000a0;hours, 4% (39/899) of these children had died, compared to 52% (54/103) of those who were not transfused; 90% of these deaths occurred within 2.5&#x000a0;hours of randomization, highlighting the critical importance of prompt transfusion. In contrast, 8-hour mortality of children with mild anaemia was higher among transfused children (8/35, 23%) than in those who were not transfused (29/808, 4%), suggesting (though numbers are small) that clinical signs of severe illness, unrelated to anaemia, may have prompted the decision to transfuse. Confining blood transfusion to children with moderate or severe anaemia would probably make better use of a scarce commodity, and might have averted some of the deaths that occurred among the severely anaemic children who were still awaiting transfusion at 8&#x000a0;hours.</p><p>The data presented here were obtained within the context of a large randomised trial of fluid resuscitation strategies for children with severe febrile illness and signs of impaired perfusion. Our study population therefore represents the most severe end of the spectrum of anaemic children presenting to hospital admission in sub-Saharan Africa and concomitant morbidity and mortality may consequently have been over-represented.</p><p>There has been much debate over whether the increased mortality that was observed in the FEAST trial among children randomised to receive fluid boluses of 0.9% saline or albumin was due to haemodilution of children who were already compromised by critically low levels of Hb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] . However, mortality of children who received fluid boluses was increased at all levels of admission Hb (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), with no evidence of heterogeneity between subgroups, strongly suggesting that this was not the case.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have described the prevalence, clinical features, and blood transfusion management of a large group of severely ill children admitted to six hospitals in East Africa. Our data confirm the importance of rapidly identifying sick, severely anaemic children and ensuring that they are promptly transfused. They also suggest that adherence to current WHO transfusion guidelines, even within the context of a clinical trial, is sub-optimal, and that transfusion with 20&#x000a0;mL/kg whole blood or 10&#x000a0;mL/kg packed cells may undertreat a significant proportion of anaemic children. A clinical trial to evaluate the impact of using a larger volume of transfused blood and determine the optimum transfusion management of children with Hb of &#x0003c;6&#x000a0;g/dL is underway (TRACT trial: ISRCTN84086586).</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12916_2014_246_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Figure S1.</label><caption><p>Kaplan Meier curves of time to first transfusion, by site and anaemia category.</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>FEAST</term><def><p>The Fluid Expansion As Supportive Therapy trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hb</term><def><p>Haemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JC, SK, and KM wrote the paper.
