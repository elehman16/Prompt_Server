The unbalanced randomisation ratio is included in the design for ethical purposes to ensure a maximum number of subjects are exposed to the active treatment, as it is expected to have a beneficial effect, whilst maintaining a sufficient sample size for the placebo group. Randomisation is further stratified according to the type of spasticity (symptomatic or asymptomatic). Allocation to treatment group and assignation of treatment number for drug dispensing will be managed by an interactive web response system (IWRS) using computer-generated lists organised by a statistician who is independent from the study. All data will be kept confidential and subjects will be anonymised using computer and web-based systems. Blinding of the 2:1 ratio for treatment allocation will be achieved by using two separate lists for randomisation and treatment numbering, with the ratio of initial supplies designed to be exactly balanced. Treatment resupply will be balanced to ensure that subject allocation cannot be deduced from the frequency of resupply; treatment packaging will be identical in appearance and smell.</p><p id="p0185">In case emergency unblinding is required for an individual subject, for example in the event of a serious or unexpected adverse event, the investigator may break the blind by asking the IWRS to obtain the subject's treatment identification, after consultation and review of the case with the sponsor's Global Patient Safety department.

In another phase II pilot study, 30 subjects received either BoNT-A (onabotulinumtoxinA, Botox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Allergan, USA) at prespecified reductions to the standard dose or placebo, within 3 weeks of stroke onset. Although there was no overall difference in improvement of arm function between groups, subgroup analysis revealed that subjects with more severe functional impairment might benefit from early injection of low-dose BoNT-A <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p id="p0310">The largest trial to date, the Asia Botulinum Toxin-A Clinical Trial Designed for Early Post-stroke Spasticity (ABCDE-S) study (NCT00234546), evaluated changes in upper limb muscle tone following one injection cycle of abobotulinumtoxinA or placebo in 182 subjects with MAS score &#x02265;1 within 2&#x02013;12 weeks of stroke.

Firstly, there are notable differences between the primary endpoints used in these two studies. The ONTIME study will employ a composite primary endpoint developed to enable clinicians to distinguish between symptomatic (disabling) and asymptomatic spasticity. This composite endpoint combines the measure of increased muscle tone (MAS) with the evaluation of functional elements (active function, passive function, involuntary movement and pain). The use of composite indices has been implemented in various acute stroke trials <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, as it is recognised that one index may not be as powerful as another, but put together, may lead to better outcome evaluation. In particular, a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis was performed in this regard to evaluate vascular outcomes after stroke, with the reasoning that various vascular events occur after stroke and so a composite endpoint was required <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In the ONTIME study, not every patient will have the same symptoms, but put together as a composite endpoint, especially considering the homogeneous populations (Asian patients with early onset post-stroke spasticity receiving the same dose of BoNT-A in the affected upper limb), the desired outcomes may reach impactful levels.</p><p id="p0320">Secondly, as symptomatic spasticity is more likely to develop in more severely affected patients <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, only subjects with moderate to severe spasticity (MAS&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;2) will be included in the ONTIME study, to ensure that meaningful functional gains are detected. This represents a patient population with more severe spasticity than subjects included in the ABCDE-S study. Furthermore, a longer follow-up (up to 28 weeks) is planned to allow adequate time to follow and document the appearance or reappearance of post-stroke spasticity symptoms following BoNT-A injection.</p><p id="p0325">Results from this pilot study will facilitate the design and sample size calculation of further confirmatory studies and are expected to provide useful insights into the optimal delivery of post-stroke patient management, including timing of BoNT-A therapy and duration of follow-up regimens.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Trial status</title><p id="p0330">Recruitment to the ONTIME pilot study began in December 2014 and was completed in September 2015 (final data collection for the primary outcome measure).</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p id="p0335">KHK, JB, HB, PM, KJG, WK, RR all contributed to the conception and design of the ONTIME protocol.
