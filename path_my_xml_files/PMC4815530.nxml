At least 50 million people worldwide are affected by the disease and nearly 100 million people have experienced seizure at least once in their lives. The disease creates psychological, physical, social, and economic consequences. Its prevalence is 5.8/1000 in developed countries and 10.3/1000 people in developing countries.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The most commonly used treatments for epilepsy are antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The most common drug used to treat epilepsy is valproate (VPA) sodium, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and lamotrigine and currently levetiracetam. Usually a combination of drugs is used to treat epilepsy. Choosing any of these drugs depends on the type of seizure and the involved part in the brain. One of the functions of carbamazepine and sodium VPA and levetiracetam is through the impact on the course of oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>VPA can also reduce the concentration of the mitochondrial coenzyme A which is produced due to the conversion of the VPA to valproyl-CoA in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and coenzyme A. This may affect the oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria and impaired ATP synthesis. Fatty acid oxidation by VPA can also be caused by the effect of this drug on carnitine.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Oxidative stress is a mitochondrial dysfunction and an imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant and is involved in many pathological and physiological processes. Brain cells are sensitive to reactive oxygen types that are produced during the oxidation.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Brain cells are sensitive to reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress can cause irreversible damage to biological molecules such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and the DNA. Oxidative stress is involved in many neurodegenerative disorders such as epilepsy.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Vitamin E (&#x003b1;-tocopherol) is a lipophilic alcohol and its food source is the root of wheat and vegetable oils. The most important part of this substance is the &#x003b1; part because it forms 90% of the tocopherol composition of animal tissues. Many physiological functions have been considered for this substance including stabilization of membrane, acting as enzyme inhibitor and the multiplier of the effect of Vitamin A2. This substance has the ability to prevent the negative effects of lipid peroxidation in the brain tissue because it can absorb free radicals of oxygen. Many studies have shown the effect of Vitamin E on the treatment of epilepsy. For example, in a study, this substance was used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of epilepsy in children whose seizures were not well controlled, resulting in significant improvement. It has no serious side effects and risk of toxicity. This causes the substance to be considered in the treatment of epilepsy.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Many studies have shown an increase in oxidative stress in epilepsy and have stated that free radicals act as a pathogen in the disease.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Other studies have shown the effect of antiepileptic on enhancing free oxygen species.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In 2007, a study was conducted in children with epilepsy, and it was found that adding Vitamin E to AEDs reduces their seizures.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In another study conducted by Kovalenko <italic>et al</italic>., it was found that adding Vitamin E to antiepileptic reduces plasma levels of lipid peroxidation and decreases the frequency of seizures in these patients.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Among the studies, the lack of a study showing the effect of Vitamin E as an antioxidant on the reduction of oxidative stress created both by anticonvulsants and the epilacy in adults was felt which could show this effect using both oxidative and antioxidative findings of blood together with electroencephalogram (EEG) findings of patients. It also seems that there is no study about the effects of Vitamin E on EEG findings.</p><p>Due to the abovementioned cases and because of high frequency of epilepsy in Iran[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and in the world,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] which cause injuries to the social, occupational, and other fields of life, research into finding ways to help the treatment of this disease is a big step towards helping these patients.</p><p>As discussed, an important damaging factor causing seizures is the destruction of neurons with oxidant antioxidant system imbalance and increase of active oxygen species caused by oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] As a result, it was decided to make use of a substance in order to reduce the effect of oxidants, consequently increasing the efficacy of anticonvulsants so that the patients could benefit most from their treatment.

Our findings show that total antioxidant capacity, catalase, and glutathione significantly increased in epileptic patients after adding Vitamin E to their antiepileptic therapy in compare placebo. In addition, the frequency of seizure significantly decreased in patients who received Vitamin E than placebo group. Another important of our finding was that decreased in positive change in EEG findings in case group was significantly more than control group. Thus, Vitamin E may be suggested as an adjunctive antiepileptic therapy with partial success.</p><p>Previously, it is show that in epileptic patients lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase, as parameters of oxidative stress were significantly higher when compared to controls, either levels of Vitamin C, E, and A, as antioxidant substances were significantly lower in epileptics when compared to controls, and suggesting that free radicals may be implicated in epilepsy.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] One of the lipophilic antioxidant that is able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and accumulate at high concentration in the brain is Vitamin E.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Therefore, suggesting that in suppressing seizures and neuronal damage, Vitamin E supplementation can be helpful. In one animal study, effect of Vitamin E in the standard animal seizure models has been assessed and authors concluded that Vitamin E has an anticonvulsant effect in animal seizure models.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In a double-blind, cross-over trial, by Raju <italic>et al</italic>. Vitamin E as add-on therapy compared to placebo in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. After two treatment phases of Vitamin E or placebo with cross-over to the second phase, authors reported that change in seizure frequency observed with Vitamin E as compared with placebo was not significant between two treatments.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Other studies show that treatments with Vitamin E have had beneficial effects on seizure activity and neurodegeneration induced by pentylentetrazol[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or pilocarpine.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Moreover, Vitamin E attenuated lipid peroxidation and increased catalase activity after pilocarpine-induced seizure[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and reduced blood-brain barrier disruption after pentylentetrazol-induced epileptic seizure.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In contrast, some studies reported that Vitamin E can not to reduce seizure activity induced by amygdala kindling or KA.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Similar to some studies and in contrast to others in the present study, Vitamin E as an add-on therapy for epileptic patients, who received multi- or single-drug therapy, can be effective to significantly increased total antioxidant capacity, catalase, and glutathione, and reduce seizure frequency in compare to placebo group. However, the mean of changes in the level of malondialdehyde, which is a product of lipid peroxidation, between Vitamin E and placebo groups was not significant. The differences between our findings and some previous studies can explain by different in antiepileptic therapy, whereas we enrolled patients who received any of AEDs and we did not compare variables between groups in regard to AEDs, but other studies analyzed their result in regard to AEDs. Also, that the dosage and treatment duration Vitamin E varies across studies. Vitamin E has been used in a wide dose ranges from modest 100 IU/d[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] or 200 IU/d[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] to high doses such as 1200 IU/d[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] in various experiments. As antiepileptics are commonly weak oxidants, and their influence on oxidative stress have been commonly traced after long term intake of this agents, we believe that administration of a modest (400 IU/d) dose of Vitamin E could sufficiently compensate for their pro-oxidant activity.</p><p>Although there is conflicting between researches on efficacy of Vitamin E and its exact pharmacological mechanism in response to diverse seizures remains elusive, in epileptic patients, Vitamin E is relatively safe and may be considered for adjunctive treatment.</p><p>The main limitation of our study was that we did not limited inclusion criteria to restricted AEDs so there were few patients in each individual AEDs groups and we could not analyzed efficacy of Vitamin E in regard to individual AEDs.</p><p>According tto Martinc <italic>et al</italic>. review article, In order to evaluate potentially positive effects of therapeutic interventions with antioxidant components, numerous studies of their use in animal models of epileptic seizures, were revised. However, even though numerous positive effects of antioxidants were observed in animal models of epileptic seizure, till now only few antioxidants have been further evaluated in patients with epilepsy as an add-on therapy and even these with only partial success. Based on the several positive findings in animal models, a strong need for more carefully planned, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled clinical trials for the evaluation of antioxidants efficacy in patients with epilepsy is warranted.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion,
