Liver biopsy can be performed under premedication with an opioid alone or in combination with benzodiazepines. Important issues for the use of sedation are patient&#x02019;s cooperation and breath holding which is critical to the successful and safe completion of the procedure. Untoward movement during the procedure when the needle is in the hepatic parenchyma can lead to a tear of the liver and increases the risk of bleeding. There is variation between centers in techniques and guidelines for liver biopsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], in our center we routinely give pethidine as pre-medication.

Patients were asked to fill in a Penn State worry questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>For the procedure, patients were placed in the supine position, and the ideal location for the liver biopsy on the lateral aspect of right thoracic site was established by both percussion as well as immediately prior to the investigation by abdominal ultrasound (4.0&#x000a0;MHz sector ultrasound probe; Acuson Aspen Advanced, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). Patients were randomly (using randomization table) assigned to receive either 50&#x000a0;mg pethidine i.v. or an equal volume (1&#x000a0;ml) of 0.9% normal saline as premedication. All patients received 10&#x000a0;mg of metoclopramide i.v. The premedications were prepared by an independent nurse who was not involved with the care of patient before and after the procedure. The prepared medications were identical in volume and appearance and labeled with randomization number and patient details. The patients, assisting nurse and the operator were unaware of what premedication the patient received. The metoclopramide was given to mask the side effect of pethidine that patients may experience. Following disinfection of the skin with iodine, the patients were given the assigned premedication. The skin and subcutaneous layers of the thoracic wall were locally anaesthetized with 10&#x000a0;ml of 1% xylocaine containing 1:100,000 adrenaline. A small incision into the skin was made using a disposable scalpel. The liver biopsy was performed using a modified Menghini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] biopsy set (17G X 70&#x000a0;mm Surecut, TSK Laboratory, Japan) using standard technique. Immediately following the biopsy the patients were placed on their right-side to rest on a sand bag for 1&#x000a0;hour, followed by an hour of lying flat. Blood pressure, pulse and wound site were checked regularly in the first hour. Lying and standing blood pressure were measured immediately prior to the procedure and two hours post procedure. All patients were observed for 4&#x000a0;hours after the procedure before discharge. Patients were asked to self-evaluate pain experienced using a visual analogue score (VAS, 0&#x02013;10) at the end of procedure, and an hour after the procedure. Patients were then followed up with a telephone call 24&#x000a0;hours after the procedure to assess their pain scores, retrospective pain scores and willingness to have a repeat procedure if it was required in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The two groups were compared by Student t-test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for qualitative variables.

It provides an accurate diagnosis in approximately 90 percent of patients with unexplained liver function test abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A significant degree of anxiety and high level of pain experienced by the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] often limits the willingness of patients with chronic liver disease to undergo subsequent follow-up biopsies. Use of midazolam as sedative for frightened patients has been evaluated in the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but its use in the clinical setting has been variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Sedation used in PLB may interfere with patients&#x02019; cooperation and possibly increases the complication rate. Recent published study shown combination of short-acting tramadol and lorazepam is effective, safe and can be used routinely before PLB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Patient-administered nitrous oxide/oxygen inhalation has been evaluated as safe and excellent analgesia for PLB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], but this is associated with high cost of the system, concern of personnel exposure to the gas, and the need for nursing supervision.</p><p>The attitude toward post-procedure pain and its prophylactic use of analgesics, anxiolytic, or sedative drugs is a matter of uncertainty and controversy. Consequently, there is variation between centers in techniques and guidelines for liver biopsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In our center we routinely give pethidine as pre-medication. A pilot trial from our center has shown that pethedine may reduce anxiety and the need for post-procedural pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The potential side effects of pethidine are considerable and include nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, diaphoresis, urinary retention, and constipation. Overdose can cause muscle flaccidity, respiratory depression, hypotension, obtundedness and coma. The use of meperidine (pethidine) has been suggested as a safe analgesic option before percutaneous liver biopsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind study to evaluate the need for pethidine in PBL. The results show that the use of pethidine provided a statistically significant pain relief in the immediate post procedural period in comparison to the placebo group but has not long-term effect.</p><p>In more detail, the mean VAS score was 0.6 in the pethidine group in comparison to 1.2 in the placebo group immediately after the procedure. Although there is statistically significant difference in the VAS score between the two groups, the VAS score of 1.2 in the placebo group is not considered as a clinically significant pain score as patients with VAS score of 2&#x02013;3 are still usually quite functional.</p><p>Our results also showed that the use of pethedine had no long-term effect and did not impact on the pain score at one hour and 24&#x000a0;hours. With use of local anesthetic and good liver biopsy technique patients tolerated the PLB procedure with minimal pain.</p><p>More importantly, the result showed that overall 94% of patients were willing to undergo a repeat procedure if required regardless of whether they have received pethidine or not.</p><p>Administration of pethidine did not affect the rate of complications; there were no significant complications observed during the study period. These were consistent with our previous pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The use of pre-procedural ultrasound to identify the ideal location for all PLB, the usage of less traumatic Menghini technique and the supervision by a consultant may have contributed to the low complication rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There were four patients in the placebo group and five patients in the pethidine group who experienced vasovagal reaction with hypotension; all patients recovered spontaneously and were discharged within the same day of the procedure. The rate of vasovagal events was 10% in the pethidine group and 8% in the placebo group, this was higher than our previous reported rate of 1.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, based on our results, we consider the use of pethidine as unnecessary and liver biopsy can be performed under good local anaesthesic technique. The use of pethidine before percutaneous liver biopsy resulted in better pain score and less analgesia requirement immediately after the procedure. However the use of pethedine had not impacted on the pain score and retrospective pain score at 24&#x000a0;hours after procedure. 94% of patients were willing to undergo a repeat procedure if required regardless of whether they have received pethidine or not. Pethidine use before procedure can be discussed with the patient; however its use may not enhance patients&#x02019; compliance with future biopsies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Antony Pan, Mohammed Alansari, Ralf Lubcke, Martin Schlup, Merrilee Williams, Margaret Fraser and Sarah Buckingham contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>AP was involved in the design of the study, review of literature and writing of the manuscript.
