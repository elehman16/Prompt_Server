We have investigated the S-phase fractions of the primary tumour from premenopausal breast cancer patients who participated in a randomised trial comparing 12 cycles of polychemotherapy (CMF) with post-operative radiotherapy. DNA flow cytometry was performed on frozen tissues from 208 primary breast carcinomas, of which the S-phase fraction was estimated in 176 cases. There was a significantly higher benefit from CMF among patients with a high S-phase fraction (P = 0.0033). The relative risk of distant recurrence or death in the chemotherapy group as compared with the radiotherapy group was 0.19 for patients whose tumours had an S-phase fraction of 10% or over (95% CI 0.07-0.51) and 1.55 (0.88-2.73) for patients whose tumours showed lower S-phase levels. The interaction was still significant in multivariate analysis (P = 0.0057), including lymph node metastases, tumour size and oestrogen receptor content. We conclude that the benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy compared with radiotherapy is largely confined to patients with highly proliferative tumours.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00058-0226.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1258" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00058-0227.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1259" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00058-0228.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1260" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00058-0229.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1261" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00058-0230.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1262" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
