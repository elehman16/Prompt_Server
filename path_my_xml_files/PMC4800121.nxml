Good glycaemic control improves maternal and neonatal outcomes. Frequent clinical review of patients with GDM by healthcare professionals is required owing to the rapidly changing physiology of pregnancy and its unpredictable course. Novel technologies that allow home blood glucose (BG) monitoring with results transmitted in real time to a healthcare professional have the potential to deliver good-quality healthcare to women more conveniently and at a lower cost to the patient and the healthcare provider compared to the conventional face-to-face or telephone-based consultation. We have developed an integrated GDm-health management system and aim to test the impact of using this system on maternal glycaemic control, costs, patient satisfaction and maternal and neonatal outcomes compared to standard clinic care in a single large publicly funded (National Health Service (NHS)) maternity unit.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Women with confirmed gestational diabetes in a current pregnancy are individually randomised to either the GDm-health system and half the normal clinic visits or normal clinic care. Primary outcome is mean BG in each group from recruitment to delivery calculated, with adjustments made for number of BG measurements, proportion of preprandial and postprandial readings and length of time in study, and compared between the groups. The secondary objective will be to compare the two groups for compliance to the allocated BG monitoring regime, maternal and neonatal outcomes, glycaemic control using glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and other BG metrics, and patient attitudes to care assessed using a questionnaire and resource use.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Thresholds for treatment, dietary advice and clinical management are the same in both groups. The results of the study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated electronically and in print.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT01916694; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This will be the most rigorous and robust evaluation of an integrated telehealth solution for the gestational diabetes population to date.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intervention has been developed and piloted prior to the study with input from consumer groups: patients, clinicians and biomedical engineers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This study will be conducted within the maternity diabetes service of a National Health Service (NHS) hospital, therefore capturing data in a &#x02018;real-life&#x02019; scenario.</p></list-item><list-item><p>As adverse clinical outcomes such as shoulder dystocia, birth trauma or stillbirth are relatively uncommon in women with gestational diabetes mellitus receiving treatment, this study will not be able to be powered on these outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The optimal metric for measuring glycaemic control in the gestational diabetic population is not known. We plan to assess the difference in overall mean blood glucose between the two groups as the primary outcome for this trial; however, an intended objective will also be to assess and compare other summative metrics of glucose control. This will enable us to select a valid primary outcome measure, with known SD and estimation of effect size, to allow calculation of sample size for a future definitive trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study will be conducted in a single UK tertiary centre where women have high rates of literacy and relatively low levels of social deprivation; therefore, further evaluation will be needed to demonstrate effectiveness in other settings.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined by the WHO as &#x02018;carbohydrate intolerance resulting in hyperglycaemia of variable severity with onset or first recognition during pregnancy&#x02019;.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Maternal hyperglycaemia leads to excess transfer of glucose to the fetus resulting in fetal hyperinsulinaemia. The consequence of this is accelerated fetal growth and large babies, which increases the risk of delivery complications such as shoulder dystocia, birth trauma, the need for caesarean section and increased risk of stillbirth.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Recognising and treating gestational diabetes to achieve tight glycaemic control has been shown in randomised controlled trials to reduce obstetric and fetal complications.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Blood glucose (BG) metabolism and regulation change rapidly in pregnancy. The development of GDM and its progression to requiring pharmacologic treatment can be difficult to predict accurately. Once a woman is on insulin treatment, rapid upward titration of insulin dose is commonly required to maintain optimal glycaemic control and rarely hypoglycaemic episodes may require reduction in insulin dosages.</p><p>In order to detect and respond to these physiological and metabolic changes, women with GDM are commonly reviewed by a hospital-based maternity diabetes team, at frequent and regular intervals&#x02014;typically every 1&#x02013;4&#x02005;weeks. This constitutes a significant burden to the patient of having to attend many additional antenatal clinics and to the health system responsible for care.</p><p>In recent years, there has been a widening of GDM screening criteria,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> a lowering of diagnostic thresholds,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> an increasing proportion of pregnant women who are classed overweight or obese and increasing numbers of women from high-risk ethnic groups. These changes have led to a rise in the prevalence of GDM, from a baseline of around 4% in 2008<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> predicted to reach over 16% in the UK if the new diagnostic thresholds are widely adopted.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Taking these factors together, current maternity diabetes services are likely to become overwhelmed and provision and funding will be required for rapid expansion of these services.</p><p>The concept of women being able to monitor their BG levels at home with results transmitted in real time to a healthcare provider with bidirectional communication is attractive. Technology intended to deliver healthcare at a distance using an electronic means of communication is referred to as digital health. M-health is a subcategory of digital health where smartphones are used to transfer data and run applications to integrate with other health technology and services.</p><p>We developed a novel m-health management system for women with GDM (GDm-health). This system was designed to be an intuitive, interactive, reliable and accurate digital health solution for women with GDM.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> GDm-health was designed to include a smartphone application for the patients and a web interface for the clinicians. It incorporates several features of digital health technology that have only been evaluated in isolation before, including bidirectional communication, integration with an existing health system and digital recording and analysis of BG results. The system was developed in collaboration with women with GDM, healthcare professionals and biomedical engineers to create a system that could potentially be fully integrated into routine clinical care within the National Health Service (NHS), with an interface that was easy to use for staff and patients. Full details of development of the system are provided elsewhere.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Additionally, the system needed to be fully secure, low cost and based on readily available technologies. It is this system that we are using to compare remote BG monitoring with standard clinic care in the gestational diabetic population.</p><p>The evidence base for m-health as an intervention to improve glycaemic control in diabetes outside pregnancy is becoming increasingly well established.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Our team members have had experience with developing and evaluating solutions for the management of type 1 and 2 diabetes using these approaches.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref></p><p>There are few published studies of digital health solutions for the management of women with GDM. Most have enrolled only small numbers of women and have been conducted with methodological approaches at risk of bias. Comparison is hampered by the wide range of technologies that have been developed, with little agreement on the key components of interventions, the appropriate comparator group(s) or primary outcome measures.</p><p>Consequently, the true effects and possible benefits or harms of digital health solutions on GDM are not understood. While four studies of women with GDM (272 women) failed to demonstrate any impact on pregnancy outcomes or glycaemic control,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref> other studies of women with type 1 diabetes<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref> or GDM<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> showed an association with better glycaemic control and improved outcomes in the digital health group compared to standard care. It has been proposed that the value of telehealth solutions may be in reducing the number of outpatient clinic visits required,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and there is evidence of improved satisfaction with care among patients and healthcare professionals.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Sustainability and scale up of the technologies has proven challenging, with no examples in the published literature describing successful widespread implementation and adoption beyond the research setting of telehealth solutions for GDM.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of monitoring BG in pregnancy using remote glucose monitoring (GDm-health) compared to standard clinic care.

The system is described in more detail below.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015009702F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>The GDm-health Management System.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015009702f04"/></fig><p>Participants will be invited to contact the specialist diabetic midwife using a call-back request function in the smartphone application, or by phone call, if they have any concerns. A specialist diabetes midwife will review the results of the remote monitoring at least three times a week. If a participant has two or more consecutive postprandial readings &#x02265;7.8&#x02005;mmol/L or fasting readings &#x02265;5.9&#x02005;mmol/L or one reading above 9.0&#x02005;mmol/L at any time of day, the specialist midwife will call the participant or send an SMS message from the web interface to the participant&#x02019;'s phone inviting discussion and further dietary advice. If fewer than 12 of the minimum 18 readings a week are being done, an automatic alert will be generated on the web interface for the diabetes specialist midwife. If this alert persists for 2&#x02005;weeks, the specialist diabetes midwife will contact the participant. If there is evidence that pharmacological treatment is required, the participant will be referred to the consultant-led clinic to start treatment. Further dose adjustments and messages of advice/encouragement will be communicated to the participant between clinic visits via the GDm-health management system by the specialist diabetes midwife.</p><p>Measures taken in both groups at subsequent visits and after delivery are listed in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Description of the GDm-health system</title><p>The development of the GDm-health system has been described previously.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Each connection between the front-end (smartphone application) and the back-end (server and web interface) will be securely established on an encrypted channel and&#x02014;for privacy reasons&#x02014;the front-end will not contain any person-identifiable information (ie, participants will be identified by numeric ID). In order to avoid errors while reporting the BG measurement, the glucometer to be employed (LifeScan OneTouch UltraEasy) will be connected to the smartphone via a third-party Bluetooth module (Polytel Wireless GMA&#x02014;Polymap). The LifeScan OneTouch UltraEasy is the glucometer of choice as it is compliant with the ISO 15197:2003 standard for blood glucose monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus (this ISO standard was applicable at the time of the RCT). Readings will be transferred automatically to the Android application running on the smartphone at the time of the BG measurement, with no need of manual input.</p><p>As soon as the BG reading is stored in the smartphone's memory, the participant will be asked to &#x02018;tag&#x02019; the reading as preprandial or postprandial through the smartphone application interface. Through the application, she will also be able to enter additional free-text comments as well as dosage and type of medication taken around the time of each reading.</p><p>All information will be transmitted to the back-end server automatically when the participant exits the application or as soon as the smartphone connects to the mobile network. The BG readings and associated information entered by the participant will be displayed together on the web interface for the benefit of the clinician reviewing the data.</p><p>Data review will be possible in two different ways: a table of all the readings taken by the patient listed in reverse chronological order and a graphical display of the readings to highlight the difference between preprandial and postprandial BG levels (values will be displayed as green, yellow or amber according to the corresponding alerting thresholds).</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Measures of BG</title><p>For the control group, BG data will be scanned at each clinic visit, with identifying labels removed, and stored in an anonymised file with each participant allocated a unique code. BG readings will then be transcribed from the paper charts, with BG results stored on a secure anonymised database. These data will be verified with readings downloaded from the patient's glucose meter at the end of the pregnancy using the same unique ID for later comparison. The intervention group data will be extracted from the website and stored on a secure anonymised database using a unique ID.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Accrual and analysis</title><sec id="s2m1"><title>Sample size</title><p>The four published randomised trials that investigated the effect of a telehealth intervention on mean BG control in pregnancy reported SDs between 0.2 and 1.2&#x02005;mmol/L. The lower value was from a very small study (n=19) conducted in 1996.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The range of SD for mean BG in the three relatively large studies (n&#x0003e;30) was 0.5&#x02013;1.2&#x02005;mmol/L.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This indicates that we do not yet have a precise estimate of the likely SD in mean BG, making sample size calculation challenging. We therefore pragmatically decided to assume an SD of 0.8&#x02005;mmol/L for the mean BG level at the end point. Thus, with 100 patients in each arm, we will be able to detect a difference between the arms of 0.32&#x02005;mmol/L, with power of 80% and a significance level of 0.05.</p><p>The multilevel analysis we propose has not been conducted in any of the previous studies and will use all the data from recruitment to delivery. Thus, the difference in BG between the arms at the study end point will be estimated more precisely compared with a trial that uses a comparison of mean BG at the end point alone or a mean of all readings. Therefore, the calculation given provides a conservative estimate of the effect size that could be detected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="s2n1"><title>Descriptive analyses</title><p>Baseline demographic characteristics of each group will be tabulated.

A per-protocol analysis will also be performed excluding women who did not use the GDm-health system for at least 67% of expected BG readings (at least 18 readings per week) to determine the efficacy of the system under optimal use. This level was selected as it was programmed at the beginning of the trial as the level at which the computerised system would alert healthcare professionals that a woman was non-compliant with system use.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Analysis of end points</title><sec id="s2o1"><title>Primary end point analyses</title><p>The primary end points will be efficacy of the GDm-health system to achieve glycaemic control compared between groups.

Safety concerns include adequate alerts if the remote glucose testing groups have either high or low BG readings or are not providing readings. This will be addressed by having automatic alerts activated to ensure abnormal results are not &#x02018;missed&#x02019;. The equipment to be used is a standardised, approved glucose meter with Bluetooth technology. It has been used in numerous previous studies and found to be robust.

The users measure their BG in the same way as usual care, but the GDm-health system allows a copy of the readings to be transmitted to the smartphone via Bluetooth. The readings are then transmitted to a secure NHS server in real time via the mobile phone data network, using checksums and encryption to ensure data integrity.

We will determine the efficacy of remote monitoring in pregnant women with GDM compared to conventional care and provide an objective assessment of the potential value of the technology in impacting outcomes including BG control, patient satisfaction and resource use. Severe adverse clinical outcomes, such as shoulder dystocia or neonatal hypoglycaemia, associated with GDM are relatively uncommon among women receiving management. Therefore, we will use a measure of glycaemic control as our primary outcome as this has been shown in large studies<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> to correlate with risk of adverse outcomes.</p><p>Selecting a clinically relevant summary measure of glycaemic control in pregnancy is challenging owing to the progressively changing physiology of glucose regulation in the third trimester of pregnancy. We plan to assess the difference in overall mean BG between the two groups as the primary outcome for this trial; however, an intended objective will also be to assess and compare other summative metrics of glucose control including HbA1c, changes in BG over gestation and changes in BG in relation to meal times between the two groups. This will enable us to select a valid primary outcome measure, with known SD and estimation of effect size, to allow calculation of sample size for a future definitive trial.</p><p>One of the criticisms of the vast number of health-related &#x02018;apps' now available is that there is currently little empirical evidence to support their use. Most &#x02018;apps' have been developed by the commercial sector or by patient groups, but few are integrated within the healthcare system. We hope that the results of our trial will provide some of the first robust findings on the potential for integrated remote monitoring systems to affect patient outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Carmelo Velardo at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/2dvisio">@2dvisio</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> LHM was responsible for drafting the paper.
