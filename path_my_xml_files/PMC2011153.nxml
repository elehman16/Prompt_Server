All of the patients were in a controlled trial of adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of operable breast cancer. CEA was studied in primary tumours and axillary node metastases from these patients using an immunoperoxidase (PAP) method. Sections of 290 primary carcinomas and 217 axillary metastases were examined for CEA. The CEA status of the primary tumours was of no value as a prognostic indicator nor in the selection of patients for chemotherapy. In contrast, patients could be divided into 3 groups on the basis of the CEA results in the axillary nodes. In one group, in which cases were strongly positive for CEA (24% of the total) the prognosis, as reflected by recurrence free survival, was relatively good and chemotherapy produced no further advantage. In another group in which cases were weakly positive for CEA (18% of the total) the prognosis was poor but chemotherapy produced significant improvement. In a third group, in which cases were negative for CEA (58% of the total) the prognosis was poor and was not improved by chemotherapy, at least in the short term. Thus, the CEA status of axillary metastases may be clinically useful.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00434-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="757" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00434-0059.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="758" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00434-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="759" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00434-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="760" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00434-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="761" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00434-0063.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="762" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00434-0064.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="763" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00434-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="764" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
