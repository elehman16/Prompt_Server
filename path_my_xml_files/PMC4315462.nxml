As CSP is a condition in reproductive age, the conservation of fertility is the main concern for the patients. Invasive and radical treatment, such as hysterectomy, has recently been replaced by minimally invasive therapies.<xref rid="b5-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Methotrexate (MTX) is an antimetabolite drug that has been used successfully in conditions associated with trophoblastic proliferation. Systemic MTX is a standard treatment for tubal and cervical ectopic pregnancy if the gestational age is less than 9 weeks, the embryo size is smaller than 10 mm, no cardiac activity is seen, and the serum &#x003b2;-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) levels are less than 10,000 mIU/mL.<xref rid="b6-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The experience gained from the treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy with MTX has led some investigators to consider MTX as a treatment option in CSP. Studies have shown a good response for MTX at a dose of 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, especially when &#x003b2;-hCG level is less than 5,000 mIU/mL.<xref rid="b7-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>So far, most investigations concerning MTX treatment in CSP are retrospective analyses. At present, there are two approaches for MTX usage: systemic injection and local injection (ultrasound-guided intragestational sac injection). Are there any differences in therapeutic efficacy and clinical outcome associated with these two approaches? How do we make a choice in clinical practice? Considering these questions, our objectives in this study are therefore threefold: 1) to investigate the MTX treatment in CSP patients prospectively at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH); 2) to compare the efficacy between local injection and systemic administration of MTX, and 3) to analyze the factors in favor of patient prognosis, providing reference for screening candidates for MTX therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Our research was approved by the Ethics Committee of PUMCH, and written informed consent from each patient was obtained before treatment. From the year 2008 to 2013, 225 patients with CSP were admitted to PUMCH, among whom 195 patients met our inclusion criteria. Ninety-one patients refused MTX treatment, and finally 104 patients were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to a MTX treatment of systemic intramuscular injection or local intragestational sac injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-tcrm-11-137">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) diagnosis of CSP was confirmed by two ultrasound specialists independently, and 2) patients with CSP did not present with heavy vaginal bleeding when admitted to the hospital.</p><p>The diagnosis of CSP was based on the criteria postulated by Godin et al including 1) well-formed gestational sac in the myometrium of the lower uterine segment, 2) the presence of an empty uterine and cervical cavity, and 3) lack of continuity of myometrial image between the bladder and the gestational sac.<xref rid="b9-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Patients were counseled about the risks of the condition and management alternatives, including potential benefits and risks. Baseline &#x003b2;-hCG levels were noted. Gestational age was determined according to the last menstrual period. Two parameters, sac dimension and crown-rump length, were used to determine gestational age in situations when patients could not remember their last menstrual period, or when a discrepancy existed.</p><p>After appropriate counseling, patients were referred to our MTX treatment center. Both patients and doctors in the outpatient clinic were blinded to group allocation. Enrolled patients were then sequentially numbered. Patients labeled with odd numbers were given systemic intramuscular injection of MTX, while patients labeled with even numbers received the local intragestational sac injection of MTX, both at a dose of 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>On the seventh day after the first MTX injection, if the decrease in serum &#x003b2;-hCG level was less than 15%, MTX injection was then repeated. On the 14th day, if the serum &#x003b2;-hCG level was still not reduced by over 15%, or even increased, MTX treatment was considered failed, and uterine artery embolization (UAE) was performed followed by dilation and curettage (D&#x00026;C). If heavy bleeding occurred during D&#x00026;C, laparotomy with surgical resection of CSP or possible hysterectomy, would be needed. On the 60th day, if the gestational sac remarkably diminished but persistently existed, no matter whether the &#x003b2;-hCG level returned to normal or not, D&#x00026;C would be performed.<xref rid="b10-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Complete cure was defined as regression of ultrasonographic findings and normalization of serum &#x003b2;-hCG within 60 days. Complete sonographic resolution of CSP was defined as the absence of gestational sac, hyperechogenic chorionic rim, and any other echodensities under the cesarean scar, along with regular endometrial line in lower uterine segment at transvaginal ultrasonogrphy. It was regarded as delayed cure if additional D&#x00026;C was needed when ultrasound or serum &#x003b2;-hCG did not become normal within 60 days. Complete cure plus delayed cure were considered as treatment success. UAE plus D&#x00026;C that was performed due to unsatisfactory reduction or increase of serum &#x003b2;-hCG was considered as MTX treatment failure.</p><p>For follow-up, serum &#x003b2;-hCG testing was performed every 3&#x02013;4 days until the titers decreased to 50% of pretreatment levels, and weekly after until the titers returned to normal levels (&#x0003c;5 IU/L).</p><p>For statistical analysis, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test and student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test were used to analyze the data, and a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient information</title><p>From 2008 to 2013, 225 patients with CSP were admitted into PUMCH, accounting for 6.7% (225/3,325) of all ectopic pregnancy, similar to the data of previous studies.</p><p>One-hundred and four patients were included in our research.

The diagnosis mainly relies on ultrasound examination and magnetic resonance imaging, if necessary. The goals of treatment are termination of pregnancy, reduction of hemorrhage, and prevention of uterus rupture. The treatment options for CSP vary from expectant management to D&#x00026;C after uterine artery embolization, and from local resection of CSP lesion to hysteroscopy.<xref rid="b12-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Considering successful reported cases of multiple pregnancy reduction and conservative treatments in ectopic pregnancy, this prospective study was designed to evaluate the clinical effects of MTX therapy in women with CSP who were randomly treated with MTX either locally (intragestational sac injection) or systemically.</p><p>In our study, 225 patients with CSP were admitted into PUMCH within 5 years, accounting for 6.7% (225/3325) of all ectopic pregnancy, similar to the data of previous studies. Seventy-one patients (71/104, 66.4%) obtained treatment success, while 33 (33/104, 33.6%) patients were not sensitive to MTX therapy and underwent UAE plus D&#x00026;C, among whom 4 patients received laparotomy to remove the uterine scar lesion because of excessive bleeding. The results of our study are consistent with those of previous research. Kutuk et al reported 100% cure rate in 13 patients treated with systemic multidose MTX therapy.<xref rid="b13-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In the study conducted by Wang et al 76.2% success and 19% hysterectomy rates were observed in patients with CSP who were treated with systemic MTX monotherapy.<xref rid="b14-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, another study conducted by Lian et al showed a high failure rate of systemic administration of MTX, as 12 of 21 patients needed additional UAE combined with local MTX.<xref rid="b15-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In general, MTX therapy success can be explained by the following facts: 1) the treatment protocol included multiple doses of MTX with short intervals; 2) the gestational age was relatively early at diagnosis; and 3) MTX treatment was implemented early without an unsuccessful first-line treatment attempt.<xref rid="b13-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In support of this, Timor-Tritsch et al suggested that earlier diagnosis and treatment rather than later showed an improved outcome, even though treatment modalities with slightly higher complication rates were used in very early gestation.<xref rid="b4-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In our research, for patients whose serum &#x003b2;-hCG level was decreased below 15% of the pretreatment level, additional MTX administration was delivered to enhance the effects, and most patients were diagnosed with CSP at an average of 8 weeks.</p><p>So far, most research has been on the efficacy of systemic administration of MTX in CSP, while studies focusing on other delivery methods such as local intragestational sac injection have been scarce. Our study, for the first time, explored the differences in efficacy between the local injection and systemic administration of MTX. Our results indicate that systemic administration of MTX shows similar overall cure rate, hospitalization time, and fee compared to local injection, but requires shorter time for serum &#x003b2;-hCG remission and uterine mass disappearance.</p><p>At a common dosage of 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, MTX therapy has several side effects, such as nausea, oral ulceration, bone marrow depression, severe bleeding, and uterine rupture. In our study group, complications were mild and well tolerated, mainly including oral ulceration and bone marrow depression. Patients recovered several days after symptomatic treatment. Since only one patient presented with bone marrow depression and two patients complained oral ulceration, statistical analyses could not be performed.</p><p>MTX therapy failure is often suggested to be associated with high &#x003b2;-hCG level at presentation, deep implantation of the amniotic sac, advanced gestational age, and high vascularity around the gestational sac.<xref rid="b16-tcrm-11-137" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> To better screen candidates for MTX therapy, we then analyzed the potential factors that favor patient prognosis. The pretreatment serum &#x003b2;-hCG level and the uterine mass size in the treatment success group were significantly lower than those in the treatment failure group. Our data suggest that MTX therapy is more feasible in patients with lower serum &#x003b2;-hCG level (&#x0003c;20,000 mIU/mL) and smaller lesion (&#x0003c;3.0 cm in diameter).</p><p>The main disadvantage of systemic MTX therapy is prolonged hospitalization, especially in patients presenting with mild vaginal bleeding. With the increased experience, patients can be followed as outpatients when they are suitable for outpatient management under strict instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Generally, MTX injection is effective in the treatment of CSP.
