In the majority of cases, the disease is mild, affecting limited body surface. Several topical modalities have been found effective in limited chronic plaque psoriasis including, topical steroids, coal tar, anthralin, tazarotene and the vitamin D analogue calcipotriol (calcipotriene) alone or in combination with betamethasone dipropionate. Coal tar is one of the oldest topical preparations for psoriasis. Purified coal tar has been found to have high efficacy and good safety profile. In a study by Kumar <italic>et al</italic>., 5% crude coal tar ointment was shown to induce 75% reduction in erythema severity index (ESI) in 59% of patients at 12 weeks.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate is a relatively new topical agent and there are numerous studies to document its efficacy in psoriasis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It has been shown to produce significantly greater reduction in psoriasis area severity index (PASI) of 68.6% at week 4 compared with placebo (26.6%).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It has also been found to be superior to formulations containing calcipotriol alone or tacalcitol.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge there is no study comparing the efficacy and safety of conventional coal tar application with calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate ointment in limited chronic plaque psoriasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A prospective open label randomized trial was conducted in patients of limited chronic plaque psoriasis (i.e. involving body surface area &#x0003c;10%), who were off all topical medications in last 15 days and oral medications in last 1 month. A written informed consent was taken from all patients. Patients were randomized into two groups using a computer-generated random number table from the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org.">http://www.randomizer.org.</ext-link> Patients in Group A received topical application of 6% coal tar-3% salicylic acid ointment (Salytar-WS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Shalaks/Invida Pharmaceuticals Pvt.

No sun-exposure was advised in both groups. Use of emollients was allowed during the day in both groups. The endpoint was 12 weeks of treatment or attainment of PASI score 0, whichever was earlier. Patients were withdrawn from the study if there was &#x0003c;25% reduction in PASI at week 8, deterioration or serious side-effects warranting withdrawal.</p><p>Patients were followed-up at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 and assessed for disease severity by PASI score, patient's perception of disease severity (patient global assessment [PGA]) on a scale of 0-10 with &#x0201c;10&#x0201d; being baseline disease and &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; being no disease and adverse effects.

</p><p>The primary efficacy parameter was a comparison of reduction in PASI from baseline to endpoint of treatment or week 12. Secondary efficacy parameters were mean reduction in PASI at each follow-up visit, proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 and PASI 50 at week 12 or end point of treatment whichever, earlier and PGA score. Other treatment outcomes such as complete clearance, responders, poor responders, deterioration and relapse were also compared between the two groups.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test was used to assess statistical significance of difference in PASI, PGA, mean reduction and mean percentage reduction in PASI at each visit between two groups.

Coal tar is one of the most commonly used, cheap, safe and effective treatment for psoriasis and its utility, either alone or in combination with phototherapy has been proved in many studies.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Salicylic acid present in commercially available coal tar ointments reduces the thickness and scaling of psoriatic plaques, thereby enhancing the penetration of the active medication. In the study by Kumar <italic>et al</italic>., all patients reported at least 50% reduction and 59.3% had greater than 75% reduction in ESI score with 5% crude coal tar.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Its clinical efficacy was found comparable with 0.1% tazarotene gel.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In our study, PASI 50 was achieved in 40% cases and PASI 75 in 10% cases after 12 weeks of treatment with coal tar-salicylic acid ointment.</p><p>Calcipotriol, a vitamin D analogue, has proven to be highly efficacious in limited chronic plaque psoriasis. There are few trials comparing its efficacy with other topical agents such as steroids and coal tar, but have shown conflicting results. Sharma <italic>et al</italic>. reported &#x0003e;50% reduction in ESI score at week 4 in 60% of lesions treated with calcipotriol compared to 23.3% of lesions treated with coal tar (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01); however, there was no significant difference observed for the same parameter at week 12.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Pinheiro <italic>et al</italic>. reported greater reduction in disease severity with twice daily calcipotriol application group compared to coal tar-allantoin-hydrocortisone group at week 8.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Tham <italic>et al</italic>. found faster reduction in PASI score with calcipotriol twice a day compared to coal tar, 15% w/v cream applied once a day and also found the difference to be significant at all follow-up visits (weeks 2, 4 and 6). They reported that with calcipotriol, rapid improvement was seen in 1<sup>st</sup> 2 weeks of treatment while significant response was seen with coal tar only after 4 weeks of treatment.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Alora-Palli <italic>et al</italic>. on comparing liquor carbonis detergens (LCD) 15% coal tar solution with calcipotriene 0.005% cream twice daily for 12 weeks, reported significantly greater mean reductions in PASI scores at week 12 with LCD (58% vs. 37%).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In addition, significantly higher number of patients in LCD group had absent or minimal psoriasis on the PGA scale than the calcipotriene group and improvement was better maintained on 6 weeks follow-up in the same group.</p><p>The two-compound formulation of calcipotriol with betamethasone has been found to be superior to either component used alone in a large trial on 1605 patients, in which end point of absent-to-mild disease was achieved in 48% patients treated with a calcipotriene-betamethasone combination compared to only 16.5% patients treated with calcipotriene alone and 26.3% patients treated with betamethasone alone.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Another study found the efficacy of calcipotriol/betamethasone formulation to be better than calcipotriol alone at 2 and 4 weeks follow-up and showed a greater reduction in mean PASI in the combined formulation group (68.6% in once daily, 73.8% in twice daily group) than in the twice daily calcipotriol alone group (58.8%) and the vehicle group (26.6%).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] PubMed search did not yield any literature on studies comparing coal tar with a calcipotriol-betamethasone combination our study showed that though a calcipotriol-betamethasone combination resulted in an initial more rapid reduction in PASI (weeks 2 and 4), but this difference was not sustained at later follow-up visits. At the end of the treatment phase, greater mean reduction in PASI was achieved with coal tar-salicylic acid combination. Greater though not significant number of cases achieved complete clearance, PASI 50 and 75 with a calcipotriol-betamethasone combination. The other outcome parameters were also comparable at the end of the treatment phase. No side-effect was observed with both medications. There was no staining of clothes or irritation with coal tar possibly because a refined commercially available tar formulation was used instead of crude coal tar.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Calcipotriol/betamethasone two compound formulation leads to significantly faster clinical improvement and patient satisfaction than coal tar ointment applied once daily, but this effect is not sustained and the results are comparable after 12 weeks of treatment.
