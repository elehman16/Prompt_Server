The main hypothesis of the current randomised controlled trial is that aerobic exercise will be superior to usual care in improving asthma control. Key secondary outcomes are asthma quality of life and inflammatory profiles.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>A total of 104 sedentary adults with physician-diagnosed asthma will be recruited. Eligible participants will undergo a series of baseline assessments including: the asthma control questionnaire; the asthma quality-of-life questionnaire and the inflammatory profile (assessed from both the blood and sputum samples). On completion of the assessments, participants will be randomised (1:1 allocation) to either 12-weeks of usual care or usual care plus aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise will consist of three supervised training sessions per week. Each session will consist of taking a short-acting bronchodilator, 10&#x02005;min of warm-up, 40&#x02005;min of aerobic exercise (50&#x02013;75% of heart rate reserve for weeks 1&#x02013;4, then 70&#x02013;85% for weeks 5&#x02013;12) and a 10&#x02005;min cool-down. Within 1&#x02005;week of completion, participants will be reassessed (same battery as at baseline). Analyses will assess the difference between the two intervention arms on postintervention levels of asthma control, quality of life and inflammation, adjusting for age, baseline inhaled corticosteroid prescription, body weight change and pretreatment dependent variable level.

Asthma is among the four most common chronic disorders affecting Canadian adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> with over 2.5 million (8.5%) adults being diagnosed as having asthma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> More importantly, asthma is an escalating medical problem in Canada, with a 40% increase in asthma incidence in the last two decades.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Furthermore, the rates of poor asthma control have also increased, with nearly 60% of Canadian patients being poorly controlled.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> These increases have come despite important advances in diagnosis and treatment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7 R8 R9 R10 R11">7&#x02013;11</xref> suggesting that these changes in asthma must be multifactorial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Cytokines have been shown to play a critical role in orchestrating, perpetuating and amplifying the inflammatory response in asthma. Among these cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and IL-6 are involved in chronic airway diseases, while IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13, which are mainly derived from T helper type (Th)-2 cells, are more specific to allergic inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> IL-4 is an upstream cytokine that regulates allergic inflammation by promoting Th2 cell differentiation and immunoglobulin (Ig) G switching to IgE subsequently, whereas IL-5 is highly specific for inducing eosinophilic inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Similar to IL-4, IL-13 regulates IgE production but, unlike IL-4, it does not regulate T cell differentiation to Th2 cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Thus, the increased and abnormal expression of cytokines in airways is one of the major features of allergic asthma. Recent reports have indicated that stimulating Th1 cells (IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;) might suppress Th2 cells, and thereby allergic inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Therefore, the balance between Th1 and Th2 is important for immunoregulation, with imbalance believed to cause allergic asthma, and may predict the chronicity and the severity of asthma. However, recent findings indicate that the overall picture is more complex. For instance, both endogenous and inducible CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells, through the release of IL-10, inhibit inappropriate immune responses in Th1/Th2 balance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></p><p>A recent Cochrane review on physical training (aerobic exercise intervention of at least 20&#x02005;min twice a week for 4&#x02005;weeks) and asthma (which included articles up to April 2011)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> reported the following key findings:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Training improved cardiopulmonary fitness as measured by a statistically and clinically significant increase in maximum oxygen uptake;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Training had no significant effect on resting lung function;</p></list-item><list-item><p>None of the studies reported a worsening of asthma symptoms following training;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Training may have a positive effect on health-related quality of life.</p></list-item></list></p><p>These findings lead the authors to conclude that &#x0201c;&#x02026; training can improve cardiopulmonary fitness and was well tolerated among people with asthma&#x0201d; and that this can be performed &#x02018;&#x02026; without fear of symptom exacerbation.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> However, it should be noted that only 19 studies (695 participants) were included in the review, and overall these studies were of low quality with a high risk of bias. As such, it would seem that aerobic exercise is safe, increases fitness, does not change lung function, and may improve quality of life. With regard to asthma symptoms, only one of the seven studies reporting on symptoms actually used a recognised questionnaire (the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) to assess symptoms,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> with no changes seen between the exercise or control interventions. However, a small randomised controlled trial, which was published after the Cochrane review, found that aerobic exercise was associated with a statistical and clinical improvement in control in patients with asthma. These findings suggest that still more work needs to be done to understand the effects of exercise in symptom management and asthma control. Finally, though not the focus of the Cochrane review, one of the included studies found that aerobic exercise had a positive impact on inflammation in patients with asthma. Using induced sputum cell counts, Mendes <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> reported decreases in eosinophils in the exercise group compared with the control group. While this result suggests a benefit of aerobic exercise, the data are still too limited to come to any solid conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Originality and importance of the results</title><p>The therapeutic role of exercise training has been established for various chronic conditions (eg, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type II diabetes, etc) such that this non-pharmacological intervention is now included in several disease management guidelines. To our knowledge, the proposed research project will be one of the first to systematically evaluate the benefits of aerobic exercise training on asthma control, and the potential for inflammation to underpin such benefits, in adult asthma patients.

The exercise routine will consist of 10&#x02005;min of warm-up exercises, 40&#x02005;min of biking and/or walking (and eventually jogging) and 10&#x02005;min of cool-down exercises. Emphasis will be placed on ensuring that patients cool down properly as this is the time when most exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) events would potentially occur.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23 R24 R25 R26">23&#x02013;26</xref> A trained exercise physiologist (Canadian Sport and Exercise Physiologist certified or equivalent) will supervise all exercise sessions, and will perform three checks of heart rates per session to ensure that participants are exercising at a sufficient intensity.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> In total, we offer six time slots per week (3 in the morning before work and 3 in the afternoon after work).

During this 12-week period, we will contact patients every 4&#x02005;weeks to assess asthma symptoms, events, medication adherence and check to see if they have started or intend to start exercising. Based on our previous studies, only about 1% of control participants actively engage in exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> To ensure equity to all our patients, participants in the comparison group will be given the opportunity to participate in the exercise programme once they have completed the post-trial assessments.

(3) Behavioural contracts: a written contract will be signed by the participant at the time of the initial orientation. In this contract, the patient will agree to participate in the programme to the best of their abilities, and to discuss any concerns or difficulties with the study coordinator before considering dropping out of the programme. (4) Close exercise supervision: during the exercise sessions, we will closely supervise exercising participants to ensure that they exercise within their prescribed training ranges. In addition, the participants&#x02019; heart rate will be consistently monitored so that patients who fall below or who exceed their respective training ranges can be identified and their exercise modified. This approach has been used successfully in our prior work.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> These strategies have been successful in our prior exercise studies employing patients with chronic diseases, where the dropout rates were &#x0003c;5%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Concomitant care</title><p>As both arms of the study will be receiving the usual medical care, all potential addition treatment options are available to the patient's regular physicians.

After each inhalation, participants will be instructed to blow their nose, rinse their mouth and swallow the water to minimise postnasal drip and squamous epithelial cell contamination, respectively, before trying to expectorate in a sterile container. The mucus that will be obtained will then be separated from the saliva using forceps, weighed and rocked with four times its volume of dithiothreitol (Sputolysin; Calbiochem Corp., La Jolla, California, USA) for 15&#x02005;min. The reaction will be stopped by adding an equal volume of Dulbecco&#x02019;s phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) 1&#x000d7;(Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada).

Using data from our current epidemiological sample<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55 R56 R57">55&#x02013;57</xref> and the inclusion/exclusion criteria detailed above, we established that for the current eligible group, the baseline mean&#x000b1;SD ACQ score would be 2.14&#x000b1;0.86. Using a standard 2 group design with equal variance and setting power at 0.8, p=0.05, and two-sided hypothesis testing, a decrease of 0.5 in the ACQ score (this change has been shown to be clinically significant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) would require a sample size of 47/group, for a total sample of 94. Using the same criteria, we established that the baseline mean&#x000b1;SD AQLQ score for the eligible group is 4.60&#x000b1;0.91, and using the same parameters, a clinically significant increase of 0.5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> in AQLQ would require a sample size of 52 patients/group for a total sample size of 104. To deal with the issue of compliance and dropouts, as recommended by the CONSORT statement,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref> we will use intent-to-treat analyses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref> Use of the intent-to-treat analyses preserves the effects of group allocation and provides an assessment of the practical impact of a treatment. As there are no data on the effects of exercise training on immune markers in asthma patients, and few clinical guidelines on which to base expected changes, we have used published data from a previous study in a diseased population. Like asthma, heart disease is also considered a disease of immune dysfunction; as such, using data generated by Goldhammer <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref> for an exercise training intervention on coronary heart disease patients seems to be an adequate estimation of the immune effects we may see in asthma patients. For example, setting a power of 0.8, and p=0.05, the required sample size to see a similar outcome in the current study for IL-1, IL-6 and INF-&#x003b3; would be 34, 36 and 78, respectively.

The randomisation code will not be released until the patient has completed all baseline assessments. The staff member will provide a letter detailing the randomisation to the participant and will inform the interventionists of the patient's group allocation. None of the staff responsible for conducting assessments will be provided details of the allocation. In addition, all participants are asked to not indicate their assignment to any member of staff other than the interventionist they are working with. If a member of the assessment team is informed by the patient, they will remove themselves from any further assessment of that participant. As such, the participant and intervention staff will not be blinded to the group allocation, but the assessment staff will be.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5g"><title>Retention</title><p>Once randomised, a participant will be considered as being included in the study.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref> for two group studies, a series of mediator analyses, with Sobel testing, will be conducted to explore inflammatory changes as a mechanism linking exercise to improved asthma control. To accomplish this, we will use a two-step regression model approach. In step 1, a simple general linear model (GLM) regression will be conducted with change in exercise (defined as the difference in postintervention VO<sub>2</sub> minus preintervention VO<sub>2</sub>) as the independent variable and change in asthma control (defined as post minus preintervention levels) as the dependent variable. The above defined covariates, plus intervention group will be included. In step 2, the change in inflammatory markers, as well as the interaction between the change in VO<sub>2</sub> and the change in inflammatory markers, will be included as additional independent variables, with the change in asthma control as the dependent variable and the above covariates. It should be noted that each inflammatory marker will be included in a separate set of analyses. In these kinds of analyses, a main or interaction effect of the inflammatory marker in step 2 would indicate that that particular marker mediated the relationship between exercise and asthma control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref> These kinds of analyses may not provide us with definitive causal and/or mechanistic relationships but will allow us to further expand our knowledge in the area.</p><p>p Value reporting will be consistent with the requirements of the place where the results will be published. Up-to-date versions of SAS (Cary, North Carolina, USA) will be used to conduct analyses. For all tests, we will use two-sided p values with an &#x003b1;&#x02264;0.05 level of significance.

These analyses will be used to define the efficacy of aerobic exercise to influence asthma control. However, consistent with other behavioural trials, we will also conduct a series of completer analyses (ie, inclusion of only those with complete preintervention and postintervention assessment data). These will be conducted as quasisensitivity analyses. Given our expectation that very few patients will be lost to follow-up, these analyses should agree very closely.</p></sec><sec id="s5q"><title>Imputation procedure for missing data</title><p>We will report reasons for withdrawal for each randomisation group and compare the reasons qualitatively.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref> The main feature of the approach is the creation of a set of clinically reasonable imputations for the respective outcome for each dropout. This will be accomplished using a set of repeated imputations created by predictive models based on the majority of participants with complete data. The imputation models will reflect uncertainty in the modelling process and inherent variability in patient outcomes, as reflected in the complete data. After the imputations are completed, all the data (complete and imputed) will be combined and the analysis performed for each imputed-and-completed dataset. Rubin's method of multiple (ie, repeated) imputation will be used to estimate the treatment effect. We propose to use five datasets.
