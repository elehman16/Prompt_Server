It has been well understood that the most successful approach to manage post operative pain is multimodal. Post operative pain is mediated by nociceptive receptors which has a higher threshold than sensory receptors.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Nociceptors are found in the skin, muscles, ligaments, joints, organ capsules and vessel walls.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Pain is mediated through Ad (myelinated) and C (non myelinated) fibers.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Stimulation of Ad fibers results in localized pr&#x000e9;cised pain whereas stimulation of C fibers causes a dull and burning pain.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Visceral pain is sensed by mechanical type of receptors and chemoceptors and pain originating from viscera is of diffuse and dull in nature.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Major part of post operative pain originates from nociceptors in the cutis and subcutis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the analgesic efficacy of opioids and local anesthetics either alone or in combination.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The present study was conducted to demonstrate whether the combination of local anesthetic (Bupivacaine) and opioid (Fentanyl) has any analgesic effect before and after subcutaneous infiltration in modified radical mastoidectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Trial design and procedures</title><p>After getting clearance from the institutional ethics committe, this prospective, double blind, and parallel group randomized study was performed on 60 ASA grade I and II patients admitted to our institution undergoing elective modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM) under general anesthesia. Following detailed pre-anesthetic checkup, written informed consent was taken from all patients. Only patients who were willing, 16-60 years of either sex or ASA grade I and II were included. Exclusion criteria were patients with age less than 16 and more than 60 years, drug or alcohol addicts, obese (patient with body weight more than 20% of ideal body weight), patient with history of drug allergy to fentanyl or amide group local anesthetics, patients using NSAIDS, opioids or any other analgesic, confirmed local anesthetic toxicity, history of malignancy chronic pain syndrome where pain evaluation judged is unreliable because of neurological disease or treatment with steroid prior to surgery and deranged coagulation or bleeding parameters and with cardiovascular, pulmonary and neurological disorder.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated by computer generated random tables to one of two groups comprising 30 patients each. Sixty opaque envelopes containing the code numbers for group I and group II were prepared and sealed, which were opened in the operation theatre only. Patients recruited and randomized who did not receive the study drug because of a change in surgical plan were withdrawn and their randomization number reallocated.</p><p>Group I: (bupivacaine + fentanyl 50 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g) &#x02013; patients received a combination of 0.5% bupivacaine at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight and 50 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g (1 ml) fentanyl.</p><p>Group II: (group bupi + fent 100) &#x02013; patients received a combination of 0.5% bupivacaine at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight and 100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g (2 ml) fentanyl.</p><p>The drug solution was prepared by a doctor who had not participated in the study and was not aware of the study protocol. Surgeon and the anesthesiologist were unaware of the drug solution to which each patient was randomized. The half study drug solution was given just after incision and half at the end of surgery before wound closure, the study drug solution was infiltrated subcutaneously as well as, in and all around the incision line.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Anesthetic technique</title><p>In the operation theatre, after establishing an intravenous route, ringer lactate solution was started. All patients received intravenous injection midazolam 0.03 mg/kg and tramadol 2 mg/kg 10 minutes before induction of anesthesia and after every 30 minutes of induction tramadol 1 mg/kg was repeated. Standard monitors were attached like heart rate, blood pressure, ECG and pulse oximetry.</p><p>After tracheal intubation, end tidal carbondioxide monitoring was initiated. Anesthetic technique was standardized. All patients were preoxygenated for three minutes. Anesthesia was induced with oxygen, nitrous oxide, and propofol 2 mg/kg. succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg was used to facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide 66%, oxygen 33% and halothane 0.5% and vecuronium. Neuromuscular block was reversed with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and atropine 0.02 mg/kg. All the operations were performed by a single team of surgeons by standard technique. In both the groups, postoperative analgesia was standardized. Injection diclofenac 1 mg/kg was started eight hourly in postoperative ward as per routine analgesic protocol being followed in our institution by surgeons starting from the time when patient has arrived in postsurgical ward from operation theatre. In both the groups&#x02019; presence of pain, nausea and sedation was assessed at 0 hour (time at arousal from anesthesia), 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hrs after completion of surgery.</p><p>Time to first analgesic requirement, total analgesic consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively and occurrence of adverse events (e.g., Tinnitus, circumoral numbness, twitching, pruritis, respiratory depression) were also recorded. All postoperative observations were performed by investigators and nursing staff, who were anaware of study group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Pain assessment</title><p>Eleven point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score (0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain), at rest on pressure on incision site was used to assess pain at rest, at above intervals. At any point of time if VAS was &#x0003e;3, injection tramadol 1 mg/kg body weight 8 hrly was planned to be added. if patient had VAS &#x0003e; 3 even 30 minutes after receiving tramadol then fentanyl 2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg bolus was planned to be given intravenously.</p><p>Nausea and vomiting was assessed on a three point score:</p><p>

All the patients were included in the statistical analysis. Groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, weight, height and duration of surgery [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. In both groups VAS was less than three at each time interval [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. None of the patients in either group required rescue analgesia.

The incidence of nausea was found to be statistically significantly lower in group I at 2 hours and comparable at all other time intervals [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. There was no sedation, pruritis and symptoms suggestive of local anesthetic toxicity in patients of either group at any time interval and the two groups were comparable.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Age sex, height and weight characteristics of patients in two groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-7-243-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Visual analogue scores in two groups at different time intervals</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-7-243-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Nausea and vomiting scores in the two groups at different time intervals</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-7-243-g003"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>It has been noted that patients who received fentanyl intravenously has reduced wound hyperalgesia 24 to 48 hours post operatively, this effect was explained by the central action of fentanyl.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, the action of fentanyl on nociceptors in and around the wound area can produce an antinociceptive effect of fentanyl by interacting with peripheral opioid receptors.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It is also understood that it stays in the muscle and fat compartments for many hours (&#x0003e;23 hrs) after a single intravenous injection.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Therefore, reduction in wound hyperalgesia has a peripheral underlying mechanism. Bupivacaine is one of the longest acting local anesthetic agents with the effect lasting for up to 16 hrs. It is four times more potent than lignocaine. Its effect is due to binding with the nerve tissues. In our study fentanyl 50 and 100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g was used in combination with bupivacaine 2 mg/kg for infiltration in and around the incision site. It was observed that VAS score in both the groups was &#x0003c;3 at all times and no patient in either group required rescue analgesia. The comparison of VAS scores at different intervals showed that group two had better analgesia. Our study demonstrated that the combination of bupivacaine and fantanyl for operative field infiltration was associated with better postoperative analgesia [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><p>In our study, fentanyl was applied in combination with a local anesthetic. Likar <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that morphine added to a local anesthetic for submucosal infiltration in dental surgery resulted in an improvement of postoperative analgesia for 24 hrs similar to our results.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The analgesic effect of additional opioid was also demonstrated in several studies.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Fentanyl with its less histamine releasing property and a stronger <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>-receptor agonist activity may be a better drug than morphine or meperidine for peripheral analgesia. Evidence has shown that fentanyl may have dual mechanism of action.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Being an opioid of phenolpiperidine group it could have local anesthetic effect on the nerves. A dose of 10 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g fentanyl used by Tverskoy <italic>et al</italic>. failed to reduce the analgesic consumption in patients given fentanyl- lignocaine combination for wound infiltration.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] A dose of 25 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g fentanyl with lignocane utilized by PT Vijay kumar <italic>et al</italic>., enhanced the duration of analgesia.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Fentanyl used at a dose of 100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g by Gupta <italic>et al</italic>. for peripheral analgesia in laparoscopic surgery for intraperitonial instillation, showed better analgesia without any complications and toxicity.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Therefore the doses of 50 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g and 100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g fentanyl were chosen in our study along with bupivacaine, a longer acting local anesthetic. In both the groups, we did not observe any complications (respiratory depression, pruritis, sedation) and signs of toxicity of fentanyl or bupivacaine clinically, though we have not measured the serum level of the drugs.</p><p>The fentanyl-induced enhancement of postoperative analgesia observed in our study is mediated by peripheral opioid receptors. A less likely alternative explanation is associated with the local anesthetic action of fentanyl (nonspecific action on sodium conductance). Since the report by Kosterlitz and Wallis local anesthetic properties of opioids have been discussed in may studies.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The local anesthetic effect of fentanyl has been described <italic>in vitro</italic> when very high concentrations of the drug were used.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, <italic>in vivo</italic>, even high concentrations of fentanyl did not affect peripheral nerve compound action potentials.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In clinically relevant concentrations fentanyl also failed to affect the nerve conduction in isolated dorsal roots.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In conclusion, fentanyl added to a local anesthetic for wound infiltration can enhance postoperative analgesia via a peripheral mechanism. In this study, It is clear that the addition of opioids to local anesthetics for postoperative pain results from a truly peripheral rather than a central site of action. This is because peripheral uptake of opioids into the circulation (effect of systemic dose lasts for half an hour only) and transport to the CNS cannot be explained by the central action of fentanyl. It has been postulated that inflammatory hyperalgesia is especially amenable to peripheral antinociceptive.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The presence of inflammation has been found to enhance the efficacy of peripherally applied opioids.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This is because inflammation disrupts the perineurium as well as increases the number of peripheral sensory nerve terminals. The favorable results in our study and of other authours may be because of infiltration being performed after completion of surgery when inflammatory response may have begun.</p><p>Since wound infiltration with bupivacaine and its combination with fentanyl affects only somatic component of postoperative pain, it has always been used as a part of multimodal analgesia. Unfortunately NSAIDs alone are insufficient to effectively treat post-operative pain. However, inclusion of NSAIDs in a multimodal approach to pain relief after surgery has been very successful both in improving the quality of analgesia resulting from systemic or neuraxially administered opioids and reducing side effects.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In this study we used subcutaneous infiltration of bupivacaine and fentanyl in combination with diclofenac sodium in post-operative period so as to cover both somatic and visceral pain. Both the combinations of Bupivacaine and fantanyl are found to be efficacious as a part of multimodal analgesia. We used 50 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g and 100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g fentanyl which is well with in the permissible limit and there was no evidence clinically that the dose of drug used had crossed the toxic levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Fentanyl and bupivacaine combinations in doses of 50 and 100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g along with 0.5% bupivacaine at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight are effective in the management of postoperative pain, as a part of multimodal analgesic regimen. Patients who received 100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g fentanyl (Group II) had lower VAS scores as compared to the patients who received 50 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g fentanyl (Group I) though this was not statistically significant at all times. This method of analgesia is a safe, easy and effective that targets pain at its origin and is virtually free from side effects.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Burgess</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Perl</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cutaneous mechanoreceptors and nociceptors</article-title><source>Handbook of sensory physiology</source><year>1973</year><publisher-loc>Heidelberg</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Springer Verlag</publisher-name><fpage>29</fpage><lpage>78</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Raja</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Peripheral mechanism of somatic pain</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>1998</year><volume>68</volume><fpage>571</fpage><lpage>90</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3281512</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yaksh</surname><given-names>TL</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammond</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periferial and central substences involved in the rostrad transmission of nociceptive information</article-title><source>Pain</source><year>1982</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>85</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6287384</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>WF</given-names></name><name><surname>Nulsen</surname><given-names>FE</given-names></name><name><surname>Randt</surname><given-names>CT</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Relation of peripheral fibre size and sensation in man</article-title><source>Arch Neurol</source><year>1960</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>381</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">13694775</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ness</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Gebhart</surname><given-names>GF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Visceral pain.
