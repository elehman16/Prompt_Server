treadmill walking affects the gait parameters of stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods]
The participants, 30 hemiplegic stroke patients, were randomly allocated to one of three
groups: the NHG group (No Handrail group, n=10), the FHG group (Front handrail group,
n=10), and BHG group (Bilateral Handrail group, n=10). All the subjects&#x02019; performed
treadmill walking for 30&#x02005;min, five days a week, for a period of eight weeks. Gait
parameters were evaluated using the RS-scan system. [Results] A statistically significant
difference in the HM (heel-medial) area of plantar foot pressure was observed between BHG
and NHG. Statistically significant difference in the HL (heel-lateral) area of plantar
foot pressure was observed between BHG and NHG, and between FHG and NHG. A statistically
significant difference in contact area of the rear foot was observed between BHG and NHG.
[Conclusion] The results of this study show that holding handrails during treadmill
training may enhance the improvement in the quality of patients&#x02019; gait (plantar foot
pressure, contact area of foot).</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Treadmill training</kwd><kwd>Handrails</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Treadmills are widely used for gait training of stroke patients in clinical practice. The
walking environment provided by a treadmill is similar to that of walking on the ground<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. While training on a treadmill, patients can
usually place their hands on the handrails or use them for support. When walking on a
treadmill, most stroke patients hold the handrails with the unaffected hand or both hands,
which may be a strategy to correct or improve their body balance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Touching handrails lightly can decrease the physiologic
stress of gait instability, and may facilitate balance control<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A light touch by the fingertips of patients with sensory neuropathy of the peripheral
nerves may partially mitigate the disturbance of their posture control function. Lackner et
al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated the importance of a
light touch by the fingertips. A light touch by the fingertips can reduce postural sway,
which may also be of benefit during walking. According to some reports, postural sway was
reduced by the light touch of the fingertips on a fixed object during one-leg standing or
eyes-closed standing<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies of treadmill training or light touch sense have been conducted. However, there
is a lack of research focusing on the way handrails are held, regarding the elicitation of
light touch sense or tactile sense, during treadmill walking by stroke patients. The purpose
of this study was to investigate how the holding of handrails during treadmill walking
affects the gait parameters of stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty participants with first onset of stroke were recruited for this study. Participants
met the following inclusion criteria: onset of stroke at least six months before the study;
the ability to walk independently on a treadmill; and the ability to hold the handrails
(Chedoke-McMaster &#x02265;3/7 for arm and hand).</p><p>All of the participants understood the purpose of this study and gave their written
informed consent before participating in the experiment involvement. This study was
performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the local
committee of the Institutional Review Board of Daegu University. All the participants
received conventional physical therapy in addition to training on treadmill (JT-4000M,
SNSCARE, Korea). This treadmill has a front handrail and two handrails on both sides, so
patients using this clinical equipment can walk using the handrails for assistance.
Treadmill training began at a slow speed, which was slowly increased The subjects were
randomly allocated to one of three groups according to the use of the handrails: treadmill
walking without holding a handrail, the no handrail group (NHG); treadmill walking with
holding the front handrail with both hands, the front handrail group (FHG); and treadmill
walking holding the bilateral handrails with both hands, the bilateral handrail group (BHG).
NHG trained while their arms hanging at their sides. FHG held the front handrail height of
95&#x02005;cm with both hands shoulder width apart. All subjects were instructed to keep their heads
up and look forward, so that they did not lean excessively to the front. BHG trained holding
the handrails on both sides, which are 83&#x02005;cm in height and 69&#x02005;cm in length with both hands
approximately 15&#x02005;cm in front of the midline. All subjects wore a safety harness suspended
from the ceiling that bore no weight, but would provide support in the event of a fall. Each
group had 10 subjects. During treadmill walking, subjects walked at a self-selected
comfortable walking speed. All participants performed treadmill walking for 30&#x02005;min, five
days a week, for a period of eight weeks.</p><p>This study measured gait variables using the RS-scan system (RS scan Ltd., German). The
subjects walked on the RS-scan plate, for determination of plantar foot pressure and contact
area of the foot. All subjects walked without shoes over the plate. Gait variables including
pressure and contact area were calculated using RS-scan software. This study measured the
foot pressure data using the RS-scan system which includes a normalization procedure. The
plantar pressure area was divided into 10 regions: Toe1, Toe2&#x02013;5, Metatarsal 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
Midfoot, Heel-medial and Heel-lateral. The contact area was separated into fore, mid, and
rear foot. Subjects began walking 50&#x02005;cm in front of the RS-scan plate following a &#x0201c;Start&#x0201d;
cue, and walked continuously over the RS-scan plate at a comfortable speed. The mean of two
trials at pre-test and post-test after eight weeks was used for analysis, and only paretic
limb data were used. Data were collected at a rate of 126 frame/sec using Footscan 7 gait
2nd generation, a software program of the RS-scan system.</p><p>Group demography was compared using one-way ANOVA and the LSD procedure as a post hoc test.
Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of Condition (NHG vs. FHG vs. BHG) &#x000d7; Period (pre and
post), with repeated measures of both factors, was performed for each group of subjects.
When ANOVA yielded a significant interaction (p &#x0003c; 0.05), post hoc analyses were performed
using the t-test with LSD correction for multiple comparisons. All data were analyzed using
SPSS 12.0 statistical software.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences in gender (male/female, NHG: 8/2, FHG: 6/4, BHG:

treadmill walking affects the gait parameters of stroke patients. In each group, we measured
gait parameters before and after training. As a result of the training, significantly better
gait parameters were observed in FHG and BHG than in NHG.</p><p>According to results of the present study, plantar pressure and the contact area of the
rear foot showed more significant increases in the handrail holding groups than in the no
handrail group. Inappropriate coordination, short step length, long stance phase, and short
swing phase are general characteristics of the gait of stroke patients, and may be caused by
a spastic pattern of hamstring and calf muscles. Shortening of the calf muscle, in
particular, causes a decrease in plantar pressure of the heel during gait<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chen et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that stroke patients&#x02019; contact area ratio of the rear foot
was lower than that of normal persons. This finding was interpreted as an effect of the
extensor synergy pattern on the lower limb, post stroke. Extensor synergy pattern interferes
with coordination of the ankle dorsiflexors and knee extensor, and causes the forefoot to
make contact with the ground earlier than the rear foot<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, holding handrails on a treadmill provided a sensation of light touch sense
or tactile stimulus. According to Dickstein et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, light touch sense affected postural stability as measured by body
sway during treadmill training. In addition, according to Duysens et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, stable posture and performance of core
stability is important for heel contact with the ground in stroke patients. In the present
study, the sense originating at the hands decreased body sway, which would have helped
patient&#x02019;s heel contact with the ground as well. We consider that light touch sense or
tactile sense occurred through holding of the handrails, which resulted in better postural
stability. As a sensorimotor process, postural control can alter the force generating
capacity as well as the peripheral proprioceptive system. It is thought that improved
postural stability can change the proprioception sense of the lower extremity and affect the
heel contact ratio. In other words, increased postural stability can alter the joint angles
of the lower extremities and increase the heel contact ratio making it similar to that of
normal gait<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of this study show that holding handrails during treadmill training had a
positive effect on gait parameters. Patients training on a treadmill are usually not
concerned about their hands, however, the results of this study provide a reminder that the
use of handrails is very important for postural stability. It can also improve the ratio of
plantar pressure and the landing area of the rear foot. Therefore, in the clinic, physical
therapists should pay attention to patient&#x02019;s method of treadmill training for better
improvement of their gait. In addition, the further direction of study should be to provide
more evidence for this result.</p><p>This study had a few limitations. The number of subjects was small, and the subjects were
capable of using their affected limb to hold handrails. Therefore, our findings might not be
generalizable to other stroke patients. In addition, because the period of study was only
eight weeks, we could not confirm whether or not the effect of training persisted after the
experiment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name><name><surname>Gong</surname><given-names>WT</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The effects of lower extremitiy muscle strengthening
