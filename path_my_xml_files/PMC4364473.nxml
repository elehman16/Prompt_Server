As a high risk industry, there is a need to investigate factors that affect the occurrence of these accidents to be able to protect workers (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). </p><p>Organizing workers trainings and maintaining occupational safety and health in the workplace are vital for organizations and industries (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The training is a process by which employees gain knowledge, learn new skills, or acquire motivation to start performing in a specific way (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Providing enough training for all workers is crucial to ensure worker&#x02019;s safety and to make them aware of any possible dangers and instruct ways to avoid occupational hazards (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, training is costly both in terms of production and expenses, so the evaluation of its effectiveness is necessary (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The main emphasis on training effectiveness is making changes in safety performance (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, this might imply measuring accidents in the workplace as a basis for assessment of safety training, it show such problems like accidents being relatively low-frequent events and incidents have not being recorded in the workplace (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). One method with approved validity in relation to safety is the measurement of attitudes where they are specifically measured (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Attitudes are related to occupational accidents and measuring them to evaluate the effectiveness of safety training can be useful (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The safety attitudes are the beliefs and emotions around the safety issues, and they reflect a sense of responsibility and commitment toward safety issues (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Employees&#x02019; attitudes can act as a mediator between safety climate and accident occurrence and may indirectly influence the individuals&#x02019; safety behaviors and performance (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Researches show that safety attitude is related to other variables that associated with the occurrence of accidents such as: safety compliance practices (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), risk behavior (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), sensation seeking (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), breaking safety rules (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and fatalism (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Increasing attention in the literature focused upon learned helplessness (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Helplessness related with coping style of denial and avoidance (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), decreasing the well-being (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and increasing depression, anxiety and physical illness (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). It negatively related to work adjustment in newcomers (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and positivity related to work alienation, include the deficiency in job involvement (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Individuals that feel they are exposed to uncontrollable job events and cannot do anything to change these events experience helplessness (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Helplessness is a psychological state in which an individual to believe that no control over a circumstance environment that her action is meaningless, and it results from cognitive, motivational, and emotional deficiencies in individuals (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Abramson et al. stated that the type of the individual&#x02019;s attributions on uncontrollable events predict the degree and parameters of helplessness (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). An attribution is personal/stable/global predict serious consequences for a person, because the person (a) will search defect for the unpleasant events her/his inside, (b) believes that the outcome of events is stable, and (c) event will happen again (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, the mere observation of such deficiencies is not sufficient in order to conclude about the experience of helplessness, individuals should also perceive that the outcome of the event do not depend on their response (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>With attention to stated material above, research about safety training and perceived helplessness can have many advantages for organizations and individuals due to increasing employees&#x02019; safe behaviors and promoting safety level in workplace. The present study attempts to: 1) the examination of the effectiveness of safety training to change the attitude toward safety issues; 2) the examination of the effectiveness of safety training to decrease perceived helplessness; 3) the specification of the mediator role of attitude toward safety issues in the relationship between safety training and perceived helplessness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>

</p><p>The current study was an experimental study with the control group. This research was administrated between January and February 2012 in Esfahan Steel Company. Esfahan Steel Company (Zob Ahan-e Esfahan) opened in late 1960s, based close to the cities of Fooladshahr and Zarrinshahr, Esfahan Province. Esfahan Steel Company (ESCO) is the first and largest manufacturer of constructional steel products in Iran (No = 8300) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In this research, in attention to the extent and distribution of the employees in the different parts of Esfahan Steel Company (Tohid Building, Navard part, blast furnace, steel making, coke, fire, railway, gas, oxygen plant, technical guidance, etc.), the sample was selected according to the stratified random sampling method. In stratified random sampling, the strata are formed based on members&#x02019; shared attributes or characteristics. A random sample from each stratum is taken in a number proportional to the stratum&#x02019;s size when compared with the population. These subsets of the strata are then pooled to form a random sample. Then simple random sampling or systematic sampling is applied within each stratum (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The sample size was calculated using of SPSS for Windows (version 15, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), Following the procedure recommended by Molavi (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Given an, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> level 0.05 and a power of 90%, the sample size required was estimated to be 204 subjects. Informed consent form was obtained from each participant and was approved the research by the appropriately constituted Ethics Committees at Isfahan University.</p><p>Participants ranged in age from 18 to 53; the mean age of the participants was 39 years (SD = 5.58 years); 62% of the participants were high school graduates, 38% were university graduates; 88% were married and 12% were unmarried; average work experience was 12 years (SD = 3.2 years) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic characteristics of the sample members (N = 204)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Linguistic validation was performed by three experts of the psychology department and five experts of safety and health departments. Thus, the questionnaires were piloted and finalized with an advisory group of employees to ensure that the scales items were comprehensible and appropriate to the context. Moreover, conceptual analysis was confirmed the linguistic validity of all instrument. The questionnaires were distributed to employees with the help of union supervisor.

<italic>Attitude toward safety issues</italic>
</p><p>The safety attitude questionnaire used to collect data about attitude toward safety issues for this research was a self-reported questionnaire of Munteanu (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This questionnaire is the method most often used for collecting attitudinal data and was therefore the choice for this research. This questionnaire translated and validated in Persian, and items of it were amended by safety and health specialists to adapt with the steel industry. The safety attitude inventory is a 66-item self-report scale that measure attitude factors related to accidents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>It is presented in a multiple-choice format. The statements are arranged for reflect agreements&#x02019; intensity from strongly disagree (0) to strongly agree (4). A sample item is &#x0201c;I do not use equipment that I feel is unsafe&#x0201d;, that is related to safety consciousness factor. Munteanu (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) concluded that this inventory has high internal reliability (for all factors, Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; takes values between 0.70 and 0.80) and also has a good validity. Evidence of reliability of this inventory, as administered to Iranian relevant populations, in this research, was calculated by &#x003b1; coefficient 0.78 and by Split-half 0.80 (for all factors, Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; takes values between 0.56 and 0.87). The validity coefficients of questions and scales of safety attitude with other questionnaires of safety attitude are between 0.24 and 0.79 that all the validity coefficients are significant at p = 0.01.</p><p>
<italic>Perceived helplessness</italic>
</p><p>Perceived helplessness was measured with the 6-item of perceived helplessness scale developed by Cohen et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The items asked respondents how often they found their lives unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). All the items we used were modified to ensure that they were appropriate for the industrial context and were included a number of direct questions about the current levels of perceived helplessness. A sample item is &#x0201c;in the last month in the work environment, how often have you been angry because of the things that were outside of your control.&#x0201d; The questions in this scale ask about feelings and thoughts during the last month. In each case, respondents are asked about how often they felt in a certain way. Scoring is based on a Likert-scale format from never (0) to very often (4). The scores of participants were obtained by adding their responses to a 6-items questionnaire. Higher scores indicate that occupational events are perceived as unpredictable and uncontrollable by workers. This scale has validity (reliability = 0.84, 0.85, 0.86 in three cases), high internal reliability (0.79 = Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;) and acceptable validity (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;) in this study in Iran was 0.88, which was excellent for this scale. The validity coefficient of perceived helplessness scale with the attributional style questionnaire of Peterson et al. are 0.71 that this validity coefficient are significant at p = 0.01 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>
<bold><italic>Data analysis</italic></bold>
</p><p>From descriptive statistics and covariance analysis (in order to controlling for the effects of pre-test scores on post-test scores), were used to test the hypothesized relationships between safety training, perceived helplessness and attitudes toward safety issues, and this analysis was performed using software SPSS for Windows (version 18, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To test the mediating effect of attitudes toward safety issues on the relationship between safety training and perceived helplessness was used of equations designed by MacKinnon (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>
<bold><italic>Attitude toward safety issues</italic></bold>
</p><p>We examined the data on attitude toward safety issues and perceived helplessness and found that there was not only homogeneity of variance, but in addition, the data were normally distributed. An ANCOVA analysis with removing the effect of pre-test scores indicated that there was a significant difference between the experimental group (M = 214.38, SD = 17.64) and control group (M = 202.03, SD = 15.2) on the measurement of attitude toward safety issues at the end of the training program [F(1, 202) = 8.12, p = 0.01]. Effect size was 0.15. The statistical power of 0.80 indicated that the sample size was sufficient to investigate this hypothesis.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Perceived helplessness</italic></bold>
</p><p>An ANCOVA analysis with removing the effect of pre-test scores indicated that there was a significant difference between the experimental group (M = 11.6, SD = 3.52) and control group (M = 14.31, SD = 4.75) on the measurement of perceived helplessness at the end of the training program (F(1, 202) = 14.22, p = 0.05). Effect size was 0.23. The statistical power of 0.96 indicated that the sample size was sufficient to investigate this hypothesis.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Mediating effects</italic></bold>
</p><p>To test the mediator role of attitude toward safety issues on the relationship between safety training and perceived helplessness, investigating correlation coefficients was observed that there is a significant overlap between the attitude toward safety issues and perceived helplessness (r = &#x02212;0.31, p = 0.02); therefore, in order to investigate two possible alternative, was used of equations designed by MacKinnon (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), that is, the expansion of three-stage model proposed by Baron and Kenny (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) and Judd and Kenny (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Attitude toward safety training mediated the effect of safety training on perceived safety helplessness</italic>
</p><p>The safety training had a significant positive effect on attitude toward safety issues [F(1, 202) = 14.22, p = 0.01] and perceived helplessness [F(1, 202) = 8.12, p = 0.05]. When perceived helplessness was regressed onto both attitude toward safety issues, and safety training, only safety training remained significant [F(1, 202) = 4.72, p = 0.03]. The attitude toward safety issues was no longer a significant predicator of perceived safety helplessness [F(1, 202) = 1.73, p = 0.13]. However, was observed that attitude toward safety issues has been somewhat mediated this relationship, so that the effect size is reduced (from 0.15 to 0.01). Contradictory results showed that, firstly, the attitude toward safety issues after arrival in this relationship as a third variable was not a significant predictor for perceived helplessness and also, its effect size was low (=0.04). Secondly, with the arrival of this variable as mediator, the effect size of safety training has somewhat decreased (p = 0.01). Therefore, maybe the overlap between safety attitudes and pre-test of perceived helplessness was caused to decrease the effect size of safety training. Thus, employees in terms of the mean score of perceived helplessness in the pre-test phase were divided into two groups. Individuals with low helplessness in group 1 and individuals with high helplessness in group 2 were placed, and the results of two groups were compared (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>As are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">table 4</xref>, training safety was the significant predictor of perceived helplessness in the group with low perceived helplessness (p = 0.02), but in the group with high perceived helplessness, the attitude toward safety was the significant predictor of perceived helplessness (p = 0.02).</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>The relationship between variables under study in individuals with perceived low and high helplessness</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="justify" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

<italic>Perceived helplessness mediated the effect of safety training on attitude toward safety issues</italic>
</p><p>The safety training had a significant positive effect on perceived helplessness [F(1, 202) = 8.12, p = 0.05] and attitude toward safety issues [F(1, 202) = 14.22, p = 0.01]. When attitude toward safety issues was regressed onto both perceived helplessness and safety training, only safety training remained significant [F(1, 202) = 10.16, p = 0.02]. The perceived helplessness was no longer a significant predicator of attitude toward safety issues [F(1, 202) = 1.74, p = 0.51]. Also, was observed that the effect size was not considerably reduced (from 0.23 to 0.22). </p><p>Therefore, the attitude toward safety issues mediated the relationship between safety training and perceived helplessness in the group with perceived high helplessness. In the group with perceived low helplessness, safety training decreased perceived helplessness. The relationships between these variables are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current research examined the effectiveness of safety training on reducing employees&#x02019; helplessness with attention to the mediating role of attitude toward safety issues. </p><p>The results of the present study indicated that safety training significantly improved employees&#x02019; attitude toward safety issues in the post-test. These results were aligned with findings of other research (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Dong et al. showed that safety training play a positive role in improving occupational attitudes and consequently in reducing the number of job related accidents (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Harvey et al. observed meaningful improvements in beliefs and attitudes before and after a safety training intervention (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Colter (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) found that time of investigating an accident, important reasons that you hear from the employees, these are: &#x0201c;I did not know&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;I did not see&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;I did not think.&#x0201d; &#x0201c;I do not think I slip and fall&#x0201d;. He suggested that we must act proactively, only &#x0201c;training, training, training&#x0201d; is important. Quick et al. stated that the important predictor of the consideration of protective behaviors by individuals, are safety attitude (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Safety training should have an effective role in improving safety attitudes and subsequently in promoting safety culture in organizations.</p><p>Furthermore, the current research results indicated that the safety training could improve perceived helplessness in post-test phase. For explaining the relationship, we can use of the uncontrollability content. The perception of helplessness usually occurs when a person has previously failed to achieve their career goals. If people think that they are unable to control events and attribute them to internal/stable/global causes, would perceive helplessness; Helpless individuals perceived future events uncontrollable (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p><p>With attention to in safety training courses, occupational accidents and how dealing with emergency situations be trained, this trainings can increase workers&#x02019; awareness about safety issues and reduce the individuals&#x02019; perception of uncontrollable events; subsequently decrease the perception of helplessness in employees. Individuals recognize the hazard conditions and realize that occupational accidents do not happen under any circumstances (doing a series of actions under certain conditions result to occurrence of these accidents). For example, with the consideration of safety issues and the use of protection devices decrease the injury chance of an individual in the heights. </p><p>About the mediating effect of attitude toward safety issues on the relationship between safety training and perceived helplessness, the results showed that individuals with different levels of perceived helplessness in the pre-test safety were differently affected by the safety training. In the group with perceived low helplessness, safety training was the significant predictor of perceived helplessness and in the group with high helplessness, the attitudes toward safety issues was the significant predictor of perceived helplessness. This matter clarifies that individuals with low perceived helplessness have better attitudes toward safety issues; therefore, the feeling of their helplessness may relate to the lack of information and awareness about safety issues. Whereas, individuals with high perceived helplessness have weaker attitude toward safety issues. Providing safety trainings alone aren&#x02019;t adequate for them; only training that can change attitudes toward safety issues, can be effective in reducing their helplessness.</p><p>According to these results, we can say that one of the causes of perceived helplessness in employees can be employees&#x02019; weak attitudes toward safety issues and can decrease the perceived helplessness with promoting their safety attitudes. This result can be justified with two constructs of fatalism and locus of control.</p><p>Fatalism is an obstacle to the adoption of safe working behavior (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Fatalism describes the belief that injuries are unavoidable and happen due to haphazard or fate (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). It is negatively related with reporting job risk (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) and is positively related with the self-care disorder (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Believe to fatalism have negatively influenced the acceptance of safe work practices (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Fatalism can be recognized by perceptions of worthlessness, powerlessness, hopelessness, and futile (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Believe to fatalism may facilitate the attitude that accidents are unprofitable (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), and consequently, increases helplessness in among workers. The results of Patwary et al. showed that fatalistic beliefs among personnel of an organization that attributed these events to &#x0201c;<italic>fate</italic>&#x0201d; reflecting their perceived lack of control over accidents and reveals a lack of organizational awareness that can occur within a culture of fatalism (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Safety training with increasing employees&#x02019; awareness and with changing their attitudes toward safety issues can change this culture in organizations, and can improve employees&#x02019; control on safety issues. </p><p>External locus of control refers to attribute consequence to external element. In contrast internal locus of control refers to attribute consequence to internal element (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Employee with an internal locus of control tends to believe that they can prevent accidents and injuries. In contrast, employee with an external locus of control tends to believe that accidents and injuries are due to forces outside their control, such as fate, or fatalism (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). External locus of control has a positive correlation with helplessness (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) and accident occurrence (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), and internal locus of control has a negative correlation with psychological distress (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), anxiety and depression (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Individuals with an internal locus of control have better attitudes toward safety issues, thus the perception of helplessness in them more likely returns to lack of awareness. In contrast Individuals with an external locus of control have weaker attitudes toward safety issues (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), to decrease helplessness in them, should early be promote their attitudes toward safety issues. </p><p>The present study needs to be replicated in different populations and needs more empirical support. Until then, the findings of the study should be interpreted with caution. Further, the cross-sectional design of the study and participants (i.e., a group of employee) exert some limitations on the generalization of the findings. Finally, the problems and limitations on the use of self-repotting instruments should not be overlooked. However, limitation is usually accepted due to the fact that self-report surveys are considered the most practical way to collect data and to reflect individual attitudes and behaviors. There are many aspects which should be clarified in future research, for example, do personality styles of worker have mediating role in relation between safety training and perceived helplessness? These observations would be investigated in the future research. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the generosity of employees who agreed to participate in this research.</p></ack><sec><title/><p>
