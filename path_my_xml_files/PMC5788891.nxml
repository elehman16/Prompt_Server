Frequently reported limitations after stroke are impairments of upper limb motor function and activities, which is present in 80% of the acute stroke patients (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Recovery of post-stroke impairments mainly occurs within the first 3&#x02009;months after stroke and plateaus thereafter (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Although the presence of a plateau phase implies that patients have reached a stable situation, a functional decline has been shown on the long term (i.e., learned-non-use) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This underlines the importance of continued practice beyond the first 3&#x02009;months post-stroke, with the aim to maintain the levels achieved during earlier rehabilitation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Key elements that characterize effective stroke rehabilitation interventions are intensity of practice, and task- and context-specificity (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Provision of feedback is another important ingredient for effective motor learning after stroke (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In the last decade, rehabilitation technology has enabled higher intensity of practice and new methods of feedback. Examples of applied technologies for the upper limb are robotics and virtual reality (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, these interventions often lack context-specificity, as the training is almost always performed in a clinic and to date, a beneficial effect on what patients actually do with their paretic upper limb in their daily lives has not been reported. Furthermore, many of these technological developments require a high-financial investment in terms of costs and human resources. Recent developments in the field of tracking and feedback technology have provided low-cost tools (e.g., sensors) that incorporate key elements for effective stroke rehabilitation outside the clinic. These tracking and feedback tools have the potential to motivate patients to use their paretic upper limb in daily life while they are in their home environment. With that, they possibly are able to maintain or even improve gains made during the intensive rehabilitation period and facilitate a translation to the patients&#x02019; daily life. These tools most often rely on accelerometer data, which have been found to be reliable and valid in stroke subjects (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and correlate well with patient-reported upper limb use in daily life as assessed by the Motor Activity Log (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Previous research has shown that stroke survivors have a high adherence to wearing accelerometer devices at home (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and report good acceptance levels and high usability scores (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). These tracking devices can be used to give augmented feedback regarding movement outcomes or success rate (i.e., knowledge of results) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Knowledge of results is an external form of feedback that can encourage a patient to reach a certain goal, such as using the paretic upper limb at least a pre-defined number of times a day (e.g., 100) when performing daily life activities. In this example, the external feedback given by the trackers could enhance a patient&#x02019;s intrinsic motivation to improve the number of times he or she uses the upper limb during the day. The provided feedback should be tailored to the individual needs to increase motivation, compliance, and effectiveness. There are various feedback modalities available, such as vibrotactile, visual, and auditory feedback. A recent study reported that stroke patients preferred vibrotactile feedback over visual and auditory feedback (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, the application of visual feedback on a smartphone has also been indicated as an effective way of delivering feedback (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). With that, the optimal medium for providing feedback remains unknown.</p><sec id="S1-1"><title>Study Aim</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to determine the post-intervention and long-term effects of wearing a wrist-worn, commercially available tracking device that provides multimodal feedback for 6&#x02009;weeks on patient-reported amount of paretic upper limb use in daily life in hemiparetic subjects beyond 3&#x02009;months after stroke, when compared with a control group receiving an identical looking device providing no feedback. The secondary aims are to examine the compliance to use the device, and explore the effect on motor function of the paretic upper limb, upper limb capacity, patient-reported quality of paretic upper limb use in daily life, global disability, health-related quality of life, and during the 6-week intervention, the compliance and activity counts of the paretic and non-paretic upper limb. As a measure of safety, the incidence and severity of side effects related to the long-time wrist-worn feedback intervention during the study period will be investigated. Furthermore, the Minimal Clinical Important Difference (MCID) of the Amount of Use (AOU) subscale of the Motor Activity Log&#x02014;14 Item Version (MAL&#x02014;14) will be established.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods and Analysis</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Study Design</title><p>The present study is a multi-center, assessor-blinded, Phase 2 randomized controlled trial with a superiority framework, including two parallel study arms.

The trackers are hardware-wise identical and consist of: the actual tracker (silver with a feedback and communication module for the paretic side, which is deactivated for the control group); a reference tracker (black-brown tracker for the non-paretic side); and an exchangeable, flexible black wristband. Both elements are made out of biocompatible materials. The devices should be worn every day, as long as possible over a period of 6&#x02009;weeks. During this 6-week period, a three-axis accelerometer in each device will constantly monitor the subjects&#x02019; arm movements. A threshold of 0.1&#x02009;g acceleration is defined for detection of movements. This raw acceleration data, aggregated over 1&#x02009;min, will be converted on-device in so-called &#x0201c;Arm Activities.&#x0201d; Starting from a pre-defined goal-value, new daily goals will be automatically calculated every day from the rolling average of the last 30&#x02009;days plus 3% (e.g., after the first intervention week, patient X shows an average number of 100 &#x0201c;Arm Activities&#x0201d; per day. For day 8, his daily goal therefore becomes 103 &#x0201c;Arm Activities&#x0201d;). Patients will constantly be challenged to slightly increase their Arm Activities without ever being overstrained. Assuming a steady arm activity during the course of the day, a linear target activity line will be calculated (default start/end times: 8:00&#x02009;a.m. to 10:00&#x02009;p.m.). The already reached &#x0201c;Arm Activities&#x0201d; will be compared with an intermediate target value. After 30&#x02009;min of inactivity, the &#x0201c;ARYS&#x02122; me|tracker&#x0201d; vibration engine will provide the subject on the paretic wrist with two short double pulses and up to four LEDs will light up in orange color to remind to make more use of this arm (Level 1 Reminder). If 30&#x02009;min later, &#x0201c;Arm Activities&#x0201d; are still below the intermediate target, a second escalation level of the reminder is triggered: five long vibrating pulses will be provided and up till four LEDs will light up in red color (Level 2 Reminder). Thereafter, the escalation level is reset and starts over again with the Level 1 reminder next time. Additionally, by pressing the button on the &#x0201c;ARYS&#x02122; me|tracker&#x0201d; once, the LED lights will show the percentage of the daily target that is already reached (one white LED&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;25%; two white LEDs&#x02009;=&#x02009;25&#x02013;49%; three white LEDs&#x02009;=&#x02009;50&#x02013;75%; three white LEDs and one blinking LED&#x02009;=&#x02009;75&#x02013;99%; four white LEDs&#x02009;=&#x02009;100%, daily target reached) and the patient receives vibration feedback. When the patient has reached the daily target, the tracker vibrates.</p><p>Participants in the intervention group are encouraged to regularly check the pre-installed &#x0201c;ARYS&#x02122; me|app&#x0201d; on a standard commercial Android smartphone, which they have received. It will download &#x0201c;Arm Activity&#x0201d; data from the &#x0201c;ARYS&#x02122; me|tracker&#x0201d; automatically, motivate study subjects based on the concepts of gamification, and visualize activity data over various time intervals. Patients can monitor the development of their daily targets, today&#x02019;s progress, and provided reminders toward the daily target, as well as a history of all past &#x0201c;Arm Activities&#x0201d; and reminders presented in a day, week, month, and year view (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D).

However, a tight fit on the wrist will be beneficial to reduce motion artifacts and to ensure that the vibration feedback is properly felt by the study subjects. As both devices are splash-waterproof, there is no need to doff the trackers during daily activities involving water, such as washing hands or showering. Thanks to the easy-to-use pin-and-tuck closure, study subjects should be able to don/doff the device on their own without any help (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A,B). Other than instruction through a non-blinded study member at one of the participating study sites and the information provided in the group-specific leaflet, no training or experience will be required to use the devices.

Patients are eligible, regardless whether they have suffered an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Although it has been shown that hemorrhagic stroke patients are more severely affected in the acute stage when compared with ischemic stroke patients (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), long-term functional outcomes were not significantly different (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). As we include stroke survivors beyond 3&#x02009;months post-stroke, we do not expect that type of stroke affects the outcomes of the present study. In addition, since we will recruit stroke patients beyond 3&#x02009;months after stroke onset, we do expect that recovery has plateaued and no improvements will occur in the absence of intensive rehabilitation.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that intensive rehabilitation can influence upper limb capacity in chronic stroke patients, but context-specificity is often limited and the observed improvements fail to translate to upper limb use in daily life (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The present study can help to close the gap that exists regarding the translation of gains made during inpatient rehabilitation to the home situation. The amount that patients use their paretic arm in daily life could be enhanced by providing multimodal feedback when they are in their home environment. Feedback can be used to motivate stroke patients and with that, positively impact patient outcomes (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The experimental trial arm receives feedback regarding Arm Activities (i.e., knowledge of results). This can mainly be seen as extrinsic feedback, as the patients receive immediate vibrotactile feedback from the trackers when paretic arm use is below the pre-set daily target (i.e., controlled motivation). They furthermore receive delayed feedback regarding paretic arm use when they use the smartphone application. However, the use of the pre-installed application on the smartphone also requires self-determined motivation (i.e., self-control of feedback) of the patient, as he or she actively has to open the application for checking their progress and play the &#x0201c;Tree of Recovery.&#x0201d; We expect that the combination of various forms of feedback (vibrotactile feedback, visual feedback by the LED lights, information regarding upper limb activity counts in the app, and gamification) increases patient-reported amount of upper limb use in daily life, which consolidates at follow-up.</p><p>The applied tracking and feedback device focuses on the number of times that the patient moves the paretic upper limb in daily life. The MAL&#x02014;14 AOU as a primary outcome matches this goal, by asking patients to rate how often they have used their paretic upper limb in daily life activities. We hypothesize that the change in MAL&#x02014;14 AOU from baseline to post-intervention and follow-up will significantly differ between the experimental and control groups, favoring the experimental group. We expect that this difference will be also clinically relevant. This means that the change observed in the experimental group from baseline to post-intervention is at least 0.75 points more when compared with the control group. The latter is especially important, as clinical applicability and acceptability are highly dependent on whether a statistically significant difference is also meaningful for clinical practice. Although this study is not powered for our secondary outcomes, we expect to see relevant differences between groups regarding upper limb capacity (ARAT) and changes in upper limb activity counts as measured by the tracker devices itself during the 6-week intervention. Contrary, we do not expect to find clinically relevant change on motor function of the paretic upper limb (FMA&#x02014;UE). First of all, because the feedback does not relate to QOM. Second, while patients in the chronic phase usually do not show significant, clinically relevant changes on motor function beyond 3&#x02009;months post-stroke (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Furthermore, we do not expect to see a difference between groups regarding safety and compliance to wear the devices.</p><p>A positive result of this study will underline the importance of tracking and feedback on daily life upper limb use after stroke. It would provide therapists with a tool to enhance their patients&#x02019; real-world upper limb use, without being labor-intensive. Furthermore, the application of a tracking and feedback device could potentially reduce healthcare costs, although that is something that is beyond the scope of the present study.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Ethics and Dissemination</title><p>This study will be carried out in compliance with the protocol approved by the previously mentioned ethical committees (version 1.1, dated 20/07/2017), the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH-GCP or ISO 14155:2011, as well as all Swiss national legal and regulatory requirements.
