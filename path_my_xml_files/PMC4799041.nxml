Hair loss is associated with a progressive miniaturization of the hair follicles, which initially results in shorter and finer hairs and finally in a miniature follicle with no hair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although the underlying causes of AGA remain poorly understood, genetic and hormonal factors clearly play significant roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. At the present time, only topical minoxidil and oral finasteride are approved pharmacologic agents for the treatment of AGA in the USA.</p><p>Desmosomes are intercellular adhesive junctions that mediate cell-cell adhesion and anchor the intermediate filament network to the plasma membrane, thereby providing mechanical resilience to tissues such as the epithelial tissue. Desmosomes are expressed by epithelial cells and a few other cell types and are abundant in tissues under mechanical stress, such as the heart, skin, and hair follicles. In such desmosomal proteins, mutations to the desmoglein 3 (dsg3) and dsg4 genes have been reported in inherited hypotrichosis in both mouse and human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, loss of function of the DSG1 protein and dsg3 gene mutations were reported to be associated with alopecia because of the loss of hair anchoring by the mouse follicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These reports demonstrated that desmosomal proteins, particularly DSGs, were important to protect against baldness by suppressing hair loss.</p><p><italic>t</italic>-Flavanone is synthesized as a derivative of astilbin, a flavonoid component of hypericum extract that has been shown to actively stimulate hair growth. In our previous report, we described some biological activities of <italic>t</italic>-flavanone as a mechanism to promote hair growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this report, we described the in vivo efficacy of <italic>t</italic>-flavanone with a blood circulation accelerator (carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>) on AGA, while focusing on the anchoring strength (tenacity) of hair. Concurrently, we evaluated DSG expression in <italic>t</italic>-flavanone-treated cultured human hair follicles in vitro as a mechanism to strengthen hair tenacity. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of <italic>t</italic>-flavanone, originally developed as a component of cosmetic products for pattern baldness, in the treatment of AGA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p><italic>t</italic>-Flavanone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was synthesized by Kao Corp.

Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects, who were recruited in-house before enrollment. Eligible subjects who had mild to moderate hair loss were classified according to Ogata&#x02019;s scale for male pattern alopecia as type II early, II middle, III early, and III middle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and could be categorized as type III vertex, IV, and V according to the Norwood-Hamilton scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Subjects were excluded if they had chronic dermatologic conditions of the scalp, other medical conditions that could affect hair growth, or any medical condition at the discretion of the investigators. Subjects with a history of hair transplantation or chemotherapy on the scalp within the past year as well as subjects with recent tattooing on the scalp were also excluded. Eighty-four men between the ages 20 and 60&#x000a0;years with mild to moderate AGA were initially enrolled at the Kao Wakayama plant. For the purpose of eliminating the effect of hair tonics that were used routinely, a control period of 8&#x000a0;weeks before baseline was set. The subjects were instructed to not apply any topical treatment or take any medications or supplements for hair loss, including finasteride, minoxidil, and hormonal products, during the control period and 30-week test period. After taking baseline measurements, the subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups with equal average baldness: 0% (placebo), 0.1%, or 0.3% (wt) <italic>t</italic>-flavanone groups by the third person who did not contribute to the analyses of the results. Randomization was generated using a stratified randomization method. Approximately 2&#x000a0;ml of sample lotion was topically applied on the scalp twice a day over the test period, and compliance was assessed with a sample use diary. Seven subjects dropped out during the test period, and 27 refused to participate in a plucking test to assess hair tenacity. Finally, 77 subjects continued until the observational period, and 50 subjects completed the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Observations by the Parietal Hair and Plucking Test</title><p>At baseline and the end of the test period (week 30), a parietal global image and microscopic image of the target area (a square of approximately 0.7&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.7&#x000a0;cm) of each subject were taken using a standardized technique. At baseline, a target area was selected at the anterior edge of the bald area, and the position on the scalp was recorded to provide a stable reference point for photographic imaging throughout the test period. At baseline and week 30, the hair within the target area was clipped to approximately 1&#x000a0;mm in length, and a microscope image was captured 3&#x000a0;days later. These parietal global and microscopic images were used for assessments by a blinded investigator who rated the changes in scalp appearance from baseline to week 30 using a standardized 5-point rating scale as follows: very effective, effective, slightly effective, no change, and worse. Investigator assessments and a brief questionnaire were completed at week 30.</p><p>At week 30, the hair tenacity was electronically measured by the average peak force required for plucking out a single strand of hair in a non-bald area using the HF-1000N Digital Force Gauge Meter (Japan Instrumentation System Co., Ltd., Nara, Japan). Approximately ten strands of hair were measured, and the average hair tenacity was calculated for each subject. The diameter of each hair was also measured under a microscope at 100&#x000d7; magnification.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>In Vitro Study</title><p>Human scalp tissue was obtained from the Skin Clinic group.

After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the hair follicles were isolated under a stereoscopic microscope with tweezers and a scalpel in William E medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Although AGA is not a serious health problem, the adverse effects of AGA are associated with psychological sequelae, principally a decrease in body image satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The psychosocial impact of AGA is not insignificant, as suggested by the global popularity of hair growth stimulants. In view of the subjective nature of the effects of baldness, recent studies of hair growth products have focused on consumer self-perception of improvement rather than on objective measurement of hair counts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Our observations showed that <italic>t</italic>-flavanone improved the parietal appearance of AGA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) as well as the subjective cognition of AGA (questionnaire responses, data not shown).</p><p>The results of comprehensive evaluations showed slight improvements in AGA in the placebo group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). As reported previously, the subcutaneous blood flow in the early stage of male pattern baldness is significantly lower than that in normal subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition, the external application of CO<sub>2</sub> has been reported as a major accelerator of blood circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In such situations, we speculated that the weak effectiveness in the placebo group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c) was due to the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> as a blood circulation accelerator. These data indicate that <italic>t</italic>-flavanone significantly improved AGA, and the combination with a blood circulation accelerator such as CO<sub>2</sub> may lead to even better results.</p><p>Hair tenacity was previously correlated with hair diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This report indicated the possibility that the increase in hair diameter was due to the application of <italic>t</italic>-flavanone, which could explain why hair tenacity became greater in the intervention than placebo group. Therefore, we verified the correlations in hair tenacity and diameter by comparing tenacity in the same distributions of hair diameter. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, the tenacity and diameter in each hair diameter group were strongly correlated. Moreover, <italic>t</italic>-flavanone increased hair tenacity, even among hairs in the same diameter distribution (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b&#x02013;d). These data suggested that the enhancement in hair tenacity by <italic>t</italic>-flavanone was not due to an increase in hair diameter. In other words, <italic>t</italic>-flavanone enhanced hair tenacity regardless of the hair diameter, possibly explaining one of the mechanisms by which <italic>t</italic>-flavanone improves AGA.</p><p>At the same time, our human study had some limitations to distinguish the patients with pure AGA from those with a combination of AGA and chronic telogen effluvium (CTE). CTE was reported as a female&#x02019;s disease characterized by diffusible hair shedding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although the subjects observed in our study were males, we could not exclude the possibility that some had a combination of AGA with CTE. Recently, a method to distinguish patients with CTE was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the near future, we believe these methods will resolve the above problem.</p><p>We previously reported that <italic>t</italic>-flavanone decreased the active form of transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;2 (TGF-&#x003b2;2) through the downregulation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;s have been reported as strong inhibitors of hair growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and TGF-&#x003b2;2 was shown to induce the catagen phase in the hair cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, the suppression of TGF-&#x003b2; activity by <italic>t</italic>-flavanone effectively improves AGA. However, according to the plucking test results, we speculated that other mechanism(s) should exist that would improve AGA by <italic>t</italic>-flavanone. After measuring hair tenacity, we analyzed the mechanism of <italic>t</italic>-flavanone on the enhancement of hair tenacity using cultured human hair follicles in vitro and observed significant increases in the expression levels of DSG1, DSG2, and DSG3 following the application of <italic>t</italic>-flavanone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). DSG1 and DSG3 have been reported as the indicators of hair tenacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These data indicated that <italic>t</italic>-flavanone enhanced cell-cell adhesions in the cultured human hair follicles in vitro, which presented a possible mechanism of hair tenacity enhancement by <italic>t</italic>-flavanone. On the other hand, DSG2 was reported to be less important for cell-cell adhesions than DSG3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], although the role of DSG2 in the hair follicle remains unclear. Another group predicted that the loss of DSG2 in the skin results in some structural problems in the hair follicle because DSG2 is expressed in the basal layer of the outer root sheath at the level of the bulge and below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The role of DSG2 in the hair follicle is expected to be elucidated in the near future. Our analysis showed that DSG4 expression tended to be upregulated by <italic>t</italic>-flavanone, but not significantly (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Because DSG4 is critical to the presence of the hair shaft itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], if <italic>t</italic>-flavanone upregulates DSG4 expression in the hair shaft, it may also influence other properties of the hair.</p><p>As described above, we aimed to identify the mechanisms of <italic>t</italic>-flavanone on hair growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The suppression of the TGF-&#x003b2; signal transduction pathway, including the activation of TGF-&#x003b2; itself, is a possible mechanism by which <italic>t</italic>-flavanone improves hair growth and prevents the progression of AGA, although <italic>t</italic>-flavanone is likely to induce other mechanisms as well. In this study, we focused on cell-cell adhesion-related factors in the hair follicle and found that <italic>t</italic>-flavanone upregulated DSG expression levels in cultured human hair follicles in vitro. Our results also suggested the enhancement of hair tenacity by <italic>t</italic>-flavanone in vivo. Hence, our data provided novel insight into the mechanisms by which <italic>t</italic>-flavanone improves AGA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this article, we aimed to identify the mechanisms of action of <italic>t</italic>-flavanone on hair growth. We observed that <italic>t</italic>-flavanone improved AGA and enhanced hair tenacity by upregulation of desmoglein protein expressions. Reinforcement of hair rooting may be a mechanism by which <italic>t</italic>-flavanone promotes hair growth.
