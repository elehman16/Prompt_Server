However, it is unknown whether alcohol produces a similar impairment of neuroplasticity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a brain region that plays an important role in cognitive functioning. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of alcohol intoxication on neuroplasticity in the DLPFC. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) was used for the induction and measurement of associative LTP-like neuroplasticity in the DLPFC. Fifteen healthy subjects were administered PAS to the DLPFC following consumption of an alcohol (1.5&#x02009;g/l of body water) or placebo beverage in a within-subject cross-over design. PAS induced neuroplasticity was indexed up to 60&#x02009;minutes following PAS. Additionally, the effect of alcohol on PAS-induced potentiation of theta-gamma coupling (an index associated with learning and memory) was examined prior to and following PAS. Alcohol consumption resulted in a significant impairment of mean (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.456, df&#x02009;=&#x02009;13, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.029) and maximum potentiation (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;2.945, df&#x02009;=&#x02009;13, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.011) compared to the placebo beverage in the DLPFC and globally. Alcohol also suppressed the potentiation of theta-gamma coupling by PAS. Findings from the present study provide a potential neurophysiological mechanism for impairment of cognitive functioning by alcohol.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Alcohol consumption produces a number of neurochemical and neurophysiological changes in the brain. Acute alcohol consumption is broadly defined as consumption of any given volume of alcohol over a short period of time. Binge drinking is defined more specifically by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) as &#x0201c;&#x02026;a pattern of drinking that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels to 17.4&#x02009;mM (0.08% BAC). This typically occurs after 4 drinks for women and 5 drinks for men&#x02014;in about 2&#x02009;hours&#x0201d;. (http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/)&#x0201d;. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that acute consumption of alcohol (including binge drinking) results in an increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mediated neurotransmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and a decrease in NMDA receptor mediated transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. These aberrancies in neurotransmission with alcohol use may adversely affect neuroplasticity, which is dependent on both GABA<sub>A</sub> and NMDA receptor activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol that can be used to index long-term potentiation (LTP)-like neuroplasticity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Previous PAS studies have demonstrated that alcohol impairs neuroplasticity indexed from the motor cortex among healthy subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Our group examined the effect of alcohol intoxication (at doses of alcohol high enough to constitute heavy drinking) in 15 subjects up to 60&#x02009;minutes and 24&#x02009;hours following PAS in a within-subject crossover design study. Consumption of high doses of alcohol significantly suppressed LTP-like neuroplasticity at 30&#x02009;minutes and 60&#x02009;minutes following PAS administration compared to placebo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Findings from previous studies suggest that alcohol consumption affects neurophysiology in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (for review, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). The DLPFC is a region in the brain within the mesocortico-limbic pathway that is implicated in the pathophysiology of addiction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The DLPFC plays an important role in reward processing to guide behaviour and mediates cognitive functioning including working memory (for review, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). Given that neuroplasticity is the principle mechanism underlying learning and memory important in cognitive functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, indexing the effect of consuming high doses of alcohol on DLPFC neuroplasticity may reveal a potential mechanism of cognitive dysfunction observed during alcohol intoxication.</p><p id="Par5">Despite the important implications of neuroplasticity impairment by alcohol in the DLPFC, no study to date has examined the effect of alcohol intoxication on neuroplasticity in this region in humans <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our group has demonstrated that LTP-like neuroplasticity can be indexed from the DLPFC by combining PAS with electroencephalography (EEG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. EEG allows for the measurement of cortical evoked activity (CEA), which is the net brain activity to a stimulus. Potentiation of CEA by PAS is therefore indicative of an increase in brain activity, reflective of LTP-like neuroplasticity. This potentiation of CEA was associated with an increase in coupling of cortical oscillations of theta amplitude and gamma phase (theta-gamma coupling)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, believed to be associated with the working memory function of the DLPFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This novel technique holds the promise of revealing the effect of alcohol on neuroplasticity in the DLPFC and allows for the indexing theta-gamma coupling.</p><p id="Par6">The goal of our study was to examine the effect of alcohol intoxication on neuroplasticity in the DLPFC in fifteen healthy subjects using PAS with EEG. Additionally, the effect of alcohol intoxication on PAS potentiation of theta-gamma coupling was examined. By the definition provided by the NIAAA, the acute alcohol consumption in the present study would also meets criteria for a binge drinking episode.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par7">The current study was a within-subject, randomized cross-over study design consisting of a total of two study visits following enrollment into the study.

Previously, it has been demonstrated that a single heavy drinking episode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and even low doses of alcohol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> impair PAS-induced neuroplasticity in the motor cortex. Using DLPFC PAS and EEG, current findings demonstrate that this impairment of neuroplasticity by alcohol intoxication occurs in DLPFC. Interestingly, we found that the impairment in neuroplasticity induced by alcohol was not just localized to the DLPFC. Rather, we also observed a global impairment of neuroplasticity. It is not well understood whether this global impairment of neuroplasticity is a result of neuroplasticity induction within regions outside the DLPFC or a phenomena secondary to modulation of neuroplasticity in the DLPFC. Given that the DLPFC is functionally connected to a number of cortical and subcortical regions, the global effect observed may be due to downstream neuroplasticity mechanisms. Global evoked response potential (ERP) deficits have been reported in binge drinkers compared to non-drinkers during basic and high level cognitive states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Global aberrancies in neuronal responses may highlight neural inefficiencies in heavy drinkers (as subjects in the study reported at least one previous binge drinking episode in the last month) that contribute to a less localized induction of neuroplasticity in this population. Induction of less localized neuroplasticity in this population along with alcohol&#x02019;s widespread action on the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> may explain the global impairment of neuroplasticity seen in the present study.

Studies using rat hippocampal slices have demonstrated that both GABA<sub>A</sub> and NMDA receptors are necessary for the complete reduction of neuroplasticity by alcohol. Pharmacological isolation of NMDA receptors by antagonism of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors via picrotoxin did not produce the complete impairment of neuroplasticity otherwise produced by alcohol in hippocampal slices. Rather, alcohol produced greater impairments of LTP when GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors were functional (as seen in the absence of picrotoxin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

Theta-gamma coupling is believed to be an index of DLPFC functioning, specifically working memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Theta-gamma coupling has been shown to be increased during trials that required ordering information compared to trials that do not require ordering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

Finding of alcohol&#x02019;s impairment of potentiation of theta-gamma coupling suggest that alcohol intoxication impairs neuroplasticity in neuronal networks involved in cognitive functioning. Impaired cognitive function is a commonly reported effect of alcohol intoxication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The BAC level required to impair cognitive function varies with the type of task. Complex cognitive tasks (ie. tasks requiring divided attention) are impaired at BACs as low as 0.01%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

Firstly, it would have been informative to examine the effect of alcohol intoxication on working memory. This would have allowed us to determine if alcohol&#x02019;s impairment of neuroplasticity and theta-gamma coupling is associated with working memory dysfunction. However, given that theta-gamma coupling has been demonstrated to be related to working memory load, we can infer that alcohol is acting on the same neuronal networks involved in working memory to impair potentiation of theta-gamma coupling. Another limitation to the current study is that we used breath samples to calculate BAC levels rather than measuring from blood samples. However, it would have been unnecessarily invasive and disruptive to take blood samples from patients throughout the beverage visits as breath measures correlate highly with BAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Another limitation of the study was the sample size of the present study is relatively small. However, the within-sample design of the study allowed for the use of the current sample size. Lastly, while we attempted to blind the subjects to their beverage type, all subjects correctly guessed which beverage they had received during both beverage visits. However, we have no reason to believe that being aware of which beverage they had received would affect their neurophysiological measurements and neuroplasticity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par31">Findings from the current study revealed that alcohol intoxication impaired neuroplasticity in the DLPFC and throughout the cortex. Additionally, the increase in coupling of the theta-gamma coupling following PAS was not observed following alcohol consumption.

Furthermore, as the DLPFC is a part of the brain reward circuitry, impairment of neuroplasticity in this region may play a role in the transition to AUDs following repetitive heavy drinking.
