Totally, 85 patients were enrolled for this study scheduled to undergo lumbar laminectomy, 19 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria, and 5 patients refused to participate in the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-686-g001"/></fig><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the remaining 61 patients belonging to physical status American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Classes I and II, aged 18&#x02013;65 years with a body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c;30. Patients with known allergy to study drugs, known seizure disorder, severe systemic disease, psychiatric illness, and coagulopathy on regular opioid medications were excluded from the study group. All patients were made familiar with the visual analog pain scale (VAS) during the preanesthetic evaluation, where 0 represented no pain and 10 as the worst imaginable pain. Preoperative VAS scores were obtained from all patients by asking the average intensity of pain during the preanesthetic checkup. Based on computer-generated tables, the patients were randomized into two groups, Group BM (<italic>n</italic> = 30) and Group RM (<italic>n</italic> = 31). The study drugs were prepared by an anesthesia resident not taking part in the study. Both the surgeon as well as the anesthesist participating in the procedure were blinded to the study drugs.</p><p>Group BM received 50 mg of bupivacaine combined with 500 mg of magnesium sulfate (1 ml) made up to 20 ml solution using normal saline (NS).</p><p>Group RM received 50 mg of ropivacaine (10 ml) combined with 500 mg of magnesium sulfate (1 ml) made up to 20 ml solution using NS.</p><p>In both Groups BM and RM, general anesthetic technique was used. In the operating room, standard ASA monitors were attached, and baseline vitals were recorded. All the patients were premedicated with injection fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg intravenous (IV), injection midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV. Induction with IV propofol 2 mg/kg was done. Muscle relaxation achieved with injection rocuronium 0.9&#x02013;1.2 mg/kg IV for tracheal intubation. Patients were adequately positioned and ventilated using volume-controlled mode with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg. Intraoperative anesthesia and muscle relaxation were maintained with isoflurane 0.4%&#x02013;0.8% and divided doses of injection rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg IV dose. Intraoperative analgesia was maintained with continuous infusion of fentanyl at a dosage of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. Patients were adequately monitored intraoperatively. Fentanyl infusion was stopped 15 min before the expected time for completion of the procedure. Thirty minutes before skin closure local infiltration with the study drug was done by the surgeon into the paravertebral muscles 10 ml volume on either side. A standard 8&#x02013;10 cm incision was used for lumbar laminectomy with three point infiltration on each side was done using a 3-5 cm long 22 gauge needle. After completion, patient was made supine, and neuromuscular blockade was reversed adequately. All the patients were extubated when awake and following commands. Patients who remaining sedated up to 1 h postextubation were excluded from our study group. After the operation, patients were observed in the postanesthetic care unit where VAS pain scores were assessed hourly up to a VAS score of &#x0003e;5[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or up to the first 24 h postoperatively by a third anesthesia resident blinded to the study group. Duration of analgesia was deemed as the time from the completion of surgery till a vas score of &#x0003e;5 was noted or up to the time when the first demand for analgesic was made.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] If VAS score of &#x0003e;5 was noted rescue analgesic in the form of injection nalbuphine 5 mg IV was administered over 15 min and repeated after 3 h if required.

Pain following spine surgery is mediated through the activation of nociceptors and mechanoreceptors located in the vertebrae, intervertebral disc, dura, nerve roots, facet joint capsules, muscles, ligaments, and fascial sheaths.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] These structures are mainly innervated by the posterior rami of the spinal nerve roots linked to the autonomic nervous system. Inflammation or mechanical compression of these structures generates nociceptive impulses.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The activation of these nociceptors leads to sensitization of adjacent neurons. Significant alterations occur with time as nociceptive impulses from both the peripheral as well as the central nervous systems amalgamate causing central pain sensitization, leading to exaggerated, and prolonged postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Inadequate postoperative pain control after lumbar laminectomy hampers early ambulation increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis and contributes to the development of chronic pain.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Various modalities of postoperative pain control therapy such as intravenous, intramuscular, surgical site infiltration and epidural analgesia are now being extensively used and studied.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Postlumbar surgery recovery and rehabilitation depends on the extent of pain relief with recent literature advocating the use of multimodal approach of postoperative pain control.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The use of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for multimodal pain control carries risk of potential complications such as respiratory depression, renal injury, upper gastrointestinal bleeding.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The use of spinal and epidural technique for postoperative analgesia is often associated with delayed neurological recovery.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Local anesthetic drug infiltration used in our study was based on available literature describing its action on the pain-mediating free nerve endings and deeper tissues for the analgesic effect.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The use of bupivacaine, levobupivacaine and ropivacaine for surgical site infiltration is documented,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] so we selected bupivacaine and ropivacaine for our study. 0.25% concentration of both local anesthetic was used to obtain adequate sensory blockade without any motor block and to prevent systemic toxicity by the absorption of large volumes of local anesthetic from the highly vascular vertebral and paravertebral tissues.</p><p>Magnessium sulphate, a known physiological antagonist of NMDA receptor in its inactive state.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] NMDA receptors are not only present in the central nervous system but also in the peripheral tissues such as the skin and the muscles.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] It has got no analgesic property of its own, but its NMDA receptor antagonistic property abolishes the central mechanism of pain transmission, modulation, sensitization and even modulates pain transmission from the peripheral tissues.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This unique property of magnesium sulfate promoted its use in our study patients in combination with local anesthetic. The dose of magnesium sulfate was selected as per Donadi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Bupivacaine and magnesium sulfate infiltration used in our study patients had significantly reduced the postoperative nalbuphine consumption compared to the use of ropivacaine and magnesium sulfate. Reduction in the amount of rescue analgesic consumption is a better predictor of analgesic efficacy compared to the total duration of analgesia.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Donadi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] had observed a similar mean analgesic duration of 7.8 h with reduction in postoperative tramadol consumtion using bupivacaine and magnesium sulfate in the same dosage for postoperative wound infiltration. The higher duration of analgesia observed for bupivacaine compared to ropivacaine may be attributed to its greater lipid solubility leading to greater tissue penetration.</p><p>Postoperative urinary retention was the most common complication observed in our study patients. Donadi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] had also observed urinary retention as the most common complication without any other major systemic complications. Limitations of our study include the use of equal concentration and not equianalgesic concentration of both local anesthetics which was done to prevent usage of higher doses of ropivacaine tissue infiltration within the highly vascular vertebral and paravertebral tissues preventing systemic toxicity. We would like to test the validity of our study results by large population-based trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The use of bupivacaine
