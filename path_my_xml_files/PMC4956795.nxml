Repeated use of new-type drugs will lead to adaptation in 5-HT and dopamine function. Consequently, neurotransmitters such as dopamine and 5-HT will be depleted or much less than needed. Despite knowing this mechanism, however, no medications have been proven to be effective for the treatment of new-type drug dependence.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>Tryptophan is the precursor of 5-HT, and a high level of tryptophan could increase 5-HT synthesis,<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> which may modulate mood and sleeping disorders.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Findings from a literature review suggested that tryptophan could improve mood in vulnerable subjects, and improves sleep in adults with sleep disturbances, by increasing brain 5-HT.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Moreover, it may also be efficacious for syndromes associated with nicotine and heroin withdrawal.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup></p><p>We speculated that the increased 5-HT level with the supplement of tryptophan would attenuate mood and sleeping disorders.

The center provides compulsory addiction treatment to patients with drug dependency, where they usually have to stay for 2 years after being held with a positive urinary sample. Investigators provided study information to patients, and invited them to participate in the study. The participation in this study was voluntary, and patients were allowed to stop participation at any time during the study period. Study participants were recruited according to the following inclusion criteria: new-type drug dependence verified by the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV-TR; being treated in the detoxification center for about a week; aged 18 or above; suffering from mental or sleeping disorders verified by Symptom Check-List-90 (SCL-90) and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS); and willing and able to comply with the study, and with written informed consent. Patients were excluded according to the following exclusion criteria: substance dependence other than new-type drugs; a current neurological disease (e.g., organic brain disease) or schizophrenia assessed by Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV-TR; the score of AIS&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;4<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>; pregnant women; a history of dysfunction of liver, heart, or kidney; serious endocrine and circulatory disorders; currently taking other psychiatric medications; unable to comply with the study procedure; without giving informed consent; and other circumstances that would affect participant's safety.</p><p>The study was approved by the institutional review board at the School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. All study participants signed the written informed consent. The study was prospectively registered online and the Clinical trial registration number was ChiCTR-TRC-12002492.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Eighty eligible participants were randomly assigned to a tryptophan (1000&#x0200a;mg/d, n = 40) group or a placebo (glucose 1000&#x0200a;mg/d, n = 40) group. The intervention (and its dose) was based on findings from previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> A simple randomization schedule was used, and allocation was performed according to a list of computer-generated random numbers by an independent researcher. The medication was provided by Tianjin Tian&#x02019;an Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Tianjin, P. R. China. The tryptophan and placebo bottles were numbered 3 and 5, respectively, and dispensed by nurses in the detoxification center. Both study participants and nurses were blinded to the treatment provided. Participants took medication orally twice a day for 14 days in total, under a nurse's direct supervision.</p><p>The sample size calculation was based on the score of AIS. Previous research indicated a standard deviation of 2.2, and a mean change of AIS scores of 3.9 in the treatment group and 1.7 in the control group, respectively. With a 5% 2-sided alpha and 80% power, a minimum of 74 were required. Considering the possible follow-up loss, 80 subjects were enrolled.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Measures</title><p>The demographic characteristics and new-type drug use variables at baseline were measured using self-devised questionnaire. Sleeping status and mental symptoms of participants were assessed using AIS<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> and SCL-90,<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> respectively.</p><p>The AIS is a self-reported instrument consisting of 8 items. The first 4 items are sleep quantitative variables (i.e., sleep induction, night awakenings, early morning awakening, and total sleep time), the fifth item concerns sleep quality, and the remaining ones relate to the next-day performance of insomnia. Each item can be rated from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very serious), so that the total score ranges from 0 to 24. Patients with insomnia usually have an AIS score at least 4. The Cronbach alpha of the scale was 0.81 in Chinese.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Despite AIS was initially used to evaluate subjects&#x02019; sleep status within the last month, we used it to assess weekly sleep status, according to a previous study of patients with heroin dependence.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup></p><p>The SCL-90 scale consists of 90 items and the following 9 dimensions: somatization, obsessive-compulsive disorder, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. It is a self-administrated scale based on a 5-point rating method, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The Cronbach alpha of the scale was above 0.65, with good reliability and validity for substance abusers.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup></p><p>The mental symptoms and sleeping status were assessed at baseline, 1 week and 2 weeks after randomization. The adherence was measured daily by asking participants if they wanted to continue, and they could drop out of the trial whenever they wanted. Adverse events were assessed daily by asking participants open-ended questions such as &#x0201c;Have you had any problems or side effects (such as nausea, headache or any other problem)&#x0201d;? Nurses recorded both adherence and adverse events. For serious adverse events, nurses could inform a physician for treatment if necessary. Physicians were not blinded with the treatment allocation in order to cope with possible emergencies.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows (version 12.0). Continuously distributed variables were analyzed using mean (standard deviation or standard error), and categorical variables using frequencies and percentages. Baseline characteristics between groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous data, and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact test for categorical data. Results were analyzed according to intent-to-treat principle. Differences in changes of AIS and SCL-90 scores from baseline to week 2 between groups were assessed using <italic>t</italic> test. When outcome data at week 2 were not available due to loss to follow-up, data at week 1 or baseline were used in the analysis. The adherence and adverse events were analyzed using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test.

In our study, the AIS score was reduced by 5.5 in the tryptophan group, and it was only 1.6 in the placebo group, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant. Therefore, tryptophan may mitigate sleeping disorders of detoxified individuals with new-type drug dependence. This finding was similar to previous studies in heroin addicts<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> and adults with sleep disturbances.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> It has great significance for patients with new-type drug dependence, as sleeping disorders are usual withdrawal symptoms for individuals with new-type drug dependence.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup></p><p>Findings from this study indicated that treatment with tryptophan for 2 weeks had no effect on mental symptoms of detoxified individuals with new-type drug dependence, in terms of all dimensions of the SCL-90 scale, which was similar to previous studies of medications for methamphetamine dependence.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, it revealed that mental symptoms may not change simultaneously with changes in sleep disorders. It is possible that mental symptoms and sleep disorders involve different neurobiological mechanisms or additional pathways.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup></p><p>Tryptophan appeared to be safe and well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events reported. However, the adherence in the tryptophan and placebo group was similarly low, which was consistent with other clinical trials of methamphetamine users.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> Adherence was usually an issue in follow-up studies, and our study was no exception, even though participants of the study were from a compulsory detoxification center. Low adherence may be associated with suspicious attitudes, which was a typical psychiatric symptom among individuals with new-type drug dependence.<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup></p><p>In terms of the participant characteristics at baseline, most new-type drug users were male and relatively young, which was similar to the 2010 drug users reported by the State Food and Drug Administration and a Chinese study.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Magu was the most frequently used new-type drug, as an emerging drug in China, and its ingredients include methamphetamine and caffeine. This was different from other studies of methamphetamine,<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> which may be due to different geographic areas or reflect a real change over time.</p><p>The current study had some limitations. Firstly, patients in the current study were treated for only 2 weeks. A previous study showed that amphetamine users experienced a long period of insomnia after ceasing amphetamine use for 3 days.<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup> Another study revealed that the sleep time of amphetamine users was shorter than controls after using drugs.<sup>[<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup> Moreover, the treatment adherence in medication trials was usually low. Considering all the above reasons, we treated patients in the current study for 2 weeks. Secondly, other confounding factors, which could affect sleep in such subjects may still not be included in our study, though a multiple variable regression analysis found that the observed treatment effect of tryptophan on sleep disorders was not due to imbalanced distribution of baseline characteristics between the groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). Thirdly, our study just focuses on the effect of tryptophan on the sleeping disorder and mental symptom in patients with new-type drug dependence, not the treatment of addiction to these substances, which needs to be confirmed in further studies. Finally, the current study was very small, with a total of 80 participants. Thus, a larger, multisite, and longer-term trial needs to be conducted to confirm the present results.</p><p>In summary, the current study indicated that tryptophan was unlikely effective in reducing mental symptoms, but might be effective for alleviating sleep disorders in individuals with new-type drug dependence in short term, although this needs to be confirmed in a future definitive trial. This might provide a new insight to the treatment of sleeping disorders of patients with new-type drug dependence. Further well-designed large-scale randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the results.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the support of Yuanxuan College Foundation in HongKong, and also thank all the study participants and the staff and management in Wuhan City Compulsory Residential Drug Abstinence Institution for assistance in this study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: 5-HT = serotonin, AIS = Athens Insomnia Scale, SCL-90 = Symptom Checklist-90.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>DW participated in study design and the conduct of the study, collected the data, performed the statistical analysis and interpretation of data, and wrote the first draft of the manuscript.
