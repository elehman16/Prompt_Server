the active and passive ankle range of motion in patients with ankle stiffness. [Subjects]
The study included 10 young female patients with ankle stiffness. [Methods] The patients
were divided into the following two groups: a group that performed ankle dorsiflexion
stretching exercises using a wooden inclined board and a group that performed stretching
exercises using an air-cushioned inclined board (unstable inclined board). Active and
passive ankle dorsiflexion angles were measured bilaterally using a goniometer. [Results]
Both inclined boards significantly increased active and passive ankle dorsiflexion. After
performing ankle stretching exercises, active dorsiflexion significantly increased the
unstable inclined board compared to that using the wooden inclined board. However, the
passive dorsiflexion angles did not differ significantly between the two groups after
ankle stretching exercises. [Conclusion] The use of an unstable inclined board might
stimulate activation of the ankle dorsiflexors in addition to stretching muscle or tissue.
Active ankle dorsiflexion was more effectively improved with stretching exercises using an
unstable inclined board than with exercises using a wooden inclined board.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Inclined board</kwd><kwd>Stretching exercise</kwd><kwd>Unstable surface</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Musculoskeletal stiffness and limited range of motion (ROM) can restrict functional joint
movement, particularly during ankle supination following neurological diseases<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ankle dorsiflexion ROM restrictions impair
dynamic balance and gait, which may contribute to secondary injuries; reduced ankle ROM and
tight calf muscles can cause poor gait, inefficient energy use, impaired balance, and an
increased risk of falls<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Musculoskeletal
transformations manifesting as abnormal joint stiffness and limited ROM result in numerous
restrictions in the function and joint movements of patients<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Limited passive ankle dorsiflexion ROM during knee extension can
alter foot positioning and result in compensatory foot movements, leading to an abnormal
gait, which can result in ankle sprains and lower extremity overuse injuries<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies have reported that balance-training
programs that alter the somatosensory input, such as the use of an unstable surface to
induce equalized weight distribution, can be helpful in hemiplegic patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim et al. used an ankle board with a slope
in their center to achieve efficient ankle stretching and increased dorsiflexion<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. They suggested that stretching exercises
using their device resulted in a greater increase in foot pressure compared to that with
stretching exercises using existing inclined boards during ankle dorsiflexion
stretching<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we investigated
the effects of an unstable inclined board on the active and passive ankle ROM in patients
with ankle stiffness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study included 10 female patients (mean age, 22.8 &#x000b1; 5.3&#x02005;years; height, 158.9 &#x000b1; 3.0&#x02005;cm;
weight, 61.2 &#x000b1; 4.7&#x02005;kg) with ankle stiffness caused by diseases or medical conditions. The
patients were selected based on ankle stiffness scores obtained using a symptom checker
tool. The patients were assigned randomly to two groups (both n = 5) and their height and
weight were measured. The patients were not cognitively impaired and were capable of
independent walking for 20&#x02005;m without difficulty. Patients were excluded if they had a
history of or current neurological conditions. Before participating, the purpose and methods
of the study were explained to the patients, and all provided informed consent, according to
the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Active and passive ankle dorsiflexion were measured using a standard 31.75 &#x000d7; 4.45&#x02005;cm clear
plastic goniometer, with one increment, a 360&#x000b0; scale, and a bubble level at each end. Group
1 performed the ankle dorsiflexion stretching exercise using a wooden inclined board, and
group 2 performed ankle dorsiflexion stretching exercises using an air-cushioned inclined
board that provided an unstable surface. Both inclined boards were set to an approximately
15&#x000b0; tilt. Rubber sheets were attached to the inclined boards to prevent falls due to
sliding. The patients performed ankle dorsiflexion stretching exercises for 5&#x02005;min, with a
10-min rest between each set, five times a day for 1 week. The active and passive ankle
dorsiflexion angles were measured bilaterally using the goniometer before and after the
study.</p><p>Independent and paired t-tests were used to assess within- and between-group differences in
ankle dorsiflexion, with SPSS for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). A p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The amount of active and passive dorsiflexion did not differ between the two groups before
the exercises, with active dorsiflexion angles of 18.2 &#x000b1; 6.4&#x000b0; and 19.3 &#x000b1; 4.2&#x000b0; and passive
dorsiflexion angles of 23.4 &#x000b1; 5.5&#x000b0; and 22.6 &#x000b1; 5.7&#x000b0; in groups 1 and 2, respectively (both p
&#x0003e; 0.05). The stretching exercises significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05) increased the active and
passive ankle dorsiflexion angles in both groups compared to those at baseline. The active
dorsiflexion angle was significantly increased (p &#x0003c; 0.05) in group 2 compared to that in
group 1 after the exercises. The active dorsiflexion angles before and after the exercises
were 18.2 &#x000b1; 6.4&#x000b0; and 22.1 &#x000b1; 5.0&#x000b0; in group 1 and 19.3 &#x000b1; 4.2&#x000b0; and 28.1 &#x000b1; 6.9&#x000b0; in group 2,
respectively. The passive dorsiflexion angles did not differ significantly between the
groups after the exercises (p&#x0003e;0.05) and were 23.4 &#x000b1; 5.5&#x000b0; and 32.2 &#x000b1; 5.3&#x000b0; in group 1 and
22.6 &#x000b1; 5.7&#x000b0; and 35.1 &#x000b1; 6.0&#x000b0; in group 2 before and after exercising, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study developed a new inclined board for ankle dorsiflexion stretching. The
air-cushioned inclined board provided an unstable surface for performing ankle dorsiflexion
stretching exercises. The results showed that ankle stretching exercises using the unstable
inclined board significantly increased the active dorsiflexion angle compared to that with
exercises using a wooden inclined board. We believe that the use of the air-cushioned
inclined board provides somatosensory input and subsequently stimulates active ankle
dorsiflexion by promoting automatic postural control. Sensory proprioception of the ankle
and sensory compression of the plantar are important in the control of sway<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. An increase in the number of somatosensory
inputs affects the muscles, and the use of an unstable support surface result in many
different somatosensory inputs that limit compensatory action<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Performing cognitive tasks in a standing posture reduces internal
focus and induces external focus, which promotes automatic postural control<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stretching improve the flexibility of
tendons, and changes in the mechanical condition of tendons depend on the type of stretching
performed<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stretching exercises can
reduce spasticity by increasing tissue flexibility<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the passive dorsiflexion angles did not differ significantly between the two
groups after ankle stretching exercises. However, stretching exercises significantly
increased the active and passive ankle dorsiflexion angles in both groups compared to those
at baseline. These results suggest that passive ankle exercises using a wooden inclined
board only stretch muscle and tissue, while exercises using an unstable inclined board
stretch muscle and tissue, and stimulate activation of the ankle dorsiflexor. Active ankle
dorsiflexion was more effectively improved with ankle stretching exercises using an unstable
inclined board than with exercises using a wooden inclined board.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hoch</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Staton</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>Medina McKeon</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Dorsiflexion and dynamic postural control deficits are
