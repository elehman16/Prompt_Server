Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and its receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have the potential to counteract many metabolic defects of the type 2 diabetes phenotype. Indeed, GLP-1RAs, such as exenatide, have been shown to lower blood glucose by slowing gastric emptying, stimulating meal-related insulin secretion, and reducing glucagon secretion, thus improving pancreatic islet-cell function. Also, GLP-1RAs have been demonstrated to induce satiety, reduce food intake, and decrease body weight, the latter resulting in improved insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>A previous study showed that 3-year exposure to the twice-daily formulation of the GLP-1RA exenatide resulted in sustained improvements in A1C and body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Likewise, long-term (52 weeks) treatment with the once-weekly formulation of exenatide (EQW) led to sustained improvements in glycemic control, in the presence of body weight reduction and low hypoglycemia event rates in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we showed that 26 weeks of EQW compared with insulin glargine (IG) in patients with type 2 diabetes who failed on oral blood glucose&#x02013;lowering agents led to significant improvements in A1C compared with IG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Therefore, the objective of the current extension study was to assess, in a controlled setting, the long-term safety and efficacy of EQW versus IG by keeping patients in their originally assigned randomization arms for up to 84 weeks of therapy. This is the longest controlled clinical trial of EQW yet reported.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This was a preplanned interim analysis (at 84 weeks) of an open-ended, controlled extension (expected to last at least 2.5 years) of a previously reported 26-week, phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-arm, parallel, comparator-controlled trial in patients with type 2 diabetes failing to maintain sufficient glycemic control using metformin alone or in combination with sulfonylurea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>A detailed description of the research design and methods was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Patients were randomly assigned to add EQW (2 mg) or once-daily IG (10 IU/day, using the Initiate Insulin by Aggressive Titration and Education [INITIATE] dosing algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]) to their existing blood glucose&#x02013;lowering regimens. Up to 48 weeks, investigators were required to keep patients on the metformin dose at which they entered the study. Investigators could decrease or stop sulfonylurea therapy if hypoglycemia was a concern and could subsequently return patients to a sulfonylurea dose as high as the dose used at baseline. After 48 weeks of treatment, investigators were allowed to increase the dose of the patients&#x02019; current oral blood glucose&#x02013;lowering medication or add other blood glucose&#x02013;lowering medications to their treatment regimen, if needed. However, it is important to note that, for a clear interpretation of the long-term effect of the study treatments, data collected after any treatment regimen changes at 48 weeks or after (other than IG titration) were excluded from the analyses.</p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the ethics principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The protocol was approved by an ethics review board at every study site, and all participants gave written informed consent.</p><p>The key efficacy measure was change in A1C from baseline to study treatment end point. End point was defined as the last nonmissing postbaseline measurement prior to any change to treatment regimen after week 48. Secondary measures included the following: time to failure to maintain glycemic control (defined as the time from randomization to the first visit after week 18 when A1C was &#x02265;7.0%); proportions of patients achieving A1C &#x0003c;7.0 and &#x02264;6.5%; change in body weight; fasting serum glucose; self-monitored blood glucose; and fasting serum lipids. Exploratory measures included urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, homeostasis model assessment of &#x003b2;-cell function (using fasting blood glucose and fasting C-peptide concentrations), and waist and hip circumference. We also evaluated A1C by anti-exenatide antibody titer, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Antibody status was classified in two ways, either two-level status (positive or negative) or three-level status (positive-low [antibody titers &#x0003c;1/625], positive-high [antibody titers &#x02265;1/625], or negative).</p><p>Safety measures included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, and hypoglycemia. An episode of hypoglycemia was categorized as major if the patient had a documented blood glucose &#x0003c;3.0 mmol/L, necessitating the assistance of another person because of severe impairment in consciousness or behavior, or if the episode resulted in loss of consciousness or seizure that was promptly reversed upon administration of glucose.</p><sec id="s3"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.1). Analysis for the key efficacy measure was performed for the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set, which was defined as the group of patients who were randomly assigned to treatment and exposed to one or more doses of the study drug. The study was powered to detect A1C difference as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). We used a maximum likelihood&#x02013;based, mixed-model, repeated-measures ANCOVA, with treatment, baseline A1C, country, oral blood glucose&#x02013;lowering treatment stratum (use of sulfonylurea or metformin only), week of visit, and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects and patient and error as random effects.</p><p>Secondary analyses for the key efficacy measure were performed on the ITT analysis set. The proportions of patients achieving A1C &#x0003c;7.0% (for patients with baseline A1C &#x02265;7.0%) and &#x02264;6.5% (for patients with baseline A1C &#x0003e;6.5%) at 84 weeks were summarized using frequencies and percentages by treatment group. Treatment group difference was assessed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, adjusting for country and background oral blood glucose&#x02013;lowering medication. In addition, change in A1C from baseline to the last-observation-carried-forward end point by 84-week anti-exenatide antibody status (two-level and three-level) was performed using ANCOVA. Time to failure to maintain glycemic control was defined as the time from randomization to the first visit after week 18 where A1C was &#x02265;7.0%. The log-rank test was used to compare the time-to-failure distributions of the two treatment groups.</p><p>Analyses for other secondary measures used a mixed-model repeated-measures procedure similar to that used for the primary efficacy measure and were conducted on the ITT analysis set. All treatment difference tests were conducted at a two-sided significance level of 0.05, unless specified otherwise. Categorical variables, other than the A1C target analyses, were compared using the Fisher exact test.</p><p>Hypoglycemia events were summarized by treatment, oral blood glucose&#x02013;lowering therapy, and classification (major, minor, symptomatic, or nocturnal).</p><p>Post hoc (and postrandomization) assessments were conducted to establish whether treatment effects on A1C and weight were consistent among subgroups on the basis of study completion status (ITT population or 84-week completers) and oral blood glucose&#x02013;lowering medication use (metformin alone). All data are presented as least squares means &#x000b1; SE, unless otherwise noted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s5"><title>Patient disposition and baseline characteristics</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows patient flow through the study and reasons for discontinuation.

The patients with edematous pancreatitis and esophageal carcinoma discontinued the study. The case of edematous pancreatitis occurred in the first 26 weeks and was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Two other patients, one from each treatment group, discontinued from the study because of serious AEs considered unrelated to the study drug (EQW: cerebrovascular accident; IG: Cushing&#x02019;s syndrome). Most patients in the EQW group who reported treatment-emergent AEs that typically are associated with GLP-1RAs (nausea and diarrhea) did so in the first 26 weeks of the study (nausea incidence 12.9%, diarrhea incidence 8.6% over 26 weeks). An additional 2.1% of patients reported nausea, and an additional 3.4% of patients reported diarrhea after 26 weeks of treatment. The proportion of patients reporting one or more AEs did not differ between the group of patients testing negative for anti-exenatide antibodies (73 of 98 [74.5%]) and the group testing positive for antibodies (88 of 128 [68.8%]).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of AEs</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="683tbl1"/></table-wrap><p>The overall incidence of hypoglycemia was assessed separately for the two subgroups of patients on metformin alone or metformin plus sulfonylurea (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).

Treatment with EQW reduced A1C and postprandial glucose to a statistically greater extent than IG titrated to target. In addition, a greater proportion of patients taking EQW achieved an A1C &#x02264;6.5% compared with those taking IG, and there was a similar treatment-associated trend for the proportion of patients who achieved an A1C &#x0003c;7%. The time to failure to maintain glycemic control was longer for patients taking EQW than for patients taking IG, even though a higher number of patients taking EQW (17 EQW vs. 10 IG patients) eventually required a change to their treatment to maintain good metabolic control (i.e., the need to intensify treatment occurred later for patients taking EQW). Among patients taking EQW, A1C was reduced to a similar degree in those testing negative for anti-exenatide antibodies compared with those who had positive low titers. Furthermore, the incidence of high positive antibody titers was low (~10%), but the mean A1C reduction was smaller in this group. In addition, EQW treatment was associated with significant weight reduction (as opposed to weight gain with IG) from baseline through 84 weeks and fewer hypoglycemic episodes than IG treatment.</p><p>These results should be interpreted cautiously, given the study limitations that have been previously described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Although well controlled, study limitations include the open-label nature of the design and the fact that the study population was predominately Caucasian. It should be noted that ~30% of patients in both groups required a reduction from baseline in their sulfonylurea dose. Although a reduction in sulfonylurea dose may reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, such a change in sulfonylurea dose may be associated with a negative impact on glucose control. In addition, the possibility for bias introduced through patient self-selection for continuation into the extension study exists. However, the results for A1C and weight changes in the ITT population were similar to those observed in the 84-week completer cohort, arguing against confounding of interpretation of study results as a result of self-selection bias.</p><p>Notable strengths of the study are the use of optimized IG as the comparator throughout the 84-week treatment period (basal insulin is the standard next step in treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes not responding to oral blood glucose&#x02013;lowering medications) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), the use of the insulin titration schedule from the INITIATE trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and the continuation of patients in their originally assigned randomization arm, eliminating the possibility of any carryover effects from changing therapies. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), during the first 26 weeks of IG treatment, patients were instructed to titrate their insulin dosage to achieve a target fasting glucose of 4.0&#x02013;5.5 mmol/L, as outlined by Yki-J&#x000e4;rvinen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). This same titration schedule was used between 26 and 84 weeks, with an overall increase in the mean daily insulin dose from 31 IU at week 26 to 35 IU at this interim analysis. The A1C improvement observed in the IG group in our study was comparable with that observed in other trials of IG, despite a lower final insulin dose in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Although mean end point A1C values remained significantly lower than baseline for both treatment groups, an upward drift in A1C was observed beginning at ~26 weeks of treatment, consistent with the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The investigators were instructed to follow the same dosing/titration algorithm after 26 weeks as they did in the first 26 weeks, but such titration apparently was insufficient to prevent the slight rise in A1C to 7.3%, despite the mean daily IG dose increase of 4 IU. We analyzed individual patient response to EQW or IG treatment between 26 and 84 weeks by A1C increase versus A1C decrease and found no differences between groups in baseline characteristics that could explain why some patients lost glycemic control over time and other patients had continued improvements in glycemic control over time. An analysis of the rate of change in A1C between 26 and 84 weeks revealed a similar (<italic>P</italic> = 0.7786) rate of increase in each group (~0.0065% per week, which was significantly greater than zero [<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001]), suggesting a continuation of disease progression irrespective of study treatment.</p><p>Although body weight progressively increased over time in the IG treatment group, the mean body weight in the EQW treatment group decreased up to 48 weeks of therapy, and an overall weight loss of ~2 kg was sustained up to 84 weeks. However, it was noted in the EQW group that body weight trended upward between 48 and 84 weeks. The reason for this upward trend is not known. One possibility may be that patients did not adhere as closely to their instructed lifestyle modifications after 26 weeks, feeling that the core study period was over. However, this explanation remains speculative.</p><p>Both therapies seemed to be well tolerated over the 84 weeks of treatment. The small but statistically significant increase in heart rate with EQW treatment is of uncertain clinical importance. No adverse outcomes related to increased heart rate were observed in this study at the time of this interim analysis. In general, after 26 weeks, new cases of AEs slowed compared with the period of time between baseline and 26 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). This is noteworthy with regard to nausea and vomiting, a typical AE of exenatide therapy. Our observation is consistent with several clinical trials of exenatide twice daily, which showed decreased gastrointestinal distress over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). There were some AEs that emerged only after 26 weeks of therapy. Among the most prevalent were injection site nodule at 6% of the EQW group and bronchitis, cough, and toothache at ~5% of the IG group.</p><p>The data from this 84-week interim analysis demonstrated that treatment with EQW provided significantly better glycemic control than IG and was associated with significant weight loss through 84 weeks of treatment. These results, coupled with the significantly lower incidence of hypoglycemia observed with EQW compared with IG therapy, suggest that EQW can be a therapeutic option for patients with type 2 diabetes for whom the convenience of once-a-week dosing, weight loss, and reduction of risk for hypoglycemia are important.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
