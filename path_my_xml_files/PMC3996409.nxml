prolonged immobility were examined. Range of motion exercises using humerus anatomical
neck-shaft rotation were performed, and the immediate effect and adaptation were
investigated. [Subjects and Methods] A total of ten individuals with a mean age of 79.4 &#x000b1;
11.0&#x02005;years were included in this study. The controlled intervention involved conventional
range of motion exercises, and the experimental intervention involved humerus anatomical
neck-shaft rotation. Each exercise was performed 30 times. Shoulder joint flexion and
abduction and external rotation of the GHJ range of motion were measured with the scapula
fixed. Each change in range of motion was compared using ANOVA; less than 5% was
considered significant. [Results] After the experimental intervention, significant
increases were seen in shoulder joint flexion, abduction, and external rotation ranges of
motion. [Conclusion] Therefore, this method was effective as a means of improving the
range of motion of the GHJ.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Shoulder joint</kwd><kwd>Contracture</kwd><kwd>Humerus anatomical neck-shaft rotation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Contracture is the state in which joint motion is constrained as a result of prolonged
immobility or the fixation of joints at rest. The skin, connective tissue, skeletal muscles,
and nerves<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> are intertwined and complexly involved in range of motion (ROM)
restrictions, and physical assessment of these elements is not an easy task. Contracture
with ROM restrictions adversely affects posture and movement in daily life<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example, being forced into prolonged
immobility is a factor that restricts quality of life. Many reports have claimed that if the
ROM restrictive factors mainly originate from muscle spasms, then suppressing the muscle
spasms through massage and stretching can immediately improve ROM<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, if the ROM restrictive factor is mainly tissue
degeneration and shortening of collagen fibers in the joint capsules or ligaments,
improvement is reportedly difficult<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Even if conservative therapy is performed
for 3&#x02013;4 months for the contractured shoulder after shoulder periarthritis, if no remission
of symptoms is seen, aggressive surgical treatment is encouraged<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, if no surgical treatment is performed for shoulder
joint contracture in the elderly caused by prolonged immobility, ROM exercises are the first
choice.</p><p>ROM restrictions of the shoulder joint in elderly people forced into prolonged immobility
are essentially the result of problems with the glenohumeral joint (GHJ) in most cases,
which are currently dealt with using ROM exercises and stretching. A colleague and I
previously performed joint capsule and ligament stretching using humerus anatomical
neck-shaft rotation for frozen shoulders, and reported on the usefulness. The humerus
anatomical neck-shaft is a perpendicular shaft on the surface of the anatomical neck of the
humerus, and the rotation of this shaft is called humerus anatomical neck-shaft
rotation<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The humerus moves in a
cone-shape with a 90-degree apex angle that vertically touches the scapula and
acetabulum<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this rotation, the
acetabular surface and anatomical neck surface always run parallel to each other. In other
words, since the surfaces run parallel to the coracoacromial arch of the greater tubercle
without passing under the arch, stretching of the joint capsules and ligament tissue around
the shoulder joint is possible without causing pain in the suprahumeral joint. Clinically
applying these exercises for shoulder joint contracture in elderly people who are forced
into prolonged immobility and presenting the results may be significant.</p><p>The objective of this study was to perform conventional ROM exercises and humerus
anatomical neck-shaft rotation for shoulder joint contracture in a total ten elderly people
who were forced into prolonged immobility, and to examine the immediate changes and
adaptation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A Total of ten elderly females patients forced into prolonged immobility at our institution
were included in this study. The mean &#x000b1; standard deviation values of the age and weight of
the subjects were 79.4 &#x000b1; 11.0&#x02005;years, and 40.4 &#x000b1; 6.5&#x02005;kg respectively. The underlying disease
causing prolonged immobility was disuse syndrome as a result of the progression of
cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer&#x02019;s. This represented 0 points on the Barthel Index.</p><p>Shoulder joint contracture was defined as meeting the following two conditions: 1) feeling
soft tissue restrictions in the end feel after transitively moving the shoulder joint in all
directions and 2) feeling shortening of the joint capsules and ligaments after maintaining
abduction of the shoulder joint at a 45&#x000b0; angle and then transitively moving the bone head in
all directions. In principle, the examined shoulder joints were on the non-paralyzed side.
Four cases including cases where transitive 45&#x000b0; flexion and abduction movement was not
possible, cases of bone fractures or other past histories, and cases that also involved
degenerative diseases such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease were excluded.</p><p>Humerus anatomical neck-shaft rotation exercises were always performed with the anatomical
neck surface and acetabular surface parallel to each other<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since the anatomical neck of the humerus faces 135 degrees and 30
degrees, movement on these surfaces, represented by movement of the humerus, forms a conical
90&#x000b0; apex angle at a right angle to the acetabular surface, and since forearm abduction is
always 30&#x000b0; in regard to this circular tangent, the position of the shoulder joint was
defined as 45&#x000b0; above the scapular surface of the GHJ, with an external rotation of 30&#x000b0;<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Humerus anatomical neck-shaft rotation,
which was the experimental intervention, was performed 30 times until final ROM. Typical
transitive shoulder joint ROM exercises including flexion, abduction, adduction, internal
rotation, and external rotation, which were the control intervention, were performed 30
times until final ROM. There was one day was placed between the experimental intervention
and control intervention. In addition, sufficient consideration was given to the development
of pain during both the experimental intervention and control intervention. For the
evaluation, external rotation, flexion, abduction, and the initial position depending on the
scapula were fixed. Measurements were done in the supine position. Shoulder joint ROM with
the scapula fixed was defined as the GHJ angle. Measurement was performed by two
individuals. Measurement of the movement angle and basic angle was performed 3 times in 5&#x000b0;
increments using a goniometer in accordance with the Japanese Association of Rehabilitation
Medicine guidelines, and the mean value of the 3 was used. The control intervention and
experimental intervention were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with one repeated
measures factor &#x003b1; = 0.05 as the using a level of significance.</p><p>In addition, the purpose of this study was explained in writing to the families, and their
consent was obtained. The investigation conformed to principles outlined in the Declaration
of Helsinki and was approved by Human Research Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> The Occurrence of CNS Tumors by Study Group for F344/DuCrlCrlj Rats

factors and intra-articular factors. Tension of the muscles surrounding the shoulder joint
is the main extra-articular factor, and is thought to heal in response to conservative
therapy centered on exercise therapy. While contracture of the joint capsules is the main
intra-articular factor, many reversible cases of this pathology centered on ROM exercise
conservative therapy have been reported<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous studies on conservative therapy
for shoulder joint contracture, a reduction in pain and an increase in flexion and abduction
could be seen; however, significant increases in medial rotation and external rotation were
often reported to be difficult to achieve<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The factors that affect the degree of improvement such as age,
shoulder joint flexion at time of diagnosis, and reduced lateral rotation, are considered
poor result factors in conservative therapy<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the present study show that
significant increases were seen not only in flexion and abduction, but also in external
rotation (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Since the patients&#x02019; age
group, ROM values at the time of diagnosis, number of conservative therapies undergone, and
pathologies leading to contracture differed between this study and previous studies, the
results cannot be easily compared. However, a significant increase was seen in ROM when the
experimental intervention and control intervention were compared; if the ROM for performing
humerus anatomical neck-shaft rotation remains, then this may be clue to the significance of
introducing this method and improving ROM.</p><p>To easily measure the ROM of the GHJ, there is a method that measures flexion and abduction
with the scapula fixed<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Magnetic resonace
imaging is also necessary to perform proper measurements, but the above conventional method
was adopted in the present study because its reproducibility and validity have been
confirmed<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. When the scapula is fixed, a
maximum of 120&#x000b0; of abduction is possible. There are many cases in which there are problems
with the GHJ due to extremely restricted ROM. In this study, the non-fixed shoulder joint
could be flexed to an average angle of about 120&#x000b0;. In a normal shoulder, the GHJ moves about
80&#x000b0;. Flexion and abduction of the fixed scapula in this study, however, were less than 80&#x000b0;;
therefore, there may be a problem with the GHJ in this study&#x02019;s ROM restrictions. It has been
reported that the ROM restrictions occurring in the GHJ are mainly due to shortening of the
joint capsules<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. From the surgical
findings of 17 cases of intractable shoulder contracture, the coracohumeral ligament (CHL)
and scarring of the loose part of the rotator cuff were significant, and contracture was
reported to 3-dimensionally disappear through isolation and removal of this tissue<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the CHL tenses in shoulder
joint lateral rotation, and the loose part of the rotator cuff narrows in the longitudinal
direction and has a function that increases stability, but a reduction in extensibility due
to scarring in the same area is one of the major factors that significantly restrict
shoulder joint motion. Furthermore, the GHJ is very narrow when contracture is strong,
narrowing of the joint capsules is also observed, and inflammation and swelling of the
tissue surrounding the suprahumeral joint often causes adhesion<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The same pathology was presumed to be occurring in the
shoulder joints examined in this study. The shoulder joints of elderly people forced into
prolonged immobility are more vulnerable than expected, and acute inflammation around the
suprahumeral joint may even be the result of simple ROM exercises. In conventional exercise
therapy with stretching through transitive articulation in an elevating direction, pain may
occur around the suprahumeral joint before the sensation of stretching the muscles is felt.
The conventional ROM exercise resulted in to changes at all. In the conventional ROM
exercise, it was very difficult to improve the shortened joint capsule or the CHL.
Therefore, shoulder ROM was not 3-dimensionally improved by the conventional ROM
exercise.</p><p>In addition, when language and cognitive functions decline due to progression of
Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia, as with the subjects in this study, it may be difficult to accurately
convey complaints of pain. In humerus anatomical neck-shaft rotation, there may be
adaptation not only in cases where the is a possibility of causing pain in the suprahumeral
joint during stretching in an elevating direction and cases where shortening can be seen in
the joint capsules and ligaments, but also in cases where a reduction in language and
cognitive functions is seen in those forced into prolonged immobility.</p><p>Problems and issues, such as the validity of the stringency and therapeutic effect of this
study not being verified, remain. Future comparisons with more conventional methods and
examinations through a single-case design are necessary.</p><p>However, this study suggests this method is an effective means of improving muscle
shortening, centered on the joint capsules and CHL, which directly affect GHJ ROM.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Halar</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name></person-group>: Contracture and other deleterious effects of immobility.
