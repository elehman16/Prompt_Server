After successful screening and enrollment, patients were given trial medication for one week followed up at visit 2 (end of 1st week), visit 3 (end of 3rd week), visit 4 (end of 6th week), visit 5 (end of 9th week), and visit 6 (end of 12th week). Thus, total duration of the treatment was 12 weeks per patient.</p><p>Patients satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria were allocated any of the two treatments as per randomization schedule. The baseline efficacy parameter assessment was done on the first day of active treatment phase (Day-1, Visit-1). After one week, patients were evaluated as responders or non-responders based on the scores on VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) of SF-MPQ (Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire). Responders were the ones whose pain reduction on the VAS score was &#x02265;30%. For non-responders, dose escalation was done. The patients randomized to treatment-pregabalin SR received 150 mg once daily for 1 week. After 1 week of treatment, the non-responders were up-titrated to 300 mg once daily and the responders continued the same dose. Similarly, in the Pregabalin IR group, initially the patients received 75 mg twice daily for 1 week followed by 150 mg BID for rest of the period (for non-responders). Patients were evaluated for safety by recording adverse events and laboratory investigations at the baseline and end of the treatment.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Enrolled patients were male or female aged &#x02265;18 and &#x0003c;70 years, with diagnosis of diabetic neuropathic pain (Type I and II) having HbA1c levels of &#x02264;10% and having a score of &#x0003e;30 mm on the VAS of SF-MPQ.
