Reduced exercise capacity can have a major impact on patients' health-related quality of life and its improvement is a key goal of COPD disease management [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As such, various exercise testing protocols have been developed to evaluate exercise capacity in COPD, including progressive incremental exercise tests and constant work rate exercise (CWRE) tests [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) is a CWRE test conducted on the same flat 10-m course as the incremental shuttle walk test at a speed dictated by an auditory signal [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. One notable advantage of the ESWT is that it requires less equipment and technical expertise compared with laboratory-based tests [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, the ESWT has been shown to detect functional improvements in response to pulmonary rehabilitation and bronchodilator pharmacotherapy in patients with COPD in a single-centre setting [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in exercise capacity as measured by the ESWT of 45&#x02013;85&#x02005;s (13&#x02013;15% of the baseline value) in response to a bronchodilator has been validated in previous studies [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In two previous multicentre studies, the ESWT was used to evaluate the effect of the combination of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist, umeclidinium (UMEC), and the long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist, vilanterol (VI), on exercise capacity in patients with COPD [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Both studies demonstrated that treatment with UMEC/VI (once-daily 62.5/25 or 125/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g) resulted in similar improvements from baseline in 3-h post-dose exercise endurance time (EET) over 12&#x02005;weeks. Consistent improvements in lung function and hyperinflation were observed <italic>versus</italic> placebo; however, a pronounced placebo effect for EET was observed in one of the studies, possibly confounding the overall interpretation of the results [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to further assess the effect of once-daily UMEC/VI 62.5/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g on exercise capacity (as measured by the ESWT) <italic>versus</italic> placebo in patients with COPD and to evaluate any placebo effect.

However, the improvements in EET compared with placebo were not consistent between the studies. In one study, although initial improvements in EET in the UMEC/VI 62.5/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g group compared with placebo were observed at day 2, these were not maintained at week 6 or week 12 [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This was attributed to an increase in EET in the placebo group over the 12-week treatment period [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The increase was noted early in the study and investigated to determine if it was due to various factors, including a learning effect, or differences in study populations, study methodologies or the execution of tests between patient centres. While the study population was less reversible to both salbutamol and ipratropium plus salbutamol than the study in which a placebo effect was not observed, and included fewer patients who were able to walk at the top level of the endurance test employed, there was no definitive explanation.</p><p>In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study, the change from baseline in EET in the placebo group was consistent over the study period. The lack of a statistically significant difference between UMEC/VI and placebo was due to a reduced EET response throughout the study, but particularly at week 12 compared with day 2 and week 6. This contrasts with previous studies, in which a greater and consistent improvement from baseline in EET was observed with UMEC/VI over time (58.6&#x02013;69.1&#x02005;s at week 12) [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The differences in least squares mean percentage change from baseline with UMEC/VI <italic>versus</italic> placebo in the current study were 15%, 15% and 7% at day 2, week 6 and week 12, respectively. These differences were greater than the reported MCID in EET (13&#x02013;15% change from baseline [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) at day 2 and week 6, but not at week 12. It is unclear why the change from baseline in EET with UMEC/VI decreased at week 12 compared with the earlier time-points. It is likely not related to the bronchodilator activity of UMEC/VI, as improvements in lung function and lung hyperinflation measures with UMEC/VI over placebo were maintained over 12&#x02005;weeks and were consistent with the findings from the previous two studies [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. During exercise, ventilation increases and expiratory time diminishes, causing dynamic hyperinflation, which results in the exertional dyspnoea and reduced exercise capacity associated with COPD [<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Why the marked and sustained improvements in lung hyperinflation did not translate into improvements in EET is unclear, but may be due to the complex and multifactorial processes involved in walking. It has previously been reported that static hyperinflation is less useful than dynamic hyperinflation in predicting improvements in exercise tolerance [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this study, the large ICC at each study site indicated a high degree of similarity in EET measurements between the run-in period and randomisation visits. A way of reducing between-subject variability should be identified for future exercise studies.</p><p>In the BRIGHT study, significant improvements in EET were observed with indacaterol/glycopyrronium 110/50&#x02005;&#x000b5;g <italic>versus</italic> placebo after 21&#x02005;days [<xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Additionally, similar improvements in lung function were observed at day 21 compared with those observed throughout the treatment period in the current study. However, it should be noted that there were methodological differences between the BRIGHT study and the current study, <italic>e.g.</italic> in the BRIGHT study, cycle ergometry rather than ESWT was used to assess EET, which may have affected the results. Additionally, treatment effects were observed over 21&#x02005;days in the BRIGHT study compared with 12&#x02005;weeks in the current study. As the BRIGHT study assessed short-term improvement in EET and the current study did not detect improvements after 6&#x02005;weeks, it is still uncertain which exercise testing methodology is most appropriate for the long-term assessment of EET. Based on the previous two UMEC/VI exercise studies [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], it may be that the ESWT lacks the sensitivity and repeatability in the multicentre setting to consistently detect benefits of UMEC/VI bronchodilator therapy on EET in patients with COPD for extended periods. This may be due to factors such as the operationalisation of the test, patient motivation, encouragement and learning effects, all of which are known to affect exercise testing but not accounted for in the ESWT [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A recent trial investigated the effect of such interventions on EET in patients receiving tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g [<xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although every effort was made to reduce the impact of these factors on this study, it is impossible to ensure complete consistency across every ESWT as there are many nuances to the test (<italic>e.g.</italic> footwear, presence of a watch). The results of this trial should help further clarify the role of other factors, such as exercise training and behavioural modification, in exercise testing.</p><p>The MOVE study was a randomised, crossover study with two 21-day treatment periods, which assessed the effect of indacaterol/glycopyrronium 110/50&#x02005;&#x000b5;g <italic>versus</italic> placebo on physical activity in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD [<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Improvements in the activity-related energy expenditure were observed with indacaterol/glycopyrronium 110/50&#x02005;&#x000b5;g compared with placebo after the first 21-day treatment period, but not after the second 21-day treatment period [<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although the MOVE study did not analyse EET, a similar pattern to that in the current study was observed, <italic>i.e.</italic> short-term benefits in exercise capacity were achieved with bronchodilator therapy. This highlights that further investigations are required to clarify the effect of long-acting muscarinic antagonist/long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist combinations on exercise capacity.</p><p>A limitation of the current study was that measures of dynamic hyperinflation such as inspiratory capacity were not assessed during exercise testing. As such, it is not known whether UMEC/VI improved dynamic hyperinflation during exercise or if a loss of effect on dynamic hyperinflation may have contributed to the reduced EET response observed at week 12.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment with UMEC/VI did not result in a significant improvement in ESWT at week 12 compared with placebo in patients with COPD, although improvements were observed at day 2 and week 6. Additionally, treatment with UMEC/VI provided sustained improvements over placebo in measures of lung function, hyperinflation and health status over 12&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supplementary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1183/23120541.00073-2017.Supp1</object-id><p><bold>Please note:</bold> supplementary material is not edited by the Editorial Office, and is uploaded as it has been supplied by the author.</p><p>Supplementary Materials <inline-supplementary-material id="SS1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="00073-2017_supplement.pdf" content-type="local-data">00073-2017_supplement</inline-supplementary-material></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Disclosures</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="disclosures"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1183/23120541.00073-2017.Supp2</object-id><p>C.J.
