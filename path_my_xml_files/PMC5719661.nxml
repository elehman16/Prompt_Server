The aim of this study is to investigate whether a model of structured pharmacist and GP care reduces hospital readmissions in high-risk patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This protocol details a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised trial that will recruit participants over 9 months with a 12-month follow-up. There will be 14 clusters each representing a different general practice medical centre. A total of 2240 participants will be recruited from hospital who attend an enrolled medical centre, take five or more long-term medicines or whose reason for admission was related to heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p><p>The intervention is a multifaceted service, involving a pharmacist integrated into a medical centre to assist patients after hospitalisation. Participants will meet with the practice pharmacist and their GP after discharge to review and reconcile their medicines and discuss changes made in hospital. The pharmacist will follow-up with the participant and liaise with other health professionals involved in the participant&#x02019;s care. The control will be usual care, which usually involves a patient self-organising a visit to their GP after hospital discharge.</p><p>The primary outcome is the rate of unplanned, all-cause hospital readmissions over 12 months, which will be analysed using a mixed effects Poisson regression model with a random effect for cluster and a fixed effect to account for any temporal trend. A cost analysis will be undertaken to compare the healthcare costs associated with the intervention to those of usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has received ethical approval (HREC/16/QRBW/410). The study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conferences and reports to key stakeholders.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12616001627448</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Readmission</kwd><kwd>primary care</kwd><kwd>pharmacist</kwd><kwd>medication</kwd><kwd>collaboration</kwd><kwd>stepped-wedge cluster design</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008132</institution-id><institution>HCF Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brisbane North PHN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brisbane South PHN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A model of GP and pharmacist collaboration provides an opportunity to improve health outcomes in patients discharged from hospital.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The stepped-wedge study design is robust and pragmatic, enabling the intervention to be offered to every medical centre involved by the end of the study period.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Multi-skilled research team involving clinicians, health services researchers, a biostatistician and health economists.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Strong stakeholder participation contributing to the protocol design.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Blinding of the intervention is not possible to participants and staff at the medical centre.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transition of patients with chronic and complex conditions from hospital to the community setting is a critical time that is associated with medication misadventure and re-hospitalisation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Up to 50% of patients discharged from medical wards have an unplanned readmission within 1 year.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref> Rates are higher in the elderly and those on multiple medications.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>
</p><p>Medication-related problems are one of the most common reasons for readmissions to hospital and include adverse drug events, suboptimal therapy and poor medication adherence.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 8</xref> Patients often leave hospital with complex care plans and substantial changes to their medication regimens.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In Australia, these changes are usually communicated to the patient&#x02019;s general practitioner (GP), community pharmacy and other health professionals involved in the patient&#x02019;s care via a discharge summary. Discharge summaries can take time to reach primary care providers and often lack key information, such as medication changes, pathology tests that were performed or are pending and agreed treatment plans.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This can lead to medication discrepancies, such as continuing discontinued medication, omitting prescribed medication and not implementing dose changes.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Patients who have a medication discrepancy are twice as likely to be readmitted to hospital within 30 days.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>There have been a number of interventions targeted towards optimising medicine use and improving the timeliness of information leaving hospitals to minimise medication discrepancies and reduce hospital readmissions.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref> A common intervention used to reduce hospital readmissions is medication reconciliation. The literature exploring the efficacy of medication reconciliation at hospital discharge to reduce readmissions is mixed. A recent meta-analysis investigated the effect of pharmacist-led medication reconciliation at hospital transition.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Most of the included studies matched a patient&#x02019;s preadmission medication to their discharge medication and reconciled any differences. The meta-analysis showed there was a 19% reduction in readmissions for those receiving pharmacist-led medication reconciliation compared with usual care.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Other outcomes included a reduction in emergency department (ED) visits (28%) and adverse drug event-related readmissions (67%). These reductions would be anticipated to be associated with substantial cost savings. The findings differ to an earlier systematic review that reported hospital staff-led medication reconciliation had minimal effect on readmissions.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, many of the studies included in the earlier systematic review did not recruit high-risk patients, which may be one reason why certain interventions are not successful. Previous hospitalisations or ED visits, taking multiple long-term medicines and being admitted for heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common risk factors for readmission.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 6 7 18</xref> Interventions targeting participants with these risk factors appear more effective at reducing readmissions.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 19</xref>
</p><p>Another approach to reducing readmissions has been to conduct a medication review immediately after discharge.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> Pharmacists working within a primary care clinic undertaking medication review, with a focus on medication reconciliation and patient education, showed a reduction in hospital readmissions in two studies.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> Tedesco <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> were limited by the study design and small sample size, although they observed a trend (p=0.27) towards decreased readmissions in the intervention group compared with control. The authors noted that&#x000a0;there were fewer readmissions in those who interacted with the pharmacist face to face versus by telephone (p=0.05).</p><p>Overall, common characteristics among effective interventions include allowing for direct communication between the pharmacist and the prescriber,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> involving postdischarge care<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and targeting high-risk patients.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 19 24</xref> A model of GP and pharmacist collaboration assisting patients during transitions of care may be a clinically relevant and cost-effective strategy to reduce unplanned readmissions.</p><p>A practice pharmacist is &#x02018;a pharmacist who delivers professional services from or within a general practice medical centre with a coordinated, collaborative and integrated approach with an overall goal to improve the quality use of medicines of the practice population&#x02019;.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Despite widespread support, the Australian setting is in its infancy in exploring this model of practice that is restricted by the absence of a dedicated and sustainable remuneration model.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The vast majority of Australian pharmacists working in primary care do so in a community pharmacy with one study reporting only 26 pharmacists working within or from a general practice in 2013.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Although performing comprehensive medication reviews is a core activity of practice pharmacists, they are also involved in a range of clinician-level and practice-level activities. These include providing drug information and education as well as clinical prescribing review with prescriber feedback.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Being co-located within the patient&#x02019;s medical home allows for greater communication and collaboration with primary healthcare providers and access to patient&#x02019;s medical records.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> This allows quick identification and resolution of medication-related problems with the prescribing GP, linking with community pharmacies to enhance continuity of care and liaising with hospitals when patients are discharged. Practice pharmacists integrated into the general practice medical team have shown favourable outcomes, with improvements in clinical outcomes, identification and reduction in medication-related problems and improved medication adherence.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> A study in the Netherlands is currently exploring whether integrating non-dispensing pharmacists into the primary care team can reduce medication-related hospital admissions in patients considered at risk of adverse drug events.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>

Participants will be recruited during their hospital admission from public and private hospitals across South East Queensland, Australia. The intervention will be located in 14 different medical centres.

The design involves an initial period where no medical centres are exposed to the intervention (control phase). Then, at regular intervals, two medical centres will be randomised to cross over from control to the intervention. After&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;months, all medical centres will be exposed to the intervention. The length of time a medical centre receives the intervention may vary between 1 and 7 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).

Medication liaison in the form of a discharge medication record may be provided to patients on discharge from hospital and may be included in the hospital discharge summary to the GP.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Lead in phase</title><p>This phase will be used to assist the pharmacist integrating into the medical centre, prior to the intervention beginning. For greatest success, it will be imperative that the pharmacist establishes relationships with the GPs within the medical centre. To facilitate this, the practice pharmacist will be encouraged to meet with each GP, attend meetings and give a presentation to the medical staff on the role of the pharmacist in the study. The pharmacist may also visit the local community pharmacies to introduce themselves, explain the study and that they may be contacted by the practice pharmacist for referrals (home medicine reviews) and additional monitoring (blood pressure and others).</p></sec><sec id="s2d3"><title>Intervention phase</title><p>If the participant&#x02019;s medical centre is in the intervention phase, the participant will receive the intervention.</p><p>The intervention is a multifaceted and collaborative service, involving a practice pharmacist integrated into a medical centre to assist patients in transitioning back into primary care after hospitalisation. The intervention is targeted at the level of the medical centre. A practice pharmacist will be integrated into each medical centre during the intervention phase for approximately 12&#x02009;hours per week, spread across multiple days. There will be three components to the intervention that will apply to each participant in the intervention phase.</p><sec id="s2d3a"><title>Medication management consultation</title><p>Participants will receive a face-to-face medication management consultation (approximately 45&#x02013;60&#x02009;min) with the practice pharmacist in a private room at the attended medical centre. In circumstances where the participant cannot attend their medical centre, the participant may elect to have a home visit by the practice pharmacist.</p><p>The initial medication management consultation will occur as soon as possible after discharge, ideally within five business days of discharge. During this time, the pharmacist will perform a comprehensive medication review to identify any medication-related problems, assess medication adherence, review the participant&#x02019;s medication discharge letter and discuss any changes made to medication during the hospital admission. The pharmacist will also review the participant&#x02019;s medical records at the practice and reconcile any differences as required. The pharmacist will discuss the intended treatment plan and any problems or concerns the participant may have regarding their medication and/or medical conditions. The pharmacist may also liaise with the participant&#x02019;s community pharmacy, hospital pharmacist and other prescribers to directly clarify any issues or anomalies with the participant&#x02019;s records and to communicate the changes made to the participant&#x02019;s medication regimen in hospital.</p><p>The practice pharmacist will also aim to enrol participants into a national online health record to allow better transfer of information between health professionals involved in the participant&#x02019;s care.</p></sec><sec id="s2d3b"><title>Consultation with GP</title><p>Directly after the consultation with the pharmacist, the participant will then have a consultation with their GP to consider any recommendations made by the pharmacist&#x000a0;and discuss the recent admission to hospital and future management plans.</p></sec><sec id="s2d3c"><title>Pharmacist follow-up</title><p>The pharmacist will follow-up with the participant face to face or via the telephone within five business days of the initial consultation.</p><p>The pharmacist may also liaise with the participant&#x02019;s GP and other health professionals involved in the participant&#x02019;s care. This may include a referral to the participant&#x02019;s community pharmacy.</p><p>Additional follow-up with the participant will be determined by the pharmacist or GP based on clinical need for each participant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d4"><title>Outcome follow-up</title><p>Participants will be followed up to 12 months from day of hospital discharge. This will be done through collection of routine data from the hospital and medical centre.</p></sec><sec id="s2d5"><title>Participant withdrawal</title><p>For intention-to-treat purposes, we aim to collect routine data from all participants, regardless of whether they complete the study. If a participant decides to withdraw, we will request consent to collect their follow-up data.</p></sec><sec id="s2d6"><title>Medical centre withdrawal</title><p>It is unlikely that medical centres will withdraw once they have agreed to take part. If a medical centre chooses not to fully engage with the intervention, the research team will request to collect follow-up data. This follow-up data collection will require minimal effort from practice staff. If a medical centre withdraws before commencement of recruitment, the next medical centre on the list will be contacted and invited to participate in the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome is the rate of unplanned, all-cause hospital readmissions 12 months after discharge in the intervention group compared with control/usual care.</p><p>For the purposes of this study, an unplanned readmission is defined as any subsequent admission following the index hospital admission that is an emergency.</p><p>Secondary outcomes are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>the rate of unplanned, all-cause hospital readmissions at 30 days, 3 and 6 months after discharge in the intervention group compared with control/usual care;</p></list-item><list-item><p>the rate of ED presentations at 30 days, 3, 6 and 12 months after discharge in the intervention group compared with control/usual care;</p></list-item><list-item><p>number of hospital treatment plans received within five business days and 30 days after discharge in the intervention group compared with control/usual care;</p></list-item><list-item><p>number of participants reviewed by their GP within a week of discharge in the intervention group compared with control/usual care;</p></list-item><list-item><p>number of visits to the enrolled medical centre within 12 months after discharge in the intervention group compared with control/usual care;</p></list-item><list-item><p>costs to the healthcare system associated with the intervention (including the costs of providing the intervention, unplanned hospital readmissions, ED presentations&#x000a0;and related GP visits) at 30 days, 3, 6 and 12 months after discharge in the intervention group compared with control/usual care;</p></list-item><list-item><p>description of views of the intervention from GPs, practice pharmacists, community pharmacists and participants involved in the study.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size was calculated for the primary outcome, the rate of unplanned, all-cause readmissions at 12 months from date of hospital discharge, using a method that takes into account the: intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC), expected baseline number of readmissions, effect of the intervention and power of the study. We followed methods described by others to determine the sample size needed, assuming a random effect for cluster (medical centre) and a fixed effect for each step to account for time.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref> We have been conservative in our estimate of the ICC as we have limited a priori data to inform this value and also because the ICC is a process outcome, which usually have larger ICCs.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Although the analysis will be a Poisson regression of rate of readmission, the study has been powered on a binary proportion outcome. This is because there is no data on which to estimate current rate of readmission and sample size methodology for stepped-wedge studies does not currently exist for rate outcomes. This is a limitation of the sample size calculation, but the estimate of power will be conservative because the analysis will make full use of the number of readmissions.</p><p>Literature from Australian studies suggests that 45% of patients discharged from medical inpatient units and 61% from Geriatrics Evaluation and Management units have an unplanned readmission within 1 year.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 5</xref> A meta-analysis of interventions performing pharmacist-led medication reconciliation alone at hospital transition found a relative risk reduction in all-cause readmissions of 19% by the intervention across included studies.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This meta-analysis only included studies conducting medication reconciliation, which is only one facet of the planned intervention. It is expected that the intervention in the REMAIN HOME study will be more effective than medication reconciliation alone. A hospital discharge programme involving medication reconciliation and telephone follow-up showed an absolute risk reduction in readmissions (combined with ED visits) of 14% in the general medicine sample.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In a pharmacist-led, home-based medication review after discharge, 45% of patients in the control group experienced a readmission compared with 28% in the intervention, resulting in an absolute risk reduction of 17%.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
</p><p>This study is powered to detect a smaller effect size than the studies conducted by Jack <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and Naunton and Peterson<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> that are described above. This is a conservative estimate and smaller effect sizes are also likely to be clinically important. We expect only minimal variation in cluster sizes and so have not allowed for varying cluster sizes. With 14 clusters, and 20 patients recruited per cluster per month (except during the transition phase), it&#x000a0;gives an expected total sample size of 2240 participants. Using these estimates and expected loss to follow-up of approximately 20%, the design will have in the region of 80%&#x02013;90%&#x02009;power to detect a change in proportions of unplanned readmissions from 0.3 to 0.2 for a range of ICCs (from 0.05 to 0.15).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomisation</title><p>The unit of randomisation is the study medical centre, not the participant. Once 14 medical centres have provided consent to be involved in the study, each enrolled medical centre will be randomised to a transition step by the study statistician (KH). This will determine how long the medical centre is in the control and intervention phase. Stratified randomisation will be used to achieve an even balance of medical centres across the two geographical regions the study is set over while maintaining randomisation. Each medical centre will be informed of their randomisation status 1 month prior to their transition phase to be able to make the necessary arrangements for the pharmacist to integrate into the medical centre at the required time.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Allocation concealment and blinding</title><p>Research assistants recruiting participants will remain blinded to the randomisation schedule and will have no contact with the practice pharmacists throughout the study to ensure allocation concealment. Once the patient has been enrolled, the research assistant will notify the project coordinator who will pass the participant&#x02019;s details on to the practice pharmacist performing the intervention. If the medical centre the participant attends is in the control phase, the medical centre will not be notified.</p><p>Blinding of the intervention to staff at the medical centre and to participants is not possible as the presence of the pharmacist in the medical centre will indicate they are in the intervention phase.

We also intend to allow for both levels of clustering at the analysis stage&#x02014;clustering by hospital and medical centre. This will be done by including both a random effect for medical centres and hospitals. If this model does not converge, we will include a fixed effect for hospital (as there will not be many hospitals) and a random effect for medical centre. In addition, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted with a random effect for pharmacist. This will allow for pharmacists working across multiple medical centres.
