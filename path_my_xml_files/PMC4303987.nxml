Patients in the United States could have received clobazam for 6&#x000a0;years before it became commercially available. Efficacy assessments included changes in rates of drop seizures and total seizures, responder rates (&#x02265;50%, &#x02265;75%, or 100% decreases in seizure frequency vs. baseline), sustained efficacy over time, concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED) use, and global evaluations. Safety assessments included exposure to clobazam, laboratory assessments, physical and neurologic examinations, vital sign monitoring, electrocardiography monitoring, and adverse event reporting.</p></sec><sec><title><underline>Results</underline></title><p>Of 267 patients who enrolled in the OLE, 188 (70%) completed the trial. Two hundred seven patients were from the United States, which was the only country in which patients could be treated with clobazam for &#x0003e;2&#x000a0;years. Forty-four patients were treated with clobazam for 5&#x000a0;years, and 11 for 6&#x000a0;years. Because of the low number of Year 6 patients, this group is not reported separately. Improvements in baseline seizure rates were very stable over the course of the study, with a median 85% decrease in drop seizures at Year 1, 87% at Year 2, 92% at Year 3, 97% at Year 4, and a 91% decrease for patients who had reached Year 5. Similar results were observed for total seizures (79% decrease at both Years 1 and 2, 82% decrease at Year 3, 75% decrease at Year 4, and 85% decrease at Year 5). Responder rates were also stable for the duration of the trial. Of patients who had achieved a &#x02265;50% decrease in median drop-seizure frequency from baseline to Month 3, 86% still had that degree of drop-seizure reduction at Year 3 (and 14% lost their initial responses), and 47% were drop-seizure&#x02013;free. Most patients who had achieved drop-seizure freedom in the original controlled trials remained drop-seizure&#x02013;free in the OLE. Based on parents' and physicians' ratings of global evaluations, 80% of patients were &#x0201c;very much improved&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;much improved&#x0201d; after 3&#x000a0;years. Of the 43 patients with concomitant AED data who were treated for 5&#x000a0;years, 30% increased, 19% decreased, and 51% had no change in numbers of AEDs versus their Week 4 regimens. The mean modal clobazam dosage was 0.90&#x000a0;mg/kg/day at Year 1 and 0.97&#x000a0;mg/kg/day at Year 5, suggesting that study patients did not need significant increases in dosage over time. The safety profile was what would be expected for clobazam for LGS patients over a 5-year span, and no new safety concerns developed over time.</p></sec><sec><title><underline>Significance</underline></title><p>In this largest and longest-running trial in LGS, adjunctive clobazam sustained seizure freedom and substantial seizure improvements at stable dosages through 3&#x000a0;years of therapy in this difficult- to-treat patient population.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Drop seizures</kwd><kwd>Antiepileptic drug</kwd><kwd>Benzodiazepines</kwd><kwd>Clinical trials</kwd><kwd>Epilepsy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a complex, chronic epileptic encephalopathy that often requires decades of polytherapy.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The most common seizure types associated with LGS are tonic and atonic seizures (also referred to as &#x0201c;drop attacks&#x0201d; because they may result in falls), occurring in at least 50% of LGS patients.

During the week preceding or following each study visit, the parent/caregiver, with the assistance of the patient, if able, maintained a seizure diary in which daily seizure counts (including drop seizures) were recorded. In the OV-1012 trial, a drop seizure was defined as any drop attack or spell involving the entire body, trunk, or head that led to a fall, injury, slumping in a chair, or the patient's head hitting a surface, or that could have led to a fall or injury, depending on the patient's position at the time of the attack or spell.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>During the Day 1 visit (first visit in the OV-1004 OLE), the patient or the patient's legally authorized representative signed and dated the institutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC)&#x02013;approved informed consent form/Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization form and assent, if appropriate.

Adverse events that led to premature discontinuation in &#x0003e;1 patient were death, pneumonia, convulsion, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), each reported for two patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Deaths</title><p>Ten patients (4%) died during this OLE study, including the two patients described earlier. One patient prematurely discontinued study drug because of patient/parent/caregiver request and died following discontinuation. Fatal adverse events were pneumonia (three patients); death of unknown origin or etiology (two patients); epilepsy (one patient); the combination of pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis (one patient); pneumonia and cardiopulmonary arrest (one patient); the combination of preexisting seizure increase, atelectasis, and hypoxic respiratory failure (one patient); and ARDS and right leg hematoma (one patient). Nine of the 10 deaths were deemed &#x0201c;unlikely related&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;not related&#x0201d; to clobazam by investigators. One patient experienced a convulsion with an outcome of death that was considered &#x0201c;possibly related&#x0201d; to clobazam by the investigator.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The clobazam OV-1004 trial is, by far, the largest and longest-running trial in patients with LGS published to date. As of May 2013, only three other long-term drug extension trials in LGS patients had been published: a 6-month extension of a topiramate trial with 97 patients,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> a 1-year extension of a felbamate trial with 73 patients,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and a 3-year extension of a rufinamide trial with 124 patients.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> No other adjunctive therapy for LGS has demonstrated this degree of sustained seizure freedom and substantial seizure improvements for this length of time. Moreover, the stable dosages observed over time indicate a lack of tolerance that has not been observed in this difficult-to-treat patient population, and make these findings unprecedented in the epilepsy field and important to those treating this chronic illness.</p><p>The stability of clobazam dosing over time was carefully monitored in this open-label extension trial. Dosages were generally stable and remained &#x0003c;2&#x000a0;mg/kg maximum for most patients at the interim cutoff,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and these final results. From Year 1 through Year 5, mean modal clobazam dosages increased by a mere 8%. In addition, at Years 3, 4, and 5, approximately 75% of patients who had reached those time points were receiving either the same or a fewer number of concomitant AEDs (with approximately 25% of patients having increased their numbers of concomitant AEDs).</p><p>Development of tolerance has been known to occur with prolonged 1,4-benzodiazepine use.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Although tolerance was not specifically evaluated in this study, these final data support the interim analyses findings of limited development of tolerance, as suggested by the following: (1) Response rates did not diminish; (2) mean modal clobazam dosages did not increase with time; (3) 70% of patients remained in treatment long term, with only 6% discontinuing because of lack of efficacy; and (4) some patients were able to decrease their numbers of concomitant AEDs. For a few patients (approximately 15%), seizure control was possible with clobazam monotherapy.</p><p>At Years 1 and 3, 14% of patients who were initial responders (&#x02265;50% seizure reduction from baseline to Month 3) had lost their responses (potentially indicating tolerance). This percentage is notably lower than that of an independent, retrospective chart review of 46 LGS patients at the pediatric neurology department of Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea (2000&#x02013;2009), which reported tolerance for 12 (48%) of 25 patients.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Our summary outcome of sustained therapeutic responses, as measured by numbers and percentages of patients sustaining their initial responses at Years 1, 2, and 3, as well as our analyses of mean modal dosages over time, does not exclude the possibility of the development of tolerance. Some patients may improve later and compensate or even overcompensate for the loss of initial efficacy in other patients. It is important to note that patients outside the United States were limited to 2&#x000a0;years of therapy. Therefore, 39 patients outside the United States who had completed 2&#x000a0;years in the study were not permitted to continue in Year 3, and this accounts for the notable decrease in patient numbers from Year 2 to Year 3.</p><p>In phase II and phase III randomized controlled trials, clobazam was found to be well-tolerated and efficacious for treatment of seizures associated with LGS.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Decreases in average weekly drop attacks and total seizures observed in these trials that led into this long-term, open-label extension were sustained through 2&#x000a0;years (as reported in an interim analysis<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and have continued to improve or remain steady throughout the entire &#x02265;5&#x000a0;years. Responder rates, defined as at least 50%, 75%, or 100% decreases in drop-seizure and total-seizure frequencies with clobazam treatment, were substantially greater than previously published long-term LGS trials, with at least 4&#x000a0;years' longer clobazam treatment data.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>The type and incidence of adverse events reported during this trial were similar to those reported during the double-blind studies. The elevated incidences of upper respiratory tract infections and pyrexia were expected given the duration of the trial and a predominantly pediatric patient population. Nine of the 10 deaths were deemed &#x0201c;unlikely related&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;not related&#x0201d; to clobazam by investigators. One death was considered only &#x0201c;possibly related&#x0201d; to clobazam. Given that patients with LGS often require chronic treatment with one or more AEDs, the safety data observed during this study suggest that clobazam has a favorable long-term safety profile. Because LGS is a chronic syndrome that requires a lifetime of treatment, the lack of change in clobazam's safety profile through 6&#x000a0;years is reassuring for the long-term management of LGS.</p><p>Although vulnerable to the limitations of all OLE trials, the final OV-1004 data support the interim findings<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> of high patient retention rate, stable dosages, and continued substantial seizure improvements in LGS patients treated with clobazam. Data from long-term, open-label extension trials are useful, but they should be interpreted with caution. Patients who discontinue because of a lack of efficacy may enrich the pool of patients for whom the drug is efficacious. However, at the data cutoff date of the interim analysis (July 1, 2010), &#x0003c;5% of patients had discontinued the trial for lack of efficacy,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and only 6% of patients at this final analysis had done so. In addition, the most common reason for discontinuation (12%) in this final analysis of the study was patient, caregiver, or parent request. We had no additional information about these patients, and this limited our analyses. Study investigators could optimize treatment regimens for patients by adding, removing, or adjusting dosages of concomitant AEDs and by employing other treatment options, such as vagus nerve stimulation and the ketogenic diet. Finally, the natural course of LGS varies widely and may be less severe for older patients. Concomitant therapies; responder bias; the indeterminate patient, caregiver, or parent request reason for discontinuation; and the variable natural course of the disease are potential confounders of the results presented here.</p><p>The data from the 6-year, open-label OV-1004 trial in LGS patients indicate that clobazam is efficacious over the long term and can be used safely to treat this chronic disorder. Although results from studies of different adjunctive AEDs for LGS cannot be compared directly, clobazam's efficacy rates were greater and were sustained for longer periods than for other adjunctive LGS AEDs studied. The substantial and sustained efficacy observed in this extension, the stable dosages required to do so, and the stable and predictable safety profile provide evidence that clobazam is a valuable long-term treatment option for LGS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Manuscript preparation, including editing and formatting the manuscript, incorporating author comments, preparing tables and figures, and coordinating submission requirements, was provided by Neva West, PhD, of Prescott Medical Communications Group (Chicago, IL), and Michael A.

The maximum allowed daily dosage for all patients in OV-1004 was 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg/day (maximum 80&#x000a0;mg/day). To optimize patient care, investigators were able to start, adjust, and discontinue other AEDs, and initiate other forms of treatment, including the ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulator placement. Concomitant medications were classified by the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary, Version June 1, 2009. Concomitant medications were those received during the clobazam dosing period. The summary for concomitant medications was separated for AEDs and non-AEDs. Week 4 AED regimens (based on Week 4 of the OLE) were used as the baseline comparators. At the initiation of the OLE, all patients were started at a dosage of 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg/day. During the first 4&#x000a0;weeks of the OLE, dosages were titrated to efficacy. Therefore, Week 4 was chosen, since it represented a beginning point of stable, maintenance therapy. Rescue medications (i.e., medications with preferred terms of &#x0201c;clonazepam,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;diazepam,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;lorazepam,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;midazolam,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;midazolam hydrochloride,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;phenytoin,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;phenytoin sodium,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;phenobarbital,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;phenobarbital sodium&#x0201d;) received for only 1&#x000a0;day or one dose were not considered concomitant therapies in determining the total number of AEDs a patient was receiving. Rescue medications were permitted no more than once per month.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy outcome was the percentage decrease in the average weekly rate of drop seizures at yearly time intervals compared with baseline values. The percentage decrease in the average weekly rate of total seizures was also measured.</p><p>Baseline values for seizure analyses were defined as follows: (1) For patients who received placebo in OV-1012, baseline corresponded to the last week of recorded seizures prior to receiving their first doses of clobazam; or (2) For patients who received clobazam in OV-1002 or OV-1012, baseline corresponded to the last week of recorded seizures from the baseline period of the blinded study. For all other parameters (e.g., exposure), baseline was defined as the last value before the first dose of clobazam, whether in the previous blinded study or OV-1004.</p><p>Additional efficacy outcomes included percentage of treatment responders, percentage of patients maintaining initial response (indicating lack of development of tolerance), global evaluations of patients' overall changes in symptoms, and changes in concomitant AED use. Treatment responders were defined as patients with &#x02265;50%, &#x02265;75%, and 100% decreases in drop seizures or total seizures from baseline. As a proxy measure of the development of tolerance to clobazam, patients who had achieved a &#x02265;50% decrease in drop seizures from baseline at Month 3 were assessed for a decrease in response rate. Investigator and parent/caregiver global evaluations of patients' overall changes in symptoms assessments were based on a 7-point scale from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). At Week 4, patients receiving 1, 2, 3, or &#x0003e;3 concomitant AEDs were grouped, and changes in their AED intakes were calculated at each year (360&#x000a0;days) of the trial. Ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation, and rescue medications (previously defined in Methods and used for 1&#x000a0;day or single dose) were not considered concomitant AEDs for this calculation.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>The primary overall objective of the OV-1004 open-label trial was collection of safety information. Measures included clobazam exposure, laboratory assessments (e.g., hematology tests, blood chemistry evaluations, and urinalyses), physical and neurologic examinations, vital sign monitoring, electrocardiography monitoring, and adverse event reporting.</p><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events were summarized over time by relationship to treatment (not related, possible, or probable), severity (mild, moderate, or severe), and seriousness. A serious adverse event was defined as any adverse event that met one of five predefined criteria previously described.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p></sec></sec></app></app-group><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><p>Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article:</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd1"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Most frequently reported adverse events (&#x02265;10% of patients) during any exposure to clobazam (Safety Analysis Set).</p></caption><media mimetype="docx" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="epi0055-0558-sd1.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e2001" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd2"><media mimetype="pptx" mime-subtype="pptx" xlink:href="epi0055-0558-sd2.pptx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e2003" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></back></article>
