According to the Adult Treatment Panel III the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP-ATTP-III) guidelines, metabolic syndrome is identifying the presence of three or more of the following defining risk factors: abdominal obesity (waist circumference &#x02265; 102/88 cm in males/females), triglycerides (&#x02265; 150 mg/dL under fasting conditions or fibrate or nicotinic acid therapy), fasting glucose (&#x02265; 100 mg/dL or glucose-lowering treatment or previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus), systolic/diastolic blood pressure (&#x02265; 130/85 mmHg or antihypertensive treatment) and fasting high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (&#x0003c; 40/50 mg/dL in males/females) [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Artery structure is changed by increased blood pressure (BP). Risks of CVDs increase, not only in patients with high blood pressure, but also in those with normal blood pressure [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among the major factors related to high blood pressure, angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is associated with elevation of blood pressure in the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and kallikrein kinin system (KKS) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the RAS, ACE produces angiotensin II with vasoconstrictive activity, while in the KKS, ACE inactivates bradykinin with the ability to induce vascular relaxation [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, effective inhibition of ACE is one of the key actions required for the reduction of high blood pressure. However, the currently employed synthetic anti-ACE agents reportedly have adverse effects, such as hyperkalemia, headache, dizziness, fatigue and nausea [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Due to these adverse side effects, identifying a safe anti-ACE agent from food resources has been the subject of alternative therapies for hypertension. Possible mechanisms for the reduction of blood pressure involve promoting vasorelaxation [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Production of nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial nitric oxide synthesis (eNOS) in the endothelium leads to vasorelaxant effect in hypertension [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Our previous studies have proposed that the <italic>S. clava</italic> flesh tissue can be considered a potential antihypertensive agent. For example, the enzymatic hydrolysate from <italic>S. clava</italic> flesh tissue inhibited ACE activity [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, the enzymatic hydrolysate exerted a vasorelaxation effect in response to NO produced by eNOS in the rat thoracic aorta. Further, a previous <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment revealed that oral administration of the enzymatic hydrolysate induced a reduction of BP in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of hypertension [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite the afore- mentioned preclinical data, there is a lack of data regarding human clinical trials of enzymatic hydrolysate from <italic>S. clava</italic> flesh tissue. Thus, we conducted a double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled study to evaluate the antihypertensive effects of the enzymatic hydrolysate from <italic>S. clava</italic> flesh tissue in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p><italic>Styela clava</italic> flesh tissue was obtained from Miduduk Corporated Association (Changwon, Gyeongsangnam-do, Korea). Protamex was purchased from Novozyme Co. (Bagasvaerd, Hovedstaden, Denmark). All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of <italic>S. clava</italic> flesh tissue hydrolysate (SFTH)</title><p><italic>S. clava</italic> flesh tissue powder was hydrolyzed with Protamex in buffer solution for 24 h according to our previous method [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The enzyme was then subjected to inactivation at 100&#x02103; for 10 min, after which the solution was filtered. Following removal of the insoluble materials by centrifugation at 3,000 &#x000d7; g for 20 min, the soluble hydrolysate in the supernatant was lyophilized to yield <italic>S. clava</italic> flesh tissue hydrolysate (SFTH) dry powder.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and experimental design</title><p>Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 30-80 years, had T2DM and hypertension with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 180 mmHg or less, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 110 mmHg or less, hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) of 10% or less, triglyceride count of 1,000 mg/dL or less, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol of 190 mg/dL or less at enrollment, and were taking a stable dose and type of antihypertensive, anti-diabetic, or other medications at the discretion of the responsible physician within 3 months. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, know psychiatric diseases or drug abuse, type 1 diabetes, secondary hypertension or SBP &#x02265; 180 mmHg or DBP &#x02265; 110 mmHg, cardiovascular disorders (unstable angina pectoris, heart failure, history of myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular diseases within 6 months, and life-threatening arrhythmia), chronic kidney disease stage &#x0003e; 3, proteinuria &#x02265; 3.5 g/day, other severe systemic illnesses, and inability to communicate and comply with all study requirements. The Jeju National University Hospital's institutional review board approved the protocol (approval number: 2011-40), and informed written consent was obtained from all participants. The study was conducted by the Declaration of Helsinki, and performed in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines.</p><p>Eligible subjects were randomized within 2 weeks of the screening visit. The randomization codes were computer generated by a research coordinator in blocks to ensure an approximate balance (1:~1.5 ratio) between the placebo and SFTH treatment arms. If a subject was assigned a subject number, but did not receive study medication, the subject number was not used again. For randomization, we tried to match each subject with a control of similar age, sex, initial HbA<sub>1C</sub> level, and BP at visit 1, and randomized consecutively. However, because paired comparisons between before and after treatments were possible for the investigating agent, the matching processes were not too strict. A SFTH dosage of 500 mg 1 time/day was chosen for the study. <italic>S. clava</italic> flesh tissue hydrolysate in 250 mg capsules was used based on previous <italic>in vivo</italic> tests and dosages in prior clinical studies. All subjects were instructed to ingest the capsules before a meal over a 4 week period. The vehicle-containing placebo was comparable in size and shape to the SFTH. All subjects were instructed to maintain their usual dietary intake and physical activity. Energy and food intake was not limited throughout the trial period, but supplemental food products containing <italic>S. clava</italic> were prohibited. Anthropometric parameters were measured at baseline. Blood sampling for efficacy and safety parameters was performed at baseline and at week 4.</p></sec><sec><title>Study measurements</title><p>SBP and DBP were measured by office BP monitoring at baseline and after 4 weeks. The BP measurements were conducted by a trained clinical research nurse in the seated position, with feet on the floor and the arm supported at heart level after at least 5 min of rest. The BP measurement that was used was the mean of two values recorded 3 minutes apart. Elevated values were confirmed on a separate day. Blood samples were collected at baseline and follow-up for measurement of the plasma concentrations of HbA1c, lipoprotein, fructosamine, white blood cells (WBCs), hemoglobin, platelets, fibrinogen, total cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transferase (ALT), sodium, potassium, chloride, total calcium, fasting blood glucose, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GTP), triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs CRP), apoliportein A1, apoliprotein B, and insulin, and all samples were analyzed using routine automated methods. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated using serum fasting glucose and insulin levels [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Urine samples were collected for measurement of albumin and creatinine, and the urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) was calculated (mg/g of creatinine). Safety was evaluated through the collection of adverse experience reports, vital signs, and laboratory tests, which included hematology and blood chemistry analysis. Efficacy, safety, and all other laboratory measurements were conducted at Jeju National University Hospital (Jeju, Korea) by investigators and their trained members, all of whom were blinded to the treatment group.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The values of all test parameters are presented as the means &#x000b1; standard error (SE). Paired <italic>t</italic>-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to assess the differences before and after administration of the investigational products within groups using a per-protocol analysis. Moreover, between-group differences were assessed by independent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests if normally distributed and by non-parametric Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests otherwise. All statistical analyses were performed using the statistical analysis system (SAS) software (version 9.1.3, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). Statistical significance was considered at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Clinical characteristics</title><p>From a total of 80 screened patients, 57 were randomized. One patient was excluded because she withdrew her consent before taking the investigating agent; thus, 56 patients [placebo (n = 22); SFTH (n = 34)] were subjected to analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Baseline patient characteristics were age, gender, bodyweight, duration of diabetes, biochemical and hematological parameters and BP in both groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Baseline age, gender, body weight, duration of diabetes, biochemical and hematological parameters did not differ significantly between the two groups; however, baseline SBP and DBP did (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.022, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Blood pressure control</title><p>The changes in SBP and DBP values in placebo and SFTH groups from baseline after 4 weeks are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>. There were no significant differences in SBP and DBP between the two groups after 4 weeks of treatment. The SFTH group showed a significant decrease in both SBP and DBP (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 each), whereas the placebo group did not show significant changes in either SBP or DBP after 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical and hematological parameters</title><p>The changes in biochemical and hematologic parameters in the two groups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. For some parameters, there were slight time differences within the two groups after 4 weeks of treatment, but there were no significant differences between groups at 4 weeks. However, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) differed significantly (<italic>P</italic> = 0.039) between the two groups after the 4 week. The SFTH group exhibited significant decreases in HbA<sub>1c</sub> level (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008) and WBC count (<italic>P</italic> = 0.048) after 4 weeks as well as a tendency toward improvement in the levels of circulating triglyceride, apolipoprotein B, insulin and HOMA-IR index after 4 weeks. The body weight in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.033) after 4 weeks, while the UACR was increased. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, neither group showed serious adverse events, and there were no discontinuations associated with adverse events in either group. The number of patients with abnormal laboratory findings was low and similar between treatment groups. In addition, there were no clinically relevant changes in physical status, vital signs, or electrocardiography (ECG) observed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Many marine bioresources have recently been investigated for their ability to improve metabolic syndromes, such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Among these, the sea squirt, <italic>Styela clava</italic>, which is rich in proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acid, fibers, and carotenoids, is known to have a high nutritional value and is therefore commonly used as a food ingredient in Korea [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Among the compositions of <italic>S. clava</italic> tissue, the flesh tissue protein is more than 65%, which is two time higher than that of tunic tissue [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, flesh tissue proteins can be converted into bioactive peptides by enzymatic hydrolysis, which can therefore be used to enhance the biological activities of flesh tissue proteins. We previously reported that the enzymatic hydrolysates from <italic>S. clava</italic> flesh tissue protein has the potential to reduce BP via ACE inhibition and NO generation to induce endothelial vasodilation [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the antihypertensive effects of this food itself or its ingredients have not been evaluated in human subjects. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the antihypertensive effect and safety of enzymatic hydrolysate from <italic>S. clava</italic> flesh tissue protein in Korean patients with hypertension and T2DM. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study, after a 4-week administration of SFTH, favorable changes in SBP, DBP and some metabolic parameters were detected in subjects who consumed 500 mg/day SFTH without any noticeable adverse effects.</p><p>ACE inhibition and NO generation are important factors in lowering blood pressure [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Among the regulatory factors related to hypertension, ACE regulates BP by KKS and RAS [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, NO-mediated vasorelaxation is one of the mechanisms of antihypertensive effects [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) treated with the peptides from <italic>S. clava</italic> decreased SBP level, inhibited ACE and generated NO production in the vascular endothelium [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], suggesting that <italic>S. clava</italic> could regulate BP via ACE inhibition and NO generation.</p><p>Control of high BP is very important for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, the prevalence and risk of which are increased in patients with diabetes, atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hypertension is also commonly associated glucose intolerance, and poses a major threat to human health worldwide [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It has been reported that ACE inhibition plays a role in glucose homeostasis in subjects with diabetes [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In our previous studies, we purified an ACE inhibitory peptide from <italic>S. clava</italic> flesh tissue [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and demonstrated its stimulating effect on glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the SFTH group, serum levels of triglyceride, apolipoprotein B, insulin and the HOMA-IR index tended to be improved after 4 weeks. This finding may partially explain the effects of SFTH on BP and HbA<sub>1C</sub>, although blood glucose did not change significantly. Moreover, both groups had low incidences of adverse events and were similar to the two groups. Based on the overall results, the use of SFTH or the intake of the sea squirt <italic>S. clava</italic> might be beneficial to patients with cardiometabolic diseases. The SFTH used in this study is considered relatively safe because it used food grade enzyme. However, further studies are needed to confirm its potent antihypertensive effects, as well as the adverse effects associated with long-term use of SFTH in more hypertensive patients than were included in this study. In addition, it has previously been reported that excess daily salt intake impairs vasorelaxation and vasoconstriction, resulting in increased BP [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Accordingly, these results support the further evaluation of the salt intake via urine sodium and urine creatinine.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study showed that SFTH has antihypertensive effects with some metabolically beneficial effects in patients with T2DM and hypertension. Thus, SFTH might be a promising pharmaceutical resource that will be helpful to control cardiometabolic diseases.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>CONFLICT OF INTEREST:</bold> The authors declare no potential conflicts of interests.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This research was supported by the 2016 scientific promotion program funded by Jeju National University, as well as by a grant from the Korea Health Technology R&#x00026;D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) funded by the Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare, Korea (HI14C1135).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alberti</surname><given-names>KG</given-names></name><name><surname>Zimmet</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><collab>IDF Epidemiology Task Force Consensus Group</collab><article-title>The metabolic syndrome--a new worldwide definition</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2005</year><volume>366</volume><fpage>1059</fpage><lpage>1062</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16182882</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults</collab><article-title>Executive summary of the third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III)</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2001</year><volume>285</volume><fpage>2486</fpage><lpage>2497</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11368702</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><collab>World Health Organization</collab><source>Global Health Risks: Mortality and Burden of Disease Attributable to Selected Major Risks</source><publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc><publisher-name>World Health Organization</publisher-name><year>2009</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Je</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>WK</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Isolation of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor from fermented oyster sauce, <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic></article-title><source>Food Chem</source><year>2005</year><volume>90</volume><fpage>809</fpage><lpage>814</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Unger</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The role of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of cardiovascular disease</article-title><source>Am J Cardiol</source><year>2002</year><volume>89</volume><fpage>3A</fpage><lpage>9A</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Jeon</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Byun</surname><given-names>HG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Purification and characterization of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory peptides from the rotifer, <italic>Brachionus rotundiformis</italic></article-title><source>Bioresour Technol</source><year>2009</year><volume>100</volume><fpage>5255</fpage><lpage>5259</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19540110</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lapointe</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Rouleau</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Activation of vascular tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in heart failure.
