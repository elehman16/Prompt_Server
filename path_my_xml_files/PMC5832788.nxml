We considered that rupatadine, a platelet-activating factor receptor inhibitor, might modulate dengue-associated vascular leak. The effects of rupatadine were assessed <italic>in vitro</italic>, and in a dengue model, which showed that rupatadine significantly reduced endothelial permeability by dengue sera <italic>in vitro,</italic> and significantly inhibited the increased haematocrit in dengue-infected mice with dose-dependency. We conducted a randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 183 adult patients in Sri Lanka with acute dengue, which showed that rupatadine up to 40&#x02009;mg daily appeared safe and well-tolerated with similar proportions of adverse events with rupatadine and placebo. Although the primary end-point of a significant reduction in fluid leakage (development of pleural effusions or ascites) was not met, post-hoc analyses revealed small but significant differences in several parameters on individual illness days - higher platelet counts and lower aspartate-aminotransferase levels on day 7 in the rupatadine group compared to the placebo group, and smaller effusions on day 8 in the subgroup of patients with pleural effusions. However, due to the small sample size and range of recruitment time, the potential beneficial effects of rupatadine require further evaluation in large studies focused on recruitment during the early febrile phase.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The incidence of dengue has risen 30-fold during the past 50 years and there is a steady increase in the countries reporting dengue infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The dengue virus is a flavivirus, belonging to the same family as the Zika virus. It is estimated that 390 million dengue infections occurred in 2010, resulting in approximately 96 million clinically apparent infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The estimated annual global cost associated with dengue is $8.9 billion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Currently there is no specific treatment for this infection and careful monitoring and administration of fluid remains the only treatment option<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. There is clearly a major unmet clinical need for a safe effective therapy that can be realistically used in a practical way in resource-poor communities where the bulk of infections occur.</p><p id="Par3">Vascular leakage is a hallmark of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and is thought to occur due to endothelial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> resulting in increased vascular permeability. Severe dengue is characterized by clinically detectable vascular leak, which manifests clinically in the form of pleural effusions or ascites and can lead to haemodynamic instability and shock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Occurrence of shock has been shown to be a key association with fatalities in dengue, followed by organ dysfunction and severe bleeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Although there are many potential causes&#x000a0;of organ dysfunction and severe bleeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, poor organ perfusion and poor blood supply to the intestinal mucosa have been suggested as one of the main causes of these complications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, drugs that prevent or reduce vascular leakage, would be a suitable option to reduce severe dengue and associated complications. We recently reported that platelet activating factor (PAF) is elevated during acute dengue infection and may be an important mediator of vascular leak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We found that sera from patients with acute dengue significantly reduced the expression of tight junction protein ZO-1, and also reduced trans-endothelial resistance (TEER) in endothelial cells, which were both significantly improved by PAF receptor blockade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. PAF has also been shown to be associated with vascular leak in mouse models of dengue infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. PAF is rapidly synthesized from many cells such as endothelial cells, leucocytes, mast cells, macrophages and monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. PAF is a potent inducer of increased vascular permeability in sepsis and anaphylaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> partly by promoting inter-endothelial leakage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Overall these data support approaches to investigate the clinical effects of PAF receptor blockade in human dengue infection.</p><p id="Par4">Rupatadine is an orally available second-generation antihistamine known to have long acting dual histamine-1-receptor blocking activities and PAF receptor blocking activities for treatment of allergic disease and chronic urticaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Rupatadine, which competitively blocks both histamine and PAF receptors, has been shown to be well tolerated in many clinical trials in patients who were treated for allergic rhinitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and off-label doses of up to 40&#x02009;mg/day have shown to be well tolerated in chronic urticaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Rupatadine has not shown cardiac adverse effects even at administration of 100&#x02009;mg in European and Asian individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Given the PAF receptor blocking activity, we considered that rupatadine may be repurposed for use during acute dengue infection. It has advantages that it is administered orally and is&#x000a0;relatively cheap and so could offer a realistic practical benefit in resource-poor clinical settings. We sought to test this possibility <italic>in vitro</italic>, in an animal model, and in a placebo controlled clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effects of rupatadine on reducing endothelial cell permeability <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="Par5">We have previously shown that PAF receptor blockade inhibited the effects of acute dengue sera on endothelial permeability <italic>in vitro</italic> using a high affinity inhibitor (1-(N,N-Dimethylcarbamoyl)-4-ethynyl-3-(3-fluoro-4-((1H-2-methylimidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-1-yl)methyl)benzoyl)-indole, HCl)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In order to investigate whether a licensed human medication with known PAF receptor blockade activity could also affect dengue sera-induced vascular permeability, human umbilical vein derived endothelial cell lines (HUVEC) were incubated with PAF and/or acute dengue sera in the presence or absence of rupatadine. Rupatadine 500&#x02009;ng/ml significantly reduced PAF-induced effects on expression of the tight junction protein-ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) and trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the presence of acute dengue serum from patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), the ZO-1 HUVEC surface staining becomes punctate, but with control serum or in the presence of rupatadine, the surface staining is linear. Furthermore, we observed that rupatadine significantly inhibited the effects of acute dengue sera on HUVEC expression of ZO-1 and TEER (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The effects of rupatadine on TEER were found to be comparable to that of the high affinity PAF receptor antagonist, 1-(N,N-Dimethylcarbamoyl)-4-ethynyl-3-(3-fluoro-4-((1H-2-methylimidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-1-yl)methyl)benzoyl)-indole, HCl. However, the concentration of rupatadine used in these <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments were higher than observed in humans, when given rupatadine 40&#x02009;mg daily (Cmax&#x02009;=&#x02009;15&#x02009;ng/ml)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These data confirmed that rupatadine could modulate the effects of PAF and acute dengue sera on human endothelia, raising the possibility that it may have clinical benefit during acute dengue infection.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Rupatadine influences vascular function <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a dengue mouse model.

We reasoned that doses above the licensed 10&#x02009;mg rupatadine may be required and recruited individuals with acute dengue infection presenting sequentially to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), of Colombo, Sri Lanka for up to 5 days (or until hospital discharge). As safety was a key aspect to the study, the patients and all medical personel who were caring for the patients were blinded, whereas the investigators who were recruiting the patients and recording the data from the patients&#x02019; clinical records were not blinded. The two primary objectives in this study, were to evaluate the safety of rupatadine up to 40&#x02009;mg/day in acute dengue infection and its effect in preventing or reducing fluid leak. Accordingly, the primary efficacy endpoint assessed in the trial was defined as development of either ascites or pleural effusion at any time during follow up. Although a rapid rise in the haematocrit along with thrombocytopenia, is also considered as objective evidence of plasma leakage, as the haematocrit may also change due to dehydration or overhydration, we considered the detection of ascites or a pleural effusion as more objective evidence of plasma leakage. In our cohort, as all patients who developed pleural effusions also invariably had ascites, for analysis of the primary end point, the presence of any ascites was used as an indicator of fluid leakage. We hypothesised that rupatadine would be useful if it reduced plasma leakage from the expected level of 35% to 15% (a 20% difference). As three arms (<italic>k</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) of administration were to be studied and the expected baseline response rate was 15% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.15) with 80 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;80) patients per arm, we have probability 0.99 (<italic>Prob</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.99) of selecting the best treatment method which would reduce plasma leakage rate at 35% (<italic>D</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">The secondary objectives of this study were to assess reduction in complications including liver failure, reduction in the proportion of individuals who developed shock, reduction in the need of the use of colloids, reduction in the need of blood transfusions and a reduction in the duration of the illness.

As 15 patients on rupatadine and 18 patients on the placebo developed some form of fluid leakage (pleural effusions or ascites), only these patients were considered to have entered the critical phase.

Collectively, these data suggested that repurposing rupatadine might be effective in reducing vascular leakage in acute dengue infection.</p><p id="Par19">Rupatadine is a second generation antihistamine as well as having a PAF receptor blockade activity, and has been used for treatment of allergic rhino-conjunctivitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, chronic urticaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, cold urticaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and mastocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Many clinical guidelines recommend using up to four times the standard dose of rupatadine (40&#x02009;mg) in the treatment of chronic urticaria if required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, which was found to be well tolerated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In this phase II clinical trial, we found that rupatadine appeared safe and well tolerated at 10&#x02009;mg and 40&#x02009;mg a day in patients with acute dengue infection. The AE experienced by those on rupatadine were similar to those on the placebo. Although the trial was initially started with 3 arms, the 10&#x02009;mg arm was discontinued as it showed no benefit over the placebo, while the 40&#x02009;mg rupatadine appeared to show some benefit at the interim analysis. The study was conducted among adults, and 71.4% of patients recruited had been ill for at least 4 days. Therefore, most only received one dose of the drug before entering the critical phase, which was typically on day 5 of illness. Although the proportion of those who developed vascular leak (those who developed ascites or pleural effusions) was similar in those on the 40&#x02009;mg arm and the placebo arm, when assessed by day of illness, we observed a &#x0003e;50% reduction in the median of the maximum height of the pleural effusion on day 8. Interestingly, the time taken to enter the critical phase (fluid leakage phase) was significantly longer in those on rupatadine 40&#x02009;mg, which could be due to the reduction in the fluid leakage. For instance, fluid leakage was evaluated by detecting either pleural effusions or ascites, and even though ultra sound scans were used for their detection, small amounts of fluid could go undetected. Although not significant, the post-hoc analysis showed that the occurrence of pleural effusions, ascites and requirement for extra colloids such as dextran, were less in the patients recruited early (&#x02264;3 days of illness) to the rupatadine arm when compared to the placebo arm. The analysis carried out within the rupatadine arm also showed a reduction in the frequency of complications in those who were recruited early (and therefore were given more doses of rupatadine) when compared to those were recruited later, although this was not significant. However, such differences were not seen within the placebo group when comparing those who were recruited earlier vs those who were recruited later. Therefore, although it is possible that those who were given more than one dose of rupatadine (as they were recruited earlier) before developing fluid leakage had fewer complications, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions, due to the small sample size included in the post-hoc analysis.</p><p id="Par20">PAF is released from platelets and many other cells, and has roles in platelet aggregation, and so it is noteworthy that the frequency of haemorrhage was lower in the rupatadine 40&#x02009;mg group compared to placebo. However, since rupatadine also blocks histamine receptors, it would be important to determine whether the effects of rupatadine where due to the blocking of the PAF receptor alone, or whether its antihistamine effects had any benefit, for example through future studies of pure PAFR blockade. Rupatadine has also been shown to inhibit degranulation of mast cells in animal models and inhibit the release of leukotrienes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Since mediators released from mast cells have been shown to contribute to vascular leak in dengue mouse models and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, rupatadine could possibly further contribute to reduction in complications due these additional effects.</p><p id="Par21">Many drug trials have been conducted previously to determine efficacy in acute dengue infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Many of these trials have evaluated the efficacy of antivirals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, while some have investigated immunomodulatory drugs such as steroids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Among the antiviral drugs, chloroquine has shown to significantly reduce the duration of fever and showed a trend towards reduction in the proportion of patients developing DHF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Celgosivir was found to be safe and showed a trend towards reduction in the platelet nadir and trend towards reduction in a rise in the haematocrit in patients with secondary dengue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In a randomised, placebo controlled trial consisting of a high dose and low dose treatment regimens of steroids, the investigators did not find any differences in the virological or clinical endpoints in those in the high dose or low dose treatment arm compared to the placebo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Although these trials assessed the proportion of patients who developed fluid leakage (DHF), they did not carry out ultra sound examinations daily, to quantify the fluid leakage by assessing the development of ascites or pleural effusions. The main reason we quantified daily fluid leakage in our trial was because even if a drug fails to completely prevent fluid leakage, a significant reduction in the amount of leakage will significantly reduce the burden associated with acute dengue infections. Fatalities due to dengue occur due to shock followed by organ dysfunction and severe bleeding, which are complications of severe vascular leakage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, even though a drug may not completely prevent vascular leakage, if a drug can significantly reduce leakage, it would be helpful in reducing fatalities due to dengue.</p><p id="Par22">Limitations of the study included the single blind trial design which was used to enable more rapid detection of safety signals given the known role of PAF in haemostasis, but reasonable attempts were made to minimise bias, such as having distinct teams for recruitment, care and analysis. In addition, the multiple comparisons performed for this study would have limited the power of the statistical analysis. It has been shown that rupatadine was less effective in individuals of Chinese origin due to CYP3A polymorphisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, future trials should incorporate pharmacokinetic assessments. The earliest we could recruit patients was at day 3 of fever, which may miss greater benefits in patients treated earlier still. The advent of bedside NS1 testing in community practice may facilitate earlier diagnosis and recruitment in future trials. Doses above 40&#x02009;mg/day rupatadine were not assessed, and these may offer further therapeutic benefit. The study was not powered to determine effects on mortality (no deaths in any arm as dengue associated mortality rates are &#x0003c;0.02% in Sri Lanka), which would be important to address in future larger trials. Overall, we are encouraged by the use of rupatadine, particularly in early dengue infection, but larger multi-center trials will undoubtedly be important before any changes to clinical practice are advised.</p><p id="Par23">In conclusion, rupatadine was shown to inhibit effects of PAF and acute dengue sera on HUVEC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and to inhibit fluid leakage in a DENV-2 model <italic>in vivo</italic>. Rupatadine 40&#x02009;mg appeared to be safe and well tolerated in patients with acute dengue. We found no direct evidence of benefit in the main endpoints evaluated, but post-hoc analysis revealed small but significant differences in several parameters on individual illness days. A larger clinical trial focused on early enrolment is needed to clarify the significance of these potential signals of efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Determining effect of rupatadine on human endothelial cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="Par24">Human umbilical vein derived endothelial cell lines (HUVEC) were used to determine the effects of rupatadine at a concentration of 500&#x02009;ng/ml in reducing PAF-induced and dengue patient sera-induced effects (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) on expression of tight junction protein-ZO-1 and its effects on trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER). The dengue patient sera were from patients with DHF, who had severe vascular leak (shock). Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Review Committee of University of Sri Jayewardenapura and informed written consent was obtained from all patients. The clinical disease severity was classified according to the 2011 WHO dengue diagnostic criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and accordingly shock was defined as having cold clammy skin, along with a narrowing of pulse pressure of &#x02264;20&#x02009;mmHg.

All pregnant women, those who report reactions to antihistamines or relevant excipients, those who are alcohol dependent or abused drugs or those with previously diagnosed hepatic or renal impairment were also excluded. Those who were using alcohol and narcotics were excluded due to the possible derangements that these substances might have caused at the time of recruitment and therefore, would influence the liver transaminase levels and possible development of acute liver failure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par30">The clinical trial was an investigator-led phase II, randomized controlled study, initially consisting of three arms, which were rupatadine 10&#x02009;mg, rupatadine 40&#x02009;mg and placebo. As safety was a key aspect to the study, and since it is recommended that rupatadine should be used with caution in patients with liver dysfunction, which is a known complication of acute dengue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and due to its potential effects on platelet aggregation in the setting of the thrombocytopenia and since some patients would be on four times the licensed dose of the drug (in allergy) a single-blinded design was used. However, in order to collect unbiased data, the investigators who recruited patients and administered the drug were completely separate from the group of doctors who managed the patients. The medical personnel managing the patients recorded the clinical data, and decided on fluid treatment and when to discharge from hospital and had no knowledge of which drug the patients were given. The investigators who were involved in recruiting and administering drugs, recorded all clinical data from the hospital records and so could detect safety signals early.</p><p id="Par31">An interim analysis was carried out after recruiting half of the number of patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;120). At the interim analysis, it was found that 40&#x02009;mg rupatadine was safe in acute dengue, and that 10&#x02009;mg of rupatadine did not seem to show any benefit when compared to the placebo, and so the rupatadine 10&#x02009;mg arm was discontinued (supplementary data). 63 further patients were recruited following informed written consent for the remaining two arms. Details regarding the trial protocol are available as Supplementary Appendix 1. We have adhered to the CONSORT guidelines for publication when analysing and reporting our data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. An independent drug safety monitoring board (DSMB), which consisted of an experienced biostatistician, a clinical pharmacologist and two professors of medicine in two other universities, assessed the safety outcomes, overall study integrity and also advised on protocol amendments.

Those on 10&#x02009;mg of rupatadine received one tablet of 10&#x02009;mg rupatadine and three tablets of the placebo.

Up to 5 days since the day of recruitment (median day 4 since onset of illness) was felt to be an appropriate length of follow-up as this is standard medical practice in Sri Lanka and we wished the study findings to be valid for such a setting. The patients had completely recovered at the time of discharge (median day 9 since onset of illness). At the point of discharge, no further data were obtained from the research participants, and no carry forward of existing data was used. The haematocrit and platelet counts were assessed several times a day and the liver transaminases and ultrasound scans were done daily. Details of assessment of the extent of fluid leakage (presence of ascites and pleural effusions) are described in Supplementary Appendix 1.

In order to determine if rupatadine prevented fluid leakage, we assessed if there was a reduction in the proportion of individuals who developed fluid leakage (those who developed pleural effusions or ascites) in the treatment arm compared to the placebo. However, as all patients who had pleural effusions, invariably also had some degree of ascites, the presence of ascites was used for analysis of fluid leakage, when evaluating the primary end point. Although a rise in the haematocrit of &#x0003e;20% of the baseline value, along with a drop in the platelet count is also considered as objective evidence of fluid leakage, we did not consider the changes in the haematocrit for the analysis of the extent of fluid leakage, as the haematocrit varies with dehydration and overhydration. As we also wished to assess if rupatadine, reduced the extent of leakage, the quantity of pleural effusion or ascites, were measured in whom fluid was detected in pleural or peritoneal cavities. For evaluation of reduction in the pleural fluid leakage, the maximum height of the pleural effusion was assessed daily in all patients, throughout the course of the illness. The maximal distance between mid-height of the diaphragm and visceral pleura was measured in millimeters. We assessed the median of the maximum height of the pleural effusion observed in those on the placebo and evaluated if there was more than 50% reduction in the median of the maximum height of the pleural effusion observed during the illness, in those who were on rupatadine. The degree of pleural effusion is a known measure used to assess dengue disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The quantity of ascites was assessed by semi-quantitatively by looking for the presence of fluid in five areas of the abdomen namely RUQ (perihepatic and Morrison&#x02019;s pouch), LUQ (perisplenic), right paracolic gutter, left paracolic gutter and pelvis. Specific primary endpoints were a reduction in the proportion of individuals who were treated with rupatadine who develop fluid leakage; and reduction in fluid leakage by 50% or more in those who were treated with rupatadine. As all patients who had pleural effusions, invariably also had some degree of ascites, the presence of ascites was used for analysis of fluid leakage, when evaluating the primary end point.</p><p id="Par38">The secondary objectives of this study were to assess reduction in complications including liver failure, reduction in the proportion of individuals who developed shock, reduction in the need of the use of colloids, reduction in the need of blood transfusions and a reduction in the duration of the illness. Details of definitions used for acute liver failure, shock and duration of illness are given in Supplementary information. The secondary outcomes were analysed by assessing the differences in the proportion of individuals on rupatadine vs placebo who developed liver failure, shock, the proportion who needed less colloids than the amount allocated initially and the need for blood transfusions. The reduction in the duration of illness was assessed by the differences in the mean duration of illness in those on the placebo compared to rupatadine. The first day of illness was defined as the day in which the patient developed fever and the day of recovery was defined as the patient being afebrile for 24&#x02009;hours, the platelet counts rising to &#x0003e;50,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or a rise of 20% from the lowest platelet value, and the return of the haematocrit to the patient&#x02019;s baseline.

According to this calculation, it was predicted that a sample size of 130 patients, 65 in each arm (rupatadine 40&#x02009;mg and the placebo), was sufficient to detect a clinically important difference of 20% between groups in reducing plasma leakage.</p><p id="Par40">Statistical analysis was performed using Graph PRISM version 6 and non-parametric statistical tests were used.

Corrections for multiple comparisons were done using Holm-Sidak method and the statistical significant value was set at 0.05 (alpha). Longitudinal analyses were undertaken using 2-way repeated measures ANOVA.
