A total of 106 selected infertile male patients with bacteriologically cured chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were randomly prescribed rifaximin (200 mg, 2 tablets bid, for 7 days monthly for 12 months) and probiotic containing multiple strains VSL#3 (450 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> CFU per day) or no treatment. Ninety-five of them (89.6%) complied with the therapeutic plan and were included in this study. Group A = &#x0201c;6Tx/6-&#x0201d;: treatment for the initial 6 and no treatment for the following 6 months (<italic>n</italic> = 26); Group B = &#x0201c;12Tx&#x0201d;: 12 months of treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 22); Group C = &#x0201c;6-/6Tx&#x0201d;: no treatment for the initial 6 months and treatment in the last 6 months (<italic>n</italic> = 23); Group D = &#x0201c;12-&#x0201d;: no treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 24). The patients of Groups A = &#x0201c;6Tx/6-&#x0201d; and B = &#x0201c;12Tx&#x0201d; had the highest frequency of chronic prostatitis (88.5% and 86.4%, respectively). In contrast, group &#x0201c;12-&#x0201d;: patients had the lowest frequency of prostatitis (33.4%). The progression of prostatitis into PV in groups &#x0201c;6Tx/6-&#x0201d; (15.5%) and &#x0201c;6-/6Tx&#x0201d; (13.6%) was lower than that found in the patients of group &#x0201c;12-&#x0201d; (45.8%). Finally, no patient of groups &#x0201c;6Tx/6-&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;6-/6Tx&#x0201d; had PVE, whereas it was diagnosed in 20.8% of group &#x0201c;12-&#x0201d; patients. Long-term treatment with rifaximin and the probiotic VSL#3 is effective in lowering the progression of prostatitis into more complicated forms of male accessory gland infections in infertile patients with bacteriologically cured CBP plus IBS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chronic bacterial prostatitis</kwd><kwd>irritable bowel syndrome</kwd><kwd>probiotic VSL#3</kwd><kwd>prostate-vesiculitis</kwd><kwd>prostate-vesiculo-epididymitis</kwd><kwd>rifaximin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chronic prostatitis, the true cause of many cases of cystitis and urethritis, is commonly diagnosed in a community setting and affects approximately 1 in 22 men.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In particular, chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) has symptoms in a continuous evolution, but it can also slowly evolve into more complicated forms without or with limited symptoms. CBP maintains a condition of lower urinary tract infection and triggers multiple disorders (high-pressure voiding, &#x0201c;intra-prostatic reflux&#x0201d; of urine, bladder neck sclerosis or obstruction, urethral stricture, detrusor sphincter dyssynergia and dysfunctional voiding)<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> with shifted retrocanalicular pathogen spread into the seminal tract, which can cause recurrent chronic vesiculitis and epididymitis. Thus, CBP can lead to infertility by damaging the ejaculatory ducts and/or causing vesiculitis and epididymitis, which may be regarded as intermediate or fully extended forms of male accessory gland infections (MAGI), respectively.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>To prevent the postinfectious complication of chronic prostatitis into prostate-vesiculitis (PV) or prostate-vesiculo-epididymitis (PVE), more careful control of the predisposing factors strongly associated with prostatitis is needed.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Along with urological causes (anatomical urogenital tract abnormalities, history of sexually transmitted diseases, sexual behavior, and history of mechanical trauma to the lower pelvis area), prostatitis has been reported with a higher frequency in association with nonurological conditions, such as gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, compromised immune system due to other chronic illnesses, and/or medications, and certain psychiatric conditions (anxiety and mood disorders).<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Among the predisposing GI disorders leading to prostatitis, a growing role is attributed to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a symptom complex in the absence of any biochemical or pathological structural abnormalities diagnosed on the basis of the Rome III criteria.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Similar to another study,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> recently, we observed the simultaneous presence of prostatitis syndromes and IBS in 30.2% and 31.8% of patients screened by andrologists and gastroenterologists, respectively.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These patients also had an increased prevalence of CBP and noninflammatory prostatitis.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Furthermore, we found that patients with CBP and IBS had a significantly higher frequency (82%) of MAGI compared with patients with CBP alone.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Although the pathophysiology of IBS is complex and multifactorial, patients with CBP and IBS represent a clinical model of mechanisms underlying both these conditions. These include primitive pathogenetic factor (intestinal dysbiosis) or secondary pathogenetic mechanisms due to modified commensal gut flora related to antibiotic therapy for treatment of CBP, which in turn may lead to mucosal inflammation. The comprehension of the interaction between the dysbiotic microbiota and the host will probably lead to the development of a more integrated multidisciplinary treatment.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Accordingly, probiotics are among the pharmacological agents approved for the treatment of IBS, although their clinical efficacy on IBS is still controversial.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Indeed, 34 out of 42 trials examining lactic acid bacteria (LAB) effectiveness in patients with IBS showed beneficial effects in at least one of the endpoints or symptoms examined<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> or an association with the stabilization of intestinal microbiota.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In contrast, two other studies with LAB did not report any benefit.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Controversies on effectiveness of probiotics in patients with IBS may be in part explained by an imbalance between commensal and pathogen bacteria inhabiting the human gut. This may cause a small intestine overgrowth of the intestinal commensal microflora and/or a relative overgrowth of pathogen enterobacteria. In a recent pilot study, treatment with rifaximin (550 mg 3 times daily for 10 days), a gut-directed antibiotic, was found efficacious in reducing both GI score and symptoms in patients with chronic prostatitis type III and IBS.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Therefore, we thought to contribute to this topic with this study conducted on infertile patients with clinical history of CBP and IBS bacteriologically cured after 1&#x02013;3 intermittent courses of antibiotics and/or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory (NSAI) compounds, to evaluate the influence of treatment with rifaximin and the probiotic combination VSL#3 on the progression of chronic prostatitis into PV or PVE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Patient selection</title><p>During the period of year between January 2011 and January 2013, 106 selected infertile male outpatients (median age: 31 years, range: 19&#x02013;46 years), consecutively recruited from the Andrology and Endocrinology Unit Clinic, Policlinic University of Catania (Catania, Italy), with a confirmed diagnosis of CBP and IBS (Rome III criteria) were enrolled in this study.

At the moment when the diagnoses of CBP and IBS were made, all patients had an increased number of leukocytes (&#x0003e;10 HPF) in the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) and a positive sperm culture (with CFU &#x0003e; 10<sup>5</sup> ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

Then they were randomly prescribed a nonabsorbable antibiotic and probiotics or no treatment until the next checkup. When the patients returned for the subsequent follow-up visit, a complete gastroenterological and andrological history was once again taken and a physical examination was performed. Each of the 95 patients enrolled, including the 6 who had become fertile, underwent didymo-epididymal and prostate-vesicular transrectal ultrasound scans and sperm culture.</p><p>We defined CBP and progression into PV or PVE, when these patients, during the 6- and 12-month follow-up visits, fulfilled the following conditions:</p><p>

This CBP was a localized prostatic infection since it was characterized by the absence of ultrasound signs considered indicative of progression, in terms of extension into more sexual accessory glands (seminal vesicles and epididymites).

Two separate placebo-controlled studies reported improvement in bloating, flatulence, and colonic transit in response to the probiotic cocktail VSL#3, which comprises eight different bacterial strains including <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic>.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> An increase in the peripheral antiinflammatory (IL-10) and pro-inflammatory (IL-12) cytokine ratio was associated with probiotic administration and symptom improvement.<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In contrast, two other studies with <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> did not report any benefit.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>In this study, performed on a selected group of patients with a clinical history positive for IBS and CBP cured with antibiotics and resulting in a bacteriological eradication, we evaluated the protective role of long-term treatment with rifaximin and VSL#3 on the evolution of prostatitis toward more complicated forms of MAGI. In these patients, the therapeutic rationale was to achieve a better balance of the intestinal microflora to interrupt the mechanism (s) able to involve, in the long run, also the seminal vesicles and the epididymis.</p><p>Patients evaluated after 6 or 12 months of treatment with rifaximin and VSL#3 (groups &#x0201c;6Tx/6-&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;12Tx&#x0201d;) had the highest frequency of prostatitis: 88.5% and 86.4%, respectively. In contrast, patients of group &#x0201c;12-&#x0201d; evaluated after 12 months of no treatment had the lowest (33.4%) frequency of stable prostatitis. Therefore, the deterioration of prostatitis in PV patients belonging to group &#x0201c;6Tx/6-&#x0201d; (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and &#x0201c;6-/6Tx&#x0201d; (<italic>n</italic> = 3) is less in those patients (<italic>n</italic> = 12) belonging to group &#x0201c;12-&#x0201d;. Finally, the deterioration in PVE, which are the most extensive pathologies of the MAGI, was present in the five patients who did not receive any therapy, whereas it was zero in the groups of patients who were prescribed rifaximin and VSL#3 for the initial 6 or for 12 months. The early initiation of this therapeutic strategy was more effective, resulting in a nonsignificant progression of prostatitis into PV or PVE in the last 6 months when the patients were not treated. Conversely, a delay of 6 months in the prescription of the treatment resulted in a significant higher frequency of both PV and PVE.</p><p>The rate of progression in more extended clinical forms of MAGI was found to be the highest in patients with no treatment (group &#x0201c;12-&#x0201d;), intermediate in patients prescribed a late treatment (group &#x0201c;6-/6Tx&#x0201d;) relatively low in patients who were treated in the first 6 months of this study (group &#x0201c;6Tx/6-), and the lowest in patients treated for 12 months (group &#x0201c;12Tx&#x0201d;). This paralleled the presence of a significant bacterial growth in the seminal fluid (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref></bold>). Although the causes of IBS remain undefined, some evidence suggests that symptoms are secondary to bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine.<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This condition is likely to favor the onset of CBP and the progression of this uncomplicated form of MAGI into more extended ones, hence with a greater negative impact on sperm parameters.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, rifaximin proved to be more effective than placebo for global symptoms and bloating in IBS patients without constipation,<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> but the exact mechanisms of action remain to be determined. The present study did not clarify whether the clinical benefits of rifaximin and VSL#3 administration result from a reduction/modification and/or new equilibrium of the intestinal colonic flora. We hypothesize the following potential explanations: (1) the effect of rifaximin, by affecting gut Gram-negative or Gram-positive enteropathogen bacteria, could reduce the bacterial products that negatively affect the host and might alter mucosal immune activation of the host;<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> (2) the addition of the probiotic complex VSL#3, which is a mixture of eight different species of Gram-positive bacteria, could shift the balance in favor of commensal gut bacteria; (3) in a subset of IBS patients exists a potential dysregulation in energy homeostasis (serum glucose) and liver function (serum tyrosine) that may be improved by probiotics supplementation, as suggested by a recent metabolomic study.<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>The results of this study as they are preliminary and concluding remarks are awaiting confirmation from a larger case series, suggest that the administration of rifaximin and probiotics may represent an example of alternative treatment options in Andrology,<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> such as in patients with prostatitis syndromes and IBS. The results of this study suggest that the treatment should be prescribed immediately after eradication of the microbial component of CBP.</p><p>Although 12 months treatment of rifaximin and probiotics for patients with chronic prostatitis for the patients with bacteriologically cured CBP with antibiotics is not routine method and mainstream protocol, this regimen may represent an example of alternative treatment options in patients with chronic prostatitis and IBS, especially for the patients with reproductive demanding. In these patients, the strong inflammatory component expressed by high number of white blood cells in EPS as well as the radical oxygen species overproduction, mainly susceptible in patients with extended infection into seminal vesicles and epididymides,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> might be counterbalanced and or prevented by antiinflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of probiotics recently demonstrated in critically ill-patients.<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>This therapeutic strategy seems more suitable to prevent the infection of the seminal vesicles by contrasting one or more of four routes potentially involved in the pathogenesis of vesiculitis: by ascending the genito-urinary tract, by descending from the upper urinary or reproductive tract, by hematogenous spread, or by direct invasion of the glands from local sources. We believe that the clinical model of CBP and IBS, and particularly the condition of chronic prostatitis with recent microbial eradication is useful for future research aimed at defining the role of probiotics in other diagnostic categories such as evolution or progression of CBP into chronic inflammatory prostatitis.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>EV and SLV are the principal investigators.
