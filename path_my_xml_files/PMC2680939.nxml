The role of NMDA neurotransmission in the regulation of PPI is unclear, due to cross-species differences in the effects of NMDA antagonists on PPI. Recent reports suggest that drug effects on PPI differ in subgroups of normal humans that differ in levels of baseline PPI or specific personality domains; here, we tested the effects of these variables on the sensitivity of PPI to the NMDA antagonist, memantine.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P2">PPI was measured in male Sprague-Dawley rats, after treatment with memantine (0, 10 or 20 mg/kg, sc). Baseline PPI was then measured in 37 healthy adult men. Next, subjects were tested twice, in a double-blind crossover design, comparing either: 1) placebo vs. 20 mg of the NMDA antagonist memantine (n=19), or 2) placebo vs. 30 mg memantine (n=18). Tests included measures of acoustic startle amplitude, PPI, autonomic indices and subjective self-rating scales.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><p id="P3">Memantine had dose- and interval-dependent effects on PPI in rats: compared to vehicle, 10 mg/kg increased short-interval (10-20 ms) PPI, and 20 mg/kg decreased long-interval (120 ms) PPI. In humans, memantine caused dose-dependent effects on psychological and somatic measures: 20 mg was associated with increased ratings of happiness, and 30 mg was associated with increased ratings of dizziness. PPI at the 120 ms prepulse interval was increased by 20 mg but not 30 mg of memantine. Subgroups most sensitive to the PPI-enhancing effects of memantine were those with low baseline PPI, or with personality scale scores suggestive of high novelty seeking, high sensation seeking, or high disinhibition.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P4">NMDA blockade with memantine appears to have dose- and interval-dependent effects on sensorimotor gating in rats and humans, particularly among specific subgroups of normal human subjects. These findings are discussed as they relate to consistencies across other studies in humans, as well as apparent inconsistencies in the NMDA regulation of PPI across species.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>memantine</kwd><kwd>glutamate</kwd><kwd>prepulse inhibition</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor gating</kwd><kwd>startle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S5"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">Startle can be reduced when the startling stimulus is preceded by a weak non-startling prepulse (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Ison <italic>et al.</italic>, 1971</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Graham 1975</xref>), in a process called prepulse inhibition (PPI). The degree to which the weak sensory prepulse inhibits the motor reflex in PPI is used as a measure of sensorimotor gating. PPI is disrupted in specific neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (Braff et al. 1978, cf. <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Braff et al. 2001</xref>), Tourette syndrome (Castellanos et al. 1996), obsessive compulsive disorder (Swerdlow <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Hoenig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), Huntington's disease (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Swerdlow <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>) and Fragile X Syndrome (Frankland et al. 2004).</p><p id="P6">To clarify the pathophysiology of deficient sensorimotor gating in these disorders, one strategy has been to investigate the effects of pharmacological manipulations on PPI in normal human and animal models. For example, many studies document the PPI-disruptive effects of dopamine (DA) agonists on PPI in rodents and normal humans (Mansbach et al. 1988; Hutchison &#x00026; Swift 1999; cf. Swerdlow et al. 2008). Even within this apparently consistent literature, there is clear evidence of cross-species differences. For example, the DAergic regulation of PPI may involve different DA receptor subtypes in rats vs. mice (Ralph &#x00026; Caine 2005). Furthermore, in normal humans, the effects of DAergic manipulations on PPI may differ across subgroups characterized by low vs. high baseline PPI levels (Swerdlow et al. 2003b, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bitsios et al. 2005</xref>), and/or distinct personality dimensions (Hutchison et al. 1999; Swerdlow et al. 2006).</p><p id="P7">Perhaps even more profound cross-species differences have been identified in the NMDA regulation of PPI. In rats, PPI is reduced by non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists, such as dizoclipine, ketamine and phencyclidine. (Mansbach &#x00026; Geyer, 1989; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Mansbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991a</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Martinez et al. 1999, 2000). However, in healthy humans, ketamine has been shown to have either an <italic>increase</italic> of PPI at short prepulse intervals (30 ms (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Duncan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Abel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), or have no significant effect on PPI (van Berkel et al. 1998). A similar PPI-enhancing effect was reported by <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Swerdlow et al. (2002)</xref> in normal subjects administered the mixed NMDA antagonist / dopamine agonist, amantadine.</p><p id="P8">To better understand the role of NMDA neurotransmission in the normal regulation of PPI in humans, we tested the effects of the low- to moderate affinity NMDA-receptor antagonist <italic>memantine</italic> on PPI. Memantine was chosen because it is well tolerated (compared to ketamine), has linear kinetics, 100% bioavailability after oral administration and relative NMDA-receptor selectivity (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Wilcock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; Aerosa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Cummings 2004</xref>). Memantine does not cause sensory or dissociative symptoms like those reported in past PPI studies with ketamine (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Duncan et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Abel et al. 2003</xref>), and which might potentially complicate the interpretation of changes in PPI. Wiley et al. (2002) reported that, in rats, memantine produced a dose-dependent reduction in PPI, using 100 ms prepulse intervals; initial studies here were designed to extend these studies of memantine in rats, across the range of prepulse intervals (10-120 ms) with which PPI was measured in humans. Studies next examined the effects of two doses of memantine (20 and 30 mg) on PPI in normal men. Based on several reports with DA agonists, this study also assessed the possible relationship between baseline PPI levels, normal personality dimensions, and sensitivity to the effects of memantine on PPI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S6"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="P9">The methods used in this study were approved by the UCSD Human Subject Institutional Review Board (human studies) or were in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23) and approved by the UCSD Animal Subjects Committee (protocol #S01221 (rodent studies).</p><sec id="S7"><title>Rodent pilot testing</title><p id="P10">To confirm and extend findings of PPI-disruptive effects of memantine in rats (Wiley et al, 2002), adult male SD (n = 13) rats (225-250 g; Harlan Laboratories, San Diego, CA) were housed in groups of 2-3 animals per cage, and maintained on a reversed light/dark schedule with water and food available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Rats were handled within 2 d of arrival. Testing occurred during the dark phase. Memantine HCl was dissolved in saline vehicle and administered subcutaneously in doses of 0, 10 or 20 mg/kg (comparable to Wiley et al. (2002)). Startle chambers (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA, USA) were housed in a sound-attenuated room, and consisted of a Plexiglas cylinder 8.2 cm in diameter resting on a 12.5 &#x000d7; 25.5 cm Plexiglas frame within a ventilated enclosure. Noise bursts were presented via a speaker mounted 24 cm above the cylinder. A piezoelectric accelerometer mounted below the Plexiglas frame detected and transduced motion from within the cylinder. Stimulus delivery was controlled by the SR-LAB microcomputer and interface assembly, which also digitized (0-4095), rectified, and recorded stabilimeter readings. One hundred 1-ms readings were collected beginning at stimulus onset. Startle amplitude was defined as the average of the 100 readings.</p><p id="P11">Approximately 7 days after shipment arrival, rats were exposed to a short &#x0201c;matching&#x0201d; startle session. They were placed in the startle chambers for a 5 min acclimation period with a 70 dB(A) background noise, and then exposed to a total of 17 P-ALONE trails (40 ms - 120 dB(A) noise bursts) that were interspersed with 3 PP12dB+P-ALONE trials (P-ALONE preceded 100 ms (onset-to-onset) by a 20 ms noise burst of 12dB above background). Rats were assigned to dose groups based on average %PPI from the matching session to ensure similar baseline PPI levels between groups. Four days later, rats were injected with memantine (0, 10 or 20 mg/kg), and 30 min later were placed in the startle chambers for a 5 min acclimation period with a 70 dB(A) background noise. They were then exposed to a series of trial types which were presented in pseudorandom order: (1) P-ALONE (40 ms, 120 dB(A) noise burst); or P-ALONE preceded 10, 20, 30, 60 or 120 ms (onset-to-onset) by a 5 ms noise 15 dB over background. Interspersed between these trials were trials in which no stimulus was presented, but cage displacement was measured (NOSTIM trials). The session began and ended with 3 consecutive P-ALONE trials; between these trials were 6 presentations of each trial type, in pseudo-random order. Intertrial intervals were variable and averaged 15 s. NOSTIM trials were not included in the calculation of inter-trial intervals. Total session duration was 15.5 min.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="subjects"><title>Human Participants</title><p id="P12">A total of 40 healthy right-handed male healthy volunteers participated in the study.

During the screening, subjects also completed several questionnaires related to ethnicity, sexual preference, smoking and caffeine consumption. Personality traits were quantified using the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Cloninger 1991</xref>) and the Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS) (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Zuckerman et al 1974</xref>).</p><p id="P14">For measures of acoustic startle and PPI, Ag/AgCl electrodes (Sensor Medics) were positioned over and lateral to the obicularis oculi underneath both eyes. A ground electrode was placed behind the left ear (R&#x0003c;10 k&#x003a9;). Eyeblink magnitude was measured using EMG recordings (San Diego Instruments). EMG activity was band-pass filtered (1 &#x02013; 1000 Hz) and 60 Hz notch filtered, digitized, and 250 1 ms readings were recorded starting at startle stimulus onset (1.22 &#x003bc;V/unit). The startle test started with 3 minutes of 70 dB(A) white noise, which persisted as a background noise during the test session. During acclimation, blinks were counted by trained observers using a Radio Shack Security Camera and monitor (Inter-observer R = 0.97). The startle-session consisted of 42 trials, with six conditions: a 118 dB(A) 40 ms white noise burst (pulse alone) and the same burst preceded 10, 20, 30, 60, 120 ms by a prepulse of 16 dB above background. To measure startle habituation, three pulse alone trials were presented at the session beginning and end. The variable inter-trial interval averaged 15 s (range 10-20 s). Total test time was 15 minutes.</p><p id="P15">Participants who met study inclusion criteria returned for testing after 6-10 days, and for a second day one week later. Testing was performed double-blind and drug order was randomized. Prior to the test days, subjects were instructed to maintain their normal patterns of caffeine intake prior to the testing, based on the effects of caffeine withdrawal on PPI and subjective rating scales. (Swerdlow <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000). After arrival at 0830 hours on the test day, subjects were given a standardized breakfast, followed by a urine toxicology test and a hearing test. At 0900 hours, either memantine hydrochloride (20 or 30 mg) or placebo was administered. For the first 20 subjects, the active dose of memantine hydrochloride was 20 mg. For the next 20 subjects, the active dose of memantine hydrochloride was 30 mg. Heart rate was measured manually and blood pressure was measured by brachial cuff. Symptom rating scales (SRS) were assessed 30, 90, 150, 200 and 230 min after pill consumption. This SRS is a visual analog scale used to assess the physical and emotional states of the subjects during testing. Each symptom was rated on a piece of paper, using a 100 mm line to separate extreme ratings (&#x02018;not true&#x02019; versus &#x02018;true&#x02019;). The subjects rated emotional state (&#x0201c;happy&#x0201d;), somatic symptoms (&#x0201c;queasy&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;dizzy&#x0201d;) and consciousness (&#x0201c;drowsy&#x0201d;). The marks were manually measured by observers who were blind to the drug condition. At 1130 hours, the subjects received a standardized lunch. Startle testing began 210 minutes after pill administration, based on the reported pharmacokinetics of memantine in normal humans (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Sonkusare <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), using a test session identical to that used the screening-day. Additional psychophysiological measures were completed after this startle test, which will be analyzed separately.</p><p id="P16">The primary dependent measures for rodent and human studies were startle magnitude and PPI. PPI was defined as (100- (100 &#x000d7; magnitude on prepulse trial/ magnitude on pulse alone trials)). Planned comparisons utilized drug and prepulse interval as within-subject factors, with separate analyses completed for the 20 mg and 30 mg doses of memantine in humans. Additional planned comparisons in humans analyzed the impact of baseline (screening) PPI levels and specific personality measures (novelty seeking based on the total NS score from the TPQ, and sensation seeking, based on the total SSS score) on memantine PPI effects. These analyses utilized categorical factors (&#x0201c;low&#x0201d; vs. &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; based on median splits) within ANOVAs, and continuous comparisons within regression analyses. Self-rating scales and autonomic measures at baseline (prior to pill administration) and immediately prior to startle testing were treated as continuous variables and analyzed by ANOVA as &#x0201c;change scores&#x0201d; (difference from baseline). Alpha was 0.05. Additional exploratory analyses were conducted, with alpha corrected for multiple comparisons. When average startle magnitude was &#x0003c;10 units during testing, subjects were excluded as &#x0201c;non-responders&#x0201d;; this resulted in the exclusion of one subject in the 20 mg memantine sample and two subjects in the 30 mg memantine sample.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S9"><title>Results</title><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Rodent Pilot Study</title><p id="P17">Memantine caused a dose-dependent reduction in PPI for 60-120 ms prepulse intervals, confirming findings of Wiley et al.

Because different studies have used slightly different definitions of &#x0201c;baseline PPI&#x0201d;, we examined this relationship in a number of ways. For example, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bitsios et al. (2005)</xref> distinguished &#x0201c;low vs. high gating&#x0201d; subgroups based on mean screening PPI for 80 ms prepulse intervals. Because no 80 ms interval condition was included in this study, we used a similar approach, based on the averaged screening values for 60 and 120 ms prepulse intervals. Csomor et al. (2008) stratified subjects based on vehicle-PPI levels for 60 ms prepulse intervals, while we (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Swerdlow et al. 2002</xref>) had previously stratified subjects based on mean screening PPI values across 10-120 ms prepulse intervals.

Importantly, these scores were inter-related: NS scores correlated significantly with SSS scores (R = 0.64, p&#x0003c;0.004) but not DIS scores (R = 0.17, ns), and total SSS scores correlated significantly with scores on its DIS subscale (R = 0.49, p&#x0003c;0.035) (in contrast, HA scores did not correlate significantly with any of these scales). Subgroups were formed based on median splits of NS and SSS scales and the DIS subscale. We first examined the effect described above for the inclusive group of subjects tested with 20 mg memantine: a drug-induced increase in PPI at the 120 ms prepulse interval. Separate ANOVAs demonstrated that this effect was evident in subgroups with the highest scores in novelty seeking (F=5.54, df 1,8, p&#x0003c;0.05), sensation seeking (F=13.50, df 1,9, p&#x0003c;0.006) and disinhibition (F=7.75, df 1,8, p&#x0003c;0.025), but not in subgroups with the lowest scores in these domains (F's = 1.40, &#x0003c;1 and &#x0003c;1, respectively). Looking beyond the 120 ms interval, DIS scores significantly predicted the overall impact of 20 mg memantine on PPI: ANOVA revealed a significant interaction of dose &#x000d7; DIS group (F=12.31, df 1,17, p&#x0003c;0.003); a separate ANOVA in the high DIS subgroup revealed PPI-enhancing effects of memantine at all prepulse intervals (main effect of dose, F=6.90, df 1,8, p&#x0003c;0.035), while a separate ANOVA in the low DIS group revealed significant PPI-<italic>reducing</italic> effects of memantine (F=5.38, df 1,9, p&#x0003c;0.05) that were most prominent at the short prepulse intervals (dose &#x000d7; interval interaction: F=3.28, df 4,36, p&#x0003c;0.025). As a result, DIS scores correlated significantly with the impact of memantine on PPI (calculated by the difference score (memantine minus placebo) for mean %PPI across all intervals) (Rs = 0.63, p &#x0003c; 0.009). Importantly, only the effects of memantine on PPI, and not baseline PPI levels per se, or post-placebo or -memantine levels of startle magnitude, differed among subgroups with low vs. high NS, SSS or DIS scores.</p><p id="P28">Similar analyses using data from the 30 mg memantine trial revealed no significant differences in memantine effects among subgroups with low vs. high scores on NS, SSS or DIS scales.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">The main aim of this study was to assess the effects memantine on PPI, psychological, and somatic measures in clinically normal men. Initial pilot data obtained in rodents confirmed previous reports of memantine's PPI-disruptive effects at longer prepulse intervals (Wiley et al. 2002), but also detected PPI-enhancing properties of memantine at short prepulse intervals, at a moderate dose of memantine, i.e. one that caused a sub-maximal disruption at long intervals. Thus, even with a cursory assessment, animal data suggested both dose- and interval-dependent effects of memantine on PPI, generally consistent with those previously observed with ketamine (Mansbach &#x00026; Geyer, 1989).</p><p id="P30">In humans, we detected evidence for bioactivity of both doses of memantine at the time of startle testing: 20 mg increased ratings of happiness and reduced spontaneous blink rate, while 30 mg increased ratings of dizziness. Interestingly, these drug effects did not overlap across doses: 30 mg memantine did not change &#x0201c;happiness&#x0201d; ratings, and while 20 mg memantine may have generated some mild dizziness (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) and 30 mg memantine may have slightly slowed spontaneous blinking (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), neither of these effects approached statistical significance. In fact, beyond changes in happiness and blink rate (20 mg) and dizziness (30 mg), there were no significant drug effects on drowsiness, queasiness, autonomic measures, startle magnitude or startle habituation.</p><p id="P31">These findings (and lack thereof) with subjective measures are in line with effects of memantine reported in the literature. These drug effects on happiness, blink rate (20 mg memantine) and dizziness (30 mg memantine) were detected at a time-point corresponding to peak memantine blood levels (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Sonkusare <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Euphoric effects were reported after 40 mg memantine in adults with a history of methamphetamine abuse, and in patients with Alzheimer's disease (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hart <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; cf. Aerosa Sastre <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005). Dizziness is one of the most common side-effects of memantine in clinical trials (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Wilcock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>, cf. <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Kumar 2004</xref>). Changes in blink rate are often viewed as a marker of central dopaminergic tone (Karson 1983); in our experience, however, this association can be complicated by levels of drowsiness (that can increase blink rates) or alertness (that can decrease blink rates).</p><p id="P32">Generally consistent with previous reports with NMDA antagonists such as ketamine (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Duncan et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Abel et al. 2003</xref>) and amantadine (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Swerdlow et al. 2002</xref> (but see <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bitsios et al. 2005</xref>)), 20 mg memantine significantly increased PPI at the 120 ms prepulse interval. In previous reports, ketamine effects on PPI were either short-lived (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Duncan et al. 2001</xref>), or accompanied by reduced startle magnitude (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Abel et al. 2003</xref>). <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Abel et al. (2003)</xref> detected these PPI-enhancing effects of ketamine at both 30 and 120 ms prepulse intervals. Notably, the temporal pattern of memantine effects on PPI in humans contrasts sharply with that detected in rats: where humans exhibit maximal PPI-enhancement (120 ms intervals), rats exhibit maximal PPI-disruption; where rats exhibit maximal PPI-enhancement (10-20 ms intervals), humans exhibit a trend towards PPI disruption.</p><p id="P33">Based on recent reports of differential drug effects on PPI between individuals with low vs. high baseline PPI levels, we conducted separate analyses of 20 mg memantine effects on PPI in low vs. high &#x0201c;gating&#x0201d; subgroups. Memantine-induced increases in PPI were evident only in subjects ranked in the lowest 50% for baseline PPI; in this group, PPI-enhancing effects were apparent across the 10-120 ms range of prepulse intervals, but remained most robust at the 120 ms interval. In contrast, among &#x0201c;high gating&#x0201d; subjects, no PPI-enhancing effects of memantine were detected, and the opposite trend - decreased PPI - was apparent at short prepulse intervals.</p><p id="P34">These patterns of PPI-enhancement only in &#x0201c;low gating&#x0201d; subjects cannot be easily ascribed to a simple &#x0201c;regression to the mean&#x0201d; of PPI levels. PPI (particularly at 60-120 ms intervals), has very high test-retest reliability, exceeding 0.80 over periods as long as one year (Cadenhead et al. 1999; Light et al. 2007). This makes it very unlikely that PPI levels would systematically fluctuate between &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; PPI levels across tests. More evidence that memantine's PPI-enhancing effects do not simply reflect an arithmetic consequence of low baseline PPI was seen when subgroups were formed based on specific personality domains. These subgroups did not differ significantly in baseline PPI, and yet PPI-enhancing effects of memantine at 120 ms prepulse intervals were detected only in subjects with the highest novelty seeking, sensation seeking or disinhibition scores.</p><p id="P35">Low vs. high gating, and low vs. high DIS, subgroups differ not only in the &#x0201c;direction&#x0201d; of memantine effects on PPI, but also in the prepulse intervals most sensitive to these effects. For example, while high DIS subjects exhibited PPI-enhancing effects of memantine across all prepulse intervals, low DIS subjects exhibited significant PPI-reducing effects of memantine only at the short prepulse intervals; a similar pattern characterized low vs. high gating subgroups, respectively. In preclinical studies, short and long PPI intervals have been shown to be differentially sensitive to drug effects; indeed, this was the case in the present pilot study: short-interval PPI was increased by 10 mg/kg memantine, while at long PPI intervals, memantine produced only dose-dependent PPI-reducing effects. Some findings suggest differential neurochemical substrates regulating drug effects on short- and long-interval PPI, e.g. a prominent role of D1-like systems in regulating short interval PPI, and D2-like systems in regulating long interval PPI (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Swerdlow et al. 2004</xref>). At a psychological level, short interval PPI is linked to substrates regulating more automatic, preconscious inhibition, while long interval PPI is linked to more volitional, consciously controlled inhibition (cf. Swerdlow et al. 2008). Conceivably, individuals distinguished by low vs. high DIS scores, or high vs. low baseline PPI, might be differentially sensitive to short vs. long interval PPI effects based on intrinsic differences in both these neurochemical and/or psychological substrates.</p><p id="P36">Perhaps most striking is the fact that no significant changes in PPI were evident after 30 mg memantine, regardless of baseline PPI levels, or scores on NS, SSS or DIS scales. Two parsimonious explanations for differences in memantine dose effects are: 1) different sample characteristics, or 2) a narrow range of dose sensitivity. Cohorts tested with 20 and 30 mg doses were recruited from the same populations, using identical inclusion / exclusion criteria, and did not differ significantly in age, ethnicity, education level, weight, caffeine use, scores for NS, SSS and DIS scales and baseline PPI levels (p's &#x0003e; 0.05, both across all intervals, and for the critical mean of 60 and 120 ms intervals used for median split analyses). Groups did differ significantly in startle magnitude (see <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), with lower startle magnitude exhibited by the 30 mg dose group. However, both the PPI-enhancing effects of 20 mg memantine, and the lack thereof with 30 mg memantine, were independent of startle magnitude: median split analyses revealed no significant interaction of low vs. high startle magnitude and memantine dose effects with either 20 mg (F&#x0003c;1) or 30 mg (F&#x0003c;1) doses. Furthermore, startle magnitude was not related to low vs. high gating group assignment for either dose of memantine, nor did inclusion of low vs. high baseline startle magnitude as a grouping factor alter the critical main or interaction effects in these studies. Groups also differed significantly in HA scores (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, a subgroup of subjects from the 30 mg dose group (n=12) with mean HA score (6.0 (SEM 0.88)) nearly identical to that of the 20 mg dose group (5.95 (1.25)) exhibited no significant effect of memantine dose on PPI (F&#x0003c;1) and no dose &#x000d7; interval interaction (F&#x0003c;1). Thus, group differences in HA scores do not appear to account for differential effects of 20 vs. 30 mg memantine on PPI.</p><p id="P37">A narrow dose range of memantine effects on PPI in humans would be consistent with the present animal data for short prepulse intervals. Here, an &#x0201c;inverted-U&#x0201d; dose effect was detected: the &#x0201c;low dose&#x0201d; (10 mg/kg) increased PPI compared to vehicle, while the &#x0201c;high dose&#x0201d; (20 mg/kg) reduced PPI compared to vehicle. Such a pattern suggests interactions among multiple substrates, either among different pharmacological effects of memantine (e.g. DA agonist as well as NMDA antagonist properties (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Seeman et al. 2008</xref>)), or multiple brain systems regulating PPI. For example, we could speculate that the ratio of DA agonist : NMDA antagonist effects of memantine differs at these two doses, such that a predominant NMDA antagonism at the low dose leads to increased PPI, and more prominent DA agonist effects of the high dose opposes these effects of NMDA blockade. It would be less speculative to suggest that the overall effect of systemically administered memantine on PPI will reflect its integrated effects on different brain substrates. Animal studies suggest that different NMDA systems have opposing effects on PPI. For example, PPI is disrupted by infusion of NMDA into the ventral hippocampus (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Wan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>, Zang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Swerdlow <italic>et al.</italic> 2001b</xref>) and by infusion of NMDA <italic>antagoni</italic>sts into the basolateral amygdala (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Fendt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Thus, a narrow dose range for memantine-induced changes in PPI might reflect its simultaneous action within two or more brain systems with opposing effects on PPI.</p><p id="P38">It would be reasonable to ask whether different dose effects on PPI might relate to different effects of 20 vs. 30 mg memantine on subjective ratings in this study. Increased &#x0201c;happy&#x0201d; scores after 20, but not 30 mg memantine, suggests that the lower dose had mild hedonic effects, which might correspond to pro-DAergic properties of this drug (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Seeman et al. 2008</xref>). However, PPI-enhancing effects of pro-DAergic drugs like amphetamine are generally not reported in humans, except perhaps among low-gating subgroups (Swerdlow et al. 2008). Also arguing against a pro-DAergic mechanism for PPI-enhancing effects of memantine is the fact that high novelty-seeking subjects - who are most sensitive to the PPI-enhancing effects of memantine - are also most sensitive to the PPI-<italic>reducing</italic> effects of DA agonists (Hutchison et al. 1999; Swerdlow et al. 2008). Thus, it would be challenging to propose a parsimonious neurochemical connection between the hedonic and PPI-enhancing effects of 20 mg memantine.</p><p id="P39">The present data also make it hard to explain reduced PPI in schizophrenia, simply on the basis of reduced NMDA neurotransmission. Rather, the present evidence - together with findings of increased PPI after ketamine and amantadine in normal comparison subjects - suggests that acute systemic blockade of NMDA does not reproduce the loss of sensorimotor gating exhibited by schizophrenia patients. If reduced NMDA neurotransmission contributes to PPI deficits in these patients, such effects might reflect regionally specific changes, or neuroadaptive responses to a chronic hypoglutamatergic state, that are not modeled in normal comparison subjects by an acute drug challenge.</p><p id="P40">In summary, bioactive doses of the NMDA antagonist, memantine, cause dose- and interval-dependent changes in PPI in rats and normal humans. In rats, 10 mg/kg memantine increases short-interval PPI, and 20 mg/kg decreases long-interval PPI. In humans, 20 mg memantine has mild hedonic effects and reduces spontaneous blink rate, and significantly increases long interval PPI. This latter effect is most evident among individuals with low baseline PPI, or with personality scale scores suggesting high novelty seeking, high sensation seeking, or high disinhibition. At 30 mg, memantine causes significant dizziness, but has no effects on PPI at any prepulse interval or in any sample subgroup. The PPI-enhancing effects of memantine are generally consistent with reports of other NMDA antagonist effects in humans, but are distinct from the effects of memantine or other NMDA antagonists on PPI in rats.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><p>Supported by MH59803.
