Oozing from blood vessels too small to be ligated necessitate a treatment with haemostats in order to prevent complications attributed to bleeding. There is good evidence from randomised trials for the efficacy of fibrin sealants, on their own or in combination with a carrier material. A new haemostatic device is Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. It is a collagen based material without any coagulation factors. Pre-clinical data for Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>showed superior haemostatic effect. This present study aims to show that in the clinical situation Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is not inferior to a carrier-bound fibrin sealant (Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) as a haemostatic treatment in hepatic resection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a multi-centre, patient-blinded, intra-operatively randomised controlled trial. A total of 126 patients planned for an elective liver resection will be enrolled in eight surgical centres. The primary objective of this study is to show the non-inferiority of Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>versus a carrier-bound fibrin sealant (Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) in achieving haemostasis after hepatic resection. The surgical intervention is standardised with regard to devices and techniques used for resection and primary haemostasis. Patients will be followed-up for three months for complications and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomised controlled trial (ESSCALIVER) aims to compare the new collagen haemostat Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>with a carrier-bound fibrin sealant which can be seen as a "gold standard" in hepatic and other visceral organ surgery. If non-inferiority is shown other criteria than the haemostatic efficacy (e.g. costs, adverse events rate) may be considered for the choice of the most appropriate treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>NCT00918619</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>All surgical procedures inevitably lead to bleeding. Haemostasis - the control of bleeding - aims at reducing the amount of blood loss and the need for transfusion as well as preventing re-bleeding, haematoma formation with subsequent morbidities, and the need for intervention or repeat surgery. During liver resection the control of bleeding is a major concern. The liver is predisposed to a diffuse bleeding because of its extreme vascularity, particularly because of the hepatic sinusoidal structure, which does not have smooth muscles capable of contraction to induce vasoconstriction.</p><p>Surgical techniques and devices to facilitate haemostasis have been developed in the last decades and have minimised operative risks of liver resection. Nevertheless, a parenchymal transsection of the liver tissue is always associated with some degree of bleeding due to the division of small blood vessels which can not be isolated and ligated.</p><p>In order to achieve control over that parenchymatic diffuse bleeding from the resection surface and to prevent intraperitoneal complications attributed to bleeding various locally applicable agents (haemostats) are in use. These haemostats include bone wax, gelatine, collagen, oxidized regenerated cellulose, fibrin sealant glues, and synthetic glues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Some evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) exists regarding the use of fibrin sealants on their own or combined with a collagen fleece [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>A composite product with well documented efficacy is Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>[Nycomed, Linz, Austria]. It consists of a collagen fleece carrying the fibrin glue components human fibrinogen and human thrombin. It was shown in a RCT to be superior in obtaining intraoperative haemostasis over argon beamer in liver resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The time to haemostasis was significantly reduced. Also in kidney tumour resection a randomized study showed superiority over standard suturing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>A new haemostat product is Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>[Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany]. It is indicated for local haemostasis of capillary bleeding and bleeding of parenchymal organs. Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is composed of native absorbable collagen fibrils without any blood serum products or any pharmaceutical activity. The felt structure being rich in surface gives a framework for the adhesion of blood platelets, thus provides an additional impetus to clotting. Pre-clinical data showed very good haemostatic activity, superior to sealant and to cellulose product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study is to show that the new microfibrillar collagen hemostat Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is not inferior to the carrier-bound fibrin sealant Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>with regards to haemostatic efficacy. The efficacy of Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>has been shown in many clinical studies in various indications and thus can be seen as a standard treatment superior to other locally applicable agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>This study is designed as a prospective, single blinded, randomized, 2-arm trial of two haemostatic products.

Surgeons must be board certified and must have a minimum experience of 10 liver resections performed.

Either Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>or Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>will be applied to the resection area according to the respective instructions for use and the time to haemostasis will be recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>After surgery, two follow-up examinations will be performed while the patients are still hospitalised.

Randomisation is stratified by clinical trial centre and will be performed as block randomization. A separate randomisation list will be created for each clinical trial centre using the Software RandList of the DatInf GmbH, T&#x000fc;bingen, Germany.</p><p>Only if a patient fulfils all eligibility criteria he/she will be randomised to an investigational treatment. This will take place during surgery, since part of the exclusion criteria can only be checked during the operation (liver resection). For allocation of the randomisation numbers to eligible trial participants each clinical trial centre will be provided with a set of identical look, opaque and well sealed envelopes. If a patient turns out to be eligible the investigator opens the next envelope in sequence. Inside he will find the randomisation number and the allocated investigational treatment. The sequence of opening the envelopes will be monitored regularly.</p><p>This is a single blinded clinical trial. The clinical trial patients will not be informed about their assignment to a study group. The randomization takes place in the operating room immediately before the application of the product. Thus the investigator does not know which product will be used during transection, during primary haemostasis, and when assessing the intra-operative inclusion criteria. However, the appearance of the products precludes a complete blinding of the investigators.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec><title>Primary Variable</title><p>The proportion of patients with haemostasis 3 minutes after application of the haemostat product as well as associated 95% confidence intervals will be reported for each treatment arm. The study null hypothesis is that Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is more effective than Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Non-inferiority will be demonstrated if the lower limit of the observed two-sided 95% confidence interval of the observed difference in proportions of Treatment Arm 1 - Treatment Arm 2 does not fall below -0.100. The analysis will be based on the per-protocol population and repeated for the intent-to-treat population. The intent-to-treat population consists of all consenting patients randomized into the study. The safety population comprises all treated patients. The Per-Protocol population excludes all patients who violated inclusion or exclusion criteria of the protocol.</p><p>If the 95% confidence interval for the treatment effect not only lies entirely above -0.1 but also above zero then there is evidence of superiority in terms of statistical significance at the 5% level.

This will include the proportions, the estimated difference in proportions and the associated 95% confidence intervals. Differences in time to haemostasis will be tested with a log-rank test at the 5% alpha level. Kaplan Meier curves will be displayed, with median estimates and confidence limits provided.

Topical haemostats, glues and sealants are used regularly in liver surgery trying to prevent complications resulting from haemorrhage. The ideal haemostat should be efficient in achieving fast and durable haemostasis and not causing any adverse affects. Additionally, it should be easy to use and cost efficient.</p><p>The present study aims to show that the efficacy of a new collagen based haemostyptic agent (Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) is not inferior to another product with a proven efficacy (Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). A non-inferiority study design seems to be appropriate, since there is good evidence from controlled trials that the active control is efficacious. The expected margins of a possible difference are so small - in the range of seconds or few minutes regarding time to haemostasis - that the clinical relevance of a superiority would be at least questionable. In case Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>proves to be no worse than Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, other criteria like incompatibility with the use of human blood components or cost-effectiveness could be taken into consideration. With haemostats potentially being used in all surgical procedures and with the relatively high costs of fibrin sealants and similar products, the cost-effectiveness is of a high importance. The results of this study could influence the choice of haemostatic therapy in a great many cases, especially with extensive parenchymatic bleeding, such as in hepatic resections.</p><p>Purified, microfibrillar collagen products have been introduced as haemostats in the 1970ies and have become valuable surgical adjunctives. They induce blood clotting very fast, have a strong adherence to the surface with low tissue reaction and fast resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Preclinical data on the new collagen product Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>showed very good haemostatic activity. In a pig liver resection model time to haemostasis was shorter than for Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>or for oxidized cellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Some evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) exists regarding the use of fibrin sealants on their own or combined with a carrier material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The efficacy of Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>which consists of a collagen fleece carrying the fibrin glue components human fibrinogen and human thrombin has been shown in many clinical studies in various indications and can be seen as a standard treatment superior to other locally applicable agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It was shown in a randomised controlled trial to be superior in obtaining intra-operative haemostasis over argon beamer in liver resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The study by Frilling et al. will serve as the reference for this study design and conduct. Participants, interventions and outcome measures are chosen to be similar or equivalent. Three study centres of the ESSCALIVER - Study (Graz, Heidelberg, M&#x000fc;nchen Grosshadern) participated in the reference study, too.</p><p>Patients undergoing elective hepatic resection are generally eligible for the study. Liver surgery is to be performed according to accepted surgical standards. For primary surgical haemostasis only sutures and clips are allowed.</p><p>The efficacy parameter is "time to haemostasis" which is assessed every minute as presence or absence of haemostasis. Different from the reference study the primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients who achieved haemostasis at 3 minutes. The reference study for Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>as well as the pre-clinical data for Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>suggest that at 3 minutes in the majority of cases (&#x0003e;70%) haemostasis will be achieved already. Thus the interesting "time to haemostasis" is the time between 1 and 3 minutes. However, the instructions for use for Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>require to press the device for at least 3 minutes to the wound surface, preventing a measurement before that time. Therefore, the proportion of patients with haemostasis after 3 minutes was chosen as the appropriate primary outcome. Patient proportions at other time points and the time to haemostasis (Kaplan Meier curves) will be assessed as secondary parameters.</p><p>A limitation of the study is that due to the nature of the products a blinding of the observer is not possible. Additionally, the assessment of the time to haemostasis is subjective and prone to bias. However, there is no better method available. This is reflected by the fact that it is the method of choice in comparable studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]."</p><p>The margins of non-inferiority are a crucial decision in a non-inferiority trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The basis for the margin definition in this study were: the reference study, the preclinical data, and expert opinions. Preclinical data suggest that Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is more efficient in achieving haemostasis than Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. The reference study shows that at 3 minutes in ~70% of patients haemostasis was achieved in contrast to ~50% (difference of ~20%) with the comparator Argon Laser (figures are estimates from the published graphs). In the present study the margins for non-inferiority are set to 10% which firstly is much smaller than the effect of Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>found in the reference study, and secondly was decided by the experts in a study meeting with all participating centres.</p><p>Since the comparator is a pharmaceutical product the study has to be conducted under the strict regulations of the national drug law. On the other hand it will additionally assure a high quality study conduct which is a criterion for the acceptance of a non-inferiority study results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Diffuse bleeding from resection surfaces of parenchymatous organs remain a challenge in visceral surgery. Pre-clinical data suggest that Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>might be a very efficient haemostat, however, without any pharmaceutically active plasma components. The present study aims to assess if Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is non-inferior to the "gold-standard" product Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. In case Sangustop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>proves to be as efficient as Tachosil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, this will allow surgeons to look at additional criteria like handling characteristics or the cost-effectiveness for the selection of the most appropriate treatment for hemostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The study and the publication of the study protocol are sponsored by B.
