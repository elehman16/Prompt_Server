Researchers and practitioners have observed other benefits of yoga on the physical and mental health.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Yoga is also beneficial for musculoskeletal functioning, cardiovascular health, diabetes, respiratory disorders, hypertension, hypotension, depression, and many other disorders. In essence, yoga is a process of creating a body and mind that are stepping stone not hurdles, to an exuberant and fulfilling life. A typical yoga program, usually consisting of Asana, Pranayama, Kriya, deep relaxation, and meditation, has a combined effect of relaxation of body, slowing of breath, and calming of mind. After attention to posture, deep breathing, and chanting, yoga practice often begins with a slow movement sequence to increase blood flow and warm muscles. This is followed by poses that include flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and rotation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Holding poses build strength by engaging muscles in isometric contraction.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Moving joints through their full range of motion increases flexibility,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] whereas standing poses promote balance by strengthening stabilizing muscles and improving proprioception to reduce falls.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Thus, yoga incorporates several elements of exercise that is beneficial for human health. Yoga leads to reduce the oxygen consumption and metabolism, thereby balancing the homeostasis.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Various other researches confirmed the role of yoga and meditation against diabetes, hyperthyroidism, obesity, respiratory problems, mental stress, and oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>One of the markers of physical well-being in adults is body mass index (BMI).[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Overweight (BMI 25.0&#x02013;29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obesity (BMI &#x02265;30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) are associated with hypertension and increased mortality.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Hypertension is one of the most common disorders, affecting &#x02248;26.4% of the adult population worldwide. It ranks as the leading chronic risk factor for mortality, accounting for 13.5% of all deaths. Moreover, it is now projected to grow to affect &#x0003e;1.5 billion people by 2025.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In the present scenario, the physical and clinical problem seems unchecked, and still, there is a possibility to prevent them through yoga practices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subject selection</title><p>All the participants included in this study were selected from 1-month free Yoga camps organized by our University at various places in Dehradun district, and sponsored by CCRYN, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India.

These participants took part in every day's 1 h yoga and followed common yoga protocol given by the Government of India. The common yoga practices followed by the participants were Prayer, Sadilaja/Calana Kriyas/loosening practice (neck bending, trunk movement, and knee movement), Yogasana (standing posture: tadasana, vriksasana, padahastasana, ardhachakrasana and trikonasana; siting posture: bhadrasana, ardha-ustrasana, sasankasana and vakrasana; prone postures: bhujangasana, Salabhasana, Makarasana; supine postures: setubandhasana, Pavanamuktasana and Savasana), Kapalbhati (breathing exercise), Pranayama (Nadi shodhana/anulom viloma, and Bhramari), Dhyana in sambhari mudra (meditation), Sankalpa (solemn vow), and finally, Santih patha (mantra for peace, harmony, and happiness). The control group was consisting of 26 healthy volunteers who did not participate in yoga practice although performed their daily routine as usual. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants and study conformed to the code of ethics of the World Medical Association (the Declaration of Helsinki). In addition, good clinical practice Guidelines of Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India (March 2013)[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] were strictly followed.

In our subset of participants, we had 22&#x02013;69 years of age irrespective to their genders that performed yoga practice. In our study, we found that BMI of experimental group was significantly decreased within 1 month, that is, mainly because of asana which might be reduced the deposited fat on adipose tissue. We found better results in reducing BMI as compared to that of the previous study by Telles <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Our findings clearly suggested that the complications of obesity can be reduced by yoga therapy. Similarly, the systolic and diastolic BP was significantly decreased in persons who performed yoga for 30 days.</p><p>The asanas calm the mind and regularize and balance the nervous system, the center that controls stress. Further, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system stabilized in the practice of asanas resulting in regulation of the BP. The asanas belong to the forward bends, supine, sitting, and inversions group regulate the BP. However, forward bends are the fundamental asanas which can be helpful for persons suffering from high BP. Among them, Adhomukha svanasana is the most beneficial asana for BP. The horizontal position of the spine in these asanas allows the heart to slow down as there is no stress to pump the blood against gravity to the brain. Besides, the heart rate and the cardiac output simultaneously slow down, and BP is controlled.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Our results support the findings which stated that the yoga practice reduces systolic and diastolic BP.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In addition, all participants were found to achieve good health, positivity, and vitality after performing yoga.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The tendency of increasing weight or obesity is being prevalent day-by-day in all aged person. Studies have shown that BMI and BP at low and high level indicate morbidity and mortality. Yoga therapy is beneficial in maintaining good health by regulating BMI and BP. Hence, from our study, it is concluded that the efficacy of yoga therapy on body weight and BP may have direct impact on its use as a safe therapeutic modality in combating obesity and abnormal BP borne diseases. In future, such studies are highly needed to be done on larger group of participants for investigation and validation of effect of yoga practice on health. Such studies can aware people to adopt yoga in their daily routine for better physical and mental health.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This work was financially supported by CCRYN, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India (F.
