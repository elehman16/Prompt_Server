strength and balance in the knee joint after a meniscal injury. [Subjects and Methods]
This randomized control study enrolled 24 patients who had undergone arthroscopic
treatment after a meniscal injury and began a rehabilitative exercise program 8 weeks
after surgery. Subjects were divided into 2 groups of 12 subjects each: gluteus medius
resistance exercise group and control group. This study investigated muscle strength and
balance in the knee joint flexor, extensor, and abductor during an 8-week period.
[Results] Measurements of knee extensor muscle strength revealed no significant difference
between the control group and the experimental group. Measurements of abductor muscle
strength, however, identified a significant difference between the 2 groups. The groups
did not differ significantly with regard to balance measurements. [Conclusion] The results
of this study suggest that this subject should be approached in light of the correlation
between the hip abductor and injury to the lower extremities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Meniscus</kwd><kwd>Gluteus medius</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The prevalence of knee joint injury and disease has increased as a result of the increasing
frequency of injury due to various leisure, industrial, and traffic accidents<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The knee joint is both one of the larger
joints of the body and the most complex joint. The most typical knee joint injuries involve
the anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus, which comprise large proportions of the
joint<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The meniscus plays multiple very
diverse and important functions in a normal knee joint<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. These functions include joint cartilage lubrication, reduction of
friction, reduction of compression stress on the knee joint, and stability of the joint
during exercise<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. A knee joint injury may
lead to both ankle and hip joint injuries<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of a study of hip joint muscle strength after knee joint
injury revealed decreases of 12&#x02013;25% in the isometric muscle strength of the abductor,
adductor, flexor, and extensor of the operated leg, compared to these values in the
unoperated contralateral leg<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Decreased
hip abductor muscle strength reduces proximal control of the hip joint and thereby causes a
decrease in knee exercise dynamics. In addition, the relationship between chronic knee
injury and hip abductor strength signifies that endurance of the musculature also plays an
essential role in myoneural control of the knee. A lower extremity fatigue protocol was
shown to induce changes in the dynamics of strength generation, proprioception,
coordination, and landing exercise<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Cale<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that patients with an
increased hip abductor peak torque exhibited decreased peak knee joint displacement through
proximal hip joint control. These findings suggest that the decline in muscle strength after
knee joint surgery is not limited to the flexor and extensor muscles of the knee joint, but
may lead to a further loss of muscle strength<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The abductor muscles play important kinesiologic roles in standing
on feet and ambulation in humans<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among
these, the gluteus medius muscle controls movements of the femur and stabilizes the pelvis
during mobilization of the lower extremities<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Strengthening exercises targeting the gluteus medius muscle were
shown to improve movement in the lower extremities, prevent injuries, and reduce pain<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence, studies of the hip abductor have
recently being emphasized in the treatment and prevention of injuries of the lower
extremities<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Notwithstanding the focus on strengthening hip muscles after meniscal injury, this study
was accordingly intended to investigate the effect of hip muscle strengthening on knee joint
muscle strength and balance after meniscal injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 24 patients who had undergone arthroscopic treatment for a diagnosed
meniscal injury and subsequently completed rehabilitative exercise therapy at the M-training
center and G hospital, located in the City of U, during an 8-week period from January to
March 2014. These 24 subjects, who understood the intent of this study and volunteered to
participate, were divided into 2 groups: 1) the control group (CG), and 2) the experimental
group that practiced gluteus medius resistance exercises (GREG). All participants understood
the purpose of this study and provided written informed consent prior to participation in
accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>As suggested by the studies of Gobbi<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>
and Heckmann<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, the program of
rehabilitative exercise after meniscal injury was revised and reinforced to fit the scope of
this study. The exercise program was conducted in 3 steps: warm-up, main training, and
cool-down. This exercise program was implemented in 4 sets that were repeated 12 times at a
maximum muscle strength of 70%. The program was performed 3 times per week for 8 weeks

Germany) was used to measure muscle strength in the lower extremities. This isometric muscle
strength device measured both the maximum and mean muscle strength. Patients were asked to
sit on the device and attached the fixed strip to their chest. The muscle strength was
measured in the knee flexor, extensor, and abductor to prevent compensation of the upper
extremities. Nm was the unit of measurement. An isometric strength test was used to test the
muscle strength. Isometric strength tests were performed at a 45&#x000b0; angle for the hip flexor
and extensor, and at a 90&#x000b0; angle for the hip abductor.</p><p>A Posture Med balance measurement device (Microswing 5; Haider Bioswing GmbH, Pullenreuth,
Germany) was used in this study. Subjects with good balance received a score of 1,000
points, whereas those who lost balance received a score of 0 (zero). All subjects were asked
to move their left and right legs one at a time while stretching out their knees for 10&#x02005;s,
with their eyes open. This test was repeated 3 times to obtain a mean value.</p><p>SPSS for Windows 12.0 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the statistical data
analysis. General characteristics of the subjects and all variables in the 2 groups were
computed and expressed as means &#x000b1; standard deviations. A paired t-test was used to compare
muscle strength of the knee joint and hip abductor and to verify differences in the
balancing capacity within each group before and after exercise. An independent t-test was
used to analyze muscle strength in the knee joint and hip joint and verify differences in
the balancing capacity. A p-value of &#x02264;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, the muscle strengths of the knee flexor before and after exercise were 70.69

However, this
study also attempted to determine the effect of hip muscle strengthening on knee joint
muscle strength and balance after meniscal injury. Jacobs et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a decrease in hip abductor muscle strength
reduces proximal control in the hip joint, thus causing a decrease in exercise dynamics of
the knee joint.</p><p>Hamberg<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> asserted that after surgery,
(1) the maximum knee extensor muscle strength recovers to the preoperative level in 4&#x02013;8
weeks, (2) the knee flexor muscle strength completely returns to the preoperative level in 6
weeks, and (3) the flexor muscle recovers strength more rapidly than does the extensor
muscle.</p><p>In a study of the effect of a 6-week isometric exercise program in patients with meniscal
injury, Kim et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a lack of a
significant statistical difference between the maximum flexor and extensor muscle strengths
at 60&#x000b0;/s. Another study reported that the implementation of a 12-week rehabilitation
exercise program after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery engendered muscle
strength deficits of 10.8% and 12.2% for the extensor and flexor, respectively<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Yet another study reported that the
implementation of a 24-week rehabilitation exercise program for male soccer players yielded
muscle strength deficits of 7.9% and 3.7% for the extensor and flexor, respectively<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. These authors also reported that the same
24-week rehabilitation exercise resulted in muscle strength deficits of 17.6% and 12.5% for
the extensor and flexor, respectively, in female soccer players.</p><p>The present study, which was conducted for an 8-week period after surgery, yielded the
following knee flexor muscle strengths before and after exercise: 70.69 &#x000b1; 30.40 Nm and 84.04
&#x000b1; 29.70 Nm, respectively, for the CG and 68.95 &#x000b1; 20.26 Nm and 90.69 &#x000b1; 27.24 Nm,
respectively, for the GREG. The knee extensor muscle strengths before and after exercise
were 96.93 &#x000b1; 42.56 Nm and 127.93 &#x000b1; 42.14 Nm, respectively, in the CG and 99.63 &#x000b1; 48.19 Nm
and 140.08 &#x000b1; 42.07 Nm, respectively, in the GREG. The hip abductor muscle strengths before
and after exercise were 60.18 &#x000b1; 10.30 Nm and 69.03 &#x000b1; 11.55 Nm, respectively, in the CG and
58.00 &#x000b1; 14.81 Nm and 81.76 &#x000b1; 16.34 Nm, respectively, in the GREG. Statistically significant
increases in strength after exercise appear to support the results of previous studies.</p><p>With respect to intergroup differences, only the before- and after-exercise hip abductor
muscle strength differed significantly, with values of 69.03 &#x000b1; 11.55 Nm for the CG and 81.76
&#x000b1; 16.35 Nm for the GREG. This result was attributed to the fact that this part of the
experiment was performed 8 weeks after surgery. The assumption is that concurrent exercises
involving other muscles, in addition to the hip abductor exercises, led to a lack of
significant differences in knee flexor and knee extensor strength.</p><p>The proprioceptors are perceptive receptors that transmit stimuli from the skin, muscles,
tendons, and joints to the central nervous system.</p><p>These stimuli transmit information about the locations of body parts for the control of
tendon and muscle activities. Proprioceptors are distributed in the Golgi tendon organ,
muscle spindle, and joint receptor areas and provide input data to the central nervous
system. The scientific literature indicates that proprioception and postural control are of
great importance for optimal sports injury prevention<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, and proprioceptors play an important role in a patient&#x02019;s exercise
execution<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Injury to the lower
extremities was reported to decrease the proprioceptive (position sense) capacity in the
injured area and increase the threshold value<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. As proprioception prevents injury and restores damaged movement
sensations, it is emphasized in the rehabilitative process and recommended during the early
phase of rehabilitation<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lee<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> revealed that comprehensive exercise of
the injured lower extremities resulted in a 60% improvement in muscle strength 14 weeks
after surgery relative to the preoperative strength. In the present study, the measured
balance scores before and after exercise 153.33 &#x000b1; 271.85 and 602.50 &#x000b1; 211.26, respectively,
in the CG and 154.50 &#x000b1; 217.13 and 687.91 &#x000b1; 136.83, respectively, in the GREG. Although these
within-group increases after exercise were significant, there was no significant intergroup
difference.</p><p>The results of this study revealed that weakness of the knee flexor, the knee extensor, and
hip abductor after injury to the lower extremities. The intragroup hip abductor and hip
abductor muscle strengths and balancing capacity increased significantly; however, no
significant intergroup differences were observed. Similar results were observed for all
targets of the exercise program, except for the hip abductor muscle.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that this subject should be approached in light of the
