Response to therapy is currently not considered in the decision-making procedure.</p><p>ADAPT is one of the first new generation (neo)adjuvant trials dealing with individualization of (neo)adjuvant decision-making in early breast cancer and aims to establish early predictive surrogate markers, e.g., Ki-67, for therapy response under a short induction treatment in order to maximally individualize therapy and avoid unnecessary toxicity by ineffective treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The prospective, multi-center, controlled, non-blinded, randomized, investigator initiated phase II/III ADAPT trial has an innovative &#x0201c;umbrella&#x0201d; protocol design. The &#x0201c;umbrella&#x0201d; is common for all patients, consisting of dynamic testing of early therapy response. ADAPT will recruit 4,936 patients according to their respective breast cancer subtype in four distinct sub-trials at 80 trial sites in Germany; 4,000 patients with hormone receptor positive (HR+) and HER2 negative disease will be included in the <italic>ADAPT HR+/HER2-</italic> sub-trial, where treatment decision is based on risk assessment and therapy response to induction therapy, and 380 patients will be included in <italic>ADAPT HER2+/HR+</italic>. A further 220 patients will be included in <italic>ADAPT HER2+/HR-</italic> and 336 patients will be recruited for <italic>ADAPT Triple Negative</italic>. These three sub-trials focus on identification of early surrogate markers for therapy success in the neoadjuvant setting. Patients will be allocated to the respective sub-trial according to the result of their diagnostic core biopsy, as reported by local/central pathology for HR and HER2 status.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent trials, such as the GeparTrio, have shown that response-guided therapy using clinical response may improve outcome. For chemotherapy or HER2-targeted treatment, pathologic complete response in a neoadjuvant setting is an excellent predictor of outcome. For endocrine therapy, response to short induction treatment &#x02013; as defined by decrease in tumor cell proliferation &#x02013; strongly correlates with outcome. ADAPT now aims to combine static prognostic and dynamic predictive markers, focusing not just on single therapeutic targets, but also on general markers of proliferation and cell death. Biomarker analysis will help to optimize selection of subtype-specific treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <italic>ADAPT Umbrella</italic>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01781338?term=NCT01781338&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01781338</ext-link>; <italic>ADAPT HR+/HER2-</italic>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01779206?term=NCT01779206&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01779206</ext-link>; <italic>ADAPT HER2+/HR+</italic>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01745965?term=NCT01745965&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01745965</ext-link>; <italic>ADAPT HER2+/HR-</italic>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01817452?term=NCT01817452&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01817452</ext-link>; <italic>ADAPT TN:</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01815242?term=NCT01815242&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01815242</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ADAPT</kwd><kwd>Biomarker</kwd><kwd>Early breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Investigator initiated trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The two most important questions in therapy of early breast cancer to be resolved over the next decade are: <italic>Who can safely be spared adjuvant chemotherapy?</italic> and <italic>Who has the maximum benefit from chemo-, endocrine and/or anti-HER2 therapy?</italic></p><p>The question of who can safely be spared adjuvant chemotherapy has been extensively scientifically explored and represents the basis of decision-making with respect to adjuvant systemic therapy today [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Few well evaluated prognostic tests identify patients with a low-risk profile justifying omission of chemotherapy based on a potentially low benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A number of clinical trials, such as TAILORx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], RxPonder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], MINDACT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], NNBC-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and WSG planB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], are currently addressing this question.</p><p>The second question is much more difficult to resolve. The clinically most relevant predictor for adjuvant endocrine therapy response is steroid hormone receptor protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similarly, benefit from anti-HER2 therapy seems to be restricted to patients demonstrating over-expression and/or amplification of the HER2/neu oncogene, accounting for about 15% of patients with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The strongest clinical parameter for prediction of outcome after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the adjuvant setting, the recurrence score (RS) has been demonstrated to predict outcome in hormone-sensitive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, HER2 over-expression correlates with anthracycline sensitivity, and luminal subtypes benefit differently from taxanes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Recent data, derived mainly from primary endocrine therapy and less from primary chemotherapy, indicate that early sequential evaluation of proliferation markers such as Ki-67 strongly correlates with recurrence-free survival and overall outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Within the ADAPT trial, prognostic evaluation (static biomarker) and early prediction (dynamic biomarker) are combined. The prognostic profile is evaluated at the time of diagnosis in core biopsy material and a second evaluation of proliferative and apoptotic markers as well as imaging (only in the HER2+ and triple negative setting) will be done in sequential tissue samples after a short period (3 weeks) of subtype-specific induction therapy.</p><p>Since the evidence for proliferation marker Ki-67 as an early response predictor is strongest for hormone sensitive disease, Ki-67 will be used in the <italic>ADAPT HR+/-HER2-</italic> sub-trial to early identify responders in the intermediate-risk group (N0-1, RS 12&#x02013;25), who are then considered to be sufficiently treated by adjuvant endocrine therapy alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Low responders and patients initially identified as high-risk for recurrence (N2-3 or N0-1 and RS &#x02265;26) will be randomized to a chemotherapy protocol optimizing dose-dense taxane-based chemotherapy.</p><p>The <italic>ADAPT HR+/HER2-</italic> sub-trial is therefore a modern biomarker-based adjuvant trial, which advances the ideas of earlier trials such as TAILORx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], NNBC-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], WSG planB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] or MINDACT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Besides better definition of prognosis, it will improve early prediction with the aim to reduce over-treatment by chemotherapy.</p><p>The ADAPT trial aims to individualize therapy by integration of early dynamic response data into clinical management. In terms of an early enrichment strategy, the purpose is to spare unnecessary toxic therapies and costs without compromising patient outcome. ADAPT thus may not only help to reduce over-treatment, but also to avoid under-treatment in early breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>ADAPT is a second generation trial addressing individualization of adjuvant decision-making in early breast cancer by utilization of optimized pre-therapeutic biomarker information and early biomarker changes as determined from a second core biopsy after three weeks of subtype-specific induction therapy. ADAPT is set up as an &#x0201c;umbrella&#x0201d; trial, i.e., all patients will complete the <italic>ADAPT Umbrella</italic> trial (two sequential core biopsies including biomarker determination and three weeks subtype-specific induction therapy) plus one of the breast cancer subtype-specific sub-protocols (<italic>ADAPT HR+/HER2-</italic>, <italic>ADAPT HER2+/HR+</italic>, <italic>ADAPT HER2+/HR-</italic> or <italic>ADAPT Triple Negative</italic>). Each sub-trial will utilize the subtype-specific treatment to establish individualized therapy approaches and assess early therapy response. The trial is prospective, multi-centric, controlled, non-blinded, randomized, investigator initiated phase II/III, and is run at 80 German trial sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The ADAPT trial population is comprised of 4,936 women with early primary breast cancer (BC) aged between 18 and 75 years old. Any tumor size (T1-T4, except inflammatory BC) and nodal status (N) is allowed. All patients will complete the <italic>ADAPT Umbrella</italic> protocol irrespective of their disease subtype. Based on the sample size calculations, as adapted from the primary hypotheses to meet the primary objectives of each sub-trial, 4,000 hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative patients will be included in <italic>ADAPT HR+/HER2-</italic>. Another 380 patients with HER2 and HR positive tumors will participate in <italic>ADAPT HER2+/HR+</italic>; 220 HER2+/HR- patients will be included in <italic>ADAPT HER2+/HR-</italic> and 336 triple negative (HER2-/HR-) patients will be treated within the <italic>ADAPT Triple Negative</italic> sub-trial. Allocation to the sub-trials depends on the result for hormone receptor and HER2 status from diagnostic core biopsy as determined by local pathology. For any HER2+ or triple negative patient, the local pathology result will be verified by central pathology review since significant discordance rates between local and central pathology assessment have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Only if central pathology confirms the local result for HR and HER2 status, the patient is eligible for the respective HER2+ or triple negative sub-trial. For HR+/HER2- patients the local pathology result is acceptable for inclusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment process</title><p>Patients are recruited at participating trial sites, i.e., breast centers, highly specialized gynecologic departments, or gynecological and oncological outpatient units. West German Study Group (WSG), as the study sponsor, provides specific recruitment training to the sites as part of each onsite trial initiation visit.</p><p>Patients whose diagnostic core biopsy &#x02013; as standard of care &#x02013; shows a histologically confirmed unilateral primary invasive carcinoma of the breast by local pathology review will be informed about the ADAPT trial and asked to participate. Each patient has to sign three informed consent forms for inclusion, i.e., one for <italic>ADAPT Umbrella</italic>, one for the applicable ADAPT sub-trial as well as a third one for blood and tissue sample donation. Only if all three informed consent forms are obtained, and inclusion and exclusion criteria are not violated, the patient is ready for trial registration. Patients who are not registered prior to any trial-related procedure cannot be accepted for the trial at a later time.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility</title><p>Female patients with histologically confirmed unilateral primary invasive carcinoma of the breast aged 18&#x02013;75 years old are eligible if they are candidates for (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy by conventional prognostic criteria (age, tumor size, nodal status, grade) and have no clinical evidence for distant metastasis (M0). HR and HER2 status must be known from local pathology review and a representative tumor block must be available for central pathology review, genomic signature (where applicable), and biomarker determination. Patients must not be pregnant, i.e., a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within seven days prior to start of induction treatment in premenopausal patients is obligatory. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any protocol-specific procedures and must be documented together with expected cooperation and accessibility of the patients for the treatment and follow-up according to local regulatory requirements. Patients must also be able to tolerate the treatment, as indicated by normal laboratory values and proper organ function.</p><p>Patients must not have a known hypersensitivity reaction to the compounds or incorporated substances used for treatment. Prior malignancy with a disease-free survival of less than ten years (except curatively treated basalioma of the skin or pTis of the cervix uteri) as well as sequential or non-operable BC including inflammatory BC, are not allowed. Previous or concurrent treatment with cytotoxic agents for any reason without prior consultation of the sponsor (WSG) disqualifies for trial participation. Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs or participation in another interventional clinical trial with or without any investigational not-marketed drug within 30 days prior to trial entry is prohibited. Patients indicating risk of poor compliance or not able to consent will be excluded.</p><p>The procedure for enrollment, eligibility verification, treatment allocation, randomization and analysis is shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>ADAPT CONSORT flow diagram.</bold> Patients are allocated to one of four distinct ADAPT sub-trials, depending on the hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status of the tumor.

Eligibility criteria have to be confirmed and any required baseline measures must be obtained. Eligible individuals recruited through the above strategies are provided with three patient information sheets (<italic>ADAPT Umbrella</italic>, ADAPT sub-trial, blood and tissue sample donation) and three informed consent forms, respectively, all of which were approved by the leading Ethics Committee in the currently applicable version at the time of recruitment.</p></sec><sec><title>Therapy response assessment</title><p>Currently, assessment of early therapy response for each sub-trial will be based on Ki-67 antigen, a nuclear protein associated with cell proliferation, which can be measured by immunohistochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Within the ADAPT trial, Ki-67 will be determined by central pathology for standardization of the response assessment. The measurements are performed from the diagnostic core biopsy tumor sample and the repeat core biopsy or surgical sample.

Subsequently, the subtype-specific induction therapy will be applied for a short-term three-week treatment. Lastly, a repeat core biopsy or the tumor sample from surgery (in case of adjuvant treatment) will be obtained for efficacy estimation. This completes the <italic>ADAPT Umbrella</italic>. In the repeat core biopsy or surgery specimen, proliferation marker Ki-67 will be measured again in order to compare the pre- and post-therapeutic proliferation, which will then be interpreted either as good or low therapy response (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>ADAPT Umbrella </italic></bold><bold>trial design.</bold> Patients are included in the trial based on the results of the diagnostic core biopsy and local pathology for histologically confirmed tumors.

As stated above, this reference group has expected size n = 640 and expected 5-year EFS of 94%. The primary hypothesis to be tested in this sub-trial is non-inferiority of the AU-EG1 experimental group (N0-1/RS 12&#x02013;25 responders) compared to the reference, with regard to the primary endpoint EFS. This experimental group has an expected size of n = 1,120 (about 28% of HR+/HER2- patients).

To this end, two arms are considered: Patients randomized to Arm A (&#x0201c;no-chemotherapy arm&#x0201d;) receive Trastuzumab + Pertuzumab; patients randomized to Arm B (&#x0201c;chemotherapy arm&#x0201d;) receive Trastuzumab + Pertuzumab + taxane backbone. For the primary hypothesis, pCR of early responders of Arm A is compared with pCR of Arm B as a whole.</p><p>Omission of chemotherapy is formalized by a test of the hypothesis of non-inferiority (with respect to the primary endpoint, pCR) between &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; of the &#x0201c;no-chemotherapy arm&#x0201d; (A) and all patients of the &#x0201c;chemotherapy arm&#x0201d; (B). The power analysis is based on this hypothesis test.</p><p>If the primary hypothesis is confirmed (i.e., the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint is rejected), a secondary analysis will be performed in which pCR will be estimated in three subgroups defined via the combination of treatment and biomarker status. In these three subgroups, the pCR rates with confidence intervals adjusted for multiple testing by the Sidak correction (&#x003b1; = 0.017) to achieve a family-wise error rate no larger than &#x003b1; = 0.05.

The family-wise error &#x003b1; is controlled for multiple testing at the level 0.05; an unequal allocation of &#x003b1; is used for the two tests.</p><p>Regarding comparison of responders and non-responders: the overall proportion of pCR with these medications in TNBC is estimated at about 25%. This proportion includes both responders (about 60% of TN patients) and non-responders (about 40% of TN patients). A difference of 17% between pCR proportion of responders and pCR proportion of non-responders would be of clinical interest. A one-sided test with &#x003b1; = 0.01 is performed for a difference of 17% between responders and non-responders (e.g., 31.8% versus 14.8%). Under the above assumptions, this test would reject the null hypothesis (no difference in proportions) with better than 80% power with a total of n = 320 patients (336 including drop-outs), taking into account variability in the true percentage of responders. Regarding the medication comparison: there is indirect evidence that pCR could be higher in the B (nab-Paclitaxel + Carboplatin) arm. A two-sided test with &#x003b1; = 0.04 will be performed for a difference of 15% in pCR proportion between arm B (nab-Paclitaxel + Carboplatin) and arm A (nab-Paclitaxel + Gemcitabine). A difference of this magnitude would be clinically relevant for triple negative BC.

The central pathology has access only to the central pathology e-CRF page to report the result of central pathology review. This e-CRF report is considered as source data and can only be handled by the central pathology. Monitors have access to any e-CRF page and can comment on any erroneous e-CRF page and return them for correction to the trial site&#x02019;s documentalist. Any change or correction to e-CRF pages is tracked and marked by the system. Once the monitor has verified the correctness of e-CRF pages, these pages are irrevocably closed for further data capture.

These factors allow for identification of a patient subgroup at such a low risk of recurrence that absolute reduction of recurrence risk by adjuvant chemotherapy would only be marginal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, even if modern molecular risk stratification tools are used, there remains a large group of patients at intermediate risk for whom the magnitude of benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The primary goal of ADAPT is early response assessment, based on Ki-67, in all subtypes of breast cancer as clinically defined by hormone receptor status and HER2 over-expression. ADAPT is in line with recent trials, such as POETIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], WSG planB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], I-SPY 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and GeparTrio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], aiming at incorporation of new diagnostic methods for both patient and subtype-specific treatment of breast cancer. Each of these trials focused on early molecular marker assessment, while ADAPT moves the field forward by covering all subtypes of early breast cancer.</p><p>The POETIC trial addresses hormone sensitive disease only. The trial assesses the influence of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (randomization to two weeks of pre-surgical endocrine therapy vs. none) on proliferation in postmenopausal estrogen receptor positive women in a prospective setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Yet, in contrast to ADAPT, no further treatment decision is based on the early treatment response.</p><p>The I-SPY 1 trial focuses on the predictive value of early serial imaging and serial biomarker profiles for pathologic complete response and recurrence-free survival in a population with tumors &#x02265;3 cm receiving neoadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by taxanes at the discretion of the investigating trial site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Central pathology assessment was limited to HER2 status, whereas HR status was determined locally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the multivariate analysis, the molecular signatures providing additional information after consideration of clinical pathological factors and pCR were Mammaprint, wound healing signature, p53 mutation signature and PAM50. No therapeutic consequences were drawn from the results, while both the treated population and the treatment were heterogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In contrast, ADAPT uses central assessment of HR, HER2, and Ki-67 since high levels of discordance have been reported for local vs. central pathology assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. ADAPT will thus provide high quality assurance standards. Although logistics for the central pathology assessment are challenging, the central pathology results are reported back to the trial sites within five business days on average.</p><p>Within the phase III GeparTrio trial early clinical therapy response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is taken into account for further therapy decision-making in all breast cancer patients being candidates for chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

Early response in this trial was assessed by ultrasound after two courses of TAC. A complete response was defined as no sonographic signs of disease. Response was regarded as partial if the product of the two largest perpendicular diameters of the primary tumor was reduced by 50% or more. If the reduction in tumor size was less than 50% or tumor growth did not exceed 25%, the response was documented as no change. More growth or the occurrence of a new lesion were classified as progressive disease. Patients with no change at the first control (after 2 &#x000d7; TAC) were randomized to further TAC versus navelbine/capecitabine. Patients receiving non-cross-resistant chemotherapy in the case of no change had a significant survival benefit from changing the regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In retrospective subgroup analyses, the effect was mainly limited to patients with luminal A and luminal B tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although, ADAPT does not include change of the regimen in case of low response, except for endocrine therapy in the HR+/HER2- setting, it will potentially identify patients were change to a non-cross-resistant regimen could be beneficial to reduce mistreatment and improve individual outcome.</p><p>WSG planB is a prospective randomized phase III trial comparing anthracycline-free chemotherapy (Docetaxel + Cyclophosphamide (TC) &#x000d7; 6) versus an anthracycline-based standard (EC &#x02192; Doc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Oncotype DX&#x000ae; was used in HR+/HER2- patients to reduce over-treatment in the low-risk group (RS &#x02264;11 (18%)), which was recommended not to take chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. For HR+/HER2- disease ADAPT includes the same patient population as planB and recommends endocrine therapy only in low-risk patients as defined by RS &#x02264;11. In the intermediate-risk population (RS 12&#x02013;25), treatment-decision is made on the basis of early response to endocrine therapy measured by baseline and sequential Ki-67 assessment. Patients defined as early responders are spared chemotherapy and receive endocrine therapy only. A pooled analysis of both trials will allow important comparisons of conventional prognostic parameters with a new generation of prognostic tools.</p><p>In summary, ADAPT surpasses any of the recent biomarker-driven trials in terms of complexity and potentially also of clinical significance given its inclusion of all breast cancer subtypes. Together with RxPonder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], TailorX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and WSG planB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], ADAPT will prospectively validate the clinical utility of the RS by Oncotype DX&#x000ae;. To bridge the gap between prognosis and prediction of therapy success there is a need to regard individual response to therapy, which has so far not been included systematically into the clinical decision-making procedure. Potentially, the additional evaluation of early therapy response will elucidate the unclear magnitude of benefit from chemotherapy in intermediate-risk patients, who are a substantial proportion of patients in early breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The definition of therapy response is primarily based on two consecutive Ki-67 evaluations. Nevertheless, the ADAPT design allows identification of further molecular markers and profiles with a potentially even stronger correlation to therapy response and thus may lead to replacement of the currently used markers.</p><p>Early prediction of outcome based on therapy response may be a powerful instrument to identify over- or under-treatment and therefore may become a unique tool to identify potential mistreatment. It could spare unnecessary toxicity and costs if these modern enrichment strategies were integrated to management of early breast cancer.</p><p>In hormone-sensitive disease, data are already available identifying the early drop of proliferation marker Ki-67 under endocrine treatment as a potent early surrogate for EFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Presumably, these data are mature enough to spare chemotherapy to those patients with hormone-sensitive disease, who are at intermediate risk, but highly responsive to endocrine therapy. The hypothesis is that good responders are sufficiently treated by adjuvant endocrine therapy only, whereas patients with low response need additional treatment such as (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p>In HER2 over-expressing and triple negative disease, the data on early response prediction are less mature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, the evaluation of the dynamic test is the main objective defined for these sub-protocols. Without interfering with this primary endpoint, innovative new compounds such as T-DM1, Pertuzumab (HER2+) or nab-Paclitaxel (HR+/HER2- and triple negative) have been implemented in the sub-trials. Together with the dynamic test the ADAPT concept will provide important and rapid early feedback for future planning of large-scale phase III trials. Especially in the context of a vast number of new biological agents and the high costs associated with registration and marketing approval there is a major challenge for both new generation trial designs by academia and drug development by the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>The <italic>ADAPT Umbrella</italic> trial brings together the results of dynamic testing acquired in the different subgroups. It will allow identification of patients within all breast cancer subtypes, who have intermediate to poor prognosis according to conventional criteria, but excellent outcome due to high therapy efficacy. Due to the applied therapy response assessment, this population is identified as early as possible within the ADAPT trial. Consequently, the main hypothesis is to spare further unnecessary therapy for these patients, without compromising the individual outcome. The low responding population (i.e., potentially mistreated) may become another major future focus of ADAPT. Further adaptive strategies may be warranted to generate valuable information about this subgroup and improve their outcome.</p><p>The umbrella protocol design is a new powerful tool, especially in heterogeneous diseases like breast cancer, in order to apply one common therapy concept to all disease subtypes. Virtually any patient diagnosed with primary breast cancer can be included in the trial and may benefit from the early response assessment and further individualization of therapy by taking into account not only the conventional tumor characteristics, but also the individual response to the applied therapy. Last, but not least, the ADAPT concept is flexible enough to incorporate new sub-trials or to implement highly innovative treatments as they arise from early clinical or translational research.</p><p>In conclusion, trial sites and patients can equally benefit from the ADAPT concept by establishing one common trial concept for all breast cancer subtypes. The additional central pathology assessment assures and improves the diagnostic quality for the trial sites, the individual patient as well as the clinical scientists. Finally, access to new and promising substances for specific and targeted treatment of the different breast cancer subtypes as well as flexible trial design, make WSG ADAPT an innovative, while clinically highly relevant trial. It will contribute to the goal of therapy individualization for each individual patient by maximizing treatment efficacy in early breast cancer at the same time. The importance of this investigator initiated trial for clinical management is recognized by the fact that for the first time, payers in the German healthcare system are working together with an academic study group as well as partners from the diagnostic and pharmaceutical industry, in order to support the WSG ADAPT trial. Especially, since ADAPT is an investigator initiated trial where the monetary possibilities are limited, the advantages are outstanding.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The ADAPT trial is currently recruiting patients.
