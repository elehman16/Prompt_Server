This research examines several broad types of information about FDA tobacco regulatory mission that may improve the perceptions of FDA as a tobacco regulator. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, 1766 adults, smokers and non-smokers, were randomly assigned to view a statement about FDA regulatory authority that varied three information types in a 2 &#x000d7; 2 &#x000d7; 2 between subjects experimental design: (1) FDA&#x02019;s roles in regulating tobacco (yes/no); (2) The scientific basis of regulations (yes/no); and (3) A potential protective function of regulations (yes/no). Using factorial ANOVA, we estimated the main and interactive effects of all three types of information and of smoking status on the perceptions of FDA. Participants that were exposed to information on FDA roles reported higher FDA credibility and a greater perceived knowledge of FDA than those who did not. Exposure to information about the scientific basis of regulations led to more negative views of the tobacco industry. Participants who learned of the FDA&#x02019;s commitment to protecting the public reported higher FDA credibility and more positive attitudes toward regulations than those who did not learn of this commitment. We observed no significant interaction effects. The findings suggest that providing information about the regulatory roles and protective characterization of the FDA&#x02019;s tobacco regulatory mission positively influence public perceptions of FDA and tobacco regulations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>FDA</kwd><kwd>tobacco regulations</kwd><kwd>source credibility</kwd><kwd>perceptions</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-ijerph-15-00753"><title>1. Introduction </title><p>The Tobacco Control Act and the deeming rule give the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a broad authority to regulate all tobacco products, including their manufacture, marketing, and distribution [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Under this authority, the FDA&#x02019;s Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) examines and makes determinations on new tobacco products that seek market authorization, conducts rigorous compliance and enforcement programs to ensure that tobacco industry and others (e.g., distributors, retailers) follow the law, educates the public about the dangers of tobacco products, and funds and conducts research to support and establish regulations concerning tobacco products that are appropriate for the protection of the public health [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>To achieve its mission, the FDA&#x02019;s CTP is responsible for informing the public and various stakeholders (e.g., tobacco companies, manufacturers, distributers, retailers, and advocacy groups) about the FDA&#x02019;s authority over tobacco products. Public perceptions of FDA are likely to influence the public&#x02019;s and stakeholder&#x02019;s attitudes towards the agency and its tobacco regulations [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Perceptions of FDA&#x02019;s credibility as a tobacco regulator (i.e., its expertise, trustworthiness, and accountability in this role) may also determine receptivity to, and persuasion by, FDA communications about the harms of tobacco products [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Research in the United States (US), however, shows moderate levels of trust in government agencies, including those that were tasked to implement tobacco control measures [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. One study found that federal agencies, such as FDA, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) emerged third (42%) in ratings of trust in online health information resources after personal doctor (59%), and medical universities (48%) [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In a 2015 Pew Research Center Poll, only 51% and 71% of the US population reported that they view the FDA and CDC favorably [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A more recent study by Kowitt et al., (2017) found that only 43% of US adults reported trust in the federal government and that trust in FDA was moderate (62%) but lower than trust in the CDC (65%) [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Research also shows low public awareness of FDA&#x02019;s tobacco regulatory and communication roles [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. </p><p>Historically, public opinion about tobacco use has been shaped by promotional and marketing activities of the tobacco industry, which included decades of obscuring the truth about the addictiveness of nicotine and the negative health consequences of tobacco use [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Relatedly, tobacco control programs to reduce tobacco consumption have frequently been countered by the tobacco industry in ways designed to maintain its customer base [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Many rigorous and effective efforts have been undertaken to counter tobacco industry activities including exposing industry documents, the MSA settlement [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], advertising restrictions, major legislative action (The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, 2009, The deeming rule) [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and major tobacco prevention public education campaigns (e.g., Truth campaign, Tips from former smokers campaign, Real Cost campaign) that directly support FDA&#x02019;s mission by educating the public about the dangers of regulated tobacco products [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Despite great accomplishments for tobacco control in the US, industry activities continue to encourage the consumption of harmful, traditional, and new and emerging, tobacco products [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this context, it is important to establish and maintain a public and stakeholder opinion that understands and supports tobacco control measures to curb the tobacco epidemic. </p><p>What types of information would serve to increase awareness about, improve the credibility of, and enhance public attitudes towards tobacco control communications and regulations, such as those that were promoted by the FDA? The present study draws upon research on brand identification [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in order to test the role of three types of information in improving public perceptions of FDA. The first is information about the agency&#x02019;s regulatory role: what does the FDA do, and the rationale for its role to safeguard the public&#x02019;s health. The second is information about the scientific basis of FDA regulations: regulations are derived from scientific evidence. The third is information about the regulation&#x02019;s protective function. In this study, we examine the effect of one possible example of a protective function statement that describes the FDA&#x02019;s commitment to protecting Americans by regulations from unlawful tobacco industry activities. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijerph-15-00753"><title>2.

Discussion </title><p>The FDA&#x02019;s tobacco regulatory and communication framework is responsible for informing the public and various stakeholders about the FDA&#x02019;s authority over tobacco products and communicating the risks of those products to the public [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This study is the first to evaluate the impact of three types of information that characterize the FDA&#x02019;s tobacco regulatory mission on the perceptions of FDA. These types of information can be broadly used to facilitate understanding of FDA regulations as they demonstrate a positive impact on perceptions of the agency and its tobacco-related regulations.</p><p>Information on the FDA&#x02019;s regulatory roles increased participants&#x02019; perceived credibility of FDA. Source credibility, defined as perceived trustworthiness, expertise, and accountability of FDA as a tobacco regulator, is important to the persuasiveness of FDA&#x02019;s communications about tobacco products, and may influence public and stakeholder&#x02019;s support for new or existing regulations. Moreover, information on the FDA&#x02019;s regulatory roles also resulted in a higher perceived knowledge of what the FDA does. Previous research has shown that the knowledge of FDA roles in regulating tobacco is strongly associated with perceived credibility of the organization [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Knowledge also plays a role in persuasion and can influence attitude change even in the absence of actual change in information or knowledge [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Altogether, these findings suggest that communication strategies that provide information about the tobacco regulatory roles of FDA can increase public awareness and improve the agency&#x02019;s perceived credibility. </p><p>The FDA bases its regulatory decisions on scientific evidence, and supports scientific research to help explicate impacts of tobacco product use on population health [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Interestingly, information on the scientific basis of FDA regulations did not influence perceived credibility of FDA or attitudes toward the regulations. Since the FDA is widely known for regulating and ensuring the safety of food and drug products, it is plausible that participants already knew and perceived FDA as a science-based organization. Though over half of the sample had high levels of education, it is also plausible that participants in the study did not fully understand what it means that regulations are based on scientific evidence. Participants that were exposed to information on the scientific basis of regulations, however, showed a more negative view of the tobacco industry. Perhaps emphasizing the need for rigorous scientific inquiry to support FDA tobacco regulations implies that the FDA is working against an entity that aggressively promotes one of the most lethal products to people&#x02019;s health&#x02014;tobacco. </p><p>As a government agency, the extent to which the FDA is perceived to act in the public&#x02019;s best interest is key to its perceived credibility [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Consistent with this idea, we found that information on a protective function of regulation positively influenced the perceptions of FDA credibility and attitudes toward tobacco regulations. This finding is in accord with research that identifies benevolence and agency motives as influential factors on organizational trust [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which is a key determinant of how well risk communications are processed and received by the public [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It is important to note that the protective function statement tested in this study referred to protection from presumed promotional and marketing activities of the tobacco industry. Psychological research indicates that harm is mentally represented in terms of perpetrators and victims [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. From this perspective, a potential protective function of regulations could be designed to protect smokers and nonsmokers from both a harmful product (tobacco) and the agents who promote such a product, thus, involving a consideration of the tobacco industry. Relatedly, Lakoff&#x02019;s analysis of the concept of regulation indicates that this term highlights the perspective of industry (the body that is regulated) whereas the public perspective involves &#x02018;protections&#x02019; rather than &#x02018;regulations&#x02019; [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is worth noting that exposure to information on the protective function of regulations, even with reference to industry, did not influence participants&#x02019; perceptions of the industry. This protective function statement was also not intended to be used verbatim in any communications; rather, it provides an example of one type of information that FDA could use to inform the public of its tobacco regulatory authority. Multiple potential protective function statements may be equally effective. As FDA&#x02019;s approach has been to engage the tobacco industry as a stakeholder in dialogues to reduce morbidity and mortality from tobacco use [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], testing out other potential protective function statements for protecting the public from the harmful substances in tobacco products is essential. </p><p>Overall, the differences between participants that were exposed to information on FDA regulatory mission and controls were significant, but small. The differences are impressive, however, given the one-time brief online exposure to an informative statement about FDA. It is important to note that the effect of each informational statement on the perceptions of the FDA was not moderated by smoking status. Thus, the informational statements influenced both smokers and non-smokers equally. Some differences between smokers and nonsmokers were observed, however. Smokers perceived FDA as less credible than did nonsmokers and they reported weaker attitudes in favor of tobacco regulations. Smokers also reported less negative views of the tobacco industry. Such differences are not surprising. Previous research has demonstrated lower levels of trust among smokers in sources of health information [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and in government agencies [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, research on information processing shows that when a message is threatening to one&#x02019;s existing attitude, those who believe that the message is relevant to them are more likely to generate critical judgments regarding the message&#x02019;s content, quality, and credibility than individuals for whom the message is less relevant [<xref rid="B38-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this context, it is particularly heartening that informational messages detailing the role, scientific basis, and a potential protective function of tobacco regulations changed smokers&#x02019; perceptions of the FDA.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-ijerph-15-00753"><title>5. Limitations </title><p>The current study has several limitations. The study used a convenience sample of MTurk workers; hence, the findings cannot be generalized to the general US population. Though demographic characteristics of MTurk samples (i.e., higher representation of highly educated participants) do not resemble the demographic characteristics of nationally representative samples, previous studies have shown that MTurk is a valid recruitment tool for experimental studies on tobacco-related issues allowing researchers to minimize threats to internal validity [<xref rid="B40-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, studies that compared results from MTurk samples to results from nationally representative samples show comparable experimental and correlational results [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijerph-15-00753" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Since this is the first study to test types of information to improve the perceptions of FDA, the findings are preliminary and should be further investigated in nationally representative samples of Americans to better inform FDA educational efforts. Although data were self-reported, hence they are subject to related biases, such as recall and social desirability biases, we used attention checks to gauge participants&#x02019; attention to and compliance with study instructions; participants who failed these checks (<italic>n</italic> = 197) were excluded from the analysis. Lastly, we did not assess participants&#x02019; risk perceptions concerning use of tobacco products post exposure to information on FDA as a tobacco regulator. Future research will need to determine whether providing information about the FDA&#x02019;s role, function, and the basis of its regulations influences the risk perceptions of tobacco use. </p></sec><sec id="sec6-ijerph-15-00753"><title>6. Conclusions </title><p>Public perceptions of the FDA&#x02019;s tobacco regulations may influence the public and stakeholder receptivity to FDA tobacco communications and compliance with tobacco regulations. This study provides experimental evidence that casting the FDA tobacco regulatory mission in a frame that includes explaining the FDA regulatory roles, scientific basis of regulations, and the possible protective functions of regulations, may improve public perceptions of FDA and increase source credibility. FDA and other tobacco prevention organizations may examine this framework to determine how they may better communicate to the public various missions that are aimed at reducing tobacco-related diseases and protecting the public health. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Research reported in this publication was supported by grant number P50CA180907 from the National Cancer Institute and the FDA Center for Tobacco Products (CTP).
