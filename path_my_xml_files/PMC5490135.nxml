It is more frequent and troublesome during regional anesthesia. Around 40%&#x02013;60% of the patients under regional anesthesia develop shivering.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Shivering can be very unpleasant and physiologically stressful for the patient. Shivering increases oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) consumption to a level that is produced by light exercise, whereas severe shivering increases metabolic rate and O<sub>2</sub> consumption up to 100%&#x02013;600%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It may induce hypoxemia, lactic acidosis along with a linear increase in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) production.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Ventilation and cardiac output are adversely affected along with adverse postoperative outcomes such as wound infection, increased surgical bleeding, and morbid cardiac events.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Shivering also increases intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure and creates difficulty in monitoring electrocardiography (ECG), blood pressure (BP), and pulse rate.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Shivering may be detrimental to the patient with low cardiorespiratory reserve.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It is uncomfortable to the patient as well as to the operating theater personnel, especially during regional anesthesia.</p><p>Shivering depends on various factors, including age, gender, type of anesthesia, volume and temperature of intravenous (IV) fluid, duration of surgery, and temperature of operating theater.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Human maintains the core body temperature within a narrow physiologic range, but surgery and general anesthesia can alter this delicate balance between heat loss and production by depressing the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Prolonged impairment of thermoregulatory autonomic control coupled along with the cold environment of operating theaters and infusion of cold fluids contribute to a fall in core body temperature thus, leading to shivering.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Various methods are now available to control shivering during anesthesia. These include nonpharmacological methods such as the use of radiant heat, covering the patient with blankets to prevent heat loss and warming the operating theater to increase the ambient temperature and use of warm IV fluids.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Non-pharmacological method using equipment to maintain normothermia are effective but may be expensive and are not practical in all settings. Pharmacological methods include administration of drugs such as opioids (pethidine or tramadol), ketanserin, propofol, granisetron, doxapram, physostigmine, clonidine, and nefopam, but the debate on an &#x0201c;ideal antishivering drug&#x0201d; still continues.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The problem gets further compounded because of restrictions on drug licensing for opioids like pethidine.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Tramadol hydrochloride is a synthetic &#x003bc;-opioid receptor agonistic drug. It has a modulatory effect on central monoaminergic pathways, and thus inhibits the neuronal uptake of noradrenaline/serotonin and encourages hydroxytryptamine secretion which resets the body temperature regulation center.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] It has demonstrated effectiveness in controlling postspinal shivering.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine is an alpha-2 (&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>) agonist which is highly lipid-soluble and easily crosses the blood-brain barrier.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It exerts its anti-shivering effects at three levels: Hypothalamus, locus coeruleus, and spinal cord. At hypothalamus, it decreases the thermoregulatory threshold for vasoconstriction and shivering,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] at locus coeruleus -a pro-shivering center in pons, it reduces spontaneous firing, and at the spinal cord level, it activates the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptors and release of dynorphin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine is useful in the treatment of postoperative shivering.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Delaunay <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that clonidine reduces the thermoregulatory threshold for both vasoconstriction and shivering and suggesting it acts by inhibiting central thermoregulatory control. It is a potent suppressor of sympathoadrenal activity[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and has been shown to blunt sympathetic response to surgical stimulation and tracheal intubation. Bradycardia and hypotension are potential adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine is an established antishivering drug and is one of the most frequently used substances in prophylaxis and treatment of shivering. In some studies, sedative and cardiovascular effects of clonidine were noticed when a dose of 3 &#x003bc;g/kg was used. Therefore to minimize adverse effects, we decided to administer 1 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine. This lower dose of clonidine used in the present study was effective in the prevention of shivering.</p><p>Although, both the drugs have been used for control of shivering, studies comparing relative efficacy between the two drugs have shown contrasting findings. While some workers[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] are of the view that clonidine offers a better relief against shivering, others[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] report in favor of tramadol. In view of these contrasting findings, this study was conducted to compare the relative efficacy of tramadol and clonidine for control of intraoperative shivering under spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was conducted at Medical College, Kolkata in the Department of Anaesthesiology. After obtaining approval of the ethics committee and written informed consent from patients, 142 patients from either gender, aged between 20 and 60 years of physical status American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) Class I and II scheduled for elective infraumbilical surgery under spinal anesthesia were included in this prospective randomized clinical controlled study. Patients presenting with a history of fever, known sensitivity to drugs to be used, shivering even before administration spinal anesthesia and patients requiring supplementation with general anesthesia were excluded from the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Preoperative management</title><p>A detailed preanesthetic checkup of all the patients posted for surgery was performed 1 day before the surgery. All the patients were kept on fast for more 8 h before surgery. On the day of surgery, after the patients were brought to the operation theater (OT), IV line was secured, standard monitors attached and baseline parameters were recorded. Baseline temperature was recorded using a mercury thermometer in the axilla. All the patients were preloaded with Ringer lactate 10 ml/kg before giving neuraxial blockade. All the fluids and drugs were stored and administered at room temperature, and ambient temperature of the operating theater was maintained at 22&#x000b0;C&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C. Spinal anesthesia was performed with a 25-gauge quincke spinal needle, in a sitting position, at the L3&#x02013;4/4&#x02013;5 interspace (midline approach) with bupivacaine (0.5%, heavy) in a dose of 3.5 ml, to achieve a desirable level at T8&#x02013;T10 dermatome, in accordance with the surgical procedure.</p><p>The patients were randomly allocated to two groups: Group C (<italic>n</italic> = 71) received injection clonidine 50 &#x003bc;g IV in 100 ml normal saline (NS) over 10 min after administration of spinal anesthesia and Group T (<italic>n</italic> = 71) received injection tramadol 50 mg IV in 100 ml NS over 10 min after spinal anesthesia.</p><p>Grading of shivering was done as per wrench,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] which is as follows: Grade 0: No shivering, Grade 1: One or more of the following: Piloerection, peripheral vasoconstriction, peripheral cyanosis with, but without visible muscle activity, Grade 2: Visible muscle activity confined to one muscle group, Grade 3: Visible muscle activity in more than one muscle group, Grade 4: Gross muscle activity involving the upper part of body. The attending anesthetist recorded the frequency of shivering during the operative period after spinal anesthesia. A number of complete responders &#x02013; (cases with no shivering) were recorded. A number of cases of shivering and the time of appearance of shivering after administration of the drug was noted.</p><p>In patients who developed hypotension (fall in BP &#x0003e;20% of the baseline value) were treated with IV fluid and injection mephentermine (6&#x02013;10 mg.) IV bolus. Patients who developed bradycardia (heart rate &#x0003c;60 beats/min) were given atropine 0.6 mg IV Duration of surgery was noted. Recurrence of shivering was also observed until the patient left the OT. Any patient who developed shivering despite drug administration (clonidine or tramadol) were managed with rescue dose of tramadol 50 mg IV bolus. Side-effects and complications such as nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, allergic reactions, and sedation if present, were recorded. If patients develop nausea and vomiting, metoclopramide 10 mg IV was administered.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sample size and statistical methods</title><p>We planned the study with independent cases in each group arranged in a 1:1 ratio.

However, shivering restricted to upper extremities is relatively ineffective and insufficient to prevent additional hypothermia.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] It only increases patient's discomfort and causes further common perioperative problems by causing hypertension, tachycardia, and increase metabolic demands as well as interference in patient monitoring like ECG.</p><p>Several nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods have been employed to prevent heat loss and decrease shivering. Nonpharmacological methods include radiant heat warmers, warming the OT, blankets, warm IV fluids and using anesthetic drugs at body temperature.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] This study was therefore designed to standardize these possible compounding factors.
