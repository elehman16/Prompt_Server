Twenty patients with nonspecific back pain (abdominal draw-in maneuver group: n= 10, core exercise group: n= 10) were recruited in the study. Both group received exercise intervention 3 times a week for 4weeks. The test were based on muscle thickness (transversus abdominis; Tra, internal oblique; IO and external oblique; EO), disability (Oswestry disability index; ODI) measured immediately before and after intervention. The data was measured by SPSS program 12.0 version and analyzed by Paired t-test and Independent t-test. The following results were obtained. The thickness of IO, EO for both group significantly improved except for muscle thickness of Tra. The ODI were significant difference for both groups. As the results of this study, we suggest that it may be effective method to apply to increase for the thickness of Tra, EO using abdominal draw-in maneuver and thickness of IO using core exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Abdominal draw-in maneuver</kwd><kwd>Core exercise</kwd><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Oswestry disability index</kwd><kwd>Ultrasonography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain (LBP) is the general problem which influences the majority of adults once in their lifetime. Among those adults, most of their symptoms are naturally alleviated. However, minority undergoes LBP recurrence while the other feels constant pain (<xref rid="b10-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Dunn and Croft, 2004</xref>). The attack rate of LBP in lifetime is 60&#x02013;80% (<xref rid="b30-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Waddell, 2004</xref>), and during a year, 34% (<xref rid="b9-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Croft et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Originally, LBP is associated with the technical change of the surrounding tissues of spine (<xref rid="b1-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Adams, 2004</xref>). The change of spinal control is caused by the hypofunction of the myotome such as transverses abdominis (Tra) (<xref rid="b28-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Richardson et al., 1999</xref>). <xref rid="b17-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Hodges and Richardson (1996</xref>, <xref rid="b16-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">1998)</xref> conducted the study by using EMG. They reported that the preceded posture control, preliminary to the upper limb movement activates Tra. However, in case of the LBP patients, preceded control is not working, so that its activity is being delayed. In the external oblique (EO), the larger abdominal muscle, the attack site&#x02019;s activity was delayed when measured during the independent state. Also, in the internal oblique (IO), attack site&#x02019;s activity showed a change during the comparative study on the non-attack site of the chronic LBP patients.</p><p>Treatments for the LBP patients were passive in the past, focusing on the pain control by taking a rest. On the other hand, active treatment is the current tendency such as lumbar trunk strengthening, for the muscle strength and stability (<xref rid="b4-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Bendix et al., 1996</xref>). Also, exercise therapy of the body trunk is crucial in order to improve the muscle strength and stability which is good for the deep muscle (<xref rid="b31-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Weinstein et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) is the main for the strengthening of the deep muscle such as Tra, IO, and EO. ADIM is the exercise method which increases the abdominal pressure by pulling the abdominal walls to the inside that Tra and oblique abdominal are contracted. Because of the increased abdominal pressure, lumbar trunk stability training is effectively accomplished. Also, it induces the muscle contraction that excessive lordosis and tilts of the pelvis are reduced which is effective for the LBP (<xref rid="b20-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Kisner and Colby, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Recently, core training is on the rise as rehabilitation for the body balance. Hodges and Richardson used the term, stability and the function of the core muscle is to maintain the postural alignment. Also, maintaining dynamic postural equilibrium during the function movement as.</p><p>Tra is one of the important muscles in maintaining the stability and proprioceptive sense of the lumbar trunk (<xref rid="b24-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019; Suullivan et al., 1997</xref>). This muscle controls the lumbar region&#x02019;s joint because of its location and the direction of tissue. It manages the stability of the body trunk through co-contraction without a movement of joint. Core muscle system is the total component of a protective mechanism which reduces the stress that harmful forces are applying to spine during the functional movement (<xref rid="b2-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Barr et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Core stability is to maintain the inter-segmental coordination to the maximum point, and to control the body&#x02019;s center of gravity from the moving basal plate. Core muscle is where all the strength and motility is arising from, it act as protecting important muscles and bones by maintaining balance whenever body moves, and muscle-skeletal structure (<xref rid="b5-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Brill and Couzen, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The difference between ADIM and core training is that the muscle contraction is done in an isolation state or non-isolation state. These methods have shown significance effects with LBP patients, but the comparison between the effects of these two methods are not done. Thus, what we are attempting to find in this study is the influence of ADIM and core exercise has over the thickness of Tra, EO, and IO, also over the Oswestry disability index (ODI) via musculoskeletal ultrasonic imaging. As a result, it would help LBP patients to choose the most effective exercise program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Experimental subject and equipments</title><p>Among W hospital patients, twenty adults were chosen as subjects of this study, and all of them were diagnosed as chronic back pain. Their sickness attacked them over six months ago. They signed to the application form before participating in the experiment which was going to proceed for four weeks. Each ten of them were divided into the group of ADIM and core training randomly. There were no statistical differences between subject&#x02019;s general traits such as age, sex, height and weight (<xref rid="t1-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Those who have experienced lumbar region surgery, cauda equina syndrome, progressive neurological deficit, fracture, cancer, excessive lordosis and kyphosis were excluded. In this study, 10 MHz linear probe of musculoskeletal ultrasonic diagnosis instrument, LOGIQ P5 (GE Healthcare, LA, USA) was utilized in measuring the muscle thickness. Also, physical therapists with the experience over ten years about ultrasonic measure were chosen.</p></sec><sec><title>Muscle thickness</title><p>Subjects were filmed during the Supine posture, when lordosis of the lumbar region was reduced with the help of a cushion below their knee joints.

ODI is composed of ten questions so that subjects mark grades based on their performance, 0 with no pain to 5 with the worst condition. Lower grade means that the physical disability has improved and disability index is marked as percentage dividing total grade with the answered grade.

Muscles around the spine contributes in stabilizing, and the imbalance of muscle induces overload to spine while moving waist (<xref rid="b12-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Grabiner et al., 1992</xref>). As a result, it damages the musculoskeletal system, thus pain. When the back pain occurs (<xref rid="b13-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Hides et al., 2001</xref>), contraction of the cross-sectional area and decrease of the function of muscles proceed rapidly to the affected sides of the lumbar region when compared with the non-affected side (<xref rid="b25-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Panjabi, 2003</xref>). Rather than the direct damage of spine, instability of it, such as the weakening of the deep muscles such as Tra, is the main cause of the pain since it contributes in stabilizing spine by surrounding it (<xref rid="b14-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Hodges, 2003</xref>). Generally, illnesses occurring to the musculoskeletal system can be treated with the preservative therapy such as exercising program, excluding the case where surgery is needed. The purpose of lumbar region strengthening exercise for the back pain increases the stability and mobility of the surrounding tissues by stabilizing the posture, also it increases the lower limb muscles strength and muscle endurance (<xref rid="b32-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Yoon et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Core training is one of the methods to stabilize the body trunk; it provides stability by resisting to the influence of gravity in order to enable humans to maintain erect posture.

However, the thickness of Tra has increased 0.41&#x000b1;0.02 cm to 0.42&#x000b1;0.02 cm that there was no statistical significance. This means that the core training affects the abdominal muscles and its activity and the thickness of IO/EO but it does not affects the thickness of Tra.</p><p>In case of abdominal drawing-in maneuver, <xref rid="b14-jer-9-2-12-286_291" ref-type="bibr">Hodge et al.

Each exercise program showed significant difference, but core training was more effective between groups. In terms of muscle thickness, EO and Tra showed more change during abdominal drawing-in maneuver while IO showed more change during core training. In terms of ODI, ADIM group showed more change. These results show that abdominal drawing-in maneuver is more effective in terms of muscle thickness of EO/Tra, and ODI. On the other hand, core training is more effective in terms of the muscle thickness of IO.</p><p>This study was conducted to find out the change made in ODI and thickness of abdominal muscles after carrying out abdominal drawing-in maneuver and core training for 4 weeks sampling 20 people hospitalized in for chronic LBP. As a result, there was significant effect on the decrease of ODI between two groups and there was also a change made in the muscle thickness of IO/EO/ and Tra when it was measured by musculoskeletal ultrasonic imaging. In conclusion, ODI and the muscle thickness of Tra/EO showed significant improvement in terms of abdominal drawing-in maneuver whereas the muscle thickness of IO showed significant improvement in terms of core training. In other words, it would be helpful to choose isolation method, abdominal drawing-in maneuver, when abdominal muscle contraction training is being carried out while non-isolation method, training would be helpful in contractive training IO and ODI. Although the reliability of musculoskeletal ultrasonic imaging and ODI were high, medicines objects are taking were not controlled, accurate education was not carried out about muscle contraction method, and the proceeding time, four weeks, was short and these would be the limitations of this study. Longer proceeding time and accurate education about exercising methods would be required in the future study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</bold></p><p>No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-jer-9-2-12-286_291"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Biomechanics of back pain</article-title><source>Acupunct Med</source><year>2004</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>178</fpage><lpage>188</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15628775</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-jer-9-2-12-286_291"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Barr</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name><name><surname>Griggs</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Cadby</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Lumbar stabilization: Core concepts and current literature, part 1</article-title><source>Am J Phys Med Rehabil</source><year>2005</year><volume>84</volume><fpage>473</fpage><lpage>480</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15905663</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-jer-9-2-12-286_291"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Beazell</surname><given-names>ZR</given-names></name><name><surname>Grinstaff</surname><given-names>TL</given-names></name><name><surname>Mgnmi</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of clinical test and realtime ultrasound evalution of muscle contraction in normals and patients with low back pain</article-title><source>J Manual Manip Ther</source><year>2006</year><volume>14</volume><fpage>168</fpage><lpage>169</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-jer-9-2-12-286_291"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bendix</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Bendix</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name><name><surname>Busch</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Jordan</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Functional restoration in chronic low back pain</article-title><source>Scand J Med Sci Sports</source><year>1996</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>88</fpage><lpage>97</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8809926</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-jer-9-2-12-286_291"><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brill</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name><name><surname>Couzen</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name></person-group><source>The Core Program</source><year>2002</year><edition>1st ed</edition><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Bantam Books</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="b6-jer-9-2-12-286_291"><element-citation publication-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>YH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of Isotonic Exercise Program and Core Exercise Program on Isokinetic Muscular Strength, Flexibility, Balance, and Visual Analog Scale of Teenage Soccer Player</article-title><year>2010</year><comment>Unpublished master thesis.
