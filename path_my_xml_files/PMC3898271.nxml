Participants: 220 first time parents making a first dose MMR decision. Interventions: Web, based MMR decision aid plus usual practice, MMR leaflet plus usual practice versus usual practice only, (control).

However uptake remains below the 95% target required for population immunity at 92% (1st dose by 24 months) and 88% (1st and 2nd dose by 5 years) <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The incidence of measles is at its highest for 18 years <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. More widely, over 20 000 cases of measles were reported in 51 countries within the WHO European Region from January to October 2012 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In the USA, where childhood immunisation is mandatory, 211 cases of measles were confirmed in 2011 the highest levels since 1996 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These outbreaks are partially attributable to vaccine refusal <xref rid="bib0030 bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref> and strategies targeting different groups of parents who do not vaccinate their children continue to be needed <xref rid="bib0040 bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[8,9]</xref>.</p><p>Typically Government information about MMR vaccination, for example &#x02018;MMR the facts&#x02019; <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, emphasises the risks of not having the vaccine with the aim of increasing uptake. Patient decision aids are a different type of information resource that provide detailed information on the probable risks and benefits of having <italic>and</italic> not having the MMR vaccination. Decision aids also encourage people to actively evaluate this information in accordance with their values, to make a decision <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Encouraging people to deliberate about their MMR beliefs may affect their motivation to vaccinate <xref rid="bib0060 bib0065 bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[12&#x02013;14]</xref> hence their underuse in this context.</p><p>Few studies have evaluated decision aids for childhood immunisation decisions. In New Zealand, a childhood immunisation paper based decision aid reduced parent's anxiety about making the decision and encouraged promptness in vaccination <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. An Australian MMR vaccination web based decision aid resulted in parents having more positive views towards MMR, feeling more informed and leaning towards vaccination <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This decision aid was subsequently adapted for UK parents and its feasibility evaluated <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The findings suggested that the decision aid may support both informed decision-making and vaccination uptake. Finally an MMR leaflet <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> was compared with the leaflet plus a community-based decision support intervention <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Parents in both groups felt more able to make an informed decision with those receiving the community intervention significantly more likely to take their child to be vaccinated. These studies suggest that interventions focusing on the decision-making process for MMR vaccination are associated with parents making informed decisions, and may also impact positively on vaccine uptake. However, with the exception of Jackson et al. <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, evaluations have used quasi-experimental designs and so cannot provide conclusive evidence of effectiveness.</p><p>This paper presents the findings from the first cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a decision aid versus a leaflet versus usual practice for a childhood immunisation decision. Our primary interest was whether the decision aid compared with a leaflet could support parents&#x02019; informed decision-making about the MMR vaccine.

Impact was explored on two outcomes relevant to childhood immunisation, informed decision-making and MMR uptake <xref rid="bib0160 bib0165 bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[32&#x02013;34]</xref>. Only the decision aid achieved both outcomes. Several study limitations are acknowledged. Nineteen per cent of GP practices agreed to take part however only 16% provided parents (21% of all parents invited). Possible deterrents to practice enrolment were concerns about associated workload, ambivalence towards decision aids and fears of a negative impact on vaccination uptake. As a consequence we did not meet our initial recruitment target. However, we consider the study was sufficiently powered to draw meaningful conclusions because the ICC and the number of parents per cluster were lower than estimates used in the sample size calculation, meaning that the sample size inflation factor, and therefore the required sample size, had been over-estimated <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We do not know if parents who took part were different to non-responders, although their characteristics were consistent with parents who find making the MMR decision difficult <xref rid="bib0150 bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[30,31]</xref>. We are confident that the sample is broadly representative of the target audience for this decision aid, that is &#x02018;hesitant&#x02019; and &#x02018;late or selective&#x02019; vaccinators <xref rid="bib0040 bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[8,30]</xref> representing 20&#x02013;30% and 2&#x02013;27% of parents, respectively <xref rid="bib0165 bib0175 bib0180 bib0185 bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[33,35&#x02013;38]</xref>. Due to the study timeframe we recorded MMR uptake at 15 months of age instead of 24 months which is used for national COVER (Cover of Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly; <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>) data. Uptake may have been higher (in the leaflet and control arms) by 24 months. Finally, complete case analysis for the primary outcome was undertaken on just 55% of the data. Although we found no evidence of selection bias this remains a possibility.</p><p>Our finding that parents receiving the decision aid had lower decisional conflict than those receiving usual practice is consistent with evaluations of decision aids in other contexts <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The positive effect of the leaflet mirrors our previous research <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The positive impact of the decision aid on both vaccination uptake (which was higher than uptake across the five participating PCTs at the time of the study <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>) and decisional conflict is in keeping with previous quasi-experimental evaluations of childhood immunisation decision aids <xref rid="bib0075 bib0080 bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[15&#x02013;17]</xref>. What are the possible explanations for first, the differences between vaccination uptake in the leaflet and decision aid arms (in which parents had levels of decisional conflict associated with informed decision-making); and second for the high uptake in the control arm when parents experienced high levels of decisional conflict?</p><p>First, the decision aid framed MMR vaccination as a choice between two options, to have or to not have the vaccination, rather than as an opportunity to have a vaccination as presented in the leaflet. Importantly, it included an interactive values clarification exercise <xref rid="bib0205 bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[41,42]</xref> which prompted parents to deliberate about their child having the vaccine or catching the diseases. It is plausible that this deliberation process may have enabled parents to use the information effectively <xref rid="bib0065 bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[13,14]</xref> to make a decision consistent with their values <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, thus prompting action. Reading the information leaflet appears to have been sufficient for parents to <italic>feel</italic> that they had made an informed decision but they may have based their decision on the issues they focused on at that time, which are often emotions such as anticipated regret <xref rid="bib0065 bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[13,14]</xref>, rather than the evidence. This is consistent with the findings of our previous study <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and other childhood immunisation research <xref rid="bib0065 bib0070 bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[13,14,43]</xref>. It seems likely that the lower rate of uptake in the leaflet arm reflected parental inertia rather than vaccination rejection.</p><p>Second, uptake in the control group (99%) was very similar to uptake in the decision aid arm (100%). One could then question whether interventions to support decision-making are worthwhile as an uptake rate of &#x02265;95% is a successful population health outcome <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, the two arms differed significantly in the extent to which decision-making was informed. Post-intervention, decisional conflict was reduced to a level associated with informed decision-making in parents receiving the decision aid while in the control arm was unchanged from baseline. So while parents exposed to the decision aid were making a deliberative <italic>informed</italic> decision to have their child vaccinated, parents in the control arm may have been adopting a position of &#x02018;unquestioning acceptor&#x02019; <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Our earlier research <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> found that whilst most parents took their children to be vaccinated, two thirds reported that they had not made an informed decision, with some experiencing decision regret.</p><p>Finally, it may be argued that our findings can be attributed to the mode of information delivery (internet versus paper). However, increasing evidence indicates that it is the components of the decision aid (rather than the mode of delivery) that enable more informed decisions to be acted upon <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec0120"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>The concern about using decision aids in the context of immunisation is that their focus on individual choice and autonomy potentially conflicts with public health goals by deterring uptake of programmes with evidence of effectiveness <xref rid="bib0230 bib0235 bib0240" ref-type="bibr">[46&#x02013;48]</xref>. The consequences of which are particularly important when a parent's decision to not vaccinate their child has implications for the wider community <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Our findings, building on those of others <xref rid="bib0075 bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref>, suggest this concern is unfounded. Moreover, simply providing information without supporting parents to use it effectively may deter timely uptake of the first MMR dose, although this warrants further investigation. The challenge then is two-fold; to encourage health professionals and public health organisations to value decision support for immunisation decisions <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>; and to identify ways of implementing tools like decision aids into routine practice that are not burdensome to parents or health professionals <xref rid="bib0170 bib0245 bib0250" ref-type="bibr">[34,49,50]</xref>. The first should be achievable as health professionals and public health organisations are central in addressing parental concerns about vaccine safety <xref rid="bib0165 bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[33,44]</xref>; and these tools appear to help meet uptake targets attached to financial incentives <xref rid="bib0170 bib0255" ref-type="bibr">[34,51]</xref>. Regarding implementation, the web address for a decision aid could be incorporated into invitation letters sent to parents to use in advance of the appointment so they can come to the appointment ready to discuss MMR if they so choose. For parents who may be less likely to access this type of support, perhaps due to health literacy barriers <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> or cultural norms that don&#x02019;t value patient autonomy <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, other approaches to decision support need to be explored.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wakefield</surname><given-names>A.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Murch</surname><given-names>S.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Anthony</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Linnell</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Casson</surname><given-names>D.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>351</volume><year>1998</year><fpage>637</fpage><lpage>641</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9500320</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yarwood</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Salisbury</surname><given-names>D.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Tracking mothers&#x02019; attitudes to MMR immunisation 1996-2006</article-title><source>Vaccine</source><volume>25</volume><year>2007</year><fpage>3996</fpage><lpage>4002</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17395344</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0015"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="oref0015">Health Protection Agency [Internet].
