The COPD clinical course, punctuated by exacerbations, is frequently treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Chronic treatment with macrolides reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients; however, the salient mechanisms are undefined.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Although sputum culture shows altered bacterial compositions during exacerbations, the role of bacterial colonisation in COPD progression is uncertain.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In a recent single-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial with moxifloxacin, doxycycline, azithromycin (AZM) or placebo, the bacterial load of sputum did not change significantly.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, description of the lower airway microbiome has been challenging because bacterial burden in the lung is approximately 1 million-fold lower than in the gut and 100-fold lower than the upper airway.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> supporting the hypothesis that microbiota changes are linked with pulmonary effects.

<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Bacterial stress responses during antibiotic treatment could therefore impact innate immunity, benefiting the local bacterial community.</p><p>To explore the pulmonary effects of macrolide exposure, we performed a randomised trial comparing AZM treatment with placebo for 8&#x02005;weeks in 20 subjects with CT-defined emphysema who had not been treated with antibiotics or corticosteroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2016208599F1">figure 1</xref>, NCT02557958; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>).

All subjects signed informed consent to participate in this study and the research protocol was approved by the New York University (NYU) and Bellevue Hospital Center (New York, New York, USA) IRB# 8896. This cohort has 1984 subjects receiving yearly follow-up including chest CT and 447 have CT-defined emphysema. We enrolled 20 EDRN subjects who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: diagnosis of emphysema as documented in the report by radiologist and significant smoking history (&#x0003e;20&#x02005;pack/year). For all subjects, exclusion criteria included FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x0003c;70% predicted, age &#x0003e;70&#x02005;years, known cardiovascular, liver or renal disease (due to increased bronchoscopic risk), recent treatment with antibiotics or steroids in the prior 3&#x02005;months. None of the subjects had received any inhaled medication for at least 1&#x02005;month. For scoring of emphysema, a 6-point score of CT emphysema was performed and the percentage of lung voxels below &#x02212;950 HU in the entire lung volume was automatically computed (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary material</xref> for more details).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-208599.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2016-208599supp.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Procedures</title><p>Research bronchoscopy was performed at baseline using a nasal approach as described.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Briefly, two bronchoscopes were used, in which the first one was used to obtain a supraglottic sample. Then, the second bronchoscope was passed without suctioning until it was wedged for BAL. For BAL, the right middle lobe and/or lingula were preferred and 150&#x02005;mL of sterile saline was used for the lavage. Background samples were obtained by passing sterile saline through the suctioning channel of bronchoscope prior to bronchoscopy. From the BAL fluid, the total and differential cell counts were obtained after centrifugation. Subjects then were randomised to receive either placebo or AZM 250&#x02005;mg/daily for 8&#x02005;weeks. Based on previous data, we considered this treatment period sufficient to observe significant changes in inflammatory mediators.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Both placebo and AZM were prepared in an opaque capsule by the NYU pharmacy and were given to each subject after the first bronchoscopy. The NYU pharmacy controlled the randomisation scheme to ensure that the study was double-blinded. Each subject completed a pill diary. After 8&#x02005;weeks of treatment with AZM or placebo, subjects underwent post-treatment research bronchoscopy in which BAL was performed in same lung segments as in the baseline bronchoscopy. BAL fluid aliquots were frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Bacterial 16S rRNA gene quantitation and sequencing</title><p>DNA was then extracted from background, supraglottic and BAL samples using an ion exchange column (Qiagen). Total bacterial and human DNA levels were determined by quantitative PCR. The BAL samples used in this study were acellular BAL fluid. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA-encoding gene amplicons encoding the V4 region (150&#x02005;bp read length, paired-end protocol) was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform.</p><p>The obtained 16S rRNA gene sequences were examined using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology package for analysis of community sequence data. To estimate within-sample diversity (&#x003b1;-diversity), we calculated the number of distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at different sequence depths as well as the Shannon's diversity index. PERMANOVA (Adonis) testing was used to compare &#x003b2;-diversity of groups. &#x003b2;-Diversity refers to between-sample similarity based on bacterial composition. For &#x003b2;-diversity (between-sample taxonomic diversity), we used the ade4 package in R to construct Principal Coordinate Analysis based on weighted UniFrac distances. Additionally, Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was used to visualise potential clustering patterns among samples based on the estimated &#x003b2;-diversity and its relationship with dominant taxa. For comparisons of &#x003b1;-diversity, &#x003b2;-diversity or taxonomy between the placebo and AZM groups at baseline, non-parametric (Mann-Whitney) tests were used. Paired statistics (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were used for pre-treatment and post-treatment comparison of continuous parameters such as changes in &#x003b1;diversity post-treatment with AZM or placebo. To evaluate changes in &#x003b2;-diversity pre-treatment versus post-treatment, we performed Procrustes analysis of the principal coordinate matrices generated after &#x003b2;-diversity determination on each pair of BAL samples (before and after treatment) for every subject. False discovery rate was used to control for multiple testing. To evaluate differences between groups of 16S data or inferred metagenomes, we used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) in paired samples (before and after treatment).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> All data are publicly available in Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE74396 (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary material</xref> for more details).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Measurement of metabolites in BAL fluid</title><p>For metabolomics analysis, we used 4&#x02005;mL of BAL samples obtained before and after treatment with AZM or placebo to perform gas chromatography time-of-flight (GC-TOF) mass spectrometry. Identified metabolites were reported if present in at least 50% of the samples per study design group (as defined in the software). Data were mean-centred and divided by the SD of each variable using MetaboAnalyst. For association with discrete factors, we used the Mann-Whitney test (in the case of two categories). Paired statistics (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were used for pre-treatment and post-treatment comparisons of continuous parameters, such as changes in metabolites with AZM or placebo (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary material</xref> for more details).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Measurement of in vivo cytokines in BAL fluid and alveolar macrophages</title><p>In vivo inflammation was assessed by BAL cell count differential and cytokines. Since analytes in the epithelial lining fluid are diluted with sterile saline during BAL, a concentration step was performed via dialysis against Tris 10&#x02005;mM pH 7.5, EDTA 1&#x02005;mM and lyophilisation, using albumin as an internal control. For this, the initial volume of acellular BAL fluid was 5&#x02005;mL. After lyophilisation at &#x02212;80&#x000b0; C, sample was resuspended in 60&#x02005;&#x003bc;L of phosphate-buffered saline. This approach yielded measurable concentrations in 30/39 cytokines in a Luminex platform (Human Cytokine Panel I, Millipore) for all samples. The following cytokines levels were below the detectable limit of the assay (standard curve range=3.2&#x02013;10&#x02005;000&#x02005;pg/mL) and are not included in the analyses: interferon (IFN)-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b2;, interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-17. Values obtained in concentrated BAL fluid were extrapolated to represent concentration in BAL by dividing the obtained levels in picogram/millilitre by 83.3 (since 5&#x02005;mL of BAL fluid was lyophilised and resuspended in 60&#x02005;&#x003bc;L). Alveolar macrophages from baseline bronchoscopy in 12 subjects were isolated from BAL and cultured (10<sup>6</sup>&#x02005;cells/mL) for 24&#x02005;hours in Roswell Park Memorial Institute media with 40&#x02005;ng of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/mL (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 0.55:B4 and B5, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri, USA) with or without AZM (10&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/mL, Pfizer, New York, New York, USA). Since we observed changes in microbial metabolites during treatment with AZM, we tested the ex-vivo anti-inflammatory effects of two of those metabolites (glycolic acid and indole-3-acetate) in macrophages obtained from a similar cohort of smokers. To this end, we isolated alveolar macrophages from an additional eight subjects (two smokers and six ex-smokers) who were enrolled in an NIH-funded protocol (Lung Microbiome and Inflammation in Early COPD, NYU IRB# S14-01546, online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table</xref> S1).

However, mechanistic interpretation of the critical events has been limited by inability to comprehensively characterise the microbial community of the lung. Our observations of the impact of AZM on the lower airway microbiota, bacterial metabolites and lower airway cytokines are consistent with its known anti-inflammatory effects. During COPD exacerbations, neutrophils and TNF-&#x003b1; increase, a process associated with loss of lung function.

A large proportion of BAL samples were dominated by background taxa, which tend to have low bacterial burden. In these samples, the true composition of the lower airway microbiome is more difficult to establish due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. Studies that include subjects with higher bacterial burden (such in more advanced COPD) are needed to clarify the effects of macrolides on the composition of the microbial community of the lower airways. Of note, a recent placebo-controlled study did not show significant change in bacterial burden in sputum after macrolides,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> similar to the results of this study. Replication is also important because of the limited ability of a small study to control for the effects of multiple comparisons and the modest effect sizes in our assays. This is also important since it is possible that some subject's characteristics might have actually differed between groups but did not reach statistical significance due to the small sample size. Nevertheless, the paucity of changes in the placebo group, the observed changes in multiple platforms and the ex-vivo experimental validation increase confidence in the findings and interpretation. Moreover, our power to detect differences was increased by our longitudinal assessment, using each subject as their own control. In this study, we used acellular BAL fluid, a type of sample that has been used before to describe the lower airway microbiome.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref> Other studies have used whole BAL; head-to-head comparison of acellular versus whole BAL showed that in some samples, taxa differed significantly with loss of some <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Escherichia</italic> OTUs in the acellular BAL sample.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> While whole BAL fluid may somewhat differ in taxonomic composition compared with acellular BAL samples, the reduction of &#x003b1;-diversity and changes in taxonomic composition before and after AZM, but not in the placebo group, occur in samples that were consistently processed similarly. Thus, the observed differences cannot be explained by differences in technical processing or composition of whole BAL versus acellular BAL sample. Although we provide evidence that some metabolites of possible bacterial origin induced by AZM are anti-inflammatory ex-vivo, we cannot distinguish the antibiotic and anti-inflammatory effects of AZM in these subjects. Neither can we assess the effects of AZM on other microbial communities such as the gut that might contribute to the host immune phenotype. A transcriptome approach would help distinguish microbial from mammalian metabolic effects on measured metabolites. However, technical challenges due to low bacterial concentration further limit the evaluation of microbial genes impacted by AZM in-vivo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, AZM exerts multiple effects on the structure and composition of the lower airway microbiota. The concomitant increase in several microbial metabolites provides evidence that the lung microbiome is metabolically responsive to the AZM-induced stress. The stressed microbiome releases microbial metabolites with well-defined anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting that AZM's therapeutic benefit includes altering the lung microbiome interaction with the host immune system. Experiments in model systems, required to precisely define the anti-inflammatory effects of microbial metabolic products produced during AZM treatment, may yield novel strategies for COPD.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> Conception and design: LNS, MJB and MDW.
