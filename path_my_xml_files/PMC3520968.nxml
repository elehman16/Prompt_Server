Due to a defect of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene, plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) are elevated <xref rid="pone.0050032-Kasper1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In most Western countries, approximately one in 500 people is affected with FH <xref rid="pone.0050032-Goldstein1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Elevated serum LDL-C and therefore FH is associated with an elevated risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) <xref rid="pone.0050032-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, which is the disease with the highest burden in disability adjusted life years in the Netherlands <xref rid="pone.0050032-Treurniet1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. If elevated LDL-C is not diagnosed and treated, the cumulative risk of developing coronary artery disease by the age of 60 years is over 60% for men, and over 30% for women <xref rid="pone.0050032-Betteridge1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Yet, research has mainly been focused on the effectiveness of pharmaceutical therapy, whereas achieving (additional) improvement by lifestyle change has hardly been investigated in people with FH. Large primary and secondary prevention trials with statins have clearly demonstrated the benefit of reducing LDL-C in subjects with high LDL-C <xref rid="pone.0050032-Baigent1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050032-Kearney1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Also, Versmissen and colleagues showed an overall risk reduction in a large cohort (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2146) of people with FH that used statins <xref rid="pone.0050032-Versmissen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, lifestyle factors also appear to play an important role in moderating the course of FH <xref rid="pone.0050032-Hegele1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050032-Austin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The EUROASPIRE III survey, conducted in 2006&#x02013;2007 in 22 European countries, showed a high prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles among CVD patients treated by cardiologists, and moreover, use of medication was often inadequate to achieve treatment goals <xref rid="pone.0050032-Kotseva1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Overall, two main strategies are of importance to optimally reduce CVD risk among people with FH: 1) Improvement of compliance to statin therapy, and 2) Improvement of CVD-risk-related lifestyle.</p><p>A healthy lifestyle is mentioned as an aspect of the treatment of FH with many benefits beyond LDL-C-lowering drugs <xref rid="pone.0050032-Civeira1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In the most recent European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention <xref rid="pone.0050032-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, lifestyle modification is recommended for individuals at high risk for CVD. Results of primary prevention trials in high-risk persons and secondary prevention trials in CVD patients both show that substantial reductions in the CVD risk can be obtained through lifestyle changes <xref rid="pone.0050032-Kromhout1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050032-Blokstra1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. For example, the INTERHEART study showed that eating fruit and vegetables daily, being physically active regularly and avoiding smoking were effective in reducing the risk of a myocardial infarction by 80% <xref rid="pone.0050032-Yusuf1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Particularly, interpersonal and tailored interventions matching an individual's specific needs and preferences have shown promising results within a range of lifestyle behaviours <xref rid="pone.0050032-Hettema1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050032-Noar1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>There is a lack of evidence-based interventions that incorporate a comprehensive approach to optimise treatment goals of people with FH in the Netherlands, as well as elsewhere. We assume that lifestyle improvements can positively change biological CVD risk indicators, and that this would eventually lead to a reduction of the CVD risk. In the PRO-FIT project, we developed an individually tailored lifestyle intervention aimed at a CVD risk reduction in individuals with FH. At first, we investigated the efficacy of the intervention on biological CVD risk indicators: lipids (LDL-C, HDL-C, TC and triglycerides), systolic blood pressure, glucose, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference <xref rid="pone.0050032-Broekhuizen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In this paper, we report the efficacy on smoking, physical activity, dietary intake and compliance to statin therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and participants</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050032.s004">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050032.s003">Protocol S1</xref>. A parallel randomised controlled trial was conducted with measurements at baseline and at 12 months post-baseline. Participants diagnosed with FH through DNA analyses from January 1<sup>st</sup> 2007 to April 15<sup>th</sup> 2009, aged from 18 to 70 years and with a LDL-level&#x0003e;75<sup>th</sup> percentile (age and gender specific) were recruited from the national cascade screening program of the Foundation for the Identification of Persons with Inherited Hypercholesterolemia (StOEH) <xref rid="pone.0050032-Foundation1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Access to internet, sufficient fluency in Dutch and residency &#x0003c;150 km radius from Amsterdam were additional eligibility criteria. Invitation brochures were send by a research assistant to 986 people during six months (from February 1<sup>st</sup> 2009 until August 1<sup>st</sup> 2009) and resulted in 340 participants (34%), of whom 336 (99%) completed the baseline questionnaire, and 318 (94%) completed the baseline and follow-up questionnaire. The follow-up period of 12 months lasted until August 2010.

The PRO-FIT project was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Centre (under registration number: NL23932.029.08) and all participants gave written informed consent. The trial is registered at the Dutch Trial Register (under registration number: NTR1899).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Procedure</title><p>After the participant had confirmed to participate and had signed the informed consent form, the baseline questionnaire was sent out. Thereafter, the concealed randomisation procedure was carried out by an independent researcher. Participants were randomly assigned to either the usual care control group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;159) or the intervention group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;181) through a stratified computerised randomisation procedure using Microsoft&#x000a9; Office Access 2003 software. At first, participants were stratified according to cholesterol lowering medication use, assuming that medication use implicates treatment by a general practitioner and/or medical specialist, who could have already given lifestyle advice. In addition, we expected that a decrease in LDL-C &#x02013; the primary outcome of this project - because of the intervention is smaller if a participant already uses medication. Family members of the same household were clustered and subsequently randomised as a cluster to prevent contamination of the intervention effect due to spill over of communication about the intervention among participants. For this reason, the allocation ratio was 1&#x02236;1.1.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p>The intervention of the PRO-FIT project was developed according to the integrated model for exploring motivational and behavioural change, the I-Change model (2.0) <xref rid="pone.0050032-Broekhuizen2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050032-deVries1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Briefly, it assumes that the behavioural change process can be distinguished in three phases: awareness, motivation and action/behaviour. Hypothetically, due to gained knowledge and awareness of one's CVD risk, a participant will become motivated to change lifestyle behaviour(s), and subsequently, implementation intentions and action plans will be formed to actually achieve (maintenance of) behavioural change. In addition, it is assumed that this will eventually lead to a reduction in CVD risk (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050032.s002">figure S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention consisted of a combination of tailored web-based advice (<italic>PRO-FIT*advice</italic>) and face-to-face counselling complemented with telephone booster sessions (<italic>PRO-FIT*coach</italic>). The goal was to: 1) improve awareness of the cardiovascular disease risk through an increase of specific knowledge, cues to action and change in risk perception, 2) improve motivation with respect to healthy behaviour through an increase of specific knowledge and a change in attitude, self-efficacy and social influences, 3) adopt and maintain a healthier lifestyle, with regard to physical activity, saturated fat intake, fruit and vegetables intake, smoking and compliance to statin therapy, and 4) lower the level of LDL-C and other biological CVD risk indicators and thereby reducing the CVD risk.</p><p>The intervention has been described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0050032-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Briefly, participants were encouraged to visit a weblink referring to the project website, where generic CVD risk information was presented, containing feedback on CVD risk behaviours, their contribution to overall CVD risk, and cues on how to change behaviours. Thereafter, participants could log on to a personal account, consisting of six tailored advice modules on smoking, physical activity, saturated fat intake, fruit intake, vegetables intake and compliance to statin therapy. The module on compliance to statin therapy was developed at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, the Netherlands. The other modules were based on existing tailored information modules of the &#x02018;Healthy Life Check&#x02019; (in Dutch: &#x02018;Gezondlevencheck&#x02019;) of the Netherlands Heart Foundation <xref rid="pone.0050032-Oenema1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The modules on fruit and vegetables were mainly based on existing modules of the Live Healthy Coach (in Dutch: Leefgezondcoach) of the Dutch Diabetes Federation, developed at the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</p><p>On-screen personalised feedback was tailored to personal performance level (current lifestyle behaviour), awareness of one's own performance, as well as personal motivation to change, outcome expectations, attitude and self-efficacy. Personalised feedback to compliance to statin therapy was tailored on knowledge and personal beliefs about (the effect of) statin therapy, potential side effects of the prescribed drug and current compliance.</p><p>Subsequently, the participant and the personal coach further established the level of the participant's knowledge/awareness about FH and CVD risk factors. Furthermore, the assessment(s) and advice(s) within the participant's personal <italic>PRO-FIT*advice</italic> account were discussed and ambivalence and barriers related to the recommended behaviour changes were explored based on Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques <xref rid="pone.0050032-Rubak1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Further, an additional one to five counsellor-initiated booster telephone sessions were performed to further encourage the participant's behavioural changes. The two personal coaches had lifestyle coaching and nursing/teaching backgrounds and had received an additional 3-day MI workshop, incorporating both introductive lessons and practical training sessions with professional actors. Both participant and personal coach were not blinded for group assignment and intervention implementation.</p><p>The control group received care as usual.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Measurements</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Lifestyle related outcomes</title><p>The level of physical activity in minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity performed per week, as well as whether participants either did meet or did not meet the physical activity guideline of 30 minutes of moderate- to vigorous physical activity on at least 5 days a week <xref rid="pone.0050032-Kostalova1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, was measured by the Short QUestionnaire to ASsess Health-enhancing physical activity (SQUASH), which has been found to be fairly reliable and reasonably valid <xref rid="pone.0050032-WendelVos1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>Saturated fat, fruit and vegetables intake were measured by the short Dutch questionnaire on total and saturated fat intake and on fruit and vegetable intake, that have been validated as related to seven day dietary records <xref rid="pone.0050032-vanAssema1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050032-vanAssema2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. For the fruit and vegetable questionnaire also biomarker validity has been established <xref rid="pone.0050032-Bogers1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. From this questionnaire, a score for saturated fat intake, ranging from 0 (lowest) to 80 (highest) fat points was computed, as well as servings of fruit and grams of vegetables per day. One fat point equals 2 gram of saturated fat. Subsequently, it was assessed whether a participant met the Dutch recommendations for daily saturated fat intake, being &#x02264;28 gram/day for men and &#x02264;22 gram/day for women, as well as for daily fruit intake (2 servings/day) and daily vegetable intake (200 gram/day) <xref rid="pone.0050032-Voedingscentrum1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Smoking behaviour was assessed by a self-reported measure, asking participants if they were a current smoker, an ex-smoker, or a never smoker. Consequently, they were categorized as either smoker (if currently smoking) or non-smoker (if ex-smoker or never smoker) <xref rid="pone.0050032-Mudde1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>The five-item Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5) was used to measure self-reported compliance to statin therapy, which was found to have good reliability and validity <xref rid="pone.0050032-Horne1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Scores on five items were combined to a total score ranging from 5 (lowest) to 25 (highest). The items referred to whether participants always (1)/never (5) forget or stop their medication, decide to miss out a dose, take less than instructed or alter the dose of their medication without consulting a medical doctor and/or pharmacist. Based on former research, low compliance is suggested if one or more doses are missing, thereby assuming an overestimation of the actual compliance <xref rid="pone.0050032-Haynes1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050032-Stephenson1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. As a consequence, participants with a score of 25 were categorised as compliant to statin therapy, others (score&#x0003c;25) as non-compliant.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Other outcomes</title><p>Intention to change was assessed with a self-report measure, asking participants whether they plan to change behaviour X on a 5-point Likert scale (certainly yes (1) to certainly no (5)) and how sure they are of this (absolutely sure (1) to absolutely not sure(5)). Both scores were averaged and participants were categorised into motivated (average score&#x02264;2) or unmotivated (average score&#x0003e;2) to change behaviour for each specific behaviour <xref rid="pone.0050032-DeVet1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Both height (in cm) and body weight (in kg) were measured twice on calibrated scales. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from the average scores. LDL-C was measured with fasting finger stick samples analysed on a Cholestech LDX desktop analyser (Cholestech, Hayward, USA). The reproducibility and precision of lipids measurement by the LDX analyser are within the guidelines of the NCEP <xref rid="pone.0050032-Panz1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050032-Issa1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The Cholestech LDX analyser has been validated for point-of-care lipid measurements in clinical practice <xref rid="pone.0050032-Carey1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>A process evaluation was carried out, taking into account the process elements reach, dose (delivered and received) and fidelity. The research methods of this evaluation, as well as the results and discussion are extensively described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0050032-Broekhuizen3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In short, reach (the number of people with FH that took part in the project, as well as how representative the participants in the intervention group were for the study population and non-participants) was assessed by consulting the StOEH client database, as well as the PRO-FIT client database. The dose of all delivered elements of the intervention was assessed by logs that were kept by the coaches and the project database. Dose received, i.e. the way participants used PRO-FIT*advice (% of participants that logged on, number of modules finished), was assessed by means of log on rates and website use data. Whether face-to-face counselling sessions were implemented as planned according to MI guidelines (i.e. MI fidelity) was assessed by two MI experts, following the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity code (MITI 3.1.1.) <xref rid="pone.0050032-Moyers1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Self-reported measures were collected through digital questionnaires that were sent by email. Body height, weight and lipid measurements were conducted at the participants' homes by a research assistant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Potential baseline differences were checked between intervention and control group with linear and logistic regression analyses, including group allocation as an independent variable, and the following dependent variables: gender, age, education, BMI, medication use, LDL-C and whether participants met the recommendations on the different lifestyle behaviours at baseline. In addition, differences between dropouts and non-dropouts regarding the above-mentioned baseline characteristics were tested with linear and logistic regression analyses as well. If baseline differences were found, the variable concerned was included in further analyses. Effect modification of the above-mentioned variables and intention to change was checked and confirmed if the p-value of the interaction term was &#x0003c;0.05. Only in case of significant effect modification, outcomes were presented per category of the effect modifier (e.g. for women and men separately) as well.</p><p>Primary, a complete case analysis was conducted at the participant level, restricted to those who filled in questionnaires at both baseline and follow-up. These numbers vary for different outcome measures. Subsequently, an intention-to-treat analysis was conducted, involving all participants who were randomly assigned (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;340). Missing data on physical activity, dietary saturated fat, fruit and vegetable intake, smoking and compliance to statin therapy were imputed using multiple imputations. Five different datasets were created in SPSS (version 18.0) using Fully Conditional Specification and Predictive Mean Matching procedures. All available data on the above-mentioned lifestyle outcomes, as well as on group allocation, gender, age, education, BMI, medication use and LDL-C were included in the imputation model. Thereafter the multiple datasets were analysed as described below, using SPSS (version 18.0). Pooled estimates were computed following the rules as described by Rubin <xref rid="pone.0050032-Rubin1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. As no major differences were found, only the results of the complete case analysis are presented.</p><p>In order to investigate whether the PRO-FIT intervention had had an effect on physical activity, dietary saturated fat, fruit and vegetable intake, smoking and compliance to statin therapy, regression analyses were conducted. Linear regression analyses were conducted, including group allocation as an independent variable and the following continuous outcome measures as dependent variables: saturated fat intake, fruit and vegetables intake, physical activity, compliance to statin therapy). Because data on physical activity were skewed, we log-transformed them and conducted log-linear regression analyses.

However, evidence on the effects of such and other lifestyle interventions in a FH population is scarce. In a review on dietary interventions in a FH population, Shafiq and colleagues emphasise the need for large, parallel randomised controlled trials, since no reliable conclusions could be drawn from the included studies <xref rid="pone.0050032-Shafiq1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Until now, no indisputable effects have been published so far.</p><p>It may be that the intervention reach and true exposure (dose received) was insufficient to initiate behaviour changes. The content of the intervention was largely based on earlier tailored interventions, that were effective on behaviour changes, and our process evaluation indicates that participants were sufficiently exposed to the intervention. However, the results also indicate that only half of the participants logged on at the <italic>PRO-FIT*advice</italic> website and completed at least one of the advice modules, and that face-to-face counselling sessions were delivered with low MI fidelity. Mixed evidence has been published on computer-tailored interventions addressing more than one lifestyle behaviour. In their latest review, Sweet and colleagues concluded that single health behaviour interventions are more effective at changing specific health behaviours than multiple-behaviour interventions <xref rid="pone.0050032-Sweet1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Further, it appears from literature that multiple-behaviour interventions may be burdensome for some individuals, and advices may be too long <xref rid="pone.0050032-Nigg1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050032-Prochaska2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Regarding the low MI fidelity, it has often been reported that skills required for effective MI may take longer to develop than the 3-day MI workshop in our project <xref rid="pone.0050032-Britt1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050032-Levensky1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Probably, the provided MI workshop was not sufficient and more thorough monitoring and supervision of counselling skills during the intervention should have been built in.</p><p>The lack of large improvements in both control and intervention group, might be caused by the relatively healthy lifestyle of our population. Results showed that the majority of the people with FH in this project already met the recommendations on physical activity and smoking behaviour at baseline (physical activity: 78%; non-smokers: 81&#x02013;85%). However, this was the case for both control and intervention group. On this point, the FH population obviously differed from the general Dutch population, as survey data show that only 53% of the Dutch general population is sufficiently physically active and 73% of all Dutch adults are non-smokers <xref rid="pone.0050032-Zantinge1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0050032-Kostalova1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Though, there was much room for improvement with regard to saturated fat and fruit and vegetable consumption. Only 49&#x02013;57% of our study population met the Dutch recommendations on saturated fat consumption, and only one third on fruit and vegetable consumption.</p><p>The baseline self-reported compliance to statin therapy in our project (38&#x02013;44%) is comparable to those reported in the literature. Our results showed no significant intervention effect. According to recent reviews, the effects of compliance-improving interventions are generally small <xref rid="pone.0050032-Haynes1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050032-Kripalani1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. About 50% of the interventions proved to be efficacious, and effects on treatment outcomes (p.e. LDL-C) were often absent. So far, little is known about the determinants of compliance <xref rid="pone.0050032-Haynes1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Julius and colleagues recommended assessing patients' motivation to take prescribed medications, and to identify and address potential barriers to compliance <xref rid="pone.0050032-Julius1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>.</p><p>To our knowledge, the PRO-FIT intervention is the first to evaluate the effects of an innovative lifestyle intervention on multiple lifestyle behaviours among people with FH. The RCT was conducted in a sample representative for the general FH population with a small drop-out rate. The intervention is innovative in combining three communication channels: the individualised web-based approach added by the social interaction of the face-to-face and telephone coaching sessions. So far, few studies have evaluated the effects of an intervention that had combined web-based computer-tailored lifestyle education <italic>and</italic> motivational interviewing techniques on multiple lifestyles <xref rid="pone.0050032-vanKeulen1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050032-Prochaska3" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Thereby, the step-wise approach of raising awareness first, then giving tailored feedback and thereafter motivating people towards behavioural change, is thoroughly described and based on a firm theoretical framework <xref rid="pone.0050032-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050032-deVries1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Moreover, from the process measures reach and dose it can be said that the implementation of the intervention was feasible. Confidence in the validity of our findings is increased by the parallel randomised study design and absence of differential attrition.</p><p>This project also had limitations. Behaviour is multi-dimensional and complex to measure by self-report. The use of inappropriate or crude measures has serious implications and could likely have led to misleading results, for instance an underestimation of effect sizes. Although fairly reliable and valid questionnaires were used, the choice of a (self-report) measure often remains a compromise between the research aim, accuracy level and feasibility <xref rid="pone.0050032-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>.</p><p>Despite randomization of 4 clusters of family members living in the same household, communication among family members of control and intervention group was unavoidable. The Dutch screening program works cascade-wise; once a person is diagnosed (the index patient), pedigrees are consulted to trace other potentially FH positive family members. In a relative small country such as the Netherlands, families appeared to be wide-spread and overlapping each other, making it rather challenging to prevent communication, which therefore should be taken into account when interpreting the results.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this project suggests that in general individually tailored feedback is not superior to generic feedback regarding changes in multiple lifestyle behaviours in people with FH. Women aged 18&#x02013;40 years in the intervention group consumed significantly less saturated fats, and compliance to statin therapy significantly improved among unmotivated medication users in the intervention group. These results should be carefully interpreted, due to post-hoc analyses of relatively small subgroups. Research is needed to gain more insight in the characteristics of this specific high-risk population, for instance risk perceptions and determinants of behaviour, such as self-efficacy, attitude, motivation and social influence. The effects of the small lifestyle changes on CVD risk remains (and is due) to be investigated.</p><p>In practice, it is crucial to achieve an optimal received dose of a computer-tailored intervention, by e.g. reducing the burden of filling in (screening) questionnaires to a minimum in order to keep participants motivated, e.g. by creating a joint questionnaire, for both evaluative and tailoring purposes. Thereby, it is known that incorporating iterative feedback and interactive website components are positively associated with exposure to web-based interventions <xref rid="pone.0050032-Brouwer1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Further, MI training of counsellors should be more extensive, incorporating more thorough monitoring and supervision of counselling skills.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0050032.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>

Invitation brochures were send to 986 people. The recruitment period lasted 6 months and resulted in 340 participants. Three hundred and eighteen participants (94%) completed the baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Missing data on physical activity, saturated fat intake, fruit and vegetables intake, smoking and compliance to statin therapy were imputed using multiple imputations, allowing an intention-to-treat analysis based on 340 participants.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0050032.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0050032.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>
<bold>The I-Change model 2.0.</bold> The I-Change model assumes that the behavioural change process can be distinguished in three phases: 1) Awareness, 2) Motivation and 3) Action. Hypothetically, due to gained knowledge and awareness of one's CVD risk, a participant will become motivated to change lifestyle behaviour(s), and subsequently, implementation intentions and action plans will be formed to actually achieve (maintenance of) behavioural change. In addition, it is assumed that this will eventually lead to a reduction in CVD risk.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0050032.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0050032.s003"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
