Also many infectious and neoplastic laryngeal processes may require a surgical airway[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]. No absolute contraindications exist to tracheostomy but a strong relative contraindication to discrete surgical access to the airway is the anticipation that the blockage is a laryngeal carcinoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>].</p><p>Conventional surgical tracheostomy involves a full dissection of the pretracheal tissues and insertion of the tracheostomy tube into the trachea under direct vision[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]. However, the postoperative complications such as bleeding, cellulites-infection of the stoma and bad cosmetic results still exist and relatively frequent[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]. In addition, critically ill patients require transport from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the operating theatre[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>].</p><p>Although surgical cricothyroidotomy performed in intensive care units is rapid and simple procedure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>], but most otolaryngologists disagree with its elective use due to complications such as subglottic stenosis, vocal cord paralysis and recommend the procedure for emergency situations only[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>].

Patients with distorted anatomy, history of previous surgery at the neck, bleeding disorder, goiter, neck masses, unstable general condition or cervical spine trauma were excluded. Patients were divided randomly into two equal groups; first group (32 patients) subjected to percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT group) while the other group (32 patients) subjected to conventional surgical tracheostomy (CST group).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization was performed prior to study commencement as follows: Opaque envelopes were numbered sequentially from 1 to 64. A computer-generated table of random numbers was used for group assignment; if the last digit of the random number was from 0 to 4, assignment was to Group A (PDT), and if the last digit was from 5 to 9, assignment was to Group B (CST). As eligible participants were entered into the trial, these envelopes were opened in sequential order to give each patient his or her random group assignment.

Despite the long experience with ST, the technique still has many complications, with an overall incidence of 6%-66%, including pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema (4%-17%), tube dislodgement (0%-7%), bleeding (3%-37%), stomal infection (17%-36%) and a mortality rate of 0%-5.3%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>].</p><p>PDT has a number of important advantages over performing a ST in critically ill patients who require an elective tracheostomy. First, PDT was associated with a reduction in the incidence of clinically important wound infections compared with traditional ST, secondly and importantly, there was no evidence that PDT resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant bleeding, major peri-procedural or long term complications[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]. In agreement with these studies, we found that the mean duration of the procedure, lowest SpO<sub>2</sub> during procedure, PaCO<sub>2</sub> after operation and intra-operative bleeding, post operative complications and cough were all nearly similar between the two groups with no statistically difference between. Also in his series, T&#x000fc;rkmen et al mentioned that the PDT was not associated with clinically important hemorrhage, purulent infection at the stoma, or any lethal complication[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]. Griggs et al found that the PDT technique was associated with a shorter procedure time and a significantly fewer morbidity, in comparison to the standard ST technique and this is due to the good experience in their technique[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>].</p><p>While the mean size of tracheostomy tube used, postoperative infection after 7 days and mean length of scar tend to be less in PDT group compared with CST group with statistically significance difference between two groups. Delaney mentioned that it is not surprising to find reduced incidence of wound infection with the PDT technique and stated that minimally invasive surgical techniques is a factor for reduction in the rates of surgical site infections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]. In addition, the minimization of the local tissue damage with a dilatational technique and the relative preservation of immune functions when minimally invasive techniques are used may be a factor for such reduction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of studies comparing PDT versus ST has been published in which PDT was found to be associated with an increased incidence of per operative complications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] and the risk of subsequent stenosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]. However, the strength and experience of the operator may also influence the formation of tracheal stoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]. Despite this meta-analysis, many studies stated that the per operative complications are few and minor PDTs, however, have significant advantages when compared with the standard techniques of tracheostomy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]. Delaney et al reported that there was no evidence that PDT was associated with an overall increase in the rate of bleeding, other major complications or long-term complications, compared to ST but he mentioned that the PDT technique is the choice for critically ill patients who require a tracheostomy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]. Leinhardt et al recommended to keep this technique in the domain of surgery, and also pointed out that some doctors in non-surgical specialties, such as intensive care and anesthesia, have already been skilled in vascular access using the Seldinger technique, they could also be trained to perform percutaneous tracheostomy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>].</p><p>A meta-Analysis for percutaneous versus surgical tracheotomy stated that although significantly faster than ST, PDT has more early complications compared with open tracheotomy in the operating room or at the bedside. The long-term complications of the two techniques appear comparable but have not been thoroughly investigated. These findings suggest that a team approach between surgeons and critical care specialists is essential to select the appropriate tracheotomy technique for a given patient[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>PDT technique is similarly effective and safe as CST with low incidence of post operative complication. PDT reduces the overall incidence of wound infection and may further reduce clinical relevant bleeding and mortality when compared with ST. PDT may be considered the procedure of choice for performing elective tracheostomies in critically ill adult patients.</p><p>(Trial registration number:
