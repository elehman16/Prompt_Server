However, they may have disadvantages, such as a bad taste or refrigerated storage conditions. These disadvantages may be avoided by the use of oral solid medicines, such as powders or tablets. The aim of this study was to investigate the acceptability of and preference among four oral formulations in domiciliary infants and preschool children in The Netherlands.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Parents administered four oral placebo dosage forms that were aimed at a neutral taste, at home, to their child (1&#x02013;4&#x02005;years of age) twice on one day following a randomised cross-over design: small (4 mm) tablet, powder, suspension and syrup. They were asked to report the child's acceptability by a score on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS score) and by the result of the intake. At the end of the study, they were asked to report the preference of the child and themselves.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>183 children were included and 148 children were evaluated. The data revealed a period/cross-over effect. The estimate of the mean VAS score was significantly higher for the tablet than for the suspension (tablet 9.39/9.01; powder 8.84/8.20, suspension 8.26/7.90, syrup 8.35/8.19; data day 1/all days). The estimate of the mean number of intakes fully swallowed was significantly higher for the tablet than for the other formulations (all p values &#x0003c;0.05). Children and parents preferred the tablet and syrup over the suspension and the suspension over the powder (all p values &#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>All formulations were well accepted.

Parents were asked or called by phone for written informed consent and study participation at least 2&#x02005;weeks after the written information was provided. The results of the selection process were systematically gathered (date when verbally approached, healthcare clinic, recruiter, date of birth, child gender, willingness to participate, reason for exclusion if mentioned voluntarily).</p><p>Children were eligible for inclusion in this study if they were between 1 and 4 years of age and if their parents had mastery of the Dutch language. Exclusion criteria were: (1) significant developmental delay; (2) having swallowing difficulties, an eating disorder or a chronic condition requiring oral medication; (3) hypersensitive to lactose, having cow-milk allergy or having an allergy of unknown origin; (4) a member of staff of the preventive healthcare clinic considered that study participation was inappropriate in view of the family situation. During the study, the criterion added was (5) according to the parents&#x02019; observation, children should not feel ill when the formulations were actually given.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>Parents were asked to administer four oral placebo formulations to their child at home during normal family routines. They were asked to administer the formulations (4 mm tablet, powder, suspension and syrup) in the same way they would administer a prescribed medicine, however, without any physical or physiological pressure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ARCHDISCHILD2012303303TB1">table 1</xref>). In conformity with common Dutch dispensing procedures for immediate release formulations, chewing and coadministration/mixing with food or drinks was neither recommended nor forbidden. Parents were instructed to administer the formulations on four consecutive days; however, they were allowed to skip a day if necessary. In order to study any period or carry-over effect, the formulations should be given in a predefined, randomised order, and each formulation twice on 1&#x02005;day only.

Due to a lack of relevant data from the literature on the acceptability of oral formulations in (young) children, the sample size calculations were based on plausible values for the mean difference and SD of the VAS scores. The sample size for preference was calculated on basis of a statistical design where parents were asked to identify the single most preferred formulation. The same approach was applied as for the calculation of the acceptability. The sample size was set at 150 evaluable children, which would, in most cases, allow a maximum difference of 2 for acceptability and 0.2 for preference to be detected.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomisation</title><p>The study was randomised for the order of administration of the formulations by an RIVM employee who was not involved in this study.

The VAS score data indicated a period or cross-over effect by which formulations administered earlier tended to have somewhat higher scores (p value &#x0003c;0.0001). As a consequence, analysis started with the data of the first day only.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></p><p>This study is the first randomised cross-over trial investigating the child and parent acceptability of and preference among four oral placebo formulations in infants and preschool children. It is also the first study investigating the child acceptability of oral placebo formulations in a domiciliary rather than inpatient setting, with a double rather than single administration of each formulation, a 4 mm, rather than a 2 or 3 mm tablet, and with two different measuring instruments for child acceptability.</p><p>In this study, an indication was found that the mean VAS acceptability score of the tablet was higher than that of the syrup, and that the parents preferred the tablet over the syrup. However, when parents were asked to report the child's preference, no significant difference was found between the syrup and the tablet. Results such as ours provide an argument for the fact that child and parent acceptability and preferences are different outcomes providing complementary information on the suitability of a formulation. Preferably, these outcomes are investigated in the same study.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, the administrations were not supervised by the research team as this would bias normal family routines. Consequently, the evaluation of the child acceptability and preference relied on parental reports. This self-reporting methodology was not validated prior to the start of the study. Therefore, recruiters focused heavily on adequate verbal instructions to the method of administration and reporting.</p><p>Second, child acceptability may be influenced by taste aspects. The powder and tablet were manufactured from the same blend, so their taste was identical. However, the taste of the suspension and syrup differed due to the intrinsic nature of these dosage forms. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that any differences in the acceptability and preference among the liquid formulations were also related to taste.</p><p>Third, the recruitment was tailored to healthy domiciliary children between 1 and 4 years of age and parent with mastery of the Dutch language. Hence, the applicability of our findings to children outside this population, for example, children who are feeling ill, who are otherwise fractious or who are from a foreign ethnicity is left for future research. In view of the findings of the teams of Ansah,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> Bagenda,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> and Spomer,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> it is anticipated that our study's findings will equally hold for older children.</p><p>Fourth, chewing was not evaluated as it is common practice in The Netherlands that children may chew on immediate release tablets if they want to. Therefore, the acceptability (swallowabilty) of tablets that should be taken as a whole, for example, monolithic extended release tablets or tablets with essential taste masking, is left for future research.</p><p>Fifth, we did not systematically evaluate the parents&#x02019; reasons to decline participation. However, from the voluntary reasons provided, it seemed that parents were mainly &#x02018;too busy&#x02019; or having a second name suggesting a non-European ethnicity. It cannot be excluded that parents who did not participate in this study might be more reluctant to administer a particular formulation to their child than those who participated.</p><p>This study showed that the acceptability of 4 mm tablets is unlikely to be inferior as those of three currently employed dosage forms in infants and preschool children when aimed at a neutral taste. Thus, there is no reason to further question the acceptability of 4 mm immediate release tablets for children from the age of 1&#x02005;year. Rather than discussing whether small tablets should be the preferred type of dosage form for the development of future paediatric medicines, pharmaceutical industries are recommended to consider the possibility of developing two essentially different dosage forms alongside each other.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Oral placebo 4 mm round uncoated tablets, powders, suspensions and syrups may be considered well accepted dosage forms in children between 1 and 4&#x02005;years of age when aimed at a neutral taste. The tablets were significantly better accepted than the suspension, and there is an indication that they were also better accepted than the powder and syrup. Children and parents preferred the tablet and syrup over the suspension, and the suspension over the powder, but it was not clear whether they preferred the tablet over the syrup or otherwise. This study does not support the historic approach that medicines should normally be given to young children as an oral liquid formulation as other formulations may result in equivalent acceptability.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> DAvRN: conceptualised and designed the study, coordinated the participant recruitment, coordinated the manufacture and dispensing of the placebo formulations, was responsible for the liaison with the statistician (JAF), drafted the initial manuscript and approved the final manuscript as submitted.
