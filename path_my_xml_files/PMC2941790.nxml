Hereditary angioedema, resulting from inherited partial C1 inhibitor deficiency, is a disabling condition characterized by intermittent episodes of bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Icatibant blocks bradykinin B2 receptors, attenutating the episode. Randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of icatibant, showed significant superiority over oral tranexamic acid in 74 European patients and a trend to improvement in a similar US trial comparing icatibant with placebo in 55 patients. Outcomes for several endpoints did not reach significance in the US trial, perhaps because of low participant numbers and confounding factors: a further trial is planned. Open label studies have shown benefit in multiple treatments for attacks at all sites. Approximately 10% of patients require a second dose for re-emergent symptoms, usually 10 to 27 hours after the initial treatment. Its subcutaneous route of administration, good tolerability and novel mode of action make icatibant a promising addition to the limited repertoire of treatments for hereditary angioedema.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hereditary angioedema</kwd><kwd>bradykinin</kwd><kwd>icatibant</kwd><kwd>C1 inhibitor deficiency</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Hereditary angioedema: clinical features and current management of acute attacks</title><p>Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from a partial deficiency of C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). Those affected experience intermittent cutaneous or mucosal swellings or &#x02018;attacks&#x02019;, lasting between 1 and 5 days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-vhrm-6-795">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-vhrm-6-795">2</xref> Swellings affecting the skin are typically painless but may cause disfigurement, or difficulty driving or operating machinery if hands or feet are involved. Cutaneous swelling of the genital area may occasionally lead to retention of urine. Intra-abdominal edema, affecting bowel segments or viscera, is usually very painful, may be associated with vomiting and/or diarrhea, is occasionally mistaken for a surgical emergency and typically leads to temporary disablement, with full recovery after several days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-vhrm-6-795">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-vhrm-6-795">4</xref> By contrast, laryngeal attacks may be fatal. Lifetime fatality rates have been estimated at between 10% and 30%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-vhrm-6-795">5</xref> and 25% of families surveyed in the European HAE register reported an HAE-related fatality, almost exclusively caused by laryngeal edema.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-vhrm-6-795">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-vhrm-6-795">7</xref> Because the episode fatality rate of laryngeal edema is relatively low, patients may experience many such attacks which resolve spontaneously or with treatment, and therefore may fail to treat laryngeal symptoms as a medical emergency. Conversely patients may be so fearful of laryngeal swelling that they are unwilling to risk being unable to obtain emergency treatment by traveling any distance from their local hospital, resulting in social and employment difficulties.</p><p>Prophylaxis for HAE attacks is available; either with attenuated androgens which increase hepatic production of endogenous C1 inhibitor, or by antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid or &#x0025b;&#x02212;aminocaproic acid (EACA) which may exert a C1-INH sparing effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-vhrm-6-795">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-vhrm-6-795">10</xref> However, efficacy of these agents is variable and most patients continue to experience intermittent swellings albeit at a reduced frequency. Attenuated androgens are associated with androgenic side-effects such as amenorrhea, weight gain, mood changes or hirsutism; and hepatitis or the development of adenomas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-vhrm-6-795">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-vhrm-6-795">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-vhrm-6-795">12</xref> Therefore many patients find prophylactic agents insufficiently effective or have unacceptable side-effects.</p><p>For acute HAE attacks, tranexamic acid is of very limited benefit and attenuated androgens are not effective. Until recently, C1-INH has been the sole option for acute treatment. C1-INH is purified from the pooled plasma of volunteer donors and is subject to one or more additional treatments to minimize risk of pathogen transmission.

Inducible B1 receptors probably mediate pain and possibly erythema, while activation of constitutive B2 receptors causes local vasodilatation and edema. Icatibant is a synthetic decapeptide and competitive inhibitor of bradykinin B2 receptors. It exerts its action in HAE by antagonizing the vasodilatory effect of excess bradykinin.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemistry</title><p>The active decapeptide of icatibant; H-D-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-D-Tic-Oic-Arg-OH is synthesized in a solid phase peptide synthesis process. Thus, unlike C1 inhibitor, it does not contain human or other animal material. Icatibant is stable for up to 24 months at 5&#x000b0;C, and for up to 6 months at 25&#x000b0;C. This relatively long shelf life is important; current advice is that patients should keep at least one acute treatment at home and the majority of patients require only infrequent treatments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-vhrm-6-795">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-vhrm-6-795">39</xref> It is supplied as a 3 mL pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous injection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-vhrm-6-795">40</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>Icatibant is a specific competitive antagonist with similar affinity to bradykinin (1&#x02013;10 nM) for the B2 receptor, while affinity for the B1 receptor is 100-fold lower. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies did not reveal activity on other receptors or enzymes, including the cytochrome p450 system, thus major drug interactions were not predicted by these preclinical studies. Icatibant is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration, although individuals may show variation in its absorption rate of up to 25%.

Intravenous administration was investigated but did not offer pharmacokinetic benefit and was less convenient than subcutaneous injection. Icatibant has low protein binding at around 44% and the volume of distribution is 20 to 25 L, consistent with distribution to include sites of swelling. Animal studies indicate that icatibant is poorly distributed into adipose tissue and does not appear to cross the blood brain barrier. However, it does cross the placenta and is excreted in breast milk in rats.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-vhrm-6-795">40</xref></p><p>Icatibant is metabolized in the liver by cleavage to 2 smaller peptides; metabolites (90%) and intact icatibant (10%) are excreted via the kidney. Half-life of icatibant and its metabolites is 1 to 2 hours. Pharmacokinetics appears unaffected by liver and renal impairment in animal studies. Human studies of icatibant, for resistant ascites in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, some of whom had concomitant renal impairment did not raise safety concerns.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-vhrm-6-795">40</xref> Icatibant pharmacokinetics do not appear to depend on weight or gender but clearance is reduced in the elderly with area under the curve increased by 5% to 60% in an 80-year-old compared with a 40-year-old patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-vhrm-6-795">40</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacodynamics</title><p>Bradykinin inhibition studies with healthy human volunteers showed a mean EC50 (concentration at which 50% of the measured effect of bradykinin was inhibited) of 7.3 to 10.8 nm depending on the method used.

Results suggested that subcutaneous administration of icatibant was at least as effective as intravenous, with median time to first response of around 1 hour (iv) or 30 minutes (sc); 30% improvement (time to onset of resolution; TOR30) at 2 to 5 hours and almost complete (90%) resolution (TOR90) at around 8.5 to 16 hours.

Study treatment was administered within 6 hours of the attack becoming moderate in severity (&#x02265;3/10 on the VAS scale). Those with laryngeal symptoms were treated with icatibant on an open label basis, while those with attacks at other sites (the majority) were randomized to 30 mg icatibant subcutaneously into the anterior abdominal wall, or comparator (oral tranexamic acid 1 g 3 times daily for 3 days in FAST-2; placebo in FAST-1) in a double-blind fashion. The primary endpoint was the time to onset of symptom relief, as measured by sustained improvement of at least 30% on the VAS scale (TOR30), assessed for the principal symptom (for example cutaneous swelling or abdominal pain). Secondary endpoints were response rate at 4 hours after treatment, time to relief of secondary symptoms, time to start of improvement according to patient, time to observable regression of visible swelling, global assessment and overall patient improvement and, at week 24, a patient satisfaction questionnaire.</p><p>In both studies, patients improved more quickly with icatibant, with a median time to onset of symptom relief (TOR30) of 2.0 hours compared with 12.0 hours for tranexamic acid (FAST-2) and 2.5 compared with 4.6 hours for placebo (FAST-1).

There is no method for measuring icatibant antibodies but the low antigenic potential in animal studies (as seen with other short peptides) and the multiple treatment data provide some reassurance that this is unlikely to be a major problem.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-vhrm-6-795">40</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Recurrent attacks</title><p>The observed need for more than one injection in 10% is potentially of concern. Recurrent attacks are likely to be a consequence of the short half-life of icatibant, although continuing overactivation of other inflammatory pathways controlled by C1 inhibitor may contribute. Further information on recurrent attacks is available from Bork&#x02019;s dose-finding study. Of the 20 HAE attacks, 5 attacks in 4 patients recurred between 14 and 27 hours after the initial treatment, albeit not all treatments were at optimal dose or route. Four attacks recurred at the same site and one at a different site. All were mild and were treated with C1 inhibitor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-vhrm-6-795">42</xref> These observations are similar to experience in UK, where recurrence generally occurs the following day and is of slow onset, usually at the same site.

While not being directly comparable, results of studies of C1 inhibitor in acute HAE suggest that the icatibant and C1 inhibitor are broadly similar in terms of onset of relief and time to complete resolution of symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-vhrm-6-795">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-vhrm-6-795">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-vhrm-6-795">40</xref></p><p>In the European (FAST-2) trial, icatibant showed a significant benefit compared with tranexamic acid. By contrast, while showing a marked trend in favor of icatibant in the US (FAST-1) trial, the difference between icatibant and placebo did not reach significance for several endpoints, including the primary end point.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-vhrm-6-795">40</xref> This is likely to result from underpowering, since the low numbers were randomized for a treatment where delayed and variable responses are expected, and where the outcome measures are subjective. Additionally the use of intravenous rehydration, pain relief &#x02013; including with opiates &#x02013; and other symptomatic measures was greater in the placebo group. These almost certainly contributed to the greater than expected improvement in the placebo group, which was of sufficient magnitude to reach the endpoint of 30% improvement in several cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-vhrm-6-795">40</xref> The ongoing FAST-3 trial will provide additional efficacy data.</p><p>Icatibant, with a half-life of around 2 hours, is short-acting compared to C1 inhibitor (half-life 30&#x02013;64 hours),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-vhrm-6-795">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-vhrm-6-795">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-vhrm-6-795">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-vhrm-6-795">42</xref> and to the duration of a typical acute attack, which is 1 to 5 days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-vhrm-6-795">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-vhrm-6-795">4</xref> This is the likely explanation for recurrent swellings. In practice, recurrence appears a relatively unusual event with only around 10% of attacks requiring more than 1, and 1% requiring more than 2 injections. Since icatibant does not replace C1 inhibitor, attenuate contact pathway or complement activation, or reduce bradykinin production, this may at first appear surprising. Icatibant stops the progression of edema, and allows physiological resolution. Edema may recur if the effect of icatibant wears off while bradykinin levels are still elevated. However, the recurrent edema will often be subclinical since fluid accumulated does not reach a sufficient volume to produce symptoms before natural resolution of the attack.</p><p>Treatment of acute HAE with C1 inhibitor is most effective when given early.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-vhrm-6-795">20</xref> However, C1 inhibitor&#x02019;s intravenous route of administration can result in delays in gaining access to treatment. This has been partially addressed by the development of home therapy/self administration programs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-vhrm-6-795">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-vhrm-6-795">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-vhrm-6-795">57</xref> Self-administration of C1 inhibitor requires a high degree of patient motivation and support, and the majority of patients who have only infrequent attacks may be less motivated to undergo the necessary training. This is important, since failure to access emergency treatment in a timely manner is the major contributor to the employment, educational and social difficulties associated with HAE, as well as to mortality. The availability of a licensed subcutaneous treatment will facilitate administration by local and community-based healthcare staff without requirement for up to date intravenous skills. Assuming the reassuring safety record of icatibant is confirmed in clinical use, the true place for icatibant seems likely to be in self-administration, where it has potential to address a significant unmet need. In this respect, it may have an advantage over ecallantide, which has been associated with anaphylactoid-like symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-vhrm-6-795">58</xref></p><p>Home therapy programmes for children are less well established, perhaps due to the lower frequency of acute attacks prior to adolescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-vhrm-6-795">59</xref> or anticipated greater technical difficulties with intravenous access. There is a lack of effective prophylactic options for children since attenuated androgens are not recommended pre-puberty.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-vhrm-6-795">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-vhrm-6-795">39</xref> For the few children who have frequent attacks, a subcutaneous acute treatment would be an attractive option, although the pain associated with icatibant injections may be a problem. Repeated doses of icatibant administered to juvenile animals resulted in reversible delay in sexual maturation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-vhrm-6-795">40</xref> Further information would be necessary before icatibant could be recommended for trials in this age group.</p><p>Attenuated androgens are contraindicated in pregnancy. Therefore many pregnant women experience an increased frequency of attacks because of lack of effective oral prophylaxis and hormonal changes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-vhrm-6-795">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-vhrm-6-795">60</xref> Animal studies have shown that icatibant does not appear to have genetic toxicity nor cause structural damage to embryos.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-vhrm-6-795">40</xref> No human data are available and therefore C1 inhibitor concentrate, for attacks or prophylactically, must remain the treatment of choice for this difficult to treat group.</p><p>Despite only recently gaining a licence in many EU countries and in the US, C1 inhibitor has been used extensively for HAE and has an impressive record.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-vhrm-6-795">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-vhrm-6-795">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-vhrm-6-795">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-vhrm-6-795">62</xref> It seems likely that both C1 inhibitor and icatibant will be used, perhaps at different times in the same patient, according to circumstances. The advent of a second, complementary treatment option is a major step forward for this orphan disease.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>Dr Hilary J Longhurst and
