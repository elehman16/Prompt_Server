Low micronutrient density of locally available foods is a common problem in low income countries. Children of HIV-infected women are especially vulnerable. Although antiretroviral prophylaxis can reduce breast milk HIV transmission in early infancy, there are no clear feeding guidelines for after 6 months. There is a need for acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe (AFASS by WHO terminology) foods for both HIV-exposed and unexposed children after 6 months of age.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We conducted in Lusaka, Zambia, a randomised double-blind trial of two locally made infant foods: porridges made of flour composed of maize, beans, bambaranuts and groundnuts. One flour contained a basal and the other a rich level of micronutrient fortification. Infants (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;743) aged 6 months were randomised to receive either regime for 12 months. The primary outcome was stunting (length-for-age Z&#x0003c;&#x02212;2) at age 18 months. No significant differences were seen between trial arms overall in proportion stunted at 18 months (adjusted odds ratio 0.87; 95&#x00025; CI 0.50, 1.53; P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.63), mean length-for-age Z score, or rate of hospital referral or death. Among children of HIV-infected mothers who breastfed &#x0003c;6 months (53&#x00025; of HIV-infected mothers), the richly-fortified porridge increased length-for-age and reduced stunting (adjusted odds ratio 0.17; 95&#x00025; CI 0.04, 0.84; P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03). Rich fortification improved iron status at 18 months as measured by hemoglobin, ferritin and serum transferrin receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the whole study population, the rich micronutrient fortification did not reduce stunting or hospital referral but did improve iron status and reduce anemia. Importantly, in the infants of HIV-infected mothers who stopped breastfeeding before 6 months, the rich fortification improved linear growth. Provision of such fortified foods may benefit health of these high risk infants.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Controlled-Trials.com <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/trial/835053/ISRCTN37460449">ISRCTN37460449</ext-link>

HIV-exposed infants, even if not themselves infected, are at increased risk of poor growth and death; mechanisms are unclear but likely involve nutrition <xref rid="pone.0011165-Filteau1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. HIV-infected women are advised to exclusively breastfeed their infants unless they have access to replacement foods which are acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe (AFASS; <xref rid="pone.0011165-World3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>). Recent studies have shown that providing antiretroviral drugs to women or infants for the first few months after delivery can reduce breast milk transmission of HIV <xref rid="pone.0011165-Mofenson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, it remains unclear when to stop these antiretrovirals in women who do not yet need them for their own health and when HIV-infected women should stop breastfeeding. Given the continuing transmission risk throughout breastfeeding <xref rid="pone.0011165-Mofenson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, many HIV-infected women wish to stop early, especially if their infant is HIV-negative at around 6 months old. Furthermore, after about 6 months, other foods need to be introduced to the infant's diet, whether or not the mother continues to breastfeed <xref rid="pone.0011165-World2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Unfortunately, in much of sub-Saharan Africa available foods for infants are grossly inadequate whether they are fed as complementary foods or as replacement foods in the absence of breastfeeding <xref rid="pone.0011165-Filteau1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011165-World4" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011165-Lunney1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>A major problem with available infant foods is low micronutrient density. <xref rid="pone.0011165-Dewey1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> Micronutrient deficiencies are common in Zambia. <xref rid="pone.0011165-Famine1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011165-Gitau1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> Micronutrient-rich foods are often expensive and fortification of widely consumed foods may be a more effective intervention to improve micronutrient status than promotion of consumption of foods naturally rich in micronutrients. Furthermore, central fortification requires less active consumer participation than micronutrient supplementation and is not associated with adverse effects seen with some supplements, notably iron <xref rid="pone.0011165-Sazawal1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Zambia has a track record of successful implementation of universal fortification of sugar with vitamin A and salt with iodine. <xref rid="pone.0011165-Famine1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011165-Serlemitsos1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> There have been plans to fortify the staple, maize, with several micronutrients. <xref rid="pone.0011165-Famine1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> However, the fortificant levels for general consumption are unlikely to meet the micronutrient needs of young children who have fast growth rates yet low food intakes. The requirements for many micronutrients in children aged 6 to 24 months are not well known and have often been extrapolated from levels consumed by healthy, older children.<xref rid="pone.0011165-Dewey1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> As a result, some estimated requirements may be in excess of the true requirements and it may be unnecessarily costly to meet them. A recent meta-analysis <xref rid="pone.0011165-Ramakrishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> concluded that multiple micronutrient interventions had modest benefits for linear growth among primarily breastfed infants and young children but the trials have not addressed non-breastfed infants.</p><p>We have conducted a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial of the efficacy of two locally produced complementary/replacement foods, fortified with different levels of micronutrients, for infants aged 6 to 18 months. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating AFASS foods for infants of HIV-infected mothers after 6 months, is the largest trial of multiple micronutrients for children of this age <xref rid="pone.0011165-Ramakrishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and is a relatively rare double-blind, controlled trial of a food-based intervention. Many previous studies have used supplementation approaches which are generally easier to run and control at the trial stage but use interventions which may be less easy to implement sustainably than fortification approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The trial is registered as ISRCTN37460449 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct">www.controlled-trials.com/mrct</ext-link>).

Children were randomised to one of two locally produced porridges at age 6 months, and were followed monthly for 12 months. The primary outcome was the prevalence of stunting at 18 months, chosen since stunting begins in early infancy, is the most common form of malnutrition in young children, is largely irreversible, and is associated with long term poor health and development. The key secondary outcome was hospital referral or death.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study population and recruitment</title><p>The trial was conducted in Chilenje, Lusaka, Zambia, from October 2005 to July 2009. Infants were recruited by informing mothers attending the child health section of the government clinic on the same site as the project clinic. As over 90&#x00025; of Lusaka women bring their infants to the clinic for monthly weighing or standard early vaccinations, <xref rid="pone.0011165-World5" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> the population hearing about the study was representative of the area. According to Zambian government policy, all children receive the following vitamin A supplements at these ages: 0&#x02013;5 months and not breastfeeding 15 mg, all children 6&#x02013;11 months 30 mg, all children 12&#x02013;59 months 60 mg. Study staff arranged for the 6, 12 and 18 month doses for study children.</p><p>Infants were eligible if they were 6 months &#x0002b;/&#x02212;2 weeks old and in generally good health and their mothers gave written consent to attend monthly clinic visits for the next year, feed their infants the allocated porridge, have their infant undergo project tests including blood and urine sampling, and have their child tested for HIV at 18 months old. Knowledge of maternal HIV status was not a requirement for joining the study but 90&#x00025; of women knew their status from antenatal HIV antibody testing in the government health service using the same algorithm described below for project testing.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation was in blocks of 20; the code was held by the project Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). One kg bags of porridge flour were labelled with the participant ID number. At the recommendation of the DSMB, the randomisation and labelling process was audited halfway through the study by an independent observer and found to be robust, accurate and able to maintain blinding of other study staff and participants.</p><p>Infants were allotted to porridges by sequential numbers on recruitment. Twins (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13 pairs) were randomised to the same diet and included in analyses as separate individuals. There was one serious protocol violation: during May &#x02013; June 2007 one porridge ran out but staff continued to recruit to the other treatment; the children who were thus not appropriately randomised were followed for ethical reasons but are not included in the present analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study porridges</title><p>The two flours, based on maize, beans, bambaranuts and groundnuts, were similar in bulk ingredients and macronutrient content but differed in micronutrient content (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0011165-t001">Table 1</xref>). The flours were mixed with water to make porridges for infant feeding, similar in consistency and appearance to those in current local use. In pilot work, porridges were found to be acceptable <xref rid="pone.0011165-Owino1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> to the local population and to displace other micronutrient-poor complementary or family foods but not to displace breast milk intake <xref rid="pone.0011165-Owino2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The energy density of the porridge prepared according to package directions (equivalent to 30g blended in 250 ml water) was 0.76 kcal/g; <xref rid="pone.0011165-Owino3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> protein represented 16&#x00025; of energy.

Diarrhea was defined as at least 3 loose stools or one bulky watery stool in the past 24 hours. Pneumonia was defined as history of cough or difficulty breathing plus rapid breathing (&#x02265;50 breaths/minute for infants and &#x02265;40 breaths/minute for older children) with or without subcostal recession.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>HIV testing</title><p>Serum samples from all children at 18 months were tested for antibodies to HIV.

After controlling for baseline length-for-age Z score, socioeconomic status and maternal education, indices of linear growth were significantly increased by treatment among children of HIV-infected women breastfed for less than 6 months; higher adherence was associated with greater benefit.

This trend appeared to be mostly due to effects in children who were HIV-infected, but appeared independent of breastfeeding duration.</p><fig id="pone-0011165-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0011165.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Kaplan-Meier estimates of survivor function for hospital referral or death.</title><p>All 12 deaths occurred in hospital.

This translated into modest improvements in linear growth amongst the subgroup of children of HIV-infected mothers who stopped breastfeeding before 6 months but had no effect on linear growth or hospital referral of the group as a whole. Among children of HIV-infected mothers, there was a non-significant trend towards increased referrals in the richly-fortified arm.</p><p>The population has clear evidence of deficiencies in iron and vitamin A, as determined in this and previous work <xref rid="pone.0011165-Gitau1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Therefore, an effect of the richly-fortified porridge on iron status is important. It is interesting that this was achieved even though children's intake of porridge was only about half the estimate used for determining the micronutrient levels in the richly-fortified porridge. The porridge was also generally prepared more dilute than given in the instructions but, based on the pilot study for the trial <xref rid="pone.0011165-Owino2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, calories were not the limiting factor in these children's diets and increasing porridge energy density using &#x003b1;-amylase did not affect growth.</p><p>All children were provided with porridge and medical care which could be why the overall stunting rate was lower than the 40&#x00025; <xref rid="pone.0011165-World8" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> used in sample size estimates. This 40&#x00025; rate is consistent with the 36&#x00025; stunting we measured among Chilenje clinic children aged 18 months who were not part of the CIGNIS study because they reached 6 months old before the recruitment period but were otherwise similar. The risk of stunting among study children compared with clinic children was: OR 0.46; 95&#x00025; CI 0.25, 0.87; P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.007. Therefore, effects of rich fortification, compared with basal, on stunting may have been hard to detect. This problem has been seen in other food-based intervention trials <xref rid="pone.0011165-Lartey1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> in low income countries where providing the control group with food is essential both ethically and logistically, i.e. to ensure equivalent compliance between groups. Low stunting prevalence could also have resulted from biased recruitment due to a refusal rate which was higher than expected, based on our previous study in Chilenje. However, we determined that birth weights of CIGNIS children were virtually identical to those of the total population of infants born in Chilenje clinic during the same period (data not shown).</p><p>Importantly, the overall rate of hospital referral plus death did not differ between treatment groups. In the richly-fortified porridge group, there were no mortalities among infants of HIV-negative mothers. Among HIV-exposed children, there was a non-significant trend toward increased referrals in the richly-fortified group, with only pneumonia referrals increased. The subgroup analysis by maternal HIV status was planned because of its policy relevance but numbers were small; thus, the trend may be from chance and should be interpreted with caution. If not chance, possible explanatory factors include: an immune reconstitution syndrome <xref rid="pone.0011165-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> which could lead to increased respiratory symptoms; increased respiratory symptoms as have been previously observed following vitamin A supplementation <xref rid="pone.0011165-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> but not fortification; folate antagonism of the cotrimoxazole <xref rid="pone.0011165-Safrin1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> which the all children of HIV-infected mothers were given as standard of care; operational issues regarding differential diagnoses resulting from improved prevention and treatment of malaria. <xref rid="pone.0011165-Chanda1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> Adverse effects of iron on malaria, as reported with iron supplementation of Tanzanian children, <xref rid="pone.0011165-Sazawal1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> are unlikely since there were fewer malaria referrals for children given the richly-fortified porridge. Other infections may also be increased following iron supplementation of non-deficient children <xref rid="pone.0011165-Sazawal1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> but we are not aware of studies showing increased illness with iron fortification. Since micronutrient fortification is a key part of prevention of micronutrient deficiencies globally,<xref rid="pone.0011165-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> factors leading to hospital referral among this population are important and are under further investigation.</p><p>Although antiretroviral prophylaxis can reduce HIV transmission during early lactation <xref rid="pone.0011165-Mofenson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and although HIV-infected infants should continue breastfeeding <xref rid="pone.0011165-World3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, optimal feeding practises for HIV-exposed, uninfected infants over 6 months is a current concern for policy and practice. In our study, among middle class urban HIV-infected women with access to treated water and good medical care, there was no overall effect of breastfeeding after 6 months on stunting. Provision of the richly-fortified porridge improved linear growth among non-breastfed infants of HIV-infected mothers. A recently published study also from Lusaka found growth faltering, as measured by weight-for-age, among children whose HIV-infected mothers stopped breastfeeding early but no such faltering as measured by length-for-age. <xref rid="pone.0011165-Arpadi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> Given the effects on linear growth we found among HIV-exposed children breastfed &#x0003c;6 months, it is likely relevant that we used considerably higher fortificant levels for the richly-fortified porridge than were in the maize blend cereal provided in the other study.</p><p>In summary, the rich micronutrient fortification did not reduce stunting or hospital referral but did improve iron status and reduce anemia. For the large proportion of HIV-infected mothers who stopped breastfeeding before 6 months, the richly micronutrient-fortified porridge may be a choice which could benefit their children's linear growth. However, the major effects on stunting appear to have resulted from factors, possibly improved health care, associated with participation in the study, as has been seen elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0011165-Fillol1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, not from higher intake of micronutrients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0011165.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(0.11 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0011165.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0011165.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(0.06 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0011165.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Quality Commodities, Lusaka, especially production manager, Mr. Chongo, for preparing and storing the flours; to the Data Safety and Monitoring Board &#x02013; Dr. Paul Kelly, Dr. Jim Todd, Dr. Nigel Rollins &#x02013; for their considered efforts to monitor and support the trial; to Max Katubulushi, UTH, for audit of the diet randomisation and distribution processes, and to Gabi Meineke, LSHTM, for help with financial and logistic management.
