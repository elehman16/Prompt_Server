training on the balance, gait, and falls efficacy of stroke patients. [Subjects]
Twenty-four stroke patients participated in this study. The subjects were randomly
allocated to one of two groups: the trampoline group (n=12) or the control group (n=12).
[Methods] Both groups participated in conventional physical therapy for thirty minutes per
day, three times a week for six weeks. The trampoline group also took part in trampoline
training for thirty minutes per day, three times a week for six weeks. We evaluated
balance (Berg balance scale, timed up and go test), gait (dynamic gait index), and falls
efficacy (falls efficacy scale-K) to confirm the effects of the intervention. [Results]
Both the trampoline and the control group showed significant improvements in balance,
gait, and falls efficacy compared to before the intervention, and the improvements were
significantly greater in the trampoline group than in the control group. [Conclusion]
Modified trampoline training resulted in significantly improved balance, dynamic gait, and
falls efficacy of stroke patients compared to the control group. These results suggest
that modified trampoline training is feasible and effective at improving balance, dynamic
gait, and falls efficacy after stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Trampoline</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a sudden loss of neurological function caused by the disturbance of cerebral
blood flow. Clinically, various impairments appear including changes in levels of
consciousness, and sensory, motor, cognitive, perceptual, and language impairments<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Aspects of disability due to stroke vary
depending on the degree and area of the damage. Generally, disorders such as a decrease in
muscular strength of hemiplegic patients<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>,
a slowing of the rate at which power is generated<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and muscle weakness are seen, along with a possible limitation of
the joint range of motion<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
aforementioned problems result in decreases in walking speed and walking ability, balance
impairment, altered balance confidence, and reduced mobility due to worries about
falling<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, an important focus
of rehabilitation for chronic stroke patients is the development of interventions to promote
balance and functional movement<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Recently, a trampoline training program was reported to be effective for various target
groups, improving postural control, balance and exercise performance. The trampoline is a
balance training device that requires strong integration of the neuromuscular system. It is
frequently used because of its affordability, transportability, ease of use, and simplicity
of set up<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Movements that can be
performed on a trampoline can enhance physical factors, such as trunk stability, muscular
coordination reactions, range of joint movements, and spatial orientation<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The trampoline is a rehabilitation method
that can stimulate proprioception and enhance a person&#x02019;s ability to balance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Training on a trampoline was shown to
improve the ability of elderly patients to recover their balance after falling forward<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and trampoline training is an effective
intervention for promoting balance and other movements in children with intellectual
disabilities<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular,
predefined mini-trampoline training stroke patients produced a significant increase in their
balance. Although the improvements were not statistically significant, trampoline use also
improved their mobility and activities of daily living<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The stroke patients in that study performed the trampoline
training, without holding onto anything while they jumped or, hit a balloon. It would be
difficult to use this method for stroke patients with low physical abilities. In addition,
the effectiveness of trampoline training in preventing falls and improving the walking
ability and balance of stroke patients has not been reported. Therefore, this study used a
modified trampoline training program for stroke patients and analyzed its effects on
balance, gait, and falls efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were 28 adult stroke patients who had been admitted to Hospital B, which
is in Incheon. The inclusion criteria were single onset of stroke, an MMES-K score of at
least 24 points, and the ability to walk minimum of two minutes or more with or without
walking aids. The exclusion criteria were a history of other neurologic or circulatory
diseases or disorders, a cardiovascular system abnormality, or a history of visual or
auditory sense disorders.</p><p>This study used a randomized pre- and post-test, two-group design. Subjects were randomly
allocated to a trampoline training group (TG; n=14) or a control group (CG; n=14). All 24
participants completed the intervention. Prior to the subjects&#x02019; participation, all the
procedures were explained, and each subject provided his or her written informed consent to
participate. This study was approved by the Sahmyook University Institutional Review
Board.</p><p>The training group performed modified trampoline training for 30&#x02005;min three times a week for
6 weeks. Trampoline training sessions were performed one-on-one with a physical therapist to
instruct the participants on how to use the trampoline (Baleno Inc., diameter: 45 inch) with
a handle. To increase the difficulty of training, patients closed their eyes or did not hold
onto the handle. Rest periods were allowed according to the patient&#x02019;s needs. The details of
the modified trampoline training programs are described in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Content of the modified trampoline training</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="5" valign="middle" colspan="1">Standing</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">in place</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">with feet in a walking stance</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">with the right or left foot in front of the other foot</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">with the feet together</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">one supporting leg</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="5" valign="middle" colspan="1">Weight shifting</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">to the front, back, right, and left in place</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">to the front, and back with the feet in a walking

deviation within the base of support<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
It is important to provide treatment to increase the balance abilities of stroke
patients<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study found a
significant change in postural sway in athletes following balance training on a
trampoline<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. That study reported
improvements in muscle endurance, sensorimotor control, and reaction times within the
muscles of the ankle complex due to challenges to the neuromuscular system and specific
movements of the ankle joint muscle after a trampoline training program. In another previous
study, a trampoline intervention resulted in significant improvements in the motor
performance and balance of children with intellectual disabilities<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. During trampoline training, the participants are forced
to continuously respond to changes in gravity, and this provides deep proprioception as well
as other sensory inputs. In addition, performance improvements in balance tasks may be the
result of alterations in the complex sensory motor stimulation due to participants&#x02019; efforts
to adapt to the trampoline&#x02019;s unstable surface and maintain balance. An another previous
study conducted trampoline training for patients with stroke<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and reported a significant improvement in the BBS. In that study,
participants tried to stabilize their bodies while maintaining their center of gravity on
the base of support and responding to different environments and tasks. The reported
improvements were attributed to the participants being forced to keep their balance on the
elastic and unstable ground<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, significant improvements were found in the BBS and the TUG test after
the intervention. We used different subjects and a different training method from previous
studies. The participants in our study had to maintain their balance while performing
various operations on the unstable ground. This task likely contributed to improving the
patients&#x02019; ability to balance due to the repeated sensory feedback and the continuous
experience to postural sway. In addition, the modified trampoline training consisted of not
only static balance training, such as standing and weight shifting, but also dynamic balance
training, such as hopping, walking, jumping, and performing a task. Significant improvement
was seen in the BBS, a measure of dynamic balance, as well as in the TUG test, a measure of
static balance. In the study of Miklitsch et al., the BBS showed a significant improvement,
but the TUG test did not, despite improvement in the BBS. However, in our study,
participants resolutely performed high difficulty dynamic activities because they used the
handle. Therefore, both the BBS and the TUG test significantly improved.</p><p>Twenty percent of stroke patients need a wheelchair for tasks in everyday life after 3
months, and almost 70% decrease their walking speed or step length when they resume
walking<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Walking speed affects the
degree of daily living participation of stroke patients<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, rehabilitation for the recovery of walking ability is
very important for the development of a patient-dependent gait after stroke<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a previous study, stroke patients
could jump for the first time in many years due to the availability of assistance, which was
the motivation for them to participate in an exercise program<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, patients reported increased leg strength on the
affected side after jumping training, and all patients felt that they regained control of
the affected leg. In another previous study, the mechanical efficiency increased and energy
costs reduced when the patients jumped on an elastic surface<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was also reported that subjects could jump from a little
crouching stance on a trampoline, therefore the elastic energy loss decreased and the speed
of movement was facilitated, allowing the subjects to use maximum leg muscle power during
the jump action<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The experimental
subjects in that study were able to complete these actions, because it is easier to jump on
a trampoline than it is to jump on solid surface. In this study, a significant increase in
the dynamic gait index was seen. The dynamic gait index is the tool used to assess the
ability to control the reactions when walking tasks change in response to the external
environment. Therefore, training the patients to carry out various movements on the unstable
surface of the trampoline, would have improved their postural control and balance abilities,
as evidenced by the dynamic gait index, which would also have improved their walking
abilities.</p><p>Falls occur frequently among stroke patients due to their reduced ability to balance<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most falls are caused by a loss of
stability in the forward direction<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.
After elderly patients completed the trampoline training program of a previous study, they
showed an increased ability to regain their balance when suddenly falling forward<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the falls efficacy
scale significantly increased after the trampoline training. In addition, a score of 20
points or less on the BBS can be interpreted as a high risk of falls, a score between 21 and
40 points as a medium risk of falls, and score of 41 to 56 points suggest a low risk of
falls<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the
trampoline training group had a mean BBS score of 33.83, indicating a medium risk of falls
before the intervention, and a mean BBS score of 44.25, indicating a lower risk of falls,
after the intervention. Balance training using a trampoline is effective at equalizing the
muscles and helping them to maintain balance as well as improving the balance of their power
and strength<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The current study
demonstrated that trampoline training improved the falls efficacy by reducing this
imbalance, and the result was not ipsilateral to contralateral. Participants performed the
various actions on the unstable surface using the handle attached to the trampoline. In
addition, performing operations such as hopping or jumping on a trampoline should give
patients more experience to help them avoid falls during activities on a solid surface in
their homes.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, there was a temporary increase of spasticity in
some patients during trampoline training. However, no further increase or continuous
degradation was observed when the intervention was suspended. Second, the results of this
study cannot be generalized to other populations because of the small sample size and the
small area from which the patients were sampled. Therefore, we suggest that further studies
be conducted using larger sample sizes as well as considering the muscle tone of
patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>O&#x02019;Sullivan</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmitz</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name></person-group>: Physical Rehabilitation, 5th ed.
