A total of 41 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and 53 patients with senile cataracts (control group) were recruited. Plasma and aqueous humor samples were collected and the Hcy concentrations were determined using enzymatic cycling assays. In cell experiments, normal HTMCs were passaged and randomly divided into a blank control group, a normal HTMC group and experimental groups, which were treated with different concentrations of Hcy. The HTMC activities were detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 method and the HTMC mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was detected using JC-1 staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) released by trabecular meshwork cells was detected using flow cytometry and superoxide dismjutase-1 (SOD1) expression was detected using immunoblotting. The results revealed that the concentration of Hcy in the plasma and aqueous humor of the POAG group (14.44&#x000b1;0.86 and 1.60&#x000b1;0.27 &#x000b5;mol/l, respectively) was significantly higher compared with the control group (10.82&#x000b1;0.29 and 0.69&#x000b1;0.39 &#x000b5;mol/l). All tested concentrations (30, 100, 300 and 1,000 &#x000b5;mol/l) of Hcy reduced the MMP in HTMCs and inhibited HTMC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. ROS production by HTMCs significantly increased with increased concentrations of Hcy, whereas SOD1 expression significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, patients with POAG were demonstrated to have increased concentrations of Hcy in the plasma and aqueous humor. High concentrations of Hcy in HTMCs induced an oxidative stress state, thereby further inhibiting HTMC proliferation. The results of the present study demonstrate that Hcy may be a potential treatment target in patients with POAG.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>primary open-angle glaucoma</kwd><kwd>trabecular meshwork cells</kwd><kwd>homocysteine</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>plasma</kwd><kwd>aqueous humor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and it has been predicted that79.6 million people worldwide will suffer with glaucoma by 2020 (<xref rid="b1-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most prevalent type of glaucoma worldwide (<xref rid="b1-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The onset of POAG is associated with a number of factors, including age, sex, race, myopia and diabetes mellitus (<xref rid="b2-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, the underlying pathogenic mechanism remains to be elucidated. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor of POAG. The elevation of IOP is caused by a low aqueous humor flow rate resulting from lesions in the aqueous humor outflow pathways (<xref rid="b3-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The trabecular meshwork, which comprises endothelial-like cells, is the major location of aqueous humor outflow (<xref rid="b3-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). These trabecular meshwork cells are critical for the maintenance of the aqueous humor outflow pathway (<xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). A previous study reported that patients with POAG have pathological changes in the trabecular meshwork, including a reduced number of human trabecular meshwork cells (HTMCs), an accumulation of extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal changes (<xref rid="b5-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). It has recently been demonstrated that oxidative damage to the trabecular meshwork may serve an important role in the development of POAG (<xref rid="b6-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). It has been reported that the expression of antioxidants, including superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) and glutathione (GSH), is increased in trabecular meshwork of patients with POAG (<xref rid="b7-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Homocysteine (Hcy) is an intermediate product of methionine metabolism, produced by methionine transmethylation in the human body (<xref rid="b8-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Hcy causes vascular injury related lesions in vascular endothelial cells during oxidative stress and has been confirmed to be an independent risk factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases (<xref rid="b9-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The aqueous humor is the flow of blood from the uvea into the ciliary processes; after filtration through reticular capillaries, this fluid is secreted by ciliary epithelial cells (<xref rid="b2-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). As such, the tissue components of aqueous humor are similar to those of plasma, albeit the concentrations are somewhat different. It has been reported that, at high concentrations, Hcy may cause glaucoma due to its oxidative stress function (<xref rid="b10-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, the association between Hcy and glaucoma remains controversial (<xref rid="b11-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The aim of the present study was to compare Hcy concentrations in the plasma and aqueous humor of patients with senile cataracts and patients with POAG to investigate the effects of Hcy on oxidative stress damage in HTMCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Clinical information and grouping</title><p>All patients were treated at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University (Nanchang, China) between January 2014 and December 2015 and provided written informed consent.

Cells overlapped, the cytoplasm was clear and bright and nuclei were large and round or oval-shaped (<xref rid="f2-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). During passaging, the cells grew faster during the third and fourth generations and began to become adherent at 10&#x02013;12 h. Cells were completely attached within 24 h. Generally, cells completely fused to form a closely connected cell monolayer within 1 week. After the 6th generation, the cell growth rate decreased and the cells were spindle-shaped. Furthermore, the cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio decreased, pigment granule deposition increased, growth speed decreased and the cells were not readily adherent. Therefore, the third to fifth generation of HTMCs were used in the present study.</p><p>The cell viability in control wells was considered to be 100% and cell inhibition rates in the other groups were calculated using the following formula: [optical density (OD) of vehicle wells-OD of experimental wells)/(OD of vehicle wells-OD of mock wells) &#x000d7; 100.

Depending on changes in the MMP, the probe emits different colors of fluorescence. In cells with higher MMPs, JC-1 forms an aggregate in the mitochondrial matrix and produces red fluorescence. At lower MMPs, the probe produces green fluorescence. The results of flow cytometry revealed good HTMC activity and normal MMPs in vehicle wells (<xref rid="f3-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>); in these cells, JC-1 accumulated in the AY2 region and exhibited strong red fluorescence.

Lesions in aqueous humor outflow pathways may obstruct the outflow of the aqueous humor, thereby elevating IOP (<xref rid="b3-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The trabecular meshwork is a major location of aqueous humor outflow (<xref rid="b3-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Oxidative degeneration of the trabecular meshwork damages the aqueous humor outflow pathways, resulting in insufficient ocular local blood transfusion and, in particular, promoting the degeneration of endothelial cells (<xref rid="b6-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Early glaucoma is characterized by endogenous cell loss, a reduction of antioxidant levels in the aqueous humor, HTMC apoptosis caused by mitochondrial damage and endothelial cell dysfunction in the anterior chamber (<xref rid="b14-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). A previous <italic>in vitro</italic> study reported that ROS are able to induce structural changes in the cytoskeleton of trabecular meshwork cells and the extracellular matrix or increase the expression of adhesion molecules, thereby affecting outflow of the aqueous humor and further increasing IOP (<xref rid="b15-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that all indicators in the aqueous humor, including the total antioxidant capacity, total oxidation value and oxidative stress index, are significantly increased in patients with POAG compared with those with senile cataracts (<xref rid="b16-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Hcy is an intermediate product of the methionine cycle pathway and contains a thiol group. When plasma Hcy concentration &#x0003e;10 &#x000b5;mol/l, Hcy may be self-oxidized to produce oxygen free radicals and peroxides, which in turn damage the function and structure of vascular endothelial cells. The results of the present study demonstrated that Hcy concentrations in the plasma and aqueous humor of patients with POAG were significantly higher compared with the control group, suggesting that Hcy is upregulated in patients with POAG. These results were similar to those of Ghanem <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b17-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, other studies reported that there were no statistical differences in Hcy levels of patients with glaucoma and healthy subjects (<xref rid="b18-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The authors hypothesized that this discrepancy may be attributed to ethnic factor since large differences existed in the prevalence and phenotype of POAG among different ethnic groups (<xref rid="b20-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Plasma Hcy levels in patients with senile cataracts in the present study were also slightly higher than 10 &#x000b5;mol/l. This result may be associated with a number of factors, including age, a vegetarian diet, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection or increased incidence of atrophic gastritis, all of which may cause malabsorption of coenzymes, including folic acid, VB12 and VB6, which are required for the metabolism of Hcy (<xref rid="b22-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>In the present study it was also investigated whether treating the trabecular meshwork with high concentrations of Hcy was able to cause structural and functional damage to HTMCs. For healthy adults, Hcy concentrations &#x0003e;15 &#x000b5;mol/l are considered hyperhomocysteinemia (<xref rid="b23-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Therefore, based on a study by Per&#x00142;a-Kaj&#x000e1;n <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b23-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), an initial Hcy concentration of 30 &#x000b5;mol/l was used in this study. The results demonstrated that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited following Hcy treatment. The inhibition of HTMC proliferation increased in a dose-dependent manner. It has previously been reported that HTMCs treated with 40% O<sub>2</sub> exhibited decreased activity after 10 days (<xref rid="b24-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This suggests that treating HTMCs with Hcy as an oxidizing agent may induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation.</p><p>The JC-1 method was used to evaluate the reduction of MMP, which is used as an early marker of apoptosis (<xref rid="b25-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The JC-1 fluorescent probe enters cells and accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix to form JC-1 aggregates, which exhibit red fluorescence (<xref rid="b26-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). If the MMP decreases, JC-1 is unable to aggregate in the mitochondrial matrix and remains a monomer that exhibits green fluorescence (<xref rid="b26-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In the present study, untreated HTMCs exhibited red fluorescent JC-1, whereas cells treated with different concentrations of Hcy exhibited green fluorescent JC-1 that increased in intensity at higher Hcy concentrations. These results indicate that the MMP decreased. It was therefore speculated that Hcy induced the reduction of MMP, thereby damaging cell metabolism and inhibiting HTMC proliferation.</p><p>Flow cytometry and immunoblotting were performed to measure ROS levels and the expression of SOD1, which is primarily responsible for O<sub>2</sub>-clearance (<xref rid="b27-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). As mentioned previously, Hcy treatment increased ROS production in HTMCs. Further investigated revealed that SOD1 expression in HTMCs was downregulated and was significantly negatively correlated with Hcy concentration; these results indicate that Hcy inhibits SOD1 expression. Koh <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b28-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) used mouse bone marrow cells to demonstrate that the production of ROS increases following Hcy stimulation, while Kang <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b29-etm-0-0-5961" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) reported that increased plasma Hcy concentrations and reduced SOD1 levels were observed in young patients with central retinal vein occlusion. Based on these findings, it was speculated that Hcy may directly induce oxidative stress in HTMCs to cause the excessive production of ROS and promote cell apoptosis and also aggravate the oxidative damage by inhibiting the expression of intracellular antioxidant enzymes.</p><p>In summary, the results of the present study demonstrate that plasma and aqueous humor concentrations of Hcy increase in patients with POAG and that elevated Hcy concentrations may be a risk factor of POAG. Excessively elevated Hcy concentrations induce oxidative stress in HTMCs, increase the production of ROS, downregulate the expression of antioxidant enzymes (including SOD1) and reduce MMPs to further inhibit HTMC proliferation. These deleterious effects were also dose-dependent. Hcy may therefore be associated with the onset of POAG. The concentration of SOD1 was used as the oxidative stress marker; as the concentration of SOD1 was not high and the underlying mechanism was not elucidated, there were some limitations in the present study. Future studies should investigate the molecular mechanism, ion channels expression and signaling pathways associated with Hcy-induced oxidative stress in HTMCs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The present study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 81460088 and 81760176), the Jiangxi Provincial Training Program for Distinguished Young Scholars (grant no. 20171BCB23092), the Jiangxi Provincial Key R&#x00026;D Program (grant no. 20171BBG70099), the Jiangxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation for Youth Scientific Research (grant no. 20171BAB215032) and the Scientific Research Program of Jiangxi Health and Family Planning Commission (grant no. 20171076).</p></sec><sec><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The datasets used or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ZPY and KS designed the study and performed the experiments.
