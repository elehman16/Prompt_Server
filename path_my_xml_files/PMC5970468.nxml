Obtaining these in infants and toddlers can be challenging even for trained nurses and pediatricians. Some conditions might exacerbate venipuncture&#x02019;s difficulties, such as increased subcutaneous tissues in newborn, poor venous asset in patient requiring frequent venous cannulation because of chronic disease, dark skin color, malnourishment, and obesity. Failure of intravenous (IV) placement can be predicted by a specific score, known as the difficult intravenous access (DIVA) score, which consider the visual and tactile assessment of the vein, the color of the skin, and the age of the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Considering all these factors, it is not surprising that more than one attempt is required to achieve peripheral venous cannulation in about one third of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Moreover, up to 60% of children report pain and distress during venipuncture. Performing IV placement with as few attempts as possible is advocated, since it is well known that more the puncture attempts are, more the physical and emotional children distress is, which can negatively affect eventual subsequent procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">In the last years, specific tools have been developed to enhance the success rate in venipuncture. One of these is based on the near-infrared (NIR) technology: near-infrared light is projected by a machinery on to the skin and then absorbed by blood, but reflected by surrounding tissue. The machinery captures that information, processes it through a computer and then project a digital real-time image of the patient&#x02019;s vein pattern directly on the skin. In the study of Cuper and colleagues, a trend in reduction of time spent to obtain a blood sample in children younger than 6&#x000a0;year-old using NIR-based device was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Based on these results, we investigated if the adoption of one of these devices (VeinViewer&#x000ae; Flex, Christie Medical Corporation, Memphis, Tennessee, USA) in a pediatric blood-drawing center could decrease time spent to obtain a blood sample and improve the rate of first attempt success in children aged 0 to 18&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par12">We conducted an open, pseudo-randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms, in the blood-drawing center of a tertiary pediatric hospital in the North-East of Italy. The study was performed between October and December 2017, with the subjects enrolment performed in 14 consecutive working days. The eligible subjects were pediatric patients from 0 to 18&#x000a0;years of age who came to the blood-drawing center to collect blood samples by venipuncture. Most of the subjects were referred to the center by general practitioners for routine non-urgent blood tests. Children who had previously been applied a topical anesthetic cream on a suitable site for venipuncture were excluded, since it could have limited nurses&#x02019; choice regarding the site of IV placement.</p><p id="Par13">Patients admitted in the first 7&#x000a0;days were allocated to the VeinViewer&#x000ae; group (group 1), and those admitted in the following 7&#x000a0;days were assigned to the control group (group 2) in which a traditional sampling method was used. No formal randomization was performed mainly due to the quickness needed in a high turnover blood-drawing center, since using the same procedure in every subsequent patient allowed the operator not to lose time passing from one technique to another.</p><p id="Par14">For all the subjects, standard care were adopted consisting in blood sampling performed with patients seated or held on parents&#x02019; laps according to age, and routine application of appropriated distraction techniques. Four pediatric nurses with variable years of work experience were involved in the study and randomly assigned to IV placement. First, the patient was placed in a comfortable position, than VeinViewer&#x000ae; was switched on, and the material for blood sample was prepared; additionally, alcohol was applied as a disinfectant and to increase the contrast between the skin and the vein. The VeinViewer&#x000ae; was positioned approximately 30&#x000a0;cm above the puncture site, held by one nurse. Time monitoring started when the tourniquet was placed or when the second nurse started to look for the suitable vein for the procedure, whichever was first, until the blood was flowing in to the needle. Attempts were defined as each needle penetration into the skin, while redirection underneath the skin was not counted as a separate action.</p><p id="Par15">Data were recorded in a standardized form by the nurse who performed the venipuncture. The variables collected for each patient were children&#x02019;s age and sex, the site of the procedure, and the number of procedural attempts. We divided patients into three subgroups considering their age: &#x0003c;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;years, 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years, &#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;years.</p><p id="Par16">The primary study outcome was to assess if the use of VeinViewer&#x000ae; is associated with a reduction of time to perform blood sampling. The secondary outcome was to analyze the VienViewer&#x000ae;&#x02018;s impact on first attempt success rate in blood sampling. The study protocol received approval from the Independent Bioethic Committee. All parents of the subjects enrolled provided written, informed consent for participation. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03277092). Collected data were analyzed by an independent epidemiologist at the Clinical Epidemiology and Public Health Research Unit of our Institute.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par17">Time in seconds and age in years are presented as medians and Inter-Quartile Range (IQR). Categorical data are presented as absolute frequencies and percentages. As time was left skewed and not normally distributed, the differences in times between groups were analyzed with Kruskall-Wallis test. Stratified and multivariate analysis were used to access if the time needed for blood sampling was different in the two groups independently from age and nurse experience. For multivariate analysis, a generalized linear model with gamma family and log link function was chosen to take into account for the left-skew. A <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

More than one attempt was necessary only in 3 cases, all belonging to the control group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par22">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that assessed the usefulness of a routine use of VeinViewer&#x000ae; in a pediatric blood-drawing setting. The only study considering the use of NIR for venipuncture was performed by Cuper and colleagues in children younger than 6&#x000a0;years of age, which showed an absolute increase in first attempt success of 10%, and a tendency of a shorter time of needle manipulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Our results did not show a reduction in time spent to perform venipuncture using a NIR-based machinery in routine blood sampling. Furthermore, there was no impact on first attempt success rate, according to the meta-analysis performed by Park and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In a fortuitous way, the group of nurses that used VeinViewer&#x000ae; were less experienced, but this imbalance did not affect the study outcome.</p><p id="Par24">In our experience nurses reported that the use of VeinViewer&#x000ae; intrigued children curiosity, permitting to exploit the machinery also as a distracting activity, an element particularly relevant in pediatric settings.</p><p id="Par25">Data on the efficacy of NIR in the pediatric population are still limited but it appear particularly useful in specific settings. The use of NIR seems to make it easier to place peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in neonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. NIR also increased first-attempt success rate in patients with a DIVA score greater than 4 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.026), even if the reduction in time procedure was not significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. An advantage was confirmed by a particular application in hemophilic patient with difficult cannulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A study carried out in a pediatric Emergency Department showed no overall benefit in using NIR, but the subgroup analysis of children aged 0 to 2&#x000a0;years suggested that it decreased the time to peripheral intravenous catheter (PIV) placement in this age subgroup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Lastly, in an oncologic Department, the use of NIR was associated to a significantly shorter time to get PIV, and to the perception by the patients that nurses who used NIR were more skilled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">This study had some limits. We did not use DIVA score, neither we considered stratification according to BMI (body mass index). Since children accessing to a blood-drawing center as outpatient are usually healthy subjects performing occasional routine blood sampling, we did not stratified them in healthy, chronically or acutely ill. Furthermore, we did not formally measured the impact of VeinViewer&#x000ae; on the perception of patients and parents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par27">Blood sampling is a traumatic event for most children and sometimes a challenging procedure even for the most trained nurses, due to the anatomical peculiarities of the children or their excessive agitation. Whereas in pediatric settings are usually adopted distraction techniques (e.g. electronic tablets, smartphones, soap bubbles) to reduce the emotional distress, and procedural analgesia to prevent the pain, tools proven to enhance the success of venipuncture are scarce.</p><p id="Par28">According to our results, the use of VeinViewer&#x000ae; does not facilitate phlebotomies, but not requiring significant additional time, nor affecting the first attempt success rate, both in the younger and the older pediatric patients, it could be used according to health worker&#x02019;s preference.</p><p id="Par29">In specific conditions, as in children younger than 2&#x000a0;years of age, in patients with a high DIVA score, and subjects with poor venous asset associated or not with chronic diseases, the use of VeinViewer&#x000ae; may be particularly helpful.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DIVA</term><def><p id="Par6">Difficult intravenous access</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p id="Par7">Inter-Quartile Range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIR</term><def><p id="Par8">Near-infrared</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We kindly thank Timothy Binder for reviewing the English version of the draft.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par30">The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study available from the corresponding author.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>EC, MP, MM and GC contributed to the conception of the work, wrote down the draft, and approved the final version of the paper.
