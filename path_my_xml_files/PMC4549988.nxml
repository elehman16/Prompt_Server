Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria are most commonly associated with the initiation of periodontitis. The bacteria and their products evoke an immunoinflammatory reaction in the host tissue.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Specific microorganisms or groups of species, including <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, and <italic>Tannerella forsythia</italic> occur more frequently and/or in higher levels and proportions in periodontitis sites and subjects, whereas others such as members of the <italic>Actinomyces</italic> genus, are primarily associated with periodontal health.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Previous studies[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have reported that substantial improvements of periodontal condition measured by reduction in the probing depth (PD), and gains in the clinical attachment level (CAL) are a common outcome of scaling and root planing (SRP). However, traditional SRP may fail to eliminate the subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria located in areas such as multi-rooted teeth, furcation sites, concavities, interproximal areas, and deep pockets inaccessible to periodontal instruments.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In addition, conventional SRP does not completely eliminate periodontal pathogens, as bacteria can persist in root cementum and dentinal tubules, or migrate from reservoirs within the mouth to periodontal areas.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Therefore for periodontal therapy, anti-infective agents such as topical antiseptics or local or systemic antibiotics may be used as adjunctive measures.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The local delivery of an antibiotic offers the potential to achieve and maintain a therapeutic concentration at the site of infection; since the drug is applied directly to the site it delivers a significantly higher drug concentration than can be achieved with systemic dosages. Local drug delivery (LDD) can provide 100-fold higher therapeutic doses of the agent in subgingival areas than systemic therapy.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Several antimicrobial agents (e.g., tetracycline,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] metronidazole (MTZ),[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] clarithromycin,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] azithromycin[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) have been tested for LDD use in periodontal therapy.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>MTZ[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and related nitroimidazole derivatives including ornidazole[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and tinidazole[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have a spectrum of activity against strictly anaerobic microorganisms and have been used successfully in the treatment of periodontal diseases. Satranidazole (SZ) is another antibiotic that belongs to the 5-nitroimidazole group. SZ, (1-methylsulphonyl-3-[1-methyl-5-nitro-2-imidazolyl]-2-imidazolidinone) is a novel nitroimidazole which differs from other 5-nitroimidazoles such as MTZ, ornidazole, and tinidazole, in that the 2&#x000b0;C of the imidazole ring is connected through nitrogen to a substituted imidazolidinone moiety.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] It possesses similar activity as MTZ against cecal amebiasis in the mouse model[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and in the hamster model.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] SZ has been shown to damage DNA as a consequence of the reduction of the nitro group.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Pharmacokinetic studies of SZ in humans have demonstrated a longer half-life (SZ 14 h; MTZ 8 h) and higher blood levels than MTZ. This necessitates lesser frequent dosing of SZ as compared to MTZ. These factors combined with its greater potency are believed to contribute to its therapeutic efficacy.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>A previous study[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] has concluded improved clinical outcomes with LDD of SZ in CP. We hypothesized similar benefits with LDD of SZ in the treatment of CP. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published literature on evaluation of the microbiological efficacy of <italic>in situ</italic> gel using SZ. Keeping the above facts in mind, the aim of this double blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of subgingivally delivered SZ in CP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Source of data</title><p>The subjects for this study were selected from the outpatient section of the Department of Periodontics, Government Dental College and Research Institute, from October 2011 to April 2012.

A custom-made acrylic stent and a University of North Carolina no. 15 color-coded periodontal probe (UNC 15 Periodontal Probe, Hu-Friedy, IL, USA) were used to standardize the measurement of PD and CAL.

Twenty weighed carbopol 934P was dissolved in 50 ml of McIlvaine buffer pH 6.6. The SZ drug was also dissolved in about 25 ml of McIlvaine buffer pH 6.6. This solution of SZ was slowly added in the solution of CB 934P with stirring. Then, the gelling agent sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC) was added slowly under continuous magnetic stirring at 100 rpm. The volume was made up to 100 ml with McIlvaine buffer pH 6.6.

Using a subject based analysis, patients in Group 2 showed enhanced clinical outcome (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) over a period of 6 months as compared to Group 1. The number of sites harboring <italic>T. forsythia</italic>, <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, and <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> were significantly reduced in Group 2 compared to Group 1. Furthermore, SZ was detected in GCF till the period of 7 weeks after the LDD, thus satisfying the criteria for controlled drug release for this formulation.</p><p>The repeated, long-term use of systemic antibiotics is fraught with potential dangers including resistant strains and superimposed infections[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and problems like lack of patient compliance. Therefore, the local administration of antimicrobials provides a useful solution to these complications. It offers the advantages of high concentrations at the target site with reduced dosage, fewer applications, and high patient acceptability.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In a previous study, 20 LDD of SZ resulted in a reduction of GI, PD, and gain in CAL in the treatment of CP. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate whether the use of adjunctive local antimicrobial therapy would better reduce the number of sites harboring specific subgingival periodontopathogens in the treatment of CP.</p><p>SZ is a 5-nitroimidazole substituted at the 2-position and has been found to be more active against aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic bacteria. The MIC90 of SZ was found to be 4-fold lower than MTZ against 50 clinical isolates of anaerobes.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The finding that SRP combined with administration of SZ gel was more effective than mechanical therapy alone in terms of eliminating deep pockets and promoting CAL gain at such sites is in agreement with results reported in the previous study.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The effect of SRP combined with SZ also led to a significant reduction in the number of sites harboring subgingival periodontopathogens: <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, <italic>T. forsythia</italic>, <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, at all time periods compared to baseline. Hence, SZ was found to be highly effective against the tested anaerobes.</p><p>The present study showed a greater reduction in the frequency of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> at 3 months following initial and supportive therapy in CP subjects when locally delivered SZ was associated with SRP. <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> is one of the pathogens belonging to the red complex defined by Socransky <italic>et al.</italic>;[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] it is associated with periodontal disease progression, and its reduction is associated with periodontal health.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Therefore, the reduction in sites harboring this species could be important for the reestablishment of periodontal health.</p><p>Bacteria are difficult to eliminate in deep pockets following SRP;[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] thus, the adjunctive use of SZ in deep pockets might have inhibited the recolonization of bacteria in these sites. It could be suggested that the use of the local antimicrobial SZ, in deep sites, could have provided the additional benefits to clinical parameter improvements by the reduction of important subgingival microorganisms. This is in agreement with Haffajee <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] who reported that sites presenting gains of &#x02265;2 mm following SRP showed a significant reduction of certain periodontopathogens: <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, <italic>T. forsythia</italic>, <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic>.</p><p>The reevaluation period of subgingival bacteria in the present study was 3 months, which is longer than the expected period of 42 days for recolonization.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Therefore, the use of the locally delivered SZ could maintain significantly low levels of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, <italic>T. forsythia</italic>, and <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> subgingivally even after this period while the control group could not.</p><p>Few randomized controlled clinical trials have reported success with the use of local delivery of antimicrobials as an adjunct to SRP in the treatment of CP patients.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Our previous study has concluded significant improved clinical and microbiological outcomes with systemic use of SZ in CP patients as an adjunct to mechanical periodontal therapy.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Similar to findings in these studies, the results of this study indicate that both therapies (SRP + LDD of placebo in Group 1 and SRP + LDD of 3% SZ in Group 2) resulted in improvement but patients in Group 2 showed enhanced clinical and microbiological outcome (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) over a period of 6 months as compared to Group 1.</p><p>The mean concentration of SZ at all observed periods (from baseline to 8 weeks), as estimated by reverse-phase HPLC provided sufficient anti-inflammatory activity and fulfilled the conditions for a controlled-release device. A decrease in PD and gain in CAL are the major clinical outcomes measured to determine the success of any periodontal treatment. A significant decrease in PD and gain in CAL were found within both groups compared to baseline at all time intervals. When the two groups were compared, the decrease in PD and CAL gain were statistically significant at each period, even after 6 months (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>With regard to the dose of SZ used, 3%/0.1 ml per site was injected in the present study. In a study[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] various gelling agents have been used for LDD of SZ in patients with periodontitis. Among them, SCMC gelling agent in a concentration of 3% w/v has been reported to show the desired balance of mechanical properties (mucoadhesiveness, hardness, adhesiveness, compressibility, and cohesiveness). Furthermore, the <italic>in vitro</italic> release of SZ gel containing SCMC gelling agent showed long-term controlled release. Hence, in the present study of 3% SZ gel with SCMC as a gelling agent appeared to be more suitable for obtaining a long-term release of the drug, assuring a constant and prolonged concentration at the application site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has shown that the use of SZ gel, when used in conjunction with an initial periodontal treatment consisting of SRP in adult subjects with periodontitis, achieves significantly better clinical and microbiological results than initial periodontal treatment alone. Further long-term, multicenter longitudinal trials may are required to assess and establish the efficacy of SZ gel in the management of CP to affirm the observations of our study, and also to compare this treatment protocol with other established drugs of this group.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors express their gratitude to Alkem Laboratories Ltd., Mumbai, India for providing gift sample of SZ.
