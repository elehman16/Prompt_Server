Here, we tested the degree to which cognitive training, in the form of gamified training activities that have demonstrated some degree of success in the past, might result in broad transfer. Sixty older adults were randomly assigned to a gamified cognitive training intervention or to an active control condition that involved playing word and number puzzle games. Participants were provided with tablet computers and asked to engage in their assigned training for 30 45-min training sessions over the course of 1 month. Although intervention adherence was acceptable, little evidence for transfer was observed except for the performance of one task that most resembled the gamified cognitive training: There was a trend for greater improvement on a version of the corsi block tapping task for the cognitive training group relative to the control group. This task was very similar to one of the training games. Results suggest that participants were learning specific skills and strategies from game training that influenced their performance on a similar task. However, even this near-transfer effect was weak. Although the results were not positive with respect to broad transfer of training, longer duration studies with larger samples and the addition of a retention period are necessary before the benefit of this specific intervention can be ruled out.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cognitive training intervention</kwd><kwd>reasoning ability</kwd><kwd>video games</kwd><kwd>transfer of training</kwd><kwd>cognitive aging</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Institute on Aging<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000049</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">NIA PO1 AG017211</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">NIA P01 AG017211-16A1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="42"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="7821"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Increases in life expectancy, along with decreasing fertility rates, have led to older adults making up a larger proportion of the global population than ever before (i.e., Population Aging; United Nations, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This trend is significant because age-related changes in cognition can threaten the ability of older adults to live independently, and the societal cost of supporting an increasing number of older adults may be quite large. Considering this demographic trend and its implications, exploring methods to stave-off age-related cognitive decline is important, and has been of increasing interest to the scientific community (e.g., Hertzog et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>Greenwood and Parasuraman (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) hypothesized that successful cognitive aging involves the interaction between neuronal plasticity (i.e., structural brain changes on the cellular level stimulated by experience) and cognitive plasticity (i.e., changes in cognitive strategy). This would be the case if (1) the normal mechanisms of neuronal plasticity are sustained into old age, (2) exposure to novelty in terms of new experiences continues to drive changes in neuronal plasticity, and (3) neural integrity is upheld by beneficial diet, exercise, and other factors. There are a number of studies that support the idea that older adults' brains retain plasticity (i.e., the ability to adapt or benefit from experiences), which suggests that by making healthy lifestyle choices (e.g., balanced diet, regular exercise) and/or engaging in cognitively demanding activities, older adults can maintain a high level of cognitive functioning (reviewed in detail in Greenwood and Parasuraman, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In other words, new learning can result in cognitive plasticity, which encourages neuroplasticity, which then supports additional learning. This theoretical account is consistent with claims made by the proponents of brain training programs.</p><p>The potential benefits of cognitive training interventions aimed at averting or reducing cognitive decline in old age have led to the emergence of commercial programs with the aim of improving cognition through game-like tasks. Brain training is currently a billion dollar industry (Commercialising Neuroscience: Brain Sells, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Sharp Brains, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, the degree to which brain training (especially commercially available brain training programs) is effective, remains controversial. Currently available data have spawned dissenting &#x0201c;consensus&#x0201d; statements, one arguing against the efficacy of brain training with respect to meaningfully improving cognition (A consensus on the brain training industry from the scientific community, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and one arguing for it (Cognitive Training Data, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These opposing statements with hundreds of academic signatories highlight that the effectiveness of commercial cognitive training for older adults remains unclear. Many of the promised benefits of brain training are vague and the evidence that brain training companies point to in support of their products' effectiveness is often flawed (Simons et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Cognitive training as a means of combatting age-related cognitive decline hinges on the notion that training specific cognitive functions that support the performance of a variety of tasks (e.g., working memory) can lead to improvements on many tasks beyond the trained one (i.e., far transfer). Jonides (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) has argued that transfer from a trained to an untrained task occurs when the two tasks share processing components and activate overlapping brain regions. Many efforts to induce far transfer have focused on training working memory, due to its integral and ubiquitous role in many other cognitive and everyday tasks, with pre- to post-training increases sometimes observed in younger adults' executive functions and reasoning or memory (e.g., Jaeggi et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Au et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, these findings are far from uncontroversial (e.g., Morrison and Chein, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Shipstead et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Melby-Lerv&#x000e5;g and Hulme, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Melby-Lerv&#x000e5;g et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>In some cases, transfer to untrained cognitive tasks that recruit working memory in older adults seems more limited relative to younger adults, so it is important to examine the effect of training in both populations. Dahlin et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) randomly assigned older and younger adults to a group that received memory-updating training or to a control group that received no training. Transfer to tasks involving perceptual speed, working memory, episodic memory, verbal fluency, and reasoning was assessed after 5 weeks of training and in an 18-month follow-up post-training. Results showed that both younger and older adults that received the training improved on the trained tasks, and these benefits were still evident at the 18-month follow-up. Younger participants also showed transfer to a 3-back task, which required updating similar to the trained task but was not trained. However, older participants in this study did not show similar transfer. Further, in younger adults, no other transfer was observed to tasks of fluency or reasoning, lending support to the notion that transfer is only possible when untrained tasks utilize similar processing components (in this case, the striatum) as the trained tasks.</p><p>It is reasonable to expect improvement on trained cognitive tasks after undergoing training, and studies with older adults are consistent with this expectation (e.g., Ball et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Willis et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). However, examples of successful far transfer from cognitive training to everyday functioning are rare. Follow-up studies from the ACTIVE trial and other studies using speed of processing training are some of the most widely cited examples in the literature of far transfer to everyday functioning, attributed to older adults' participation in cognitive training. Participants that had taken part in either the speed of processing or reasoning training in the ACTIVE trial were reported to have lower rates of at-fault collision involvement in the 6 years following their involvement in the study (Ball et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), though higher rates of not-at-fault collisions with no overall collision benefit observed. Other studies that have used this speed of processing training in older adults have found that participants receiving training have reported less driving difficulty, more driving time, and longer driving distances than controls (Edwards et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>), as well as fewer driving cessations after a 3-year follow-up period (Edwards et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2009a</xref>). Still, overall, the literature is mixed, and the ACTIVE trial and various follow up studies, when examined closely, seem to provide only limited evidence for the benefits of training (Simons et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Due to the precarious support for cognitive training's benefit for older adults, it is important to compare observed cognitive benefits to those of a strong, active control group with surface plausibility. Mentally stimulating activities, such as word or number puzzles, have long been commonly thought to stave off cognitive decline, though evidence for their benefit is lacking. The current study investigated the cognitive effects in older adults using a gamified cognitive training suite (Mind Frontiers) compared to those in an active control group that played similarly-delivered word and number puzzles (crossword, word search, and Sudoku) that were believed by participants to be cognitively beneficial (Boot et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Our goal was to obtain a sample 60 older adults (age 65+) to be randomly and evenly distributed between two conditions (intervention and control; <italic>N</italic> = 30 per group). Due to the attrition of 18 participants, 78 older adults were recruited from the Tallahassee, Florida region, the majority of whom were recruited via the lab's participant database. Six participants dropped out of the study from the control group, eight from the intervention group, and four before random assignment. All participants were prescreened to assess basic demographic information as well as to ensure that they met the criteria necessary to qualify for the study (e.g., English fluency, no limiting physical and/or sensory conditions). To ensure that potential participants were cognitively intact, the short portable mental status questionnaire (Pfeiffer, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>) was used, as well as the logical memory subscale of the Wechsler Memory Scale (age-adjusted; Wechsler, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Descriptive information concerning the sample is available in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Belmont Report with written informed consent from all subjects. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by Florida State University's Human Subjects Committee. Participants were compensated $20 for the initial lab visit, $60 for completing the at-home training, and $20 after returning the training materials and finishing the post-training cognitive assessment, totaling $100.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Descriptive information regarding the sample of older adults that participated in the study</bold>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Variable</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Overall <italic>N</italic> = 60</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Mind frontiers <italic>n</italic> = 30</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Control <italic>n</italic> = 30</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="4" style="background-color:#bbbdc0" rowspan="1"><bold>AGE IN YEARS MEAN (</bold><italic><bold>SD</bold></italic><bold>)</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.35 (5.20)</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.27 (4.88)</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.43 (5.58)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="4" style="background-color:#bbbdc0" rowspan="1"><bold>GENDER</bold>

Participants then attended a 2-h training session, which involved a tutorial on how to use the provided tablet (10 inch Acer Iconia A700), as well as how to play the games they were assigned per their condition. Over the course of 1 month, participants in both groups were asked to play three games per day (including weekends) for 15 min each, totaling 45 min of playtime each session. Journals were given to participants to record their playtime.</p><p>Participants in the intervention condition were provided tablets with the Mind Frontiers application preinstalled on their system. Mind Frontiers is a Western-themed game hub comprised of seven gamified cognitive tasks modified to improve the tasks' aesthetics, as well as to include motivating feedback to encourage participants to continue playing the games (see Baniqued et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref> for more details). These gamified tasks were designed to exercise inductive reasoning, planning, spatial reasoning ability, speed of processing, task switching, and working memory updating. For an overview of the games included in Mind Frontiers, see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. Participants played a subset of the seven games that varied each day to ensure that the same games were not played in consecutive sessions. In comparison, participants assigned to the control condition were tasked with playing three common puzzle games each day (crossword, Sudoku, and word search). In both conditions, tablets were locked-down so that participants could not use the tablet for any other purpose. After 1 month of playtime, participants returned to the laboratory with the tablets and journals and completed the post-training cognitive battery.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p><bold>A brief description of each of the seven games included in the Mind Frontiers application</bold>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Mind Frontiers Game</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Description</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ante Up</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Players are shown cards organized in a certain pattern and must replicate this pattern over the course of a specified number of moves with the cards they are provided.

Participants viewed a spatial array of nine blue squares on the screen. These squares changed one at a time from blue to yellow, then back to blue, in a randomized sequence. Participants were asked to replicate the observed sequence using the mouse and then click the done button at the bottom of the screen. Each participant completed three unrecorded practice trials and was given feedback in order to become familiar with the task. The recorded task's sequence started with two squares and each participant completed two trials of each sequence length before the length increased by one. The sequence increased by one whenever the participant correctly demonstrated at least one of the two sequences at that sequence length, and the task ended if the participant failed both of the sequences at a given length. The primary measure of this task was a span measure based on the length of the sequence when the task ended.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Executive control</title><p>A task-switching paradigm (computerized) and Trails B (paper and pencil) were used to assess executive control.</p><sec><title>Task-Switching</title><p>This task was similar to the one used by Boot et al. (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Participants viewed digits that appeared one at a time at the center of the screen for 2.5 s each and had to judge whether each digit was high or low (above or below 5), or whether it was odd or even depending on the color of the square surrounding the digit (blue or pink). A blue square indicated participants had to judge whether the number was high or low, while a pink square indicated that participants had to judge whether the digit was odd or even. The digits 1 through 9 were randomly presented, with the exception that the digit 5 was never used. The &#x0201c;z&#x0201d; key was used to indicate either low or odd while the &#x0201c;/&#x0201d; key was used to indicate high or even. Participants completed four blocks of 15 trials each in which they only had to perform one task or the other. Then they completed a version of the task in which the color of the background was randomized, meaning they often had to switch from one task to the other. After 15 practice dual-task trials, participants completed 160 real trials. Switch cost, or the decrement involved in having to switch from one task to another, was used as the primary measure of task-switching. This was calculated by comparing the average performance (accurate response time) of single task blocks of trials to the dual-task block.</p></sec><sec><title>Trails B (controlling for Trails A)</title><p>In this task, participants were presented with a sheet of paper containing numbers and letters (Reitan, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1955</xref>). Participants were asked to connect the numbers and letters in sequential order, alternating between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.). Completion time was the primary measure of performance. Completion time of Trails A, in which participants performed the same task but did not have to switch between numbers and letters, was subtracted from Trails B completion time to provide a measure of switch cost.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Intervention adherence was acceptable in that participants engaged in, on average, more than 70% of their assigned training sessions according to their journals (<italic>M</italic> = 22 sessions, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.0 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 23 sessions, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.7 for the control and intervention groups, respectively). To help interpret results in light of potential placebo effects, participants' expectations for improvement were assessed after training. These data are reported elsewhere, so will not be discussed in detail, but in general participants in each group either expected a similar amount of improvement as a result of training, or expected the control condition to improve cognition more (Boot et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Any differential improvement by the intervention group is thus unlikely due to a placebo effect. Next we turn to potential changes in performance on tasks in the cognitive battery. Our general analysis approach was to explore whether groups differed on their post-training performance controlling for pre-training scores. Scores for all measures are reported in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and standardized (<italic>z</italic>-score) improvement scores are represented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Note that the degrees of freedom fluctuate slightly in the reported analyses due to occasional missing data.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p><bold>Means and

Transfer effects are unlikely if participants did not improve their game performance. An algorithm within each game dynamically adjusted difficulty based on successful game performance each time a game was played. For example, for <italic>Riding Shotgun</italic>, correctly remembering a sequence increased the difficulty level and added one more item to the sequence to be remembered. Incorrectly recalling a sequence decreased the difficulty level and removed one item from the sequence to be remembered. We were able to extract game performance data for 25 participants in the Mind Frontiers condition. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> depicts the average increase in game difficulty level over the course of training for each game. What was observed was a mixed pattern of improvement. Little improvement was observed for <italic>Sentry Duty</italic>, the game closest to n-back training which has been argued to improve fluid intelligence. However, improvement was observed for the <italic>Riding Shotgun</italic> game which is similar to the corsi block tapping task. A trend for improvement was observed for this outcome measure, though improvement was not significant after correcting for the number of outcome measures tested. Baniqued et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) similarly found that participants only improved to a small degree on <italic>Sentry Duty</italic> and <italic>Supply Run</italic> compared to other games in a study involving a younger adult sample. Across games, it is unclear whether differences in improvement relate to the demands of the game or scoring algorithm used by the Mind Frontiers software package.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Improvement in game difficulty level as a function of game</bold>.

The only measure that hinted at a benefit for the intervention group relative to the control group was the corsi block tapping task. Within the Mind Frontiers game suite, the <italic>Riding Shotgun</italic> game was essentially a gamified version of this outcome task. Even though a dual n-back training component was part of the current intervention, and previous studies have linked this type of intervention to improved reasoning ability (especially with respect to matrix reasoning tasks, e.g., Jaeggi et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), no benefits were observed as a result of the intervention. Evidence was largely consistent with a recent review of the literature in that the strongest evidence was for near rather than far transfer of training (Simons et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Even this effect, though, was ambiguous given the number of measures collected and the possibility of Type I error.</p><p>All studies examining brain training effects need to be considered in light of potential methodological and statistical shortcomings (Simons et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Some of these shortcomings may overestimate the potential of brain training and others may underestimate it. Next we present a discussion of these issues.</p><p>To guard against the effect of experimenter degrees of freedom (flexibility in the way analyses can be conducted that increase the likelihood of false-positive results; Simmons et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), it is now generally recommended that studies be preregistered. The current study was not preregistered, but our lab has made a commitment to preregister future cognitive intervention studies based on current recommendations. When study design and analysis approaches are not preregistered, positive findings here and elsewhere provide less convincing evidence in favor of brain training effects. In the absence of preregistration it is unclear whether Type I error was appropriately controlled for. Despite the absence of preregistration, little evidence of transfer was observed. Thus, Type I error control was unlikely to be a large problem here with respect to overestimating the degree of transfer.</p><p>To guard against placebo effects that may overestimate transfer effects, studies should include a strong active control condition. The current study had an active control condition featuring games that were not expected to tap the same perceptual and cognitive abilities exercised by the Mind Frontiers game. Further, expectation checks should be implemented to ensure that differential improvement of the intervention group isn't linked to greater expectations for improvement (with differential effort exerted post training for the task with greater expectations). Expectation checks were included in the current study, and it was found that any differential improvement of the intervention group (even though little evidence of transfer was observed) would be unlikely due to a placebo effect (Boot et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, this analysis indicated that the intervention and control groups were not perfectly matched; participants in the Mind Frontiers group actually expected <italic>less</italic> improvement with respect to changes in vision and response time. It is conceivable that the greater expectations of the control group may have masked transfer produced by the intervention (see Foroughi et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; for evidence that expectations can influence cognitive task performance).</p><p>Statistical power should always be considered as well when evaluating the effect of cognitive training interventions. With approximately 30 participants in each group for reported analyses and using an ANCOVA approach, the current study was powered only to detect large effects (<italic>f</italic> = 0.40) with a probability of about 0.80 using an alpha level of 0.05. This means that subtle effects may have gone undetected.</p><p>Dosage, retention, and training gains are important issues as well. Had participants adhered perfectly, they would have completed 22.5 h of training. While this is a reasonable dosage in comparison to many studies (e.g., the ACTIVE trial), cognitive intervention effects may require similar engagement over many months or years to provide protection against cognitive decline. Almost no studies to date have examined the effect of long-term engagement in cognitive training (see Requena et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; for an exception). Studies such as ours, typical of the field, test whether or not there may be a &#x0201c;quick fix&#x0201d; provided by cognitive training. In addition to overall dosage, it may be important to consider dosage of each game within the Mind Frontiers suite. With seven total games, participants were asked to play about 3 h of each game over the course of 1 month. If some of these games are more effective than others at producing near and far transfer, the training schedule of our study may underestimate transfer. Of particular note is the lack of improvement for some games (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Although game timing parameters were adjusted to be more appropriate for older adult participants, participants appeared to struggle with making progress within some games, especially <italic>Sentry Duty</italic> and <italic>Pen &#x02018;Em Up</italic>. Given the difficulty and complexity of these two game in particular, it is possible that improved game instructions and training might help participants make more progress.</p><p>Finally, our study examined transfer immediately after training. While it is reasonable to assume effects would be largest immediately after training, others have suggested that cognitive protection provided by cognitive training may not be observed until cognition begins to show steeper declines. Our study did not assess performance at later time points (as the ACTIVE trial has nicely done), so we cannot rule out such &#x0201c;sleeper effects&#x0201d; of cognitive training.</p><p>Which particular mechanisms are responsible for the benefits of cognitive training, and the question of whether broad transfer from cognitive training is even possible, are currently controversial topics. No one study provides a definitive answer and evidence needs to be evaluated with respect to the strength of a study's design and analysis approach. The current study contributes to the idea that there are no short-term, easy methods to boost cognitive performance in older adults. Whether other cognitive training interventions or longer-term interventions can produce broad transfer and improve the performance of everyday tasks important for independence (e.g., driving, financial management) remains to be seen.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>WB, DS, and NC designed the study.
