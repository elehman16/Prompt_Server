It is a product of the rate constant of CO uptake, i.e., fall in concentration of alveolar CO per unit time per unit driving pressure (also called the Krogh's constant [KCO]) and the alveolar volume (VA) at full lung inflation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Normally, DLCO and VA are measured and KCO is calculated as DLCO/VA. DLCO and DLCO/VA are considered together for interpretation of the measurements. The measurement of DLCO is technically complex with wide variability between laboratories.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The methodology has been standardized in an attempt to ensure quality control and reduce between laboratory variability.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It was revised recently by a joint task force of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Substantial variations, ascribed to differences in methodology, exist in prediction equations for DLCO even among similar populations such as Caucasians.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Therefore, use of standardized methodology is strongly recommended and equations developed in local populations should be used to interpret data.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Lack of prediction equations for DLCO using current standardized methodology for Indian population is a major limitation in clinical practice and research. Application of Caucasian equations as is necessitated currently for Indians in lung function laboratories may result in errors in interpretation. Little is known about ethnic differences in DLCO due to a paucity of equations for nonwhite populations.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The only available Indian equations for DLCO were developed three decades ago and that too only in a restricted age group limiting their wider application.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The present study was carried out to develop prediction equations for DLCO, VA, and DLCO/VA for Indians and examine the ethnic diversity in these parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (vide letter date November 29, 2004). The details of the sampling methodology were published recently in the report on prediction equations for spirometry parameters in the same population.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Subjects aged 18 years and above with parentage of Northern Indian plains around Delhi were drawn from a wide social and economic background from healthy and willing attendants of patients, volunteers from employees from institutions, general public, private, and public sector offices. As is common with studies of this nature, a convenient sample was taken after rigorous screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria described below. A written informed consent was taken. These regions are ethnically homogenous with a near sea-level altitude and a tropical climate.</p><p>For multiple linear regression, the recommended minimum sample size is [50 + (8xm)] where m = number of independent variables.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Based on previous studies[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] we identified age, height, and weight as possible predictors of DLCO giving a sample size of 74.

Those with any acute or chronic chest or other systemic disease, thoracic cage abnormality, pregnancy, body mass index &#x0003c;18.5 or &#x0003e;30, and smokers, except occasional ones, were excluded.

DLCO was measured by single-breath technique using standardized methodology[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] on benchmark lung function equipment (PK Morgan, Kent, United Kingdom). It has an automated valve box with inspiratory and expiratory bags and measures Helium by thermal conductivity and CO by infrared absorption. Gas analyzer calibration was performed weekly, volume calibration was performed daily, and moisture and carbon dioxide absorbers were replaced regularly. All measurements were made by the same technician.</p><p>A light meal was allowed but exercise and caffeinated drinks were not permitted in the morning. The subject rested for 2 h before the test. After exhaling to the residual volume, the subject inhaled maximally a gas mixture containing 0.3% CO, 12&#x02013;14% helium, and 18% oxygen from the inspiratory bag of the diffusion apparatus, followed by breath-holding at full lung inflation and then performed a rapid exhalation, washing out dead space air followed by collection of the alveolar sample in the expiratory bag. The concentrations of CO and helium in the inspired and expired gas were analyzed. Inspired volume was required to be more than 85&#x02013;90% of the previously measured vital capacity and inspiration was completed within 2&#x02013;3 s. Breath holding time was set at 9 s and the subject was instructed to voluntarily maintain full inspiration using only the minimal effort necessary to avoid Valsalva or M&#x000fc;ller maneuvers. Effective breath-holding time was calculated by the method of Jones and Mead[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and kept between 10 &#x000b1; 1 s. Expiratory maneuver was smooth, unforced, and without hesitation or interruption. The total exhalation time was &#x0003c;4 s with a sample collection time of &#x0003c;3 s. The washout and alveolar sample volume were set at 900 ml if forced vital capacity exceeded 2 l and 600&#x02013;800 ml for smaller lungs. The DLCO was calculated as described below:[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>DLCO = VA (STPD) &#x000d7; (1/t) &#x000d7; (1/[PB &#x02013; 47]) &#x000d7; Ln (F<sub>A</sub>CO<sub>O</sub>/F<sub>A</sub>CO<sub>t</sub>) &#x000d7; 60,000</p><p>F<sub>A</sub>CO<sub>O</sub> = F<sub>I</sub>CO &#x000d7; (F<sub>A</sub>He/F<sub>I</sub>He)</p><p>VA = (V<sub>I</sub> &#x02013; V<sub>D</sub>) &#x000d7; (F<sub>I</sub>He/F<sub>A</sub>He)</p><p>Volumes are in liters.

Pearson's correlation analysis and univariate regression were carried out to identify significant predictor variables for DLCO, DLCO/VA, and VA.

For DLCO/VA in females, the 5<sup>th</sup> and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile values obtained from descriptive statistics of the predicted DLCO/VA computed as above represent the LLN and the ULN, respectively.</p><p>Predictions of DLCO in males by Indian equations were lower than most Caucasian predictions by 3.4 to 19.2% but greater than the predictions for Caucasians by Roberts <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and the ECSC equations[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] by 1.6&#x02013;2.6%, and also greater than the Chinese predictions by 8%. In females, all Caucasian equations predicted higher DLCO than the Indian equations ranging from 3.4% to 20.6%, whereas the latter and the Chinese predictions were not different. The VA predicted by Indian equations was significantly lower than the Caucasian equations by 10.2&#x02013;24.3% in males and 11.5&#x02013;42.2% in females, and also slightly lower than the Chinese predictions by 2.4&#x02013;3.4% in males and females, respectively. On the other, the Indian equations predicted a higher DLCO/VA than all the Caucasian equations in females by 1&#x02013;21.6%, and also all Caucasian equations in males by 4.5&#x02013;15.8%, except the Knudson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] equations that predicted slightly higher values by 2.8%. Indian predictions for DLCO/VA were also higher than the Chinese predictions by 7.4% in males and 9.9% in females.</p><p>It is well established that Caucasians have higher lung volumes per unit height compared to Asians, including Indians and the Chinese.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In contrast, information on ethnic differences in DLCO, VA and DLCO/VA is limited because of lack of sufficient studies in nonwhite populations. Yang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that predicted values for DLCO and VA in the Chinese were significantly lower than the Caucasian predictions but DLCO/VA did not differ. Pesola <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] observed that Caucasian-derived prediction equation estimates of DLCO resulted in healthy Chinese subjects being labeled as abnormal.

It is remarkable that the explained variance for DLCO/VA in all the studies has been &#x0003c;50%, ranging from a low of 10%[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to a maximum of 46%[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in males and from 7%[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to 48%[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in females. Being an indirectly computed entity and a ratio, DLCO/VA estimates are susceptible to errors in the measurement of either component leading to greater uncertainty in its estimation.</p><p>The higher DLCO in Caucasians compared to the Chinese and the Indians is likely due to a larger lung size (larger VA) as surface area of the gas exchange zone is a major determinant of diffusion. If both DLCO and VA increase proportionately, their ratio would remain the same explaining the observations in the Chinese population where DLCO and VA were both lower compared to Caucasians whereas DLCO/VA was similar.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, the relationship between DLCO and VA is not linear and therefore a proportionately greater reduction in the latter would result in a somewhat higher DLCO/VA as observed in Indians by us. The small difference in DLCO/VA predicted by ours and the Caucasian or Chinese equations may be due to the inherent uncertainty in its estimation[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] rather than being a true difference. Ethnic differences are not known for arterial oxygenation and neither are there any known structural or physiological differences, including pulmonary capillary blood flow and ventilation-perfusion matching in the alveolar unit among populations. Anatomic and physiologic rationale therefore dictates that gas exchange in lungs per unit volume should be essentially similar in all humans and the observed differences in DLCO arise mainly from differences in the lung sizes. As gas exchange in individual lung units cannot be measured directly, it is not possible to substantiate this hypothesis experimentally. Nevertheless, our results and those of Yang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] for the Chinese population do raise the possibility that DLCO/VA may be similar or differ only marginally across populations irrespective of gender and ethnicity.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This is the first study to provide prediction equations for DLCO, VA, and DLCO/VA for Indians using the recent standardized methodology and fulfills a long unmet need. Lack of Indian equations for diffusing capacity parameters has been a major limitation in clinical practice and research. These equations should bridge this gap in information. The study also establishes the substantial ethnic diversity in these prediction equations besides the wide within Caucasian differences, reinforcing the need to follow a standardized methodology and locally appropriate equations. While the number of female subjects was lower than males, the sample size was statistically adequate in both genders. The sampling strategy was similar to that used in several other studies cited above. The joint task force of the ATS and ERS has suggested that for development of regression equations, a convenient sample is acceptable as an alternative to random sampling if the selection criteria and the distribution of anthropometric characteristics remain adequate.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This was ensured. Further, Van Ganse <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] observed that for lung function measurements, the method of selection does not impact the mean values or their ranges. Lack of availability of sufficient number of normal elderly subjects who could perform acceptable test maneuvers limited the maximum age in our study to 71 years in males and 65 years in females. Thus, caution is required in extrapolating these equations to elderly patients beyond these ages. It is however pointed out that according to Census 2011 data,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] only 1.5% of males and 3.4% of female population of India is above these ages. Thus, the present equations would be valid for all except a very small fraction of the population. The age distribution of our sample matched the age distribution of the population in India.</p><p>We and other authors have earlier documented that regional variations exist in lung function within India.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Therefore, we restricted our sample to North Indians. Similar equations would have to be developed for other regions or these would require validation in other populations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Validated prediction equations for DLCO, VA and DLCO/VA for North Indians have been developed. Predictions of DLCO in Indians are generally lower compared to Caucasians but greater than in the Chinese population, at least in males. Predictions for DLCO/VA in Indian males and females are greater by a variable extent than the predictions for both Caucasians and the Chinese. With populations in several countries increasingly becoming multi-ethnic, laboratories should be able to select ethnically appropriate equations to avoid errors in interpretation. Development of these equations is a step in this direction.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>The project was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research, Government of India.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The technical assistance of Mr GC Chandrashekharan, STA, is gratefully acknowledged.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cotes</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Arcangeli</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Cotes</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Cournand</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Denolin</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Maria</surname><given-names>GD</given-names></name><name><surname>Sadoul</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The transfer factor for the lung: Normal values in adults</article-title><source>Introduction to the Definition of Normal Values for Respiratory Function in Man</source><year>1969</year><publisher-loc>Alghero, Italy</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Panminerva Medica</publisher-name><fpage>327</fpage><lpage>43</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>American Thoracic Society.
