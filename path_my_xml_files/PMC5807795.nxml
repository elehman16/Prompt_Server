Identifying intervention strategies to reduce caloric intake and/or improve cardiometabolic health in Hispanics is critical to reducing morbidity and mortality among this large and growing population. Evidence exists to support diet-specific behavioral interventions, including beverage modifications, in reducing obesity-related health risks. However, the acceptability and feasibility of a beverage intervention in obese Hispanic adults has not been robustly evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The objective of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a randomized, controlled beverage intervention in 50 obese Hispanic adults ages 18&#x02013;64 over 8-weeks. Eligible participants were obese (30&#x02013;50.0&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), between the ages 18&#x02013;64, self-identified as Hispanic, and were able to speak, read, and write in either English and/or Spanish. Study recruitment was completed August 2017. Upon the completion of baseline assessments, participants will be randomized to either Mediterranean lemonade, Green Tea, or flavored water control. After completing a 2-week washout period, participants will be asked to consume 32&#x000a0;oz. per day of study beverage for 6-weeks while avoiding all other sources of tea, lemonade, citrus, juice, and other sweetened beverages; water is permissible. Primary outcomes will be recruitment, retention, and acceptability of the intervention strategies. Our study will also evaluate participant-reported tolerance and as an exploratory aim, assess safety/toxicity-related to renal and/or liver function. Fasting blood samples will be collected at baseline and 8-weeks to assess the primary efficacy outcomes: total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Secondary outcomes include fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This pilot study will provide important feasibility, safety, and early efficacy data necessary to design a larger, adequately-powered randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">NCT02911753 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>).

Among women, rates of obesity remain high for Hispanics at 43% compared to only 34% of non-Hispanic women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Obesity is linked to cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, gallstones, and certain forms of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Risk of developing these comorbid conditions is positively associated with increasing BMI. Consequently, Hispanic adults, regardless of gender, have a higher prevalence of certain obesity-related comorbidities in the U.S. relative to other racial/ethnic subgroups. For example, recent estimates suggest that Hispanic adults are 1.4 times more likely than non-Hispanic white adults to develop diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Additionally, cardiometabolic abnormalities such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperglycemia are more prevalent in this population subgroup overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Evidence suggests that obese individuals tend to have above normal lipid status and this is associated with a 3-fold higher risk for heart attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], placing obese Hispanics at further risk. Identifying intervention strategies to reduce caloric intake and/or improve cardiometabolic health in Hispanics is critical to reducing morbidity and mortality among this large and growing population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Beverage consumption</title><p id="Par25">Consumption of energy-dense beverages is high in the U.S., where sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are the primary source of added sugar calories and a contributing factor of obesity. Recent trends in beverage consumption in the U.S. indicate SSB consumption is declining overall, however, levels of consumption remain highest among Mexican Americans, non-Mexican Hispanics, and non-Hispanic blacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Consumption of SSBs also vary by race/ethnicity in Arizona with 39% of Hispanics consuming SSBs &#x02265;1 time/day compared to 21.1% of non-Hispanic whites and 32.9% non-Hispanic blacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Associations between SSB consumption and obesity-related metabolic disturbances have been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and whether or not reducing SSB consumption may reduce the prevalence of obesity and obesity-related diseases has previously been the subject of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. While notable efforts have been made in developing interventions to reduce SSB consumption in children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], less attention has been placed on beverage interventions in adults. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Vargas-Garcia et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], investigators sought to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing SSB or increasing water consumption. Of the 40 studies identified in the review, only 11 included adult participants. Despite this, results from interventions aimed at reducing SSB intake or increasing water intake in adults are promising. For instance, Zoellner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] examined the effectiveness of a behavioral and health literacy intervention for adults targeting SSB consumption (SIPsmartER) compared to an intervention targeting physical activity (MoveMore). Significant decreases in SSB calories and BMI were observed in the SIPsmartER group compared to the MoveMore group over a period of 6-months, however, only 1% of participants were Hispanic. Similarly, Rodriguez-Ramirez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] examined the effects of reducing SSB consumption over sustained periods of time in a group of 268 overweight Mexican women and found that women who received a water and nutrition education (where water was home-delivered during the intervention period) significantly improved the quality of their diets when compared to women who received only the nutrition education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This included significant reductions in SSB consumption, suggesting that encouraging water consumption may be an effective strategy in reducing consumption of SSBs, however, more research is needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Alternate beverages</title><p id="Par26">Similarly, our study seeks to replace dietary SSBs with healthier alternatives while simultaneously modifying cardiometabolic measures with the bioactive dietary constituents found in two beverages. Specifically, our group and others have shown improvements in metabolic activity for both green tea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and Mediterranean lemonade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The health-promoting bioactivity due to the consumption of green tea and Mediterranean lemonade is thought to be in relation to the exposure to compounds known to regulate biological pathways such as green tea polyphenols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and citrus-derived limonene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], as well as the opportunity to replace high-glycemic response beverages such as sweetened sodas and juice products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Specifically, researchers have found that green tea consumption over extended periods of time is associated with decreased body weight and lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, particularly among participants who are at risk for cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Further, favorable trends of increased blood high-density lipoprotein (HDL) have been associated with consumption of green tea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Mediterranean lemonade, a beverage consisting of two full lemons with peels and water, is a low-calorie beverage alternative to energy-dense SSBs with potential health-promoting effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It has been previously identified as a source of <italic>d-</italic>limonene, a bioactive compound found in high concentrations in citrus peel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Its potential anti-proliferative effects, bioavailability, proposed physiological mechanisms, and safety have been reviewed by our group elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aims and study hypotheses</title><p id="Par28">This pilot study will expand on earlier research by our team using beverage interventions to enhance cardiometabolic health. This study&#x02019;s primary objective is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a beverage intervention in obese Hispanic adults. Primary feasibility outcomes will be recruitment, retention, and acceptability. Beverage intake will also be assessed through intake diaries and beverage return rates during weekly clinic visits. The preliminary efficacy of the beverage intervention will assess changes in total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL over 8-weeks. Secondary outcomes are changes in fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Our study will evaluate participant-reported tolerance and as an exploratory aim, our study will also assess safety/toxicity-related to renal and/or liver function as albeit limited, evidence from green tea polyphenol E supplementation studies have reported a few cases of hepatic toxicity with on-going supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Renal and hepatic toxicity function will be assessed at baseline and 8-weeks. The aforementioned outcomes will be examined to test the following hypotheses: a) recruitment and retention of obese Hispanic participants in an 8-week beverage intervention study is feasible; b) the consumption of green tea and Mediterranean lemonade will be well-tolerated with high adherence; and c) green tea and Mediterranean lemonade intake will result in an improved cardiometabolic profile at the end of 8-weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design</title><p id="Par29">This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial where participants are randomized to one of three beverages: Green Tea (GT), Mediterranean lemonade (ML), or a Flavored Water control (FW). Participants will be stratified by gender using block randomization and an allocation ratio of 2:2:1 with variable block sizes. A computer randomization system will be used to complete the randomization assignment. We proposed to consent 150 individuals to randomize 50 participants into our 8-week study.

Additional recruitment strategies included the use of social media posts (e.g., Facebook, and Craigslist) and health provider initiated approaches (e.g., patient referral). Participants of preliminary studies who had expressed interest in health behavior research and had signed consent to be contacted for future intervention studies also were contacted. Potential participants were instructed to call study staff and a telephone screening was conducted to determine initial eligibility. Interested individuals engaged at recruitment settings were given the option of being screened on-site or during a future phone call with study staff. Telephone and on-site screenings included a detailed description of the study and its potential risks and benefits.

Lipton&#x000ae; Decaffeinated Green tea will be prepared using a ratio of 4 tea bags per 32&#x000a0;oz. water. Upon reaching a boil, tea bags will be steeped into water for 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;min. When slightly cooled, 4 drops of Liquid No Calorie Stevia&#x02122; will be added per 32&#x000a0;oz. of tea. To prepare the Mediterranean lemonade, two full lemons will be de-seeded and blended with 32&#x000a0;oz. of water and 3 drops of Liquid No Calorie Stevia&#x02122;. The control beverage will be prepared using 3 drops of Crystal Light Liquid Drink Mix (strawberry lemonade) per 32&#x000a0;oz. of water. All beverages will be prepared 2&#x000a0;days prior to participant pick-ups. All green tea will be kept frozen while the Mediterranean lemonade and flavored water will be refrigerated for storage and distribution to study participants. Preparation and storage procedures were informed by prior chemical analysis of bioactive components in the beverages across 7&#x000a0;days to assure optimal exposure. Mean epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the main polyphenol found in green tea, was 161.5&#x000a0;mg per 32&#x000a0;oz. and mean <italic>d-</italic>limonene was 373.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml per 32&#x000a0;oz. in the Mediterranean lemonade.

All participants will be advised to consume the entire beverage assigned on a daily basis (rather than save up and consume large amounts on fewer days). At the start of the intervention, participants will be asked to continue avoiding all other sources of tea, lemonade, and citrus, limit coffee consumption to 2 cups/day, avoid all sweetened beverages other than study-provided drinks, consume water ad lib, and avoid alcohol in excess of 1 drink/day for women and 2 drinks/day for men. In addition, participants will be asked to self-monitor their beverage consumption behaviors using a weekly journal to help habitually regulate beverage intake. Participants will be responsible for picking up 1&#x000a0;week&#x02019;s worth of beverages once per week from the study clinic. Participants will be asked to return any un-consumed beverages during weekly pick-ups; study staff will measure and record any amount not consumed.

If a participant experiences any of these signs/symptoms associated with beverage intake, they will be given the option to withdraw from the study or change to the alternate beverage intervention (but not flavored water) after a 1-week washout period. Participants will be asked on a weekly basis about any issues related to their beverage consumption and this information will be noted. Prior literature has reported a few cases of hepatic toxicity related to supplementation with high-dose green tea polyphenols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. No evidence exists to suggest toxicity or safety issues related to the green tea nor Mediterranean lemonade beverages consumed in the amounts prescribed for this study. Therefore, renal and hepatic function will be monitored at study beginning and end using alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) values. Abnormal values will be shared with the participant and the participant will be advised to visit their physician for evaluation. In the event this occurs, participants will not receive additional compensation and the study will not cover additional costs for physician follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Methods for assessing study outcomes and potential confounders</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Anthropometry</title><p id="Par40">Height, body weight, waist circumference, and resting blood pressure will be measured at baseline and 8-weeks. Height will be measured to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm (cm) using a ShorrBoard&#x000ae; wall-mounted stadiometer with participants removing their shoes prior to the measurement. Two measurements will be taken. A third measurement will be taken if the first two measurements differ by more than 0.5&#x000a0;cm. The average of the two measurements which met the criteria above will be recorded for data collection. Body weight will be measured using a Seca 876 scale to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;kg (kg) on a digital scale without shoes. Two measurements will be taken. A third measurement will be taken if the first two measurements differ by more than 0.2&#x000a0;kg. The average of the two measurements which meets the criteria above will be recorded for data collection. BMI will be calculated using body weight in kilograms divided by squared height in meters (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Waist circumference will be obtained using a Gulick measuring tape recorded to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm. Waist circumference will be measured in the horizontal plane directly at the umbilicus. Two measurements will be taken at each site. A third measurement will be taken if the first two measurements differ by more than 2.0&#x000a0;cm. The average of the two measurements closest to each other will be recorded for data collection.</p><p id="Par41">Resting blood pressure and heart rate will be measured using the Omron Digital Blood Pressure Monitor HEM-907XL on the participant&#x02019;s left arm. Using a Gulick measuring tape, an arm measurement will be performed on the lateral aspect of the left arm at the midpoint between the acromion process to the olecranon process to determine the appropriate cuff size. Upon a five-minute resting period with the participant in an upright position with feet flat on the floor, two blood pressure measurements will be taken with a one-minute time period between each measurement. A third blood pressure will be taken if the mean difference between the systolic blood pressure measurements differs by 10&#x000a0;mmHg or greater and/or the diastolic blood pressure measurements differs by 6&#x000a0;mmHg or greater. The average of the two measurements which meets the criteria above will be recorded for data collection. In addition, if the mean resting systolic blood pressure is &#x02265;150&#x000a0;mmHg or average diastolic blood pressure is &#x02265;100&#x000a0;mmHg at baseline, the participant will be excluded from participation and referred back to their physician.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Biological samples</title><p id="Par42">Emerging evidence indicates that genetic variation may impact the efficacy of lifestyle behavioral interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, we will perform a buccal cell collection by using a cytology brush to brush the inside of each cheek for 30&#x000a0;s for the extraction of DNA and subsequent genetic analyses. This <italic>optional</italic> non-invasive, self-collection of buccal cells will occur at one time and will be performed at either the baseline (preferable) or follow-up visit. Participants also will have the option of allowing the study investigators to store some of the blood that was taken but not used for other tests. This will allow the researchers to derive metabolomics and molecular data that are complementary in obesity research and provide value for enhancing precision care in this health disparate population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Cardiometabolic measures</title><p id="Par43">Fasting blood samples (venipuncture; 25&#x000a0;mL), will be collected at baseline and 8-weeks, by a trained phlebotomist, for the purpose of examining the following cardiometabolic measures: total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), HbA1C, hs-CRP, and fasting glucose. A comprehensive metabolic liver/kidney panel will be performed to assess the following: albumin, globulin, A/G ratio, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, creatinine, BUN/creatinine ratio, glomerular filtration rate/estimated, and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide). All laboratory tests will be performed by an independent, clinical lab (Banner University Medical Center, Tucson, AZ), blinded to the study outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Physical activity</title><p id="Par44">Physical activity will be assessed at baseline and 8-weeks using the Global PA Questionnaire (GPAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is available in both English and Spanish and provides minutes/week of physical activity of varying intensity and type. The GPAQ has been validated compared to accelerometer data in determining time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and to assess changes in physical activity over time. Cleland et al.

We aimed to recruit, on average, approximately 2&#x02013;3 participants per week during the active recruitment phase. A recruitment rate of less than this would indicate a lack of feasibility. We recorded the number of Hispanic adults who contacted the researchers and expressed interest in participation, the number screened for eligibility, and the number ineligible for study inclusion and the reason for their ineligibility. Retention will be assessed by calculating the proportion of participants who completed the study out of the number enrolled, with a 95% confidence interval.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Treatment satisfaction/acceptability</title><p id="Par49">At the completion of the study, participants will take part in an exit interview where they will be asked to rate their overall satisfaction with the intervention, if they would consider a longer-term beverage intervention, and finally, if they would recommend the program to others. Participants will also be asked questions regarding satisfaction with their overall progress and for changing dietary beverage habits. Each item will be rated on a Likert scale with higher scores indicating greater program favorability. Open-ended questions will be used to seek participant input on modifications that could be made to improve acceptability and effectiveness of the intervention.

We will include fixed effects of intervention arm, time and their interaction to allow for different patterns of change between the arms, as well as a random participant effect to account for the longitudinal nature of the data. Baseline values of the outcomes will be included in the dependent variable vector. The changes from baseline, and the differences between arms in change from baseline will be estimated using contrasts from the mixed models. Mixed models yield unbiased estimates for data that are missing completely at random (when missingness does not depend on any observed or unobserved data) and missing at random (when missingness may depend on observed data, such as the baseline value of the outcomes), as these models perform an implicit imputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

The trial will be considered feasible if the proportion retained is greater than 70%. If retention in the study is 81% or greater, the 95% confidence interval will not contain this 70% cutoff. Power will be insufficient to detect a minimum important difference of a 6&#x000a0;mg/dL change in fasting lipids from baseline, the primary efficacy outcome, based on variance estimates from a trial using a different fruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] (standard deviation &#x02248;25&#x000a0;mg/dL). We acknowledge that we are not sufficiently powered to detect important differences between arms, but if the 95% confidence intervals for the comparison of the arms contain important differences we will take this as indication of a promising intervention. Variance components estimated from this study will be used to design an adequately powered trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Data management</title><p id="Par52">Data management will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines to enhance data quality assurance and control. This will include standard operating procedures and staff trainings for data acquisition, entry, and processing.
