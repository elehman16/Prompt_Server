All patients were oestrogen receptor positive or unknown. Serum levels of gonadotrophins and oestrogens were suppressed markedly by both doses. All oestrogen values during treatment were within the postmenopausal range except for a single oestradiol level (274 pmol l-1) in one patient on the lower dose. There was no other indication that this lower dose was less effective as an oestrogen suppressant. There were two objective responders to the 3.75 mg dose and three to the 7.5 mg dose. Toxicity was confined almost entirely to hot flushes which occurred in 11/12 patients. We conclude that the slow release formulation of leuprorelin is effective in breast cancer treatment and that there is no major detriment to the use of the 3.75 rather than 7.5 mg dose.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00219-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="834" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00219-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="835" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00219-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="836" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00219-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="837" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
