In the present study, 12 male goats were randomly assigned to either a hay diet (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) or an HG diet (65% grain; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) to characterise the changes in the composition of the bacterial community in colonic mucosa and the mucosal morphology of the colon. The results showed that HG feeding decreased the colonic pH and increased the concentrations of total short chain fatty acids and lipopolysaccharides in colonic digesta. The principal coordinate analysis results showed that the HG diet altered the colonic mucosal bacterial communities, with an increase in the abundance of genus <italic>Blautia</italic> and a decrease in the abundance of genera <italic>Bacillus, Enterococcus,</italic> and <italic>Lactococcus</italic>. The HG-fed goats showed sloughing of the surface layer epithelium, intercellular tight junction erosion, cell mitochondrial damage, and upregulation of the relative mRNA expression of IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; in colonic mucosa. Collectively, our data indicate that HG feeding induced changes in colonic mucosal morphology and cytokines expression that might be caused by excessive fermentation and dramatic shifts in the bacterial populations in the colon.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Meat goats are often fed relatively high-grain (HG) diets to achieve maximum production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Usually, feeding HG diets tends to increase meat production. However, feeding diets high in readily fermentable carbohydrates increases the probability of developing subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) and decreases the long-term productive performance of goats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. During SARA, the rate of ruminal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production exceeds SCFA absorption and results in an unhealthy depression of ruminal pH, further causing a shift in the rumen microbiota<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Events that occur in the rumen during SARA are mirrored in the hindgut. A previous study revealed that an increase in intestinal carbohydrate fermentation typically occurs concurrently with HG feeding and may lead to increased concentrations of SCFA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as reduced pH in the colons of goats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. This reduction might indicate that colonic fermentation characteristics are altered by HG feeding. This alteration in fermentation characteristics may affect the composition of the colonic bacterial communities due to the susceptibility of some bacteria to low pH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Indeed, Metzler-Zebeli <italic>et al.</italic> (2013) reported that HG feeding had an impact on colonic digesta-associated bacterial populations in goats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, similar information regarding colonic epithelial bacteria is incomplete compared to knowledge of the bacterial community in the colonic luminal content of goats fed HG diets.</p><p>The colonic epithelium is inhabited by mucosa-associated bacteria and represents a physical and immunological barrier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Thus, maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of the mucosal epithelium is extremely important. Previous studies have found that HG feeding induced diarrhoea, frothy faeces, and increased particle size in faeces<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In addition, mucin casts have been observed in the faeces of dairy cattle during SARA, indicating that HG feeding may lead to hindgut mucosal injury in ruminants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However, there is little information regarding changes in the histological structure and ultrastructure of the colonic mucosa of ruminants during HG feeding.</p><p>Herein, we hypothesised that HG diet feeding might cause changes in colonic fermentation characteristics and the mucosal-associated bacterial community, and that these changes might induce colonic mucosal injury in goats. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the changes in colonic fermentation characteristics, mucosal bacterial composition, and mucosal morphology during HG feeding.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>The goats were healthy throughout the experiment.

In the present study, we investigated the adaptive response of the colon mucosal bacteria to HG feeding using high-throughput sequencing methods. In line with previous findings in bacterial communities in the colonic mucosa of calves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and in the ruminal epithelia of goats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, our results revealed that the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are the predominant phyla in colonic mucosa across all samples, accounting for over 80% of the total sequences. Bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla are known for a fermentative metabolism and degradation of carbon sources, oligosaccharides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, protein and amino acid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The high abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in colonic mucosal-associated bacteria suggest that they have a role in the utilisation of carbohydrates, protein and amino acid. Nevertheless, among the dominant phyla in the colon mucosa, the phylum Firmicutes contained the most bacteria with 67.34% of total sequences, followed by the phyla Bacteroidetes (13.24%) and Proteobacteria (10.92%), compared to the dominant bacteria (Firmicutes: 50% of total sequences) in the colon tissue of pre-weaned calves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The different percentage of dominant phyla in colon mucosa may be explained by the different diets and hosts used in the studies.</p><p>In the present study, we observed that HG feeding decreased the richness of colonic mucosal bacteria, which was confirmed by richness estimates based on chao1 and ACE. The results of unweighted UniFrac PCoA and AMOVA further revealed the bacterial community difference between the two groups, indicating that HG feeding altered the composition of the mucosa-associated bacterial community. This alteration may be due to several reasons. First, the strong effect of a decrease in colonic pH might contribute to the changes in the colonic mucosal bacterial community. There is sufficient information available regarding the susceptibility of rumen and hindgut bacteria to low pH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In the present study, the lower colonic pH might decrease the richness of some colonic mucosal bacteria due to their susceptibility to low pH, while increased abundance of some low pH-tolerant colonic mucosal bacteria. Second, variations in the content of dietary components between the two groups might also have resulted in the differences in colonic bacterial response. During HG feeding, dietary-derived nutrients such as starch are likely to be used by mucosa-associated bacteria during HG feeding, thus resulting in an increase in the percentage of polysaccharide-degrading bacteria such as <italic>Blautia</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Third, and perhaps most important, colonic mucosal injury induced by HG feeding may affect the colonic mucosal bacterial community by increasing the availability of attachment sites for opportunistic bacteria.</p><p>At the genus level, the relative abundances of <italic>Bacillus, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Psychrobacter</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> decreased in HG-fed goats. Some strains of <italic>Lactococcus,</italic> the lactate producers, are important members of the endogenous bacteria that play an anti-inflammatory role in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The decrease in the abundance of <italic>Lactococcus</italic> in the HG-fed group in this study indicates that an HG diet may be associated with the local inflammation in colon. Indeed, our data revealed that the goats fed the HG diet showed a significantly lower abundance of <italic>L. piscium</italic> (OTU-1454) and <italic>L. lactis</italic> subsp (OTU-668) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. S5</xref>). As the probiotic effect of <italic>L. pisciu</italic>m and <italic>L. lactis</italic> on human health has been extensively documented<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The decrease in the abundance of <italic>L. pisciu</italic>m and <italic>L. lactis</italic> in the HG group further demonstrated that feeding an HG diet may have negative effects on mucosal health. In the present study, a possible reason for the decrease in the proportion of <italic>Psychrobacter</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (both gram-negative bacteria) in the HG-fed group may be related to the lower pH of the colonic digesta that resulted from the HG feeding, as gram-negative populations are known to be sensitive to low pH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>It has been reported that the gut bacteria make an important functional contribution in maintaining the health of the host<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In the present study, PICRUSt was used to determine the potential functions of mucosa-associated bacteria in colons across all samples. The distinct difference in predicted functional pathways between the hay and HG groups indicates that alterations of bacterial communities are also likely to alter the functional capability of the colonic mucosa-associated bacterial community. Our data showed that compared with the control group, the genes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism were up-regulated in the HG group, while there was a decrease in the genes involved in lipid metabolism. This coordinated change in gene expression suggests a selective shift in metabolic pathways favouring the use of carbohydrates as fuel to sustain energy expenditure for the mucosa-associated bacteria. In addition, an increased percentage of bacterial inferred genes associated with immune system diseases were observed in the HG group, suggesting the possibility that long-term patterns of HG diet consumption may have detrimental effects on host immune function. In the present study, a relative increase in genes associated with energy metabolism pathways was also present in the HG group, indicating that the mucosal microbiomes associated with HG feeding may have an increased capacity for energy harvest. In general, these predicted data indicates that long-term HG diet feeding may alter the bacterial function of the colonic mucosal microbiome in goats. However, it must be noted that PICRUSt&#x02019;s well-validated predictive approach cannot confirm with absolute certainty the functional capabilities of the metagenome. Thus, true metagenomic shotgun sequencing is needed to provide greater power in order to examine the effects of feeding HG diets on the function of mucosa-associated bacteria in the colon of goats.</p><p>The changes in gastrointestinal fermentation and the mucosal bacterial community may further affect the histological integrity and function of the gastrointestinal epithelium. Previous studies have revealed that feeding HG diets to ruminants causes a high risk of damage to the histological integrity and functions of the ruminal epithelium in dairy cows and goats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. However, there are very few reports on the influence of an HG diet on colonic epithelial structure and function. The present study showed that feeding an HG diet to goats for seven weeks resulted in sloughing of the surface layer epithelium, intercellular tight junction erosion and cell mitochondrial damage. In addition, we observed that HG feeding up-regulated the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3;) and decreased the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) compared with the control. There are many possible explanations for the mucosal injury in the HG group. First, excessive carbohydrates in the colons of HG-fed goats may increase the osmotic pressure of digesta. High osmotic pressure is undoubtedly a threat to the epithelial barrier and may increase the permeability of the colonic epithelium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Second, luminal acidity is one of the most important factors in determining the status of the epithelial barrier. A previous study reported that acetic acid (0.1 M) showed a time- and pH-dependent ability to damage the colonic epithelium in pigs and that its mechanism is probably related to the ability of lower environmental pH to stimulate the SCFA entering into the non-glandular mucosal cells, acidifying the cell and damaging chloride-dependent Na transport, which results in cell necrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In the present study, the level of acetate and other SCFA components in the colonic digesta was markedly higher in HG-fed goats, which might increase localisation epithelial necrosis.</p><p>While this study reveals the detrimental effects of an HG diet on the integrity of the intestinal epithelium, the principle mechanisms responsible for triggering a local immune response during HG feeding are unknown. In the current study, correlation analysis revealed that there is a relationship between pH and some Inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1&#x003b2;, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-10. These results indicate that the lower pH may partly contribute to the changes in colonic cytokines expression in the HG group. Indeed, the influence of lower pH on inflammation in the colon is well documented<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. It is well known that SCFAs have high lipid solubility. When environmental pH declines to the threshold, the SCFA can enter into the non-glandular mucosal cells, acidifying the cell and damaging chloride-dependent Na transport, which results in cell necrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p><p>It should be stressed that it is not only lower pH that can affect mucosal cytokines expression; there are also some pathogenic and opportunistic pathogenic bacteria that can induce inflammation. Previous studies have revealed that intestinal mucosal tissue damage in colitis cases might result mostly from the production of inflammatory cytokines in response to commensal bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In the present study, the correlation analysis of the composition of mucosa-associated bacteria and the inflammatory parameters showed that the increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines correlated with changes in some mucosal bacteria of goats. In particular, the increased IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA expression observed in the goats fed the HG diet, were linked to enrichments in <italic>Blautia</italic> in the HG group. As mentioned earlier, some of the <italic>Blautia</italic> phylotypes are known to have deleterious mucosal injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In addition, the correlation analysis showed that the genus <italic>Alistipes</italic>, which is directly connected to elevated inflammation levels in the human gut and is known to have deleterious mucosal injury effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, is positively correlated with the relative mRNA expression of IL-2 and IL-6. This implies that the inflammation that occurs in the hindgut mucosal epithelium may also partly be due to the change in the abundance of genus <italic>Alistipes</italic>.</p><p>However, it has not been concluded whether variations in colonic pH and the mucosal bacterial community are the factors that contribute to the initial development of local inflammation in the colonic epithelium during HG diet feeding. Indeed, a very recent study regarding the expression of genes and proteins with key protection functions in the rumen epithelia of goats fed low-grain and HG diets revealed a mismatch in gene and protein expression in response to grain level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, indicating that the upregulation in the expression of cytokine genes might not result in increased expression of the corresponding proteins. Thus, future studies are needed to determine whether differences in the colonic mucosal bacterial communities of hay and HG groups are associated with differences in the protein expression of cytokines.</p><p>There has been remarkably little information regarding the consequences of damage to the colonic epithelium on the function of the colon and animal performance. However, recent studies on the influence of rumen acidosis on rumen function have highlighted the possibility that injury to the colonic epithelium has a potential impact on colon function. Previous studies have revealed that rumen acidosis may increase the permeability of the rumen epithelium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, and increased permeability may increase the uptake of toxic compounds such as histamine generated in the rumen into the body and the uptake of SCFAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In addition, chronic inflammation caused by damage to the rumen epithelium may stimulate the release of cytokines and trigger an immune response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, the latter of which may decrease feed intake and diet digestibility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Further, recent studies have revealed that hindgut acidosis decreased diet digestibility and milk fat percentage in cattle, and that the decreased diet digestibility likely resulted from increased bulk in the digestive tract or from increased digesta passage rate, reducing exposure of the digesta to intestinal enzymes and epithelial absorptive surfaces<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Permeability of the colonic epithelium and diet digestibility in the colon were not measured in the current study. However, Emmanuel <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> showed that low pH in the presence of LPS increased the permeability of colon epithelia in cattle. Therefore, these findings indicate that the damage to the colonic epithelium due to HG feeding may have a potential adverse impact on colon function and animal performance.</p><p>In conclusion, this study showed that HG feeding caused decreased colonic pH in goats and increased concentrations of total colonic SCFA, lactic acid, and LPS, indicating increased fermentation and the production of free LPS in the large intestine. Data from this study also demonstrated that HG diet feeding led to the changes in the colonic mucosal bacterial community, with an increase in the abundance of the genus <italic>Blautia</italic> and a decrease in the abundance of genera <italic>Bacillus, Enterococcus</italic> and <italic>Lactococcus</italic>. Microscopic examinations of the colonic mucosa revealed that the HG diet resulted in mucosal epithelial injury, and RT-PCR revealed that HG caused the up-regulated expression of IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; in the colonic mucosa. Correlation analysis revealed that the alteration in pH and mucosa-associated bacteria during HG feeding might partly contribute to changes in expression of colonic mucosal cytokines. Overall, these results provide a comprehensive picture of the bacterial structure of the colon during HG feeding and help to further elucidate the etiology of hindgut disorders in ruminants.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Our animal experiment was approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of Nanjing Agricultural University, in accordance with the Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals (The State Science and Technology Commission of China, 1988).

The DNA was extracted by a bead-beating method using a QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen,, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Briefly, colonic mucosa samples were disrupted in an ASL buffer and homogenised with 100&#x02009;mg of zirconium beads (0.1&#x02009;mm) in a Mini-Beadbeater-1 (Biospec Products Inc.) at a rate of 4800&#x02009;rpm/min four times for 30&#x02009;s each time at room temperature.
