Fifteen sheep were randomly divided into three groups. Groups 1 and 2 received selenium nanoparticles (1&#x000a0;mg/kg) or sodium selenite (1&#x000a0;mg/kg) orally, respectively, for ten consecutive days, and the third group was considered as the control. To determine the chemotactic and respiratory burst activities of the neutrophils, the leading front assay and the NBT test were used on heparinized blood samples that were collected at different intervals (days&#x000a0;0, 10th, 20th, and 30th). The results obtained showed that the chemotactic activities in groups 1 and 2 increased significantly on the 10th, 20th, and 30th day, compared to day&#x000a0;0, and on the 20th day in comparison with the 10th day, while in group 2, there was a significant decrease on the 30th day compared to the 20th day. The chemotactic activities in group 1 were significantly higher than in group 2 on the 10th day and in the control group on the 10th, 20th, and 30th day, but the chemotactic activities in group 2 were significantly higher than those in the control group only on the 20th day. On the 30th day into the experiment, the respiratory bursts in groups 1 and 2 were significantly stronger in comparison with those at day&#x000a0;0. Overall, nano-selenium increased the chemotactic and respiratory burst activities more significantly than sodium selenite, which is suggestive of a stronger stimulatory effect of the Se nanoparticles on intracellular activities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Nano-selenium</kwd><kwd>Sodium selenite</kwd><kwd>Chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>Respiratory burst</kwd><kwd>Sheep</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for higher animals and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The best-known biological roles of selenium are linked to its presence as the functional component in selenoenzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Se incorporates into proteins such as selenocysteine and prevents oxidative damage to body tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It plays important roles in antioxidant defensive system, regulation of thyroid hormones metabolism, and cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The cancer preventive properties of Se have been proved according to epidemiologic, clinical, and experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The antioxidant and prooxidant effects of Se as well as its bioavailability and toxicity depend on its chemical form. Studies have demonstrated that Se nanoparticles are more efficient than selenite, selenomethionine, and methylselenocysteine in upregulating selenoenzymes in mice and rats, while exhibiting significantly lower acute toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Nano-Se can be used as an antioxidant with reduced risk of Se toxicity and kind of chemopreventive agent because the induction of GST by Se is a crucial mechanism for this chemopreventive effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Nano-Se in different sizes (5&#x02013;200&#x000a0;nm) has equal capacity for the induction of selenoenzymes in cell culture and in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], although another study showed that different sizes of nano-Se had different potency in direct prevention of free radicals in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Among the nutritional factors that affect the chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and the respiratory burst of the neutrophils&#x02019; activities under physiological and pathological conditions, selenium is very important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Adequate levels of selenium in the feed prevent the accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides in organs and tissues and protect them from damage by oxygen radical species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Accordingly, the present study was designed to compare the chemotactic and respiratory burst activities of neutrophils in healthy sheep receiving selenium either in the form of nanoparticles or as sodium selenite, applying the leading front and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) assay.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p>Fifteen healthy, 5 to 12&#x000a0;months old, Lori&#x02013;Bakhtiari sheep were selected and randomly divided into three groups. The sheep were orally given nano red selenium (group I; 1&#x000a0;mg/kg B.W.) and sodium selenite (group II; 1&#x000a0;mg/kg B.W.) for ten consecutive days. The control group was given distilled water (group III).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ration</title><p>During the study period, sheep were fed alfalfa hay and barely.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The material includes SeO<sub>2</sub> and ascorbic acid. The ascorbic acid solution was added into the aqueous solution of SeO<sub>2</sub> to initiate the reaction. After the addition of ascorbic acid, nano red selenium particles began to form, causing the solutions to change from colorless to red. The red color of the ascorbic acid-treated solutions suggested that the selenium was present either in its amorphous or monoclinic forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The sizes of the obtained nano-Se particles ranged from 80 to 200&#x000a0;nm as determined by scanning electron microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sampling</title><p>Blood samples (20&#x000a0;ml of each sheep) were collected from the jugular veins at the beginning of the experiment (day&#x000a0;0), and subsequently on days&#x000a0;10, 20, and 30. The samples were put in acid-washed polyethylene tubes containing heparin as the anticoagulation agent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Chemotactic Activity Measuring Assay</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Isolation of the Neutrophils</title><p>The neutrophils were isolated immediately after sampling in each day, and the 20&#x000a0;ml of heparinized blood was centrifuged at 1,000&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> and temperature 4&#x000b0;C for 15&#x000a0;min. Then, the buffy coat layer was isolated, and 2&#x000a0;ml of phycol was added to it from top to bottom: (1) the leukocyte&#x02013;monocyte layer, (2) the neutrophil layer, and (3) the RBC sedimentation layer.</p><p>The upper fluid was removed, and the neutrophil layer was collected slowly with a sampler and added to 2&#x000a0;ml of RPMI 1640.

At the beginning, two to three sterile Whatman papers were placed at the bottom of six house plates, and for each sample, two houses were considered (one house as negative control and another as positive control). The negative control houses contained 1.5&#x000a0;ml of RPMI 1640 and 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of FCS, and the positive control houses contained .5&#x000a0;ml of RPMI 1640, 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of FCS, and 100&#x02013;150 landa of LPS (At the time of RPMI 1640 preparation, penicillin and streptomycin antibiotics were added). For each sample, two Boyden chambers were considered, and the neutrophil solution prepared last was added to the chambers so that their bottoms are convex. A 3-&#x003bc;m micropore filter was then placed on each chamber, and they were put on the negative control houses invertedly in order to prevent the environments from becoming dry. Sterile distilled water was poured between the plate houses, and the plates were put in a 37&#x000b0;C incubator for 3&#x000a0;h. During this period, the neutrophils moved through the micropore filter holes towards the chemotactic material (LPS). The plates exited from the incubator after 3&#x000a0;h, and the stages of fixation and staining were done.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Fixation and Staining</title><p>In this stage, each micropore filter containing neutrophils was fixed and stained as follows: first, the filters were placed in isopropanole for 20&#x000a0;min so that the fixation process could be completed. The filters were then placed in sterile distilled water for 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min until isopropanole was removed from the filters inside. The filters were placed in hematoxylin solution, methylene blue, and isopropanole for 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min in each stage, respectively. In the final stage, the micropore filters were placed in xylol for 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min and were surveyed with a microscope after drying.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Neutrophils&#x02019; Motility Measuring Assay</title><p>The filters were placed on slides so that their surface was facing upward. To make the filters more transparent, a xylol droplet was poured on the slide, and lens number 40 and 100 were used to focus on the highest level of the filter (where the most cell accumulation was observed). In this condition, the number on the microscope micrometer screw was noted, and the screw was moved slowly until the filter down layers appeared; the action was continued till the stained cells inside the filter were observed. The last place where the neutrophils were observed was considered to be the maximum limit of migration, and the number on the micrometer screw was noted. Subtraction of the first and second number showed the distance traveled by the neutrophils. For each sample, five places in different points of the filter were observed randomly by two microscope lenses, and the average was registered as the distance traveled by neutrophils.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Respiratory Burst Measuring Assay</title><p>For respiratory burst assay, NBT reduction test was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] in which the oxidant substances inside the phagocytic cells were reduced by nitroblue tetrazolium and changed color.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>NBT Solution Preparation</title><p>Five milligrams of NBT yellow powder, 85&#x000a0;mg of BSA powder, and 5&#x000a0;ml of PBS 1&#x000d7; buffer were mixed and shaken slowly so that the BSA and NBT were solved in the buffer. Before the beginning of the process, 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of PMA (20&#x000a0;Mg/ml) was added to the complex as motivator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Wright-Geimsa Buffer Preparation</title><p>For this purpose, 2&#x000a0;g of K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> was mixed with 1&#x000a0;g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and the mixture volume was extended to 1,000&#x000a0;ml using distilled water, and the solution PH was regulated by a PH meter which had to be between 6.9 and 7.2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>NBT Test Method</title><p>Fifty landa of heparinized blood was put in the microtube, and 50 landa of NBT solution was added to it; the microtube was shaken by the shaker carefully, and the microtubes were placed at 37&#x000b0;C bain-marie for 30&#x000a0;min. The microtubes were then centrifuged at 1,500&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 3&#x000a0;min. The suspension on each sample was removed by a sampler value of 50 landa, and a smear was made of the cells remaining at the bottom of the microtube on slide. Three slides were made for each sample. After the smears had dried, Wright-Geimsa color was poured on the slides, and after 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min, Wright-Geimsa buffer was added onto the slides. Slides were washed with water after 4&#x000a0;min, and the color remaining on the slides was cleared with alcohol. In the next stage, 100 neutrophils of each slide were counted, and the percentage of the cells which had reduced NBT was determined (colored blue spots were observed on cytoplasm).

Also, the chemotactic activity on the 20th day was significantly more than on the 10th day (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025). As Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> clearly shows, in group 1, the chemotactic activity decreased from the 20th day on, but statistically, there were no significant differences between the 20th and 30th day (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). The statistical survey in group 2 (sodium selenite) showed that there was a significant increase on the 10th, 20th, and 30th day in comparison to the day&#x000a0;0 (<italic>P</italic> value was 0.050, &#x0003c;0.001, and 0.016, respectively). A significant increase on the 20th day in comparison with the 10th day (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) was also seen.

However, after oral consumption of selenium admixtures on the 10th, 20th, and 30th day, respiratory burst activity increased in groups 1 and 2, and by comparing the means of the three groups, no significant differences in respiratory burst activity value were seen in the different sampling days (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Changes (mean &#x000b1; SD) in respiratory burst activity of each of the groups during sampling at different days</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Group sampling days</th><th>1 (nano-selenium)</th><th>2 (sodium selenite)</th><th>Control</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">11.174&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.568</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">11.566&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.325</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">11.364&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.649</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">13.260&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.952</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">16.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.332</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">12.542&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.252</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">14.640&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.395</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">18.864&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.099</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">12.566&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.516</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">21.322&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.316<italic>*</italic></td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">24.778&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.123<italic>*</italic></td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">13.912&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.511</td></tr><tr><td>P value</td><td><italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05</td><td><italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05</td><td><italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>*P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 (significant increase on day&#x000a0;0)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Selenium (Se), as an essential micronutrient for animals, has three levels of biological activities: (1) trace levels are required for normal growth and development, (2) nutritional and supra-nutritional levels can be stored and homeostatic functions will be maintained, and (3) toxic levels can result in harmful effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Different sources of Se in the basal diet could improve the final weight, relative gain rate, enzymes, etc. All forms of selenium have similar abilities that allow them to increase selenoenzyme activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Se is involved in selenoprotein-type structures which include glutathione peroxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], P selenoprotein, and W selenoprotein, and as selenocysteine to GSH-Px [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and thioredoxin reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These proteins have a protective role against oxidant materials in body cells and cause an increase in the body&#x02019;s cell resistance such as immunity cells against oxidative destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The most important action of Se is its antioxidant effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Se increases the capacity of being protected from free radicals and the immunity status of the animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Researchers in the studies showed the advantages of nano-Se effects in comparison with other forms of Se; for instance, nano-Se increases the activity of GPx, TrxR, and GST more than methylselenocysteine in mice. It can be used as a potential chemopreventive agent with significant reduced risk of Se toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Toxicity of nano-Se is less than that of selenomethionine, which is indicated by LD50 values, acute liver injury, and short-term toxicity. GST activity increases much earlier and more severely by nano-Se in comparison with selenomethionine and selenite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Huang et al. showed that the elemental Se nanoparticles have significant effects on both scavenging the free radicals and protecting DNA against oxidation, size dependently: the smaller, the better [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The free radical scavenging effects of the nano-Se may be increased by the interactions between nanoparticles and BSA. The supra-nutritional dose of Se may be necessary, partially as nano-Se, which can stick to the proteins in living tissue and increase the local concentrations of Se on proteins, leading to more efficient protective effects against free radicals and the subsequent anticarcinogenetic effects. Also, by the results of this study, it can also be determined that selenium nanoparticles, in comparison with sodium selenite, have better and quicker effects on chemotactic and respiratory burst activities of neutrophils. Generally, nano-Se has stronger effects on supporting the antioxidant defense systems in comparison with inorganic forms of Se. Various factors affect the chemotactic, phagocytosis, and respiratory burst activities of neutrophils such as nutrition, and between the nutrients, selenium is very important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The cells&#x02019; ability to decrease changes and hydrogen peroxide elimination is dependent on selenium, so selenium deficiency can cause chemotactic suppression, and this reduces neutrophils&#x02019; bactericidal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Fraga has mentioned that selenium deficiency can increase oxygen free radicals in body tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the major negative effects of which are on the consistency of biological membranes and the performance of immunity cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Heyland (2005) has suggested selenium meal consumption as a protective antioxidant activity and a way of decreasing acute disease mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In other studies, it was observed that neutrophils&#x02019; phagocytic ability was normal at the time of selenium deficiency, but its ability to kill cells was reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Zhang et al. indicated that nano-Se had a weaker interference effect than selenite on antioxidative balance in Se-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Se causes an increase in the stability of neutrophils because it acts as an antioxidant and protects body cells against oxidative hurts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Antioxidants increase cell life and survival duration in blood circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Consequently, Se deficiency decreases the value of glutathione peroxide enzyme activity and results in reducing neutrophil activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and cells become sensitized to oxidative damage, causing cell death to occur faster because of oxidative materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The major results of increasing phagocytic activities of polynuclear cells, especially neutrophils, which are the first body defensive barriers (this defensive mechanism is glutathione peroxide enzyme which contains selenium and destroys the produced peroxides), are increase in oxidative pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Also, respiratory burst, which occurred in neutrophils, can release oxygen free radicals that play a major role in pathogenesis of foreign agents. When neutrophils stick to foreign agents, the usage of oxygen will be increased hundreds of times more than before. This causes increasing activation of the NADPH oxidase enzyme on the cell surface. After neutrophils adhere to foreign agents, they will phagocyte and destroy them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Toxic materials that are produced in neutrophils are severely destructive and cause neutrophil membrane destruction and another cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Se admixtures can prevent destruction by elimination of toxic materials and free radicals and can reduce toxic material production of neutrophils and lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this study, in the control group, there were no significant differences in the chemotactic activity value on any of the sampling days because there were no chemotactic substances such as LPS, which is the main cause of neutrophils&#x02019; orientated locomotion. In groups 1 and 2, neutrophils&#x02019; chemotactic activities were increased, but nano-Se was more intense on the first 10&#x000a0;days (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.035). Although chemotaxis activity was considerably decreased by sodium selenite from day&#x000a0;20 on (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.017), the reduction by nano-Se was not significant from the 20th day on (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). So, it is obvious that the more intensive nano-Se is caused by neutrophils&#x02019; oriented locomotion, and the higher value retained for a longer period of time in comparison with sodium selenite. Respiratory burst activity is influenced by different physiological, immunological, and pathological factors. The effects of animal breed, illness history, and technical factors such as choice of data analysis method have also been under study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Foreign agents&#x02019; destruction ability of neutrophils was assayed with NBT reduction test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the present study, all sheep have similar ability in respiratory burst activity before the consumption of nano-Se and sodium selenite, but an increase was observed after consumption of selenium admixtures. This increase in both groups 1 and 2 on the 30th day in comparison with the day&#x000a0;0 was significant. So, according to the present results, it is clear that, to create significant increase in neutrophils&#x02019; respiratory burst activity, a period of at least 20&#x000a0;days is required. Radostits et al. showed that selenium requires a 20-day period in order to maximize the number of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Thus, the role of selenium in the improvement of neutrophils&#x02019; performance and survival is determined and, depending on the selenium compound, this function may differ. Therefore, nano-Se increased neutrophils&#x02019; numbers, neutrophils&#x02019; appetence toward chemotactic substance (LPS), the ability of neutrophils to clean up, and neutrophils&#x02019; insistence against oxidative stress with more intention in comparison with sodium selenite. The type of neutrophil response varies by the severity of infection. In mild bacterial infections, neutrophil number, chemotactic activity, phagocytosis, and the ability to kill the cell increase, and after recovery become normal, while in acute infections with toxic changes in neutrophils, chemotactic activity, phagocytosis, and the ability of neutrophils to kill cells are reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Toxic neutrophils have only 25% of the healthy neutrophil activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on all the information mentioned regarding the role of selenium, it is clear that these materials are important factors in increasing the resistance and the defensive ability of the immunity system in sheep. So, Se nanoparticles have better and stronger effects on increasing chemotactic and respiratory burst activities of neutrophils in sheep than sodium selenite. Consequently, by considering other research studies that have proved that Se nanoparticles have less toxicity and more bioability than the other forms of Se, and according to the present study that showed the benefits of Se nanoparticles in comparison with sodium selenite, the use of Se nanoparticles as food supplements in animals&#x02019; diet instead of other forms of selenium is recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="d28e829"><title>Open Access</title><p>This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which
