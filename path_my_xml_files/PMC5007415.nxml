Many patients request psychological therapy, but the best-evidenced therapy&#x02014;cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)&#x02014;is complex and costly. A simpler therapy&#x02014;behavioural activation (BA)&#x02014;might be as effective and cheaper than is CBT. We aimed to establish the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of BA compared with CBT for adults with depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial, we recruited adults aged 18 years or older meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria for major depressive disorder from primary care and psychological therapy services in Devon, Durham, and Leeds (UK). We excluded people who were receiving psychological therapy, were alcohol or drug dependent, were acutely suicidal or had attempted suicide in the previous 2 months, or were cognitively impaired, or who had bipolar disorder or psychosis or psychotic symptoms. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) remotely using computer-generated allocation (minimisation used; stratified by depression severity [Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) score of &#x0003c;19 <italic>vs</italic> &#x02265;19], antidepressant use, and recruitment site) to BA from junior mental health workers or CBT from psychological therapists. Randomisation done at the Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit was concealed from investigators. Treatment was given open label, but outcome assessors were masked. The primary outcome was depression symptoms according to the PHQ-9 at 12 months. We analysed all those who were randomly allocated and had complete data (modified intention to treat [mITT]) and also all those who were randomly allocated, had complete data, and received at least eight treatment sessions (per protocol [PP]). We analysed safety in the mITT population. The non-inferiority margin was 1&#x000b7;9 PHQ-9 points.

BA was non-inferior to CBT (mITT: CBT 8&#x000b7;4 PHQ-9 points [SD 7&#x000b7;5], BA 8&#x000b7;4 PHQ-9 points [7&#x000b7;0], mean difference 0&#x000b7;1 PHQ-9 points [95% CI &#x02212;1&#x000b7;3 to 1&#x000b7;5], p=0&#x000b7;89; PP: CBT 7&#x000b7;9 PHQ-9 points [7&#x000b7;3]; BA 7&#x000b7;8 [6&#x000b7;5], mean difference 0&#x000b7;0 PHQ-9 points [&#x02013;1&#x000b7;5 to 1&#x000b7;6], p=0&#x000b7;99). Two (1%) non-trial-related deaths (one [1%] multidrug toxicity in the BA group and one [1%] cancer in the CBT group) and 15 depression-related, but not treatment-related, serious adverse events (three in the BA group and 12 in the CBT group) occurred in three [2%] participants in the BA group (two [1%] patients who overdosed and one [1%] who self-harmed) and eight (4%) participants in the CBT group (seven [4%] who overdosed and one [1%] who self-harmed).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>We found that BA, a simpler psychological treatment than CBT, can be delivered by junior mental health workers with less intensive and costly training, with no lesser effect than CBT.

Antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) have the most clinical evidence. However, although antidepressant medications are cheap, their use is limited by side-effects, poor patient adherence, and discontinuation relapse risk. CBT is as effective as are antidepressants<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and provides long-term protection against relapse, but it is complex and its effectiveness is dependent on the skills of psychological therapists, who are expensive to train and employ. For low-income and middle-income countries in particular, the need for an extensive professional infrastructure of such therapists limits access to CBT.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>Authors of published systematic reviews, including a Cochrane review, have commented on the limitations of existing evidence for the effectiveness of behavioural activation (BA) for depression compared with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and the scarcity of cost-effectiveness data, with the existing evidence insufficiently robust to establish comparability. Authors of the Cochrane review called for studies that improve the quality of evidence. Our pretrial evidence took published review findings from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), who reported no difference in treatment outcome between BA and CBT immediately after treatment (Hedges' <italic>g</italic> 0&#x000b7;139 [95% CI &#x02212;0&#x000b7;400 to 0&#x000b7;122]; p=0&#x000b7;296) and subsequent follow-up (0&#x000b7;135 [&#x02212;0&#x000b7;456 to 0&#x000b7;186]; p=0&#x000b7;409).

Eligible participants were adults aged 18 years or older who met diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder assessed by researchers using a standard clinical interview (Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [SCID]<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>). We excluded people at interview who were receiving psychological therapy, were alcohol or drug dependent, were acutely suicidal or had attempted suicide in the previous 2 months, or were cognitively impaired, or who had bipolar disorder or psychosis or psychotic symptoms.</p><p>We recruited participants by searching the electronic case records of general practices and psychological therapy services for patients with depression, identifying potential participants from depression classification codes. Practices or services contacted patients to seek permission for researcher contact. The research team interviewed those that responded, provided detailed information on the study, took informed written consent, and assessed people for eligibility. The UK South West Research Ethics Committee gave national approval for the study (NRES/07/H1208/60). The protocol has been published previously.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>After eligibility was established, consent agreed, and baseline data collected, we randomly allocated participants (1:1) to BA or CBT using computer-generated allocation, stratified by depression severity according to the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> (&#x0003c;19 <italic>vs</italic> &#x02265;19), antidepressant use (taking antidepressants or not), and recruitment site (Devon, Durham, or Leeds). A computer-based system allocated the first 20 participants to each group on a truly random basis. For subsequent participants, allocation was minimised to maximise the likelihood of balance in stratification variables across the two study groups. The registered Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit (Plymouth University, Plymouth, UK) allocated participants remotely after baseline data entry to ensure allocation concealment. Treatment was given open label, but outcome assessors were masked to participants' allocations. Concealment was ensured by use of an externally administered password-protected trial website with retention of a stochastic element to the minimisation algorithm. We recorded instances when outcome assessors were unmasked during interviews if participants informed them of their allocation.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>We developed our clinical protocols in line with published treatment protocols,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> including those from our own trials,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> advice from international collaborators, and NICE recommendations<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> for duration and frequency of BA and CBT. Full-time National Health Service (NHS) MHWs and therapists worked half of their working week for COBRA (with the other half worked as normal) and followed written manuals to deliver a maximum of 20 sessions over 16 weeks, with the option of four additional booster sessions if the patients wanted them.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Treatment included core and supplementary techniques appropriate to the BA or CBT protocol to be used as clinically indicated; for example, behavioural or cognitive strategies for management of anxiety. All core components of both treatments were delivered by session eight, which we considered to represent a minimally sufficient dose of therapy (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Sessions were face to face, lasting for 60 min. BA and CBT experts on the trial team trained MHWs and therapists for 5 days in either BA or CBT. MHWs and therapists were assessed for competence at the end of training with use of standardised quality criteria instruments consistent with the relevant treatment: either the Quality of Behavioral Activation Scale (Dimidjian S, University of Colorado, personal communication) or the Revised Cognitive Therapy Scale for CBT.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Further training was given if competency was not demonstrated. MHWs and therapists received 60 min of clinical supervision fortnightly from NHS psychological therapists clinically experienced in BA or CBT, overseen by trial team experts.</p><p>Junior MHWs&#x02014;graduates trained to deliver guided self-help interventions, but with neither professional mental health qualifications nor formal training in psychological therapies&#x02014;delivered an individually tailored programme re-engaging participants with positive environmental stimuli and developing depression management strategies. Participants were encouraged to increase their contact with individually specified positive situations and reduce their avoidance of other situations. Specific BA techniques included identification of depressed behaviours, analysis of the triggers and consequences of depressed behaviours, monitoring of activities, development of alternative goal-orientated behaviours, scheduling of activities, and development of alternative behavioural responses to rumination.</p><p>Professional or equivalently qualified psychotherapists, accredited as CBT therapists with the British Association of Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy, with a postgraduate diploma in CBT, delivered a personalised treatment programme based on an assessment of how participants' beliefs lead to emotional distress and ineffectual coping. Participants used cognitive and behavioural exercises to specifically test the accuracy of those beliefs by identifying and modifying negative thoughts and beliefs that give rise to them. Specific techniques included participants monitoring moods and activities, planning of exercises to test negative beliefs, and thought records to identify and examine the accuracy of negative automatic thoughts and underlying beliefs. We did follow-up assessments 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months after randomisation.</p><p>We assessed the quality of and adherence to treatment using audiotapes and written records of therapy sessions. Independent experts in both treatments rated a random (with use of a computer-generated random number sequence) sample of tapes, stratified by therapist, therapy session, and intervention, for competence using the Revised Cognitive Therapy Scale<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> for CBT (range 0&#x02013;72) and the Quality of Behavioral Activation Scale (Dimidjian S, University of Colorado, personal communication) for BA (range 0&#x02013;96).

For adverse events, we recorded deaths from whatever cause and all self-harm and suicide attempts. The independent Data Management Committee reviewed all adverse events and made relevant trial conduct recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Previous research has suggested that non-inferiority margins should be half of the mean controlled effect size from historical trials.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Accordingly, we estimated the non-inferiority margin for the primary outcome using meta-analysis data from trials of BA<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> for which BA was superior to controls by a mean of 0&#x000b7;7 SD units (95% CI 0&#x000b7;39&#x02013;1) or 3&#x000b7;8 PHQ-9 score units (2&#x000b7;1&#x02013;5&#x000b7;4). Therefore, our non-inferiority margin was 1&#x000b7;9 PHQ-9 points (ie, 0&#x000b7;5&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;3&#x000b7;8). We inflated our sample size by 20% for participant follow-up attrition. We planned to recruit 220 participants per arm to detect a between-group non-inferiority margin of 1&#x000b7;9 PHQ-9 points with a one-sided 2&#x000b7;5% &#x003b1;. Furthermore, although findings from a trial<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> of CBT have shown little effect of outcome clustering by therapists, the presence of a small therapist clustering effect (ie, an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0&#x000b7;01) would still provide the same power.</p><p>We did all analyses using a statistical analysis plan prepared in the first 6 months of the trial, agreed with the Trial Management Group, Trial Steering Committee, and Data Management Committee. We assessed between-group equivalence of baseline characteristics and outcomes descriptively and did a descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics by recruitment method.</p><p>We compared observed primary and secondary outcomes between groups 12 months after randomisation using linear regression models adjusted for baseline outcome values and stratification variables. We did modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses, as security of inference depends on both PP and intention-to-treat analyses showing non-inferiority.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> PP analysis provides some protection for any theoretical increase in the risk of type I error (erroneously concluding non-inferiority). Our mITT population comprises all patients according to and included in random allocation with complete data. We defined the PP population as participants meeting the mITT definition and receiving at least eight treatment sessions (representing a minimally sufficient dose of therapy). We analysed safety in the mITT population. We did sensitivity analyses for our primary outcome and for different definitions of PP (eight, 12, 16, and 20 treatment sessions) to check security of inference of non-inferiority.</p><p>We accepted non-inferiority of BA to CBT (in a 0&#x000b7;025 level test) if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI (equivalent to the upper bound of one-sided 97&#x000b7;5% CI) was within the non-inferiority margin of &#x02212;1&#x000b7;9 PHQ-9 points. We checked for non-equivalence of the primary outcome at all follow-up points using the same approach.</p><p>We did secondary analyses to compare groups at follow-up across 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months using hierarchical linear regression. To ease clinical interpretation, we calculated proportions of recovery (participants with PHQ-9 scores of &#x02264;9) and response (50% reduction from baseline PHQ-9 scores). We ran sensitivity analyses to assess the likely effect of missing data using multiple imputation models. We did imputation by treatment group using chained equations to create 20 complete datasets under the assumption that data were missing at random.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Imputation models included covariates as defined for the primary analysis model and auxiliary variables that were predictive of outcomes. After analysis, we combined the effect estimates from the imputed datasets using Rubin's rule.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> For economic analyses, we took the UK NHS and personal social services perspective consistent with the NICE reference case,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> also examining a wide societal perspective, adding productivity losses due to time off work in a sensitivity analysis.

We noted no evidence of a difference in patient characteristics between recruitment methods (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Patient-level and trial-level characteristics at baseline were well balanced between groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). PHQ-9 score at baseline was negatively skewed, with a high proportion of participants scoring towards the upper end of the distribution (data not shown), but scores were similar between groups (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p><p>Ten MHWs provided BA (median 22 participants each [IQR 19&#x02013;25]) and 12 therapists provided CBT (21 [13&#x02013;23]). MHWs had a mean of 18 months mental health experience (SD 11) and CBT therapists had a mean of 22 months post-CBT qualification (24). We removed one CBT therapist from the trial in the early stages who did not meet acceptable competency. Participants received a mean of 11&#x000b7;5 BA sessions (7&#x000b7;8) or 12&#x000b7;5 CBT sessions (7&#x000b7;8). 305 participants (69%) completed the PP number of at least eight sessions (BA 147 [67%] patients, mean 16&#x000b7;1 sessions [SD 5&#x000b7;3]; CBT 158 [72%] patients, mean 16&#x000b7;4 sessions [5&#x000b7;4]); participants completing less than eight sessions (135 [31%]; BA 74 [33%], CBT 61 [28%]) completed a mean of 2&#x000b7;5 BA sessions (SD 1&#x000b7;9) or 2&#x000b7;6 CBT sessions (2&#x000b7;1).

The non-inferiority of BA to CBT was accepted for both the mITT and PP populations as the lower bound of the 95% CI (one-sided 97&#x000b7;5% CI) of the between-group mean difference lies within the non-inferiority margin of &#x02212;1&#x000b7;9 PHQ-9 points (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Although we initially planned to include therapist as a random-effects variable, given the low levels of observed clustering, we parsimoniously fitted our models without therapist as a variable. We checked for no inference difference with and without inclusion of a random-effects therapist term. We ruled out superiority of CBT to BA as the lower bound of the 95% CI included zero for the mITT and PP populations. The inference of non-inferiority was robust to sensitivity analysis across different PP definitions. We found no evidence of a significant between-group treatment interaction across the mITT or PP populations with the primary outcome at 12 months as stratified by depression severity, antidepressants use, and recruitment site (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p><p>We found that BA was not different from CBT in anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7), depression status, and depression-free days and anxiety diagnoses (SCID) for either the mITT or PP populations using observed or imputed data at 12 months (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Because of substantial missing 36-Item Short Form Survey data at baseline, we analysed these data adjusted for stratification variables only. We found no difference in numbers of participants with at least one anxiety diagnosis: BA 43 (28%) of 153; CBT 43 (27%) of 161 (mITT population; &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> 0&#x000b7;08; p=0&#x000b7;78).</p><p>Between 61% and 70% of mITT and PP participants in both groups met criteria for recovery from depression or response to treatment at 12 months, with no differences in the proportions of patients in each group who recovered or responded (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Using observed data for all outcomes, we found no evidence of a difference between the CBT and BA groups over the period of the trial, as indicated by a non-significant time-by-treatment effect interaction, for both the mITT and PP populations (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). We found a small, negligible clustering of primary and secondary outcome scores at follow-up across therapists overall and within BA and CBT groups (intracluster correlation coefficient &#x02264;0&#x000b7;04).</p><p>Two (1%) non-trial-related deaths (one [1%] multidrug toxicity in the BA group and one [1%] cancer in the CBT group) and 15 depression-related, but not treatment-related, serious adverse events (three in the BA group and 12 in the CBT group) occurred in three [2%] participants in the BA group (two [1%] patients who overdosed and one [1%] who self-harmed) and eight (4%) participants in the CBT group (seven [4%] who overdosed and one [1%] who self-harmed). Of the 440 participants recruited, 76 (17%) had missing primary outcome data at 12 month follow-up. The proportion of missing PHQ-9 data was higher in the BA than in the CBT group (46 [21%] <italic>vs</italic> 30 [14%]; odds ratio 1&#x000b7;6 [95% CI 1&#x000b7;0&#x02013;2&#x000b7;7]; p=0&#x000b7;05). Imputation of data for primary and secondary outcomes at 12 months showed that in accordance with the observed data analysis, no difference existed between groups (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), supporting our conclusion of non-inferiority. The odds of missing PHQ-9 data were higher for patients with increased baseline severity of depression (PHQ &#x02265;19, odds ratio 1&#x000b7;6 [95% CI 1&#x000b7;0&#x02013;2&#x000b7;6]; p=0&#x000b7;05) and increasing age (in years) was associated with lower odds of missing PHQ-9 data (odds ratio 0&#x000b7;97 [0&#x000b7;96&#x02013;0&#x000b7;99]; p=0&#x000b7;01). We found no evidence of an association between missingness and any other baseline characteristic (data not shown). Outcome assessors reported having been unmasked for 16 (4%) participants (five [2%] in the BA group and 11 [5%] in the CBT group; due to participants informing assessors of their treatment allocation).</p><p>For economic analyses, at 18 months, full service use data was available for 159 (90%) of 176 participants in the BA group and 168 (93%) of 180 participants in the CBT group. We found a significant difference in mean intervention costs between the two groups, but no differences in other categories of cost or in total cost (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). Mean health state utility scores according to EuroQoL-5D-3L were slightly higher in the BA group than in the CBT group across the entire follow-up period, with resultant QALYs also higher for BA, but the QALY difference was not significant. Costs were lower and QALY outcomes better in the BA group than in the CBT group, generating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of &#x02013;&#x000a3;6865. The scatterplot of bootstrapped cost and effectiveness pairs for BA versus CBT illustrates dominance of BA over CBT, with the point estimate and two-thirds of scatter points falling in the southeast quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane, where BA replications are cheaper and more effective than are CBT ones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>) showing the probability of BA being cost-effective compared with CBT does not fall below 75% and is closer to 80% at NICE-preferred willingness<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> to pay &#x000a3;20&#x02008;000&#x02013;30&#x02008;000 per QALY.</p><p>In all sensitivity analyses, including complementary therapies and productivity losses, as well as analyses taking narrow intervention and mental health service perspectives, BA was significantly less costly than was CBT, so BA continues to have a higher probability of being cost-effective than does CBT at the NICE threshold (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Imputation of missing data increased the difference in total cost (BA &#x000a3;1841&#x000b7;67; CBT &#x000a3;2282&#x000b7;40; difference &#x02013;&#x000a3;440&#x000b7;73 [95% CI &#x02212;1007&#x000b7;71 to 126&#x000b7;26]; p=0&#x000b7;13), but reduced the difference in QALYs (BA 1&#x000b7;22; CBT 1&#x000b7;19; difference 0&#x000b7;03 [&#x02013;0&#x000b7;06 to 0&#x000b7;11]; p=0&#x000b7;55), increasing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to &#x02013;&#x000a3;16&#x02008;951. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve for the missing data analysis again supported the likelihood that BA is cost-effective compared with CBT (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that BA for depression is not inferior to CBT in terms of reduction of depression symptoms and is more cost-effective than is CBT against commonly applied decision maker willingness to pay thresholds. We observed our results using both mITT and PP analyses, using a conservative non-inferiority margin. Our economic analyses were driven by the lower costs of the MHWs who delivered BA compared with the more experienced psychological therapists who routinely deliver CBT. Our study results therefore substantiate the hypothesis that BA is as effective as is CBT and that its simplicity renders BA suitable for delivery by junior MHWs with no professional training in psychological therapies.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>This trial is the largest trial of BA to date and is one of the largest trials of psychological treatments for depression. We followed up participants for 18 months and our economic analysis is one of few in this field. Therapists and MHWs working in three different routine UK care settings delivered treatment, providing evidence of potential generalisability. We assessed therapy quality using independent raters and ensured that treatment in both arms was delivered to the standard recommended guidelines. Our levels of attrition and outcome loss to follow-up were low at 12 months and 18 months, similar to other trials in this area, but are still a limitation. Although participants in the per-protocol population attended similar numbers of sessions to those in other CBT trials,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> 35% of participants chose to not even attend a minimal number of sessions, a problem well known to routine psychological therapy services. This pragmatic trial done in routine environments means that we were unable to quantify or control for the contribution of antidepressant medicines to outcomes. However, most participants who were taking medication had been doing so for a considerable time before entering the trial, making it unlikely that our results were driven by pharmacological treatment. Given the nature of the intervention and comparator, we could not mask patients or the mental health workers or therapists who were delivering the interventions to treatment allocation, but we used self-reported outcome measures and robust outcome assessor-masking procedures to reduce researcher unmasking to less than 5%. Missing data for the primary outcome measure was substantial. However, our between-group inferences were robust to data imputation.</p><p>Our findings could have substantial implications for the scalability of psychological treatment for depression internationally<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> given the greater availability and ease with which a BA workforce could be trained than could a CBT workforce. For many years, CBT has been the foremost psychological therapy recommended by therapists, researchers, and policy makers. Our results challenge this dominance. Although more work needs to be done than has been done so far to find ways to effectively treat the 20&#x02013;23% of patients whose depression was unchanged by BA or CBT, our findings suggest that BA should be a front-line treatment for depression, with substantial potential to improve reach and access to psychological therapy globally.</p><p>Our results in both groups compare favourably with a meta-analysis<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> of the effects of CBT that estimate proportions of patients with remissions of around 50%. Our cost-effectiveness analyses show the high probability that BA is cost-effective and affordable compared with CBT at standard willingness to pay thresholds. Our most striking finding is that BA leads to similar clinical outcomes for patients with depression, but at a financial saving to clinical providers of 21% compared with the costs of provision of CBT, with no compensatory use of other health-care services by patients.</p><p>Driving these savings is the fact that BA can be delivered by inexperienced MHWs with no professional training in psychological therapies, with no lesser effect than that of more highly trained and experienced psychological therapists giving patients CBT. Although many obstacles exist to successful dissemination in addition to training of MHWs, our findings suggest that health services globally could reduce the need for costly professional training and infrastructure, reduce waiting times, and increase access to psychological therapies.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Our findings have substantial implications given the increasing global pressure for cost containment across health systems in high-income countries and the need to develop accessible, scalable interventions in low-income and middle-income countries. Such countries might choose to investigate the training and employment of junior workers over expensive groups of psychological professionals. Our results, therefore, offer hope to many societies, cultures, and communities worldwide, rich and poor, struggling with the effect of depression on the health of their people and economies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ferrari</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Charlson</surname><given-names>FJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Norman</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Burden of depressive disorders by country, sex, age, and year: findings from the global burden of disease study 2010</article-title><source>PLoS Med</source><volume>10</volume><year>2013</year><fpage>e1001547</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24223526</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>DE</given-names></name><name><surname>Cafiero</surname><given-names>ET</given-names></name><name><surname>Jan&#x000e9;-Llopis</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><source>The global economic burden of noncommunicable diseases</source><year>2011</year><publisher-name>World Economic Forum</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amick</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name><name><surname>Gartlehner</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Gaynes</surname><given-names>BN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparative benefits and harms of second generation antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapies in initial treatment of major depressive disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis</article-title><source>BMJ</source><volume>351</volume><year>2015</year><fpage>h6019</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26645251</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref40"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kohn</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Levav</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>de Almeida</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The treatment gap in mental health care</article-title><source>Bull World Health Organ</source><volume>82</volume><year>2004</year><fpage>858</fpage><lpage>866</lpage><comment>(in Spanish).</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15640922</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref50"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jacobson</surname><given-names>NS</given-names></name><name><surname>Martell</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name><name><surname>Dimidjian</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Behavioral activation treatment for depression: returning to contextual roots</article-title><source>Clin Psychol Sci Pract</source><volume>8</volume><year>2001</year><fpage>255</fpage><lpage>270</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref60"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ekers</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Webster</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Straten</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Cuijpers</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Richards</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Gilbody</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Behavioural activation for depression;
