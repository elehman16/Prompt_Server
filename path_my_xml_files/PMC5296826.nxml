There are various modalities for evaluation of tubal patency such as hysterosalpingography (HSG), sonosalpingography, hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography, and laparoscopy with chromopertubation. Of all the available procedures to test tubal patency, HSG remains the first choice due to its reliability and cost-effectiveness. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend HSG to screen for tubal occlusion in the absence of comorbidities.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] HSG is performed between 7<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> days of a menstrual cycle in outdoor settings without anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] While it is an integral part of the infertility workup, it is considered to be very painful by about 70%&#x02013;80% of women undergoing it.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The pain is due to several factors including cervical instrumentation, uterine distension, and peritoneal irritation from contrast spill into the peritoneal cavity. Furthermore, grasping the cervix with a tenaculum, as well as distending the uterus, may release local prostaglandins which can initiate uterine cramps resulting in delayed pain after HSG. Pain from the cervix and lower portion of the uterus is carried out by the pelvic splanchnic nerves, whereas pain sensation from the fundus and body of the uterus is conducted through the hypogastric nerves to the lower thoracic segments.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This pain peaks at the time of instillation of contrast media until 5 min after the procedure and then starts to decrease rapidly between 5 and 10 min after the procedure so that at 30 min, most women classify it as a discomfort.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The pain experienced during and after HSG can have a negative impact on the woman's ability to cooperate with the procedure, thus limiting the usefulness of this investigation, as well as negatively influencing the woman's willingness to undertake similar diagnostic studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Different techniques have been used in attempts to make the procedure less painful including the use of balloon catheters rather than metal cannulas.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Furthermore, there are so many studies comparing different analgesics for pain relief during HSG, but so far there appears to be no consensus in terms of type, route, and timing of analgesia to be administered. Therefore, establishing the most effective analgesia to offer during this procedure is important to minimize these factors.</p><p>A paracervical block is routinely used to decrease pain (though of questionable benefit) with therapeutic abortions, endometrial biopsy, intrauterine device insertion, office hysteroscopy, and oocyte retrieval in <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Paracervical anesthetics block transmission of pain through sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sensory fibers before they enter the uterus at the level of the internal os. Thus, we hypothesized that a paracervical block would also decrease pain during a HSG.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>To assess the effectiveness of paracervical block with 2% lignocaine for pain relief in women undergoing HSG for evaluation of infertility.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a prospective randomized controlled study conducted at the tertiary care infertility clinic from February 2011 to August 2011. One hundred and six women undergoing HSG as a part of infertility evaluation were enrolled in the study. Patients were assigned to two groups by computer-generated randomization. After proper counseling, written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The allocating team and the team performing HSG were different, so there was no risk of selection bias.

All women were instructed to take oral antispasmodic tablet hyoscine butylbromide 10 mg, 30 min before the procedure. Women were laid in dorsal position. Five percent of povidone-iodine solution was used for antisepsis. Sims speculum was inserted. The paracervical block with 2% lignocaine was injected at 4 o&#x02019;clock and 8 o&#x02019;clock position [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Five minutes were allowed to elapse before proceeding to HSG. The cervix was then grasped at anterior aspect with single-toothed tenaculum, and a Leech-Wilkinson cannula was advanced into the external cervical os. The cannula and tenaculum were secured together, and the speculum was removed. Twenty milliliters nonionic water-soluble radiopaque contrast solution (Omnipaque, GE Healthcare, USA) was instilled through the cannula while the traction on the tenaculum was maintained. The placement of cannula, alignment of uterocervical canal, and the flow of dye through uterus and fallopian tubes were assured on image intensifier fluoroscopy screen. Four X ray films were taken at predefined stages. The cannula and tenaculum were then removed. The study group received a total of 213.5 mg (10 ml) of 2% lignocaine as paracervical block. The second group did not receive anything except oral tablet hyoscine 10 mg and served as control. The patients were kept under observation for 30 min after the procedure and then discharged on oral antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for following 3 days. If at any point, the patient was unable to continue with HSG or any difficulty in performing it, the procedure was abandoned. To account for any operator-related discrepancy, the same team carried out the procedure in all the women.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Paracervical block</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JHRS-9-230-g001"/></fig><p>Immediately after HSG (between 0 and 5 min), each patient was asked by a technician to score her pain in writing using numerical rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 10 where 0 was no pain and 10 was unbearable pain.

In our study, paracervical block did not decrease pain perception during the most painful component of the HSG, which is the instillation of contrast into the uterus. Although a subgroup of patients having intracavitary filling defects had significant relief of pain with paracervical block, definite recommendation cannot be made on this sole observation as the number of patients in the subgroup was low.</p><p>Studies evaluating pain are greatly biased by the large number of variables influencing pain. These include local and systemic sensitizing and desensitizing factors, differences in individual physical susceptibility, and the subjective nature of pain. Comparison of potential pelvic and systemic sensitizing factors (history of dysmenorrhea, past gynecological operative procedures, tubal ligation, labors, and abortions or previous experience of HSG) revealed that both the groups had similar characteristics [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>In the literature, most studies observed pain to vary at different steps of the HSG procedure. According to Liberty <italic>et al</italic>., insertion of cervical instruments was the most painful step during the HSG procedure,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] whereas Robinson <italic>et al</italic>., Hacivelioglu <italic>et al</italic>., Unlu <italic>et al</italic>., and our study reported instillation of contrast media as the most painful step.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The knowledge of the most painful phase during the HSG is very important for psychological preparation of the patient as stress and anxiety can play a negative role during the procedure. We have considered this point in our study as we did preprocedure counseling of all women by a skilled operator before going through HSG.</p><p>All of the studies using paracervical block for pain relief during HSG have used a specific premedication 30 min to 1 h before the procedure. This could be a potential bias in relation to the outcome as we know administration of systemic analgesics can be a confounding factor. Robinson <italic>et al</italic>., Hacivelioglu <italic>et al</italic>., and Unlu <italic>et al</italic>. used NSAID,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Chauhan <italic>et al</italic>. gave intramuscular atropine and promethazine hydrochloride[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] whereas de Mello <italic>et al</italic>. used oral hyoscine butylbromide with an analgesic dipyrone.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] We have not used any analgesic to eliminate this bias; instead, we gave an oral antispasmodic hyoscine butylbromide to all participants 30 min before going through HSG.</p><p>The studies were not consistent in the time points; they measured pain scores during the procedure. In most of the studies, pain score was taken from the beginning parts of the procedure, which involve the period of cervical manipulation mostly. Therefore, it would follow that topical application of the anesthesia to the cervix would have more of an effect than topical application of the anesthesia to the uterus, which is less involved in mediating pain during the early steps of the procedure. Therefore, the variation seen may in part be due to variations in the application site of the anesthesia and does highlight one of the potential biases. Certain analgesics may have shown benefit at specific time points. de Mello <italic>et al</italic>. and Robinson <italic>et al</italic>. both found a significant reduction in the pain associated with cervical grasping by prior paracervical block, but no benefit during instillation of contrast through uterus and fallopian tubes.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Similarly, Unlu <italic>et al</italic>. found a beneficial effect for topical anesthetic only during dye instillation, despite the fact that earlier pain scores during the procedure did not show any benefit.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In our study, we measured a single pain score immediately after the completion of HSG which eliminates any variation in the pain perception of the patient due to a particular step, be it injecting paracervical block, cervical manipulation, or instillation of contrast.</p><p>In previous studies, there is a significant variation in relation to concentration, dose, and number of points where lignocaine was injected as paracervical block. In the present study, a total of 10 ml (213 mg) 2% lignocaine was injected at two points only as paracervical block. The rationale behind was adequate analgesia with minimum discomfort to the patient during injection of paracervical block itself.</p><p>Out of total five studies done with paracervical block, three shows a significant difference in pain score with paracervical block, but when we look at a number of participants, two of them are underpowered [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Only study with an adequate number of participants was by Chauhan <italic>et al</italic>. which seem to be biased by the effect of systemic analgesics used before the procedure.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] According to Hacivelioglu <italic>et al</italic>., adding a paracervical block to systemic or intracavitary analgesics had no significant beneficial effect on pain relief.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Our results suggest HSG is a moderately painful procedure which is well tolerated by most of the women (average pain score 5). Recent Cochrane Review on pain relief in HSG by Hindocha <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that locally injected anesthetic was not associated with any benefit, both during the procedure and within the first 30 min following the procedure though the quality of the evidence was low.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Review of literature</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JHRS-9-230-g007"/></table-wrap><p>A drawback of paracervical block is that the administration of a lignocaine block does require knowledge of cervical anatomy and proper injection technique. It takes approximately 5&#x02013;10 min extra to inject and to allow the block to be effective, and this would increase the time required to perform the procedure. Finally, the addition of paracervical block would slightly increase the cost of the HSG because of the use of an additional syringe, spinal needle, and local anesthetic. The adverse effects due to paracervical block can be nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, respiratory depression, hypotension, allergic reaction, and infection, despite the fact that none of the participants in our study experienced any of them. In Robinson <italic>et al</italic>.'s study, none of the 38 participants who received intracervical lignocaine experienced any adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, Chauhan <italic>et al</italic>. reported that one participant experienced light-headedness, two experienced head numbness, and two experienced tinnitus with intracervical block.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In Hacivelioglu <italic>et al</italic>.'s study, two participants experienced vomiting with paracervical block.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>A recent Cochrane Review by Tangsiriwatthana <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that available evidence fails to show whether paracervical block is inferior, equivalent, or superior to alternative analgesic techniques in terms of efficacy and safety for women undergoing cervical dilatation and uterine interventions.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In this study, NRS is used as a validated pain scale to score the pain perception of patients during HSG as it was easily understood by most of the patients as they had to give a score at the time of experience of pain. Using complicated pain scores might have given inaccurate or biased results. Significant heterogeneity is recorded by various authors in this respect as visual analog scale from 0 to 10 mm, 0&#x02013;10 cm, or 0&#x02013;20 cm and verbal descriptive score has been considered in previous trials.</p><p>The only limitation of our study was that the participants were not blinded to the intervention used for each group recruited into the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>HSG is simple, reliable, and cost-effective procedure for evaluation of tubal patency in infertile women, but its only drawback is its painful nature. The results of our study and the latest Cochrane Review do not support the routine use of paracervical block for pain relief in women undergoing HSG. The most painful component of the HSG is the instillation of contrast into the uterus. A method that will significantly decrease pain for this part of the procedure is still needed. Women are unacceptable to pain during interventions when performed awake in the absence of neuraxial blockade, which is unaltered by paracervical block. Hence, there is a need to consider psychological factors also. Allaying anxiety before undergoing HSG can be of great help as we found in our study. Skilled personnel and gentle technique remain the most important factors in reducing pain during HSG.</p><p>Further high quality, well-powered trials are required to investigate the efficacy and timing of analgesia during HSG. Research is also needed in evaluating the effectiveness of combination of analgesia of different classes on HSG-related pain.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors are thankful to Dr. Mohinder Kochar, Dr. Shweta Mittal, Dr. Neeti Tiwari, and Dr. Ruma Satwik, for providing subjects and inputs for the study.
