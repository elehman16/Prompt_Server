However, there is considerable variability in individual response to these drugs in combination or as single agents. Oncologists have wanted to develop an assay that can predict response to chemotherapy drugs and combinations to allow individualized cancer therapy.</p><p>The issue of predictive testing for choosing chemotherapy for cancer patients is of very high interest. The MiCK assay for drug-induced apoptosis is a non-genomic test that is in national trials in a number of different tumors.</p><p>Assays for chemotherapy resistance have been developed in the past, but their application in ovarian cancer has been of limited usefulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. NCCN acknowledges that some institutions do use these tests in patients, but their general use is not guideline-approved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>A drug-induced apoptosis assay, the microculture-kinetic test (MiCK), has been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and tested with success in acute myelocytic leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The basis of this assay is the ability of a drug to rapidly induce apoptosis in cancer cells in short-term culture (48&#x02009;hours) without a necessity for tumor cell growth. In addition to testing in AML, it has been undergoing testing in solid tumors including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], endometrial cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], lung cancer, miscellaneous solid tumors and hematologic malignancies (the results of a non-blinded trial are in press, Cancer, 2012). These results indicate that the MiCK assay is more predictive of response and survival than almost all currently available genomic tests (probably because there are so many mutations, and epigenetic changes in every cancer, most usually different between cancers of similar histologic type, and often differing between metastases in the same patient).</p><p>We report here the results of a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, and physician-blinded study of the MiCK assay in patients with ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer of any stage, primary or recurrent, were eligible. Sterile tumor specimens (minimum 250&#x02009;mg but optimally with &#x0003e;1.0&#x02009;cm<sup>3</sup> of viable tumor tissue) were placed into sterile DiaTech transport media, and sent via FedEx to the DiaTech Oncology laboratory, Montreal, Canada.</p><sec><title>Tumor cell purification</title><p>Within 24 to 48&#x02009;hours of collection, the specimen was minced, digested with 0.25% trypsin and 0.08% DNase for 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;hours at 37 degrees Celsius, and then filtered through a 100 micrometer cell strainer. Tumor cells were purified by a proprietary method which included density gradient centrifugation, and incubation with a series of antibody-coated beads to allow only viable tumor cells to remain. The pathologist confirmed that the remaining cells in the assay were at least 90% viable ovarian cancer cells. The final cell suspension was plated into a 96-well half-area plate, 120 microliter aliquot per well. The plate was incubated overnight at 37 degrees Celsius with 5% carbon dioxide humidified atmosphere. 5x10<sup>4</sup> to 1.5x10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded per well depending on the cell volume to give adequate well-bottom coverage.</p><p>Human JURL-MK2 chronic leukemia in blast crisis cell line (DSMZ, Germany) was used as a positive control for MiCK assays performed with patient tumor cells. RPMI-1640 medium without phenol red was used for all cultures. It was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 micrograms/mL of streptomycin. Cell counts and viability were evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion.</p><p>Each tumor cell preparation was reviewed by a pathologist using a hematoxylin/eosin stained cytospin preparation to confirm the presence of malignant cells consistent with an ovarian carcinoma primary. If there was an adequate number of cells available, immunocytochemical stains including CK, CA125, calretinin and Ki-67 were performed to add supportive evidence of an ovarian origin as well as mitotic activity. The cell suspensions were purified repetitively until at least 90% purity was obtained. Suspensions with under 90% purity were not tested in the MiCK assay.</p></sec><sec><title>MiCK assay for apoptosis</title><p>The MiCK assay procedure was adapted from the method described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. After overnight incubation, chemotherapy drugs were added in the wells of the 96-well plate in 5 microliter aliquots at various concentrations. Single and combination regimens were tested, as seen in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

Following drug addition, the plate was incubated for 30&#x02009;min at 37 degrees Celsius into a 5% carbon dioxide humidified atmosphere incubator. Each well was then overlayed with mineral oil, and the plate was placed into the incubator chamber of a microplate spectrophotometric reader (BioTek instruments). The optical density at 600 nanometers was read and recorded every 5&#x02009;minutes over a period of 48&#x02009;hours. Optical density increases, which correlate with apoptosis, were converted to kinetic units (KU) of apoptosis by a proprietary software ProApo with a formula described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and were correlated with patient outcomes.

It was non-randomized, and thus was an observational study. MiCK assay results were obtained before any therapy was initiated. MiCK assay results were never transmitted to physicians. Physicians treated patients with the physicians&#x02019; own choice of drugs as they deemed clinically indicated. Tumor responses were measured by RECIST criteria every 3&#x02009;months. Patients were evaluated for response, time to recurrence after assay and disease-specific survival after assay. The clinical evaluations of response, time to recurrence and survival were then compared to the in vitro MiCK assay drug-induced apoptosis that had been determined before chemotherapy was initiated.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical evaluation</title><p>The primary goal of the study was to compare MiCK assay results with overall survival in all patients studied. We also evaluated the subset of patients with chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve stage III and IV ovarian cancer receiving primary therapy for overall survival, response rate, and recurrence-free survival. Data were imported into SAS/JMP (JMP Version 7 for Windows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]) for analysis. If a sample had multiple doses of the same drug, then the dose with the highest value was assigned to the drug. SAS/JMP was used to calculate summary statistics and perform statistical analysis (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Comparisons between drugs were made by subtracting one drug&#x02019;s KU value from another drug&#x02019;s KU value on a matched sample basis. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] was then used to test for a statistical difference. All tests were two-tailed. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In order to account for multiplicity, MULTTEST (SAS 9.2) was used to compute adjusted p-values by the Hochberg, Holm and false discovery rate methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Statistically significant results remained significant at the 0.05 level.

The overall survival of all 98 evaluable patients treated with chemotherapy was compared to the results of the MiCK apoptosis assay. In this comparison, the 60 patients who were treated with the best chemotherapy in the MiCK assay had a superior overall survival compared to the 38 patients who received a non-best chemotherapy (p = 0.003 by log rank analysis). Median survival was over 45&#x02009;months for patients who received the best chemotherapy compared to 25&#x02009;months for patients who received a non-best chemotherapy. The primary goal of the study was met. In addition, of the patients treated with the best chemotherapy, 53.3% recurred, compared to 76.3% recurrence in patients who received a non-best chemotherapy (p = 0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of patients with chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve stages III or IV primary therapy</title><sec><title>Overall survival</title><p>This section presents the results in the more homogeneous subset of patients, those with chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve stages III or IV most of whom had received tumor debulking (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). No patient had received neoadjuvant therapy. The overall survival of all stages III or IV patients with primary disease was 51.2% +/&#x02212; 10.7% at 42&#x02009;months (this is comparable to the results of GOG protocol 182 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], GOG protocol 218 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and AGO-OVAR 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]).</p><p>In the chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve stage III or IV ovarian cancer patients (73 with fully evaluable survival data), patients treated with the best chemotherapy in the MiCK assay had a superior survival compared to patients treated with a non-best chemotherapy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). The hazard ratio for death in patients receiving the best chemotherapy was 0.23 (95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.67). Median survival was over 45&#x02009;months for patients who received the best chemotherapy compared to 25&#x02009;months for patients who received a non-best chemotherapy.</p><p>In order to exclude the possibility that there was an accidental selection of more favorable patients into pre the best chemotherapy group, a multivariate analysis was performed in the stage III and IV patients with primary therapy who had complete data to determine if the MiCK assay results were predictive of survival compared to other prognostic variables in prior analyses (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model showed that use of the best chemotherapy in the MiCK assay was the strongest predictor of overall survival. The estimated hazard risk ratio (relative risk) for death if a patient received the best chemotherapy was 0.21 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.65, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Although prior studies have indicated that optimal debulking and having less residual disease were favorable prognostic factors, those factors were less prognostic when the MiCK assay results were considered in the same analysis.</p><p>In order to confirm that the MiCK assay was predictive in patients with the most optimal prognostic characteristics, we analyzed patients with stage III and IV disease, no prior chemotherapy, optimally debulked with no residual disease. Of those patients, 24 were treated with the best therapy as analyzed in the MiCK assay, and 14 were treated with drugs that were not the best in the assay. Median survival I those treated with the best drugs was over 42&#x02009;months, compared to median survival of only 25&#x02009;months in those who received chemotherapy that was not the best (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Recurrence-free interval</title><p>In the 72 patients with fully evaluable recurrence data who had chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve stage III or IV primary disease, the recurrence-free interval of patients treated with the best chemotherapy was longer compared to patients treated with a non-best chemotherapy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, p = 0.03). The hazard ratio for recurrence in patients receiving the best chemotherapy was 0.52 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.96).

In 28 of 51 (56%), C&#x02009;+&#x02009;P was the best chemotherapy based on the assay. It was not the best chemotherapy in 44%, and the most usual better choice by the MiCK assay was gemcitabine plus cisplatin in 10 (43%). When physicians used C&#x02009;+&#x02009;P, time to recurrence was significantly longer if it was the best therapy compared to patients in whom it was a non-best therapy (p = 0.03); and overall survival was marginally longer if C&#x02009;+&#x02009;P was the best therapy versus if C&#x02009;+&#x02009;P was a non-best therapy (p = 0.1) with 88% survival at 30&#x02009;months if C&#x02009;+&#x02009;P was the best therapy, versus 20% if it was a non-best therapy (based on Kaplan-Meier curves).</p></sec><sec><title>Is the MiCK assay just a prognostic variable?</title><p>In order to test if the maximum degree of apoptosis was prognostic of overall survival without considering whether the patient received the best or a non-best chemotherapy, a Cox proportional hazards model was performed. In all patients receiving chemotherapy, apoptosis was not correlated to survival (p = 0.40). In patients with stage III or IV primary disease, apoptosis was not correlated to survival (p = 0.24). Survival was only correlated with apoptosis if the physician used the best chemotherapy regimen from the MiCK assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This prospective, multi-institutional blinded study demonstrated a significant correlation between using the best chemotherapy regimen as assessed in the MiCK assay and overall survival both in all ovarian cancer patients studied, and in the more homogeneous subset of patients with chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve stage III or IV primary disease. Using the best chemotherapy regimen based on the MiCK assay also correlated with relapse-free interval. If the physicians used a chemotherapy regimen with higher activity in the MiCK assay, response to therapy was higher. This suggests in this non-randomized observational trial that the MiCK assay can help guide selection of more active chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients. Based on this hypothesis generating study, subsequent randomized validation trials will help further elucidate the benefits of using the MiCK assay to select appropriate therapy for these patients. This study justifies such a randomized trial, and quantifies the benefits in outcomes on which a randomized study can be developed (for power determinations and study size requirements). Such a randomized prospective trial should compare standard postoperative therapy of patients with stages III and IV epithelial ovarian cancer, versus therapy directed by the best results in the MiCK assay. Appropriate stratifications would include extent of debulking, amount of residual disease, stage, age, and preoperative CA125. Numbers of patients needed to treat would be determined by participating statisticians based on primary and secondary goals.</p><p>A review by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO, 1) has found prior chemosensitivity and chemoresistance assays to be insufficiently robust in predicting outcomes, and has not recommended their routine use. This MiCK assay was not reviewed in any of those analyses. However, the reviewers stated in their conclusions that &#x0201c;because the in vitro analytic strategy has potential importance, participation in clinical trials evaluating these technologies remains a priority.&#x0201d; This study represents such a trial that can contribute to subsequent reviews by that ASCO committee and other organizations. This study also represents evidence on which future validation and utility trials can be based.</p><p>In contrast to prior chemotherapy resistance assays, the MiCK assay is different. The MiCK assay measures direct in vitro cell killing (rather than measuring only survival of cells), studies only cancer cells (compared to mixed host and cancer cells), requires no in vitro growth of tumor cells (compared to assays requiring growth of cells, which measures only a subset of cancer cells capable of growth in vitro), gives results based on multipoint analyses (every 5&#x02009;minutes for 48&#x02009;hours) rather than just a single endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and has results available within 72&#x02009;hours of biopsy (rather than 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;weeks).</p><p>The ability to identify drugs which are active in the clinical therapy of ovarian cancer suggests that this assay may also be able to play a role in drug development. The assay might be used to study new drugs pre-clinically (2 such trials have been completed, unpublished data), to evaluate if drugs known to be active in other cancers may also have activity in ovarian cancer, and to identify which patients are most likely to respond in clinical trials. This would allow phase II and phase III trials to be focused on patients with the highest chance of improvement, reducing time needed to conduct a clinical trial and increasing the probability of finding effective new drugs. The MiCK assay may also be able to give pharmaceutical companies indications of which approved drugs may be more effectively combined with investigational agents, thus prioritizing clinical trials for more rapid approval by regulatory agencies.</p><p>The assay also showed that in some patients (approximately 1/3 to 1/2), single agents were as effective in killing ovarian cancer tumor cells in vitro as standard combination therapies. If confirmed clinically, the MiCK assay may be useful to physicians in individualizing therapy, especially in patients at increased risk of toxicity from combination drug treatments or patients fearful of side effects of combination therapy. Single agent chemotherapy has been found equivalent to combination chemotherapy in some trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] but not others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Since the MiCK assay indicates which drugs are associated with improved survival, it is possible that use of the assay may reduce healthcare costs by avoiding inactive therapies. Results of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] have been used to model potential cost savings in care of cancer patients in a large self-insured employer database. This study indicated possible cost savings of 25 to 85% of chemotherapy-associated expenses.</p><p>Since this study initially had a high rate of unsuccessful assays, education of participating sites about submission and processing procedures have been improved which resulted in consistently higher success rates over 75%. Although the learning curve is very fast, the company which provides the test has improved its support of centers using the assay so that inevaluable specimens are less frequent.</p><p>In summary, use of the best chemotherapy regimen as assessed in the drug-induced apoptosis MiCK assay correlated with overall survival in all ovarian cancer patients, and in patients with chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve stage III or IV primary therapy patients with a hazard ratio for death of 0.23. The assay is predictive of survival if physicians use the best treatment based on the assay. Relapse-free interval and response rate were also predicted by the MiCK assay. Further studies of this predictive theranostic bioassay are warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Misc</title><p>Supported by DiaTech Oncology, Nashville, TN.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ES participated in design, conducted final reviews and drafted manuscript; MP participated in design and conception of study; HH, MB, AG submitted patients and participated in coordination and review of study results; CP participated in the design and review and manuscript preparation; JR,MC, performed statistical analysis; AH, MP supervised lab results and provided patient outcome data.
