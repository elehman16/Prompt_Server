Participants will receive weekly supportive telephone calls over a 3-month period from a volunteer-peer. Feasibility will be assessed in terms of recruitment, acceptability of the intervention to participants and level of retention in the programme. Changes in level of loneliness (UCLA-3 item Loneliness Scale), mood (Geriatric Depression Scale-5 item) and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS) will also be measured postintervention (3&#x02005;months).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Research ethics and governance committee approval has been granted for this study by each participating centre (reference: 432/15 and 12-09-11-15).

The intervention is innovative as it is delivered by hospital-based volunteers over the telephone.</p><p>Peer support is the &#x02018;<italic>provision of knowledge, experience, emotional or practical help by someone sharing common characteristics</italic>&#x02019;.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The social support model postulates that social relationships promote health and well-being; thus, peer support is hypothesised to reduce feelings of social isolation and loneliness, thereby improving well-being.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Peer support is usually provided by a person sharing common characteristics, for example, age, gender, ethnicity or experience of illness. Equivalent &#x02018;status&#x02019; between peer and patient is a feature of peer support that facilitates a high level of empathy delivered in a non-confrontational manner.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>The telephone is increasingly used to deliver healthcare advice and support for patients. Most older people have telephone access and are likely to accept telephone-mediated peer support. Telephone-based peer support can be a satisfactory substitute for face-to-face interaction, and many people prefer the relative anonymity and increased privacy of talking over the phone.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Evaluation of the UK <italic>Call in Time</italic> telephone befriending service for older people indicated a major impact on their quality of life.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Participants reported they felt a sense of belonging, valued knowing &#x02018;there's a friend out there&#x02019; and that the service had a positive impact on their health and well-being, with increased self-confidence and alleviation of previous loneliness and anxiety.</p><p>Dale <italic>et al</italic>'s<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> updated Cochrane Review investigated the effects of peer support telephone calls for improving physical, psychological, behavioural and other health outcomes in 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 8040 participants. Positive results were found in eight studies, with peer support effective in reducing depressive symptoms in new mothers, supporting breast feeding, promoting mammography screening, improving diabetes outcomes and colonoscopy screening. Peer support programmes have also been shown to reduce healthcare service use by older people, including admissions to hospital, nursing care facility admissions and community doctor visits.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>Peers may be volunteers who are trained to support and listen, but not to give medical advice or judgement. Their non-medical status helps to overcome any reluctance that patients may have in discussing feelings of loneliness or isolation.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Hospital volunteers are trained to help support patients and families during an acute hospital admission or ED visit, which is a form of &#x02018;peer&#x02019; support.

Study recruitment nurses will liaise with ED allied health and nurse team leaders at the beginning of each shift to identify potential participants based on the inclusion criteria. Participants will not be approached until after their clinical needs have been addressed, as these must be respected first and foremost, over and above their participation in this study. Potential participants will be screened by the recruitment staff for social isolation, loneliness and depressed mood, as well as for cognitive impairment; and eligible patients will be invited to participate.

Patients will receive one telephone-support call every week over a 3-month period (up to 12 calls). The aim of the telephone calls is to provide emotional and social support. The first call will occur within 72&#x02005;hours of discharge from ED, SSU or AMW.</p><p>The phone calls will focus on encouraging and supporting the patient and providing social stimulation and informal guidance about strategies that patients feel would improve their well-being, such as better self-care and/or social engagement with family, friends or community groups. Each call will be unstructured and patient-directed; however, the volunteer will ask the patient to describe any changes since the previous call, the outcomes of any planned actions and agree on new social goals. This model has been used by social service providers for older people in the community with positive outcomes,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> but is yet to be trialled in a cohort following hospital discharge.</p><p>The telephone calls will be conducted from the respective hospitals in an area allocated by the Volunteer Services Manager. <italic>HOW R U?</italic> volunteers will be provided with a summary of their participants' baseline data collection forms prior to conducting the first phone call.</p><p>In order to understand the impact of the various components of the intervention, telephone activity logs will be maintained by the volunteer for each participant. These logs will record the dates, times and length of each call, and the number of attempts required to make contact with the participant on each occasion. The content of the calls made will be described using a simple template. Participant drop-outs and their reasons for doing so will also be recorded on the activity log.</p><p><italic>Volunteer Training</italic><bold><italic>:</italic></bold>
<italic>HOW R U?</italic> volunteer peers will be recruited from the hospital Volunteer Service. All volunteers will have participated in their respective hospital-based volunteer training programme, which include workshops on confidentiality and privacy; rights and responsibilities in healthcare; professional and personal boundaries as a volunteer; emotions and responses; stress and self-care and communication and listening techniques. <italic>HOW R U?</italic> volunteers will be actively involved in the regular provision of inhospital social and emotional support to acutely unwell patients and families.</p><p>At study initiation, the <italic>HOW R U?</italic> volunteers will attend a compulsory 4-hour project orientation session, including an overview of peer support; general information about mental health and ageing; expectations of their role; empathic listening techniques; policies and procedures; confidentiality and boundaries; risk management strategies and formal and informal community resources available to patients.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Safety considerations</title><p>It is not anticipated that <italic>HOW R U?</italic> will cause any specific harm or discomfort. If participants wish to terminate an individual telephone call or cease their involvement in the study, they may do so at any time, without any interference to any care provided by their treating hospital.</p><p>If a volunteer is concerned about the physical or mental health of a participant, the volunteer will liaise directly with the relevant Emergency Physician Coinvestigator. The concern will then be triaged and the participant's GP may be contacted, as required.</p><p>Volunteers will have access to their respective Volunteer Services Manager and the Chief Investigator for advice and support throughout the study. A monthly meeting of volunteers with the Chief Investigator and the Volunteer Services Managers will enable debriefing of any issues or concerns that arise.</p><p><italic>Care transition at study end</italic><bold><italic>:</italic></bold> Three main pathways have been developed for preparing participants for care transition from the project. Discussions will start at week 8 of the 12-week intervention, or earlier as needed. Participants will either: continue the telephone support calls if a mutual agreement is reached between the patient and the volunteer; be referred and transferred to an alternative community support programme for support or cease telephone support calls. If any issues arise for participants or volunteers as a result of planning the transition pathway, they will be referred to the Chief Investigator or their respective Volunteer Services Manager.

Secondary benefits include the positive effects that the act of meaningful volunteering has on the peer supporter; with a positive correlation between volunteering and perceived health, and a negative correlation to depression in older volunteers.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Volunteers represent a significant adjunct resource for meeting some of the health and social care service needs of our more vulnerable older population; as well as being inexpensive, which is an important consideration, given the financial constraints of health systems across the world.</p><p>The quantitative and qualitative findings of this feasibility study will be used to inform further development of <italic>the HOW R U?</italic> intervention and its mode of delivery, as well the design and development of a future RCT and programme evaluation, which will test the effectiveness of <italic>HOW R U?</italic> compared with usual care in improving quality of life, through improvement of symptoms of depression, social isolation and loneliness; and in reducing reattendances and hospitalisations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JAL conceived and developed the study protocol.
