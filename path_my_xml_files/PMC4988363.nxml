Pressure sores result from both extrinsic (e.g., pressure and friction) and intrinsic (e.g., contractures and malnutrition) etiologies [<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Continuous or chronic pressure on the skin and muscle cause circulation disorder, leading to the destruction and necrosis of tissue. The incidence and prevalence rates of pressure sores are rapidly increasing because of the growth of the elderly population and increasing prevalence of chronic diseases. It has been reported that the prevalence rates vary from 8.8% to 53.2% [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and the incidence rates range from 7% to 71.6% [<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The occurrence of pressure sores considerably increases hospitalization time and medical expenditure. The prevention and care of pressure sores have always been a challenge to the nursing profession because the responsibility for prevention and care usually falls to the nurses [<xref rid="b9-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, early intervention and appropriate treatment is critical to prevent the development of pressure sores.</p><p>Currently, the treatment of pressure sores involves a wide range of traditional interventions, including surgical treatment (e.g., debridement and myocutaneous flaps) and nonsurgical treatment (e.g., elemental pastes, antimicrobials, dressing, and solutions). In addition to traditional interventions, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used extensively in treating pressure sores [<xref rid="b10-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ligustrazine, a major active alkaloid extracted from the plant <italic>Ligusticum chuanxiong</italic> Hort, is a frequent Chinese medicinal herb that has been widely used for many years to treat diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, cancers, and ischemic stroke [<xref rid="b11-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition to the clinical administration, it is now widely used in food preparation as a health-promoting ingredient. Ligustrazine displays numerous bioactivities such as antioxidant, neuron-protection, antifibrosis, anti-nociception, vasorelaxation, anti-inflammation, and anti-proliferation [<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although various bioactivities have been substantiated in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, the molecular mechanisms of action are still unclear, which creates a major obstacle to further clinical application. Little information is available concerning the effect of ligustrazine on pressure sores and the possible underlying mechanism.</p><p>Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to explore the effect of ligustrazine on pressure sores and tried to clarify the underlying mechanism. We compared the therapeutic effect of compound clotrimazole cream <italic>vs.</italic> ligustrazine with holistic nursing. Additionally, we explored the mechanism <italic>in vitro</italic> by using HaCaT cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Research subjects</title><p>A total of 32 patients with Phase II and Phase III pressure sores, who were admitted at our hospital from February 2014 to March 2015, were enrolled in this study. Among the 32 patients, 19 were male and 13 were female, with an age range of 65&#x02013;83 years. The stage of pressure sores was categorized according to the standard pressure ulcer classification revised by the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) [<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There were a total of 45 sites of ulcers, including 33 sites of Phase II and 12 sites of Phase III. The locations of pressure sores were: ischial tuberosity (21 sites), sacrum (12 sites), trochanter (5 sites), heel (4 sites), and malleolus (3 sites).</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group or the control group. In the experimental group there were 9 males and 7 females, with an average age of 63.33&#x000b1;2.78 years, and the average duration of pressure sores was 1.36&#x000b1;0.68 months. In the control group there were 8 males and 8 females with an average age of 64.21&#x000b1;3.02 years, and the average duration of pressure sores was 1.22&#x000b1;0.37 months. There were no significant differences in sex, age, or average duration of pressure sores between the patients in the 2 groups and the results were comparable.

If there was incontinence, measures were taken and the bedding was replaced in a timely fashion. Patients who had difficulty in turning over or who could not turn over used an air cushion bed or a bedsore mat. A high-protein diet was given to patients to strengthen nutrition. Nutritional support was administered when necessary. Health education was provided to the families. In addition to the basic nursing, patients in the control group received compound clotrimazole cream with an outer layer of wet dressing held in place by a medical-quality rubberized fabric. Dressing change was carried out 1&#x02013;2 times a day, depending on local exudation. Patients in the experimental group were given ligustrazine prepared according to a previously described method [<xref rid="b17-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. After disinfection with iodine and rinsing with normal saline (NS), the wound was dried by a high-velocity flow of oxygen for 5 min, and then covered with a transdermal ligustrazine patch.

Human HaCaT cells were cultured with various concentrations of ligustrazine (0.5 mmol/L, 1.0 mmol/L, and 1.5 mmol/L), and the cell growth was then evaluated by MTT and colony formation assay after 72 h of culture. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-22-2871">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>, the cell viability and clone formation numbers were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner by culture with ligustrazine (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 or <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), indicating that ligustrazine promotes cell growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of ligustrazine on the PI3K/AKT pathway</title><p>We also investigated the associated pathway involved in the effect of ligustrazine on cell growth.

The underlying mechanism was also explored <italic>in vitro</italic> by using HaCaT cells.

The <italic>in vitro</italic> study suggested that the protective role of ligustrazine in pressure sores might be associated with activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.</p><p>Pressure sores, also known as pressure ulcers or bedsores, are a source of pain, major discomfort and disruption, and infection, limiting ability to perform daily activities. This disease not only represents a major burden to individuals and society, but also reduces the quality of life for patients and their caregivers. Although tremendous progress has been made in recent years in basic science research and clinical guidelines on the treatment of pressure sores, prevention and treatment of pressure sores is still an issue that needs to be addressed by doctors and nurses. TCM, one of the most important complementary and alternative medicines, has been well demonstrated to have significant treatment effects on pressure sores [<xref rid="b10-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ligustrazine is an effective TCM herb isolated from <italic>Ligusticum chuanxiong</italic> Hort, which was first recorded in the <italic>Divine Husbandman&#x02019;s Classic of the Materia Medica</italic> (Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing). This plant is widely used when treating various diseases <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. For example, it has been reported that ligustrazine can protect against accelerated nephritis due to its antioxidant characteristics and inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref rid="b20-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Ligustrazine may attenuate atherosclerosis and hepatic accumulation by alleviating oxidative stress and dyslipidemia [<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b21-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, ligustrazine has been reported to play a protective role in ischemia-reperfusion injury [<xref rid="b22-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the therapeutic effect of ligustrazine on pressure sores has rarely been studied. Therefore, we explored the therapeutic effect of ligustrazine in combination with holistic nursing on pressure sores.</p><p>Patients with Phase II and Phase III pressure sores were enrolled in our study. Ligustrazine was externally administrated to the experimental group patients by using a dermal patch, whereas compound clotrimazole cream was administered to the patients in the control group. Compared with conventional oral administration, the medication delivered by a dermal patch reduces adverse effects and improves compliance with medication and dosage control by avoidance of first-pass hepatic metabolism and destruction in the gastrointestinal tract [<xref rid="b24-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, in our study we administrated ligustrazine using dermal patches. In addition to the pharmacotherapy, nursing intervention is also extremely important. Effective and good nursing care with targeted interventions is essential for prevention of pressure sores and is generally able to reduce the incidence and development of pressure sores. In addition, exemplary skin care is now considered as one of the nurse-sensitive outcome measures [<xref rid="b25-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and was reported in the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators [<xref rid="b26-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The total effective rate and healing time were recorded after 4 continuous weeks of treatment. Our results showed that external application of ligustrazine significantly improved the total effective rate and decreased healing time. Since ligustrazine can promote the recovery of pressure sores, we speculated that ligustrazine might promote cell regeneration and enhance cell proliferation ability. To further clarify the underlying mechanism of the protective role of ligustrazine in pressure sores, the phosphorylation and expression of PI3K, AKT, and p-mTOR were examined through qRT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. AKT is an important anti-apoptotic protein, which is activated via the PI3K pathway. The PI3K/AKT pathway has been demonstrated to play a key role in cell proliferation and survival [<xref rid="b27-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b29-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibits cell death and enhances cells survival [<xref rid="b30-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Ligustrazine and its analogue, CXC195, can both protect against ischemia reperfusion injury in rats by activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway [<xref rid="b23-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b31-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Chen et al. suggested that combination treatment of Adriamycin and (E)-2-(2, 4-dimethoxystyryl)-3, 5, 6-trimethylpyrazine (DLJ14) (a ligustrazine derivate) suppressed resistant breast cancer progression, partly by inhibition of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT survival pathway [<xref rid="b33-medscimonit-22-2871" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In our study, the expression levels of PI3K, phosphorylated AKT, and mTOR were significantly up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner by application of ligustrazine. However, this effect was abolished by co-treatment with the inhibitor of AKT (LY294002), suggesting that ligustrazine activates the PI3K/Akt pathway. Our results were similar to those of the above studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results demonstrate that external application of ligustrazine combined with holistic nursing protects against pressure sores.
