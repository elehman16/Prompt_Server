The rapid increases in the proportion of the population that are overweight and obese are now apparent in children as well as adults in both developed and developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. New Zealand has not avoided the global obesity epidemic, with the country now being ranked fourth in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rankings for overweight and obesity (65&#x000a0;% of the population over 15&#x000a0;years are classed as either overweight or obese) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The Health of New Zealand Children Survey 2013/2014 reported 10&#x000a0;% of children aged 5&#x02013;14 years are obese, up from 8&#x000a0;% in 2006/2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Rates of obesity are higher for Maori &#x02013; New Zealand&#x02019;s Indigenous population (15&#x000a0;%), Pacific Island children (25&#x000a0;%), and children living in the most deprived quintile of households (18&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Few children and adolescents struggling with weight issues have access to intervention programmes. In New Zealand, most overweight or obese children and adolescents coming to the attention of medical professionals are either managed by a general practitioner or general paediatrician with minimal intervention programmes being available nationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. No national cohesive approach for managing childhood obesity exists, despite national clinical guidelines being available since 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A recent multi-centre audit showed that, irrespective of type of intervention, a small but significant reduction in BMI SDS was achievable (&#x02212;0.15 overall), highlighting the importance of health professionals being proactive in identifying and addressing child obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, even when obesity is identified, intervention is infrequently implemented. In Australia, general practitioners were recently shown to provide weight management for &#x0003c;2&#x000a0;% of overweight and obese children attending primary care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and paediatricians reported lacking confidence in the management of obesity in children, with only 37&#x000a0;% reporting training in the management of obesity-related comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This is also likely to be the situation in New Zealand, although to date, similar surveys remain unpublished.</p><p>Past meta-analyses have supported multi-disciplinary intervention programmes for addressing child and adolescent obesity, as they are deemed as having the greatest chance of success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. New Zealand&#x02019;s Ministry of Health guidelines support an approach of working with family to address food habits, increase physical activity and to promote behavioural change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Evolution of the current trial came from these recommendations, findings from an audit of an existing physical activity/nutrition programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and recognition of the need to address accessibility for those most affected by obesity. A trial was deemed necessary to ensure future decision-making with regard to child and adolescent obesity was informed by the most reliable evidence possible. The trial has been designed with consideration of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>It was clear in the pre-existing regional programme that the lack of a measure for assessing a participant&#x02019;s psychological &#x0201c;readiness&#x0201d; to make lifestyle changes was affecting interpretation of the outcomes of the programme overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Whilst most clinical practitioners assess readiness to make lifestyle changes in their patients on a daily basis, this is a poorly defined process. Historically, readiness for change (RFC) has been utilised qualitatively in some obesity services. It is a concept that has developed from the transtheoretical model defining stages of behavioural change around addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. When deciding to undertake behavioural change, an individual moves through defined stages at different rates and not always in a linear fashion (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, an individual&#x02019;s readiness to change may be behaviour-specific, so it is unclear whether a participant&#x02019;s &#x0201c;readiness&#x0201d; may equate to global changes related to improving lifestyle. In the original readiness for change questionnaire directed towards excessive alcohol use, this was somewhat mitigated by the use of multiple descriptive statements across pre-contemplation, contemplation and action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Theoretical model of stages of readiness for change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Stage</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pre-contemplation</td><td>&#x0201c;I do not have a problem&#x0201d;</td></tr><tr><td>Contemplation</td><td>&#x0201c;I may have a problem&#x0201d;</td></tr><tr><td>Preparation</td><td>&#x0201c;I may have a problem and need to do something&#x0201d;</td></tr><tr><td>Action</td><td>&#x0201c;I will try these changes&#x0201d;</td></tr><tr><td>Maintenance</td><td>&#x0201c;The changes I have made are now part of what I do&#x0201d;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>The transtheoretical model has been used to assess individual&#x02019;s motivation for smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and various tools for readiness for change have been trialled in the obesity setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The utility of readiness for change remains unclear as it relates to obesity services, and it is too simplistic to expect that every individual would move through these stages in a similar fashion. However, previous studies have highlighted the importance of tailoring interventions to the individual stage of change rather than treating all participants as if they are in preparation or action stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. If there were a quantitative tool that could predict likelihood of success at initial assessment, this would potentially focus health resource where it was most likely to make a difference. Given the complexity of behaviour change as it relates to obesity, the original readiness for change questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] would require modification and expansion to include questions regarding eating behaviour, attitude towards weight and physical activity behaviour. Confidence to make changes in physical activity and eating behaviour would also need to be considered.</p><p>The question remains as to whether an individual&#x02019;s readiness in the &#x0201c;snapshot&#x0201d; situation of an assessment translates to ongoing motivation to make lifestyle changes over time. In the domain of child and adolescent obesity, parental readiness is a vital factor in a child or adolescent&#x02019;s success in making and maintaining lifestyle changes. If a parent believes their child&#x02019;s weight is a problem, or that they as parents are overweight, they are more likely to be ready to make lifestyle changes for their child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>&#x0201c;Whanau Pakari&#x0201d; means &#x0201c;healthy self-assured families that are fully active&#x0201d; in Maori, and was the name gifted to the trial by a prominent Maori community representative. The trial assesses a new mainstream clinical service delivered in an innovative way in order to improve access for Maori, and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Previous child obesity services in the region involved the traditional model of medical referral to a Paediatrician, sometimes with the addition of dietitian input, and physical activity programme input. The physical activity programme, run in the community through the regional sports trust with a maximum number of participants per year, did not specifically target high-risk groups, and was not region-wide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The new programme removes the &#x0201c;hospital visit&#x0201d;, but participants continue to receive support and oversight from a Paediatrician. This multi-disciplinary programme incorporates three novel approaches:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>It provides a trained roving community coordinator to meet families in their homes, enabling improved access to the clinical service, especially for Maori.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It assesses &#x0201c;readiness for change&#x0201d; both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It provides follow up to 12&#x000a0;months post intervention to assess persistence of lifestyle changes, which is longer than any other multi-disciplinary obesity intervention model trialled in New Zealand.</p></list-item></list></p><p>There is a clear need for evidence-based interventions for child obesity that demonstrate on-going effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Whether engaging with those that are more motivated to make lifestyle changes is a strategy that warrants further exploration. Our objectives are firstly, to undertake a multi-disciplinary intervention, which is accessible and appropriate for those most affected by child obesity. Secondly, we aim to assess whether a quantitative RFC questionnaire is useful in predicting response to the intervention. We hypothesise that in obese/overweight children, assessed as psychologically &#x0201c;ready for change&#x0201d;, delivery of a 12-month multi-disciplinary intervention programme results in a significant reduction in body mass index standard deviation score at 12&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Whanau Pakari is an unblinded randomised controlled clinical trial being conducted in Taranaki, New Zealand (population 23,139 children aged 0&#x02013;15 years, of which 28&#x000a0;% are Maori) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Ethical approval was granted by the Health and Disability Ethics Committee (Ministry of Health, New Zealand; CEN/11/09/054), and the trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR: 12611000862943). Locality approval has been obtained from Sport Taranaki, and the Taranaki District Health Board.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Children from the Taranaki region aged 5&#x02013;16 years, with a body mass index (BMI) &#x02265;98th centile, or those &#x0003e;91st centile with weight related comorbidities will be offered participation in the trial if referred to &#x0201c;Whanau Pakari&#x0201d;. These cut-offs are a modification of UK Cole data, and have been chosen as they are nationally accepted for use by the Ministry of Health for defining obesity and overweight respectively in the community for 0&#x02013;5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. (There are no nationally accepted growth charts or official cut-offs in use for &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;year old children currently.)</p><p>Exclusion criteria will be significant medical or psychological conditions leading to inability to undertake physical activity or participate in group sessions; those not &#x0201c;ready&#x0201d; to make lifestyle changes; and those without a committed family member (essential to support the family-based approach of the programme).</p><p>To optimise accessibility, referrals will be accepted from all health professionals within the community, including public health nurses in schools, and Maori health workers. Self-referrals will also be accepted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Summary of Whanau Pakari trial design within service</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40608_2015_68_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Recruitment for the trial will be through the service, which is being advertised across Taranaki through multiple channels, including referrer training half-days (training sessions about the service, and how to have conversations about weight with families), meetings (hui) with all stakeholders, general practice visits, school visits, media releases, pamphlet drops at public places and events, and the Public Health Unit of Taranaki District Health Board.</p><p>Whilst the trial will assess a &#x0201c;mainstream&#x0201d; clinical service, the aim is to target Maori and the most deprived in the community. To achieve this aim we will use identified facilitators that enable Indigenous people&#x02019;s participation such as relationship and partnership building, involvement of Indigenous staff, the use of Indigenous knowledge models (such as He Korowai Oranga: the Maori Health strategy and the Whanau Ora [healthy families] tool) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], targeted recruitment techniques (such as working with Maori health workers within the community to engage with families) and adapting study material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>All children referred will be seen in the family (whanau) home by the Healthy Lifestyles Coordinator (a health professional trained in focussed weight-related assessment, supported by a Paediatrician). This design aspect allows the trial to run as a community-based service yet with a full clinical component to it. Removal of a hospital-based appointment with a specialist was designed to enable access to the service for larger numbers and minority groups, and to avoid &#x0201c;medicalisation&#x0201d; of the process. Given the service is targeting Maori and those from lower socio-economic areas, ensuring accessibility and appropriateness are crucial to the study design, without compromising clinical care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conception and consultation</title><p>The multi-disciplinary intervention model was developed after consideration of the national guidelines for implementation of weight management programmes, and the recommendations from the international systematic reviews and meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Longer-term follow-up was deemed imperative to determine whether lifestyle changes persisted over time, which has been a deficit of many previous studies. Conceptually, a multi-disciplinary intervention that incorporated dietary, physical and psychological support was considered important, with 12&#x000a0;months the optimal length of intervention. It was necessary for the intervention to be community-based with a strong focus on accessibility to Maori, and those from lower socio-economic areas.</p><p>Guidance was sought in the inception stages from the Maori Health Unit of Taranaki District Health Board, who advised appropriate linkages with the community, identifying the key Maori stakeholders from Maori Health Centres in the region, and tribal representatives. Maori were instrumental in the initial set-up phase, applying a Maori lens to service delivery and curriculum development, and were on the interview panel for all staff members. It was imperative to the researchers that the consultation undertaken helped to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Build appropriate and positive relationships around the region, particularly in South Taranaki, which has a proportionally larger population of Maori.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ensure acceptability of the intended research by using a community-based approach.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Provide an opportunity for input and contribution from community stakeholders during the consultation process.</p></list-item></list></p><p>This process ensured that potential barriers for engagement for Maori and the most deprived in the community such as lack of access, unfamiliarity with research, distrust and problems with the research material were addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The consultation process is ongoing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessments</title><p>Assessments will be completed at six monthly intervals for 2&#x000a0;years from enrolment.

Readiness for lifestyle change will be based on the transtheoretical model of stages of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and will be established with two questionnaires (parent and child/adolescent) and the best judgement of the Healthy Lifestyles Coordinator at the end of the baseline assessments. Both questionnaires will be based on the 12-item Readiness to Change Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and will use a 5-point Likert scale to assess the parent&#x02019;s and child/adolescent&#x02019;s beliefs, attitudes and behaviour about weight, eating behaviour and physical activity. Given the complexity of obesity, the questionnaires will be expanded. The child questionnaire will have 21-items and will be used for children 11&#x000a0;years and older, and a 27-item parent questionnaire, including 6 questions regarding family attitudes/behaviour, will be administered to parents. Whilst self-efficacy/confidence to make changes are not extensively measured, confidence in making changes in physical activity and eating behaviour has been included in both quantitative questionnaires.</p><p>Qualitative assessments of readiness for change will be made by the Healthy Lifestyles Coordinator at the end of the assessment. This will be the Coordinator&#x02019;s overall subjective opinion as a health professional of stage of change in both the committed family member and child (if &#x0003e;11&#x000a0;years of age), based on the assessment. A qualitative stage of change will be included as this is what is undertaken in current clinical practice, and provides a comparator for the quantitative tool. The quantitative assessment will be scored at point of data entry by the Healthy Lifestyles Coordinator. Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha will be used to establish the reliability of our readiness for change lifestyle questionnaire.

The RFC questionnaire was based on the original readiness to change questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], focussing on beliefs and behaviour around three factors: weight, eating habits and activity levels. If the RFC ranking is scored in the contemplative or further along on either scale, then participants will be offered entry into the trial. We purposely set the bar low (i.e. below the preparation/action level) to assess whether degree of RFC predicts outcomes within those contemplative or above.</p><p>Patients will be assessed, consented, and entered into the trial prior to randomisation. Randomisation by minimisation (using age and ethnicity) will be conducted using the Minim randomisation computer programme which maintains approximate balance in the 2 arms for age and ethnicity but incorporates a random element so it cannot be predicted which study arm the subject will be allocated to.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome measure is the change in BMI SDS in the intervention group compared with the control group recorded at 6, 12, 18 and 24&#x000a0;months post enrolment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Secondary outcomes include changes in health-related quality of life; dietary knowledge and behaviour; physical activity (specifically moderate to very vigorous physical activity), sedentary behaviour, knowledge of benefits of physical activity, cardiovascular and metabolic profile (blood pressure, resting heart rate, waist circumference and WHtR) all at 6, 12, 18, and 24&#x000a0;months, and glycaemic control (fasting glucose and HbA1c), fasting insulin and lipids at baseline, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Other aims and outcomes</title><p>This study also aims to investigate whether those assessed as ready for change (i.e. preparation/action) experience a greater reduction in BMI SDS compared with those less ready for change (i.e. contemplation).

This will be achieved with its focus on an indigenous group at increased risk for obesity and its resulting comorbidities, and through its engagement with the community to increase acceptability of the programme. It is likely to inform these areas in a robust manner if high participation is achieved and maintained.</p><p>This randomised controlled trial is unique in three key ways. First, it is assessing a mainstream multi-disciplinary clinical service that has evolved to specifically ensure accessibility and appropriateness for Indigenous people. Whanau Pakari is a community &#x0201c;real life&#x0201d; intervention programme resulting out of a clinical need, and has the potential to answer critical questions in relation to delivery of interventions in this area. Secondly, Whanau Pakari utilises a home-visit model which replaces hospital medical assessments, therefore &#x0201c;de-medicalising&#x0201d; obesity assessments. The family-based home model is likely to appeal to many ethnic groups who resist the hospital-based mainstream clinical models currently operating in most areas. Thirdly, Whanau Pakari will only include those considered potentially ready for change, and will investigate whether the level of &#x0201c;readiness&#x0201d; to make lifestyle changes predicts improved outcomes in intervention programmes. If the RFC measures provide a reliable and valid measure of outcome success, then the development of paired interventions around motivation for change for those in earlier stages of change followed by direct interventions for those in later stages could result in less programme dropout as well as being a more efficient and cost effective utilisation of limited resource.</p><p>A limitation of this study is the use of self-report for Tanner pubertal stage. Previous literature has demonstrated that obese girls tend to overestimate breast size and obese males stage of pubic hair development more than their non-obese counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, we did not believe it was appropriate to undertake pubertal examination within the home setting, and it was determined this would be a more appropriate cut-off for pre-pubertal and pubertal status than an arbitrary age for males and females.</p><p>Weight-related comorbidities are a particular concern in child obesity, given the long-lasting effects of these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Past meta-analysis highlighted that a BMI SDS reduction of &#x02212;0.1 led to significant improvements in multiple cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. BMI, in conjunction with waist circumference, WHtR, fasting lipids, glucose and insulin, and blood pressure (all being measured at intervals over an extended period of follow-up) will provide a comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes long-term.</p><p>Whilst there has been a shifting focus toward early obesity intervention targeting critical periods of human development, there is still a need for an effective intervention programme to provide assistance for those children and adolescents who are already obese. This research aligns with the Ministry of Health&#x02019;s clinical guidelines for weight management in children and young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and addresses barriers to accessing services and programmes identified by the Office of the Auditor General&#x02019;s performance audit into child obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>In summary, this trial will determine if this unique multi-disciplinary intervention will result in improved health outcomes, especially among Maori. It will also investigate whether there is an indication that being at the preparation/action stages of RFC compared to those in the contemplative stage results in improved success in intervention programmes. As translational research, it will inform the New Zealand Ministry of Health regarding ways to combat child and adolescent obesity. It is hoped this study will lead to prevention of the adult associated comorbidities of child obesity into later life for some individuals, thereby reducing morbidity, particularly for those most vulnerable in our population.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANZCTR</term><def><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OECD</term><def><p>Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RFC</term><def><p>Readiness for change</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HbA1c</term><def><p>glycated Haemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDS</term><def><p>standard deviation score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHtR</term><def><p>Waist height ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Peds QL</term><def><p>Pediatric Quality of Life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBCL</term><def><p>Child Behaviour Checklist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>C-PAQ</term><def><p>Children&#x02019;s Physical Activity Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDQ</term><def><p>Children&#x02019;s Dietary Questionnaire</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Dr Anderson wishes to declare funding from grants as listed in funding section below.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>YCA designed the study, will coordinate the trial, provide Paediatrician oversight, and drafted the manuscript.
