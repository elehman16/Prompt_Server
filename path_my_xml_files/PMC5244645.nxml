However, some patients do not respond to rHuEPO mainly because of iron deficiency.

Patients were considered eligible according to all the following criteria: &#x02265;18 years, regular HD for at least 3 months; serum hematocrit (Hct) percentage (%) between 22% and 32%, serum ferritin &#x0003c;200 &#x003bc;g/L, serum transferrin saturation percentage (Tsat%) &#x0003c;40%,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] normal serum Vitamin B12 and folic acid concentrations, and no blood transfusion in the last 3 months. The exclusion criteria were any one of the followings: Hemoglobinopathies, malignancy, pregnancy, acute infectious state, gastrointestinal bleeding, mental incapacity, and inability to abide to the study requirements. The main purpose of the study was to compare the improvements of anemia after administering iron sucrose or ferric chloride to HD patients with iron deficiency anemia. Hct is an easy feasible method in clinical practice to evaluate anemia in HD patients.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Therefore, we used Hct as an indicator of evaluation of anemia in this study. The primary outcome in our study was to evaluate changes in serum Hct level after administration two kinds of iron preparations (iron sucrose and ferric chloride). The second outcomes were to evaluate the changes of serum iron indices including iron, ferritin, and Tsat. Eligible patients were initially screened in our HD rooms, and then some patients were excluded (according to exclusion criteria). Remnant patients were categorized to an iron sucrose group and a ferric chloride group according to the table of random numbers. Clinical physicians knew what kinds of iron preparations were administrated; however, all patients did not know. Furthermore, specific questions regarding symptoms typical of iron toxicity, such as hypotension, dizziness, or nausea, and those suggestive of anaphylactic reactions were asked after each iron administration. In total, the study duration was 10 weeks. Blood investigations, including serum Hct, iron, ferritin, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC), were checked at 2-week intervals (after a total of 200 mg of iron was administered) before each dialysis sessions. Criteria for the discontinuation of iron treatment included subjective symptoms, such as anorexia, general malaise, or any discomfort experienced by the patient. To examine the greatest effects of iron administration under rHuEPO therapy, all patients received identical doses of rHuEPO (RECORMON 5000 IU/week). Patients were excluded from this study if the doses of rHuEPO were changed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Parenteral iron and dosage</title><p>In the iron sucrose and ferric chloride groups, 100 mg of iron sucrose (Fe-Lib) and 100 mg of ferric chloride hexahydrate (CH) (Atofen) was administered, respectively.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Both iron supplements were administered once weekly during dialysis until a total dose of 1000 mg was reached over the 10-week treatment period. They were administered as an infusion in 100 mL of normal saline in the last &#x000bd; h of dialysis through the venous bubble trap port of the dialysis circuit (time of infusion was 30 min). Regular observations were conducted over the administration period.

Accordingly, a sample size of at least 25 per treatment group at 10-weeks follow-up was calculated to provide 80% power (alpha = 0.05, two-tail) to detect statistically significant differences between the two treatments for a mean Hct increase to at least 32%.

In our study, a total iron dose of 1000 mg was administered. Patients were closely monitored for side effects and assessed during the study period to avoid lethal anaphylactic reactions associated with intravenous iron injections. Despite the past reports of allergies in patients treated with ferric chloride at HD centers in Taiwan, neither major side effects nor symptoms suggestive of possible anaphylactic reactions were observed during the 10-week study period in either treatment group. In the study, three patients experienced mild skin itching (one patient, and two patients in the iron sucrose and ferric chloride groups, respectively), and four patients had a mild sensation of nausea after iron therapy (one patient and three patients in the iron sucrose and ferric chloride groups, respectively).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This prospective observational study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of intravenous iron sucrose and ferric chloride over a 10-week treatment period. Under a satisfactory dose of rHuEPO, our results showed that both iron preparations had similar efficacy in terms of increasing body iron content. Our study suggested that there were no statistically significant differences in serum Hct, ferritin, and Tsat levels between the two treatment groups at any point during the study. No obvious major side effects were observed in either group. Therefore, we concluded that iron sucrose and ferric chloride were equally effective and safe in treating anemia in HD patients with short-term (10-week) use.</p><p>A previous trial in which 108 patients were randomized to receive either iron sucrose or ferric CH revealed similar results in ferritin, Hct, and Tsat levels during a 24-week study period; however, rHuEPO dose used was different compared with that used in our study. They suggested that iron sucrose and ferric CH were equally effective, although Hct levels at week 24 and ferritin at week 20 were significantly higher in the iron sucrose group.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] A reasonable explanation for the similarity in efficacy between iron sucrose and ferric chloride is that both iron preparations contained ferric iron. Iron sucrose is polynuclear iron (III)-hydroxide in sucrose, and ferric chloride is ferric chloride in hexahydrate. In our observational study, no obvious side effects or other symptoms suggestive of anaphylactoid reactions were found in either treatment group. This suggests that iron sucrose and ferric CH are equally safe with regard to short-term use. Despite past reports of allergy, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiovascular risk in both iron sucrose and ferric chloride-treated patients, the patients in our study showed no signs of allergy or anaphylactic reaction.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] A relationship between iron dosing and mortality in HD patients has been reported. Feldman <italic>et al</italic>. found no adverse effects in a 2-year survival study for total doses of &#x02266;1000 mg of iron therapy over 6 months; however, there was a statistically significant increase in mortality with total iron doses of &#x0003e;1000 mg to 1800 mg.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In a clinical situation, due to poor bioavailability, oral iron supplementation will often not be sufficient to supply adequate amounts of iron. Even though oral iron supplementation is inexpensive, it has not gained wide acceptance. Apart from poor bioavailability, other reasons include intolerance to gastrointestinal side effects and noncompliance.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] A recent study found that parenteral iron in HD patients with relative iron deficiency is cost-effective compared to oral iron.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Because of the limitations of oral iron supplementation, the parenteral administration of iron is necessary in the majority of renal failure patients. In the 2005 United States Renal Data System annual report, approximately 70% of HD patients in the United States received intravenous iron therapy.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The most widely used parenteral iron preparations at present include iron dextran, iron gluconate, and iron sucrose. Iron dextran has been available in the United States and the United Kingdom for more than 30 years. Presently, iron dextran is primarily sold in the United States and is not used in continental Europe or the United Kingdom. The major drawback of iron dextran is its relatively high rate of life-threatening anaphylactic reactions. It was hypothesized that the anaphylactic reactions were caused by the high molecular weight iron dextran component, since the abovementioned intravenous iron preparations were all ferric iron but in different sugar solutions.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Therefore, it might be reasonable to hypothesize that the past reports on allergy associated with the use of intravenous ferric CH might be attributed to the hexahydrate component of the iron complex. Nevertheless, in our observational study, no obvious severe allergic reaction was reported in the ferric CH treatment group. This may be associated with the fewer patient numbers enrolled in our study. Low molecular weight iron dextran and iron sucrose have been reported to have similar comparative safety profiles in CKD patients. Of interest, low molecular-weight iron dextran has been reported to be associated with reduction in platelet counts in CKD patients.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Regarding iron sucrose, one study described a total of 64 HD patients on iron sucrose for 1-year. There were no major adverse effects and the target Hct of 33% was reached with or without very low doses of rHuEPO.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, this latter study did not investigate possible iron toxicity, such as the change in serum ferritin or Tsat. From our observational study, we concluded that parenteral iron sucrose was at least as effective as parenteral ferric chloride with regard to short-term (10-week) use. Both iron supplementations could gradually increase serum Hct and ferritin levels during the study period. Further assessment of associated iron overload, such as change in inflammatory biomarkers and magnetic resonance imaging, should be considered.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] A 6-month observational prospective crossover study revealed the safety and efficacy of iron sucrose (Venofer).[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] A current randomized, open-label trial of iron sucrose (Venofer) in HD patients showed that iron sucrose was well tolerated with a good short-term safety profile. Long-term iron administration of both iron sucrose and ferric chloride in CKD and HD patients is important; however, it should be monitored carefully.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, rHuEPO doses were used at 5000 IU/week identically in all enrolled patients during the study period. However, the required rHuEPO dose and rHuEPO responsiveness differed among patients because of body size, body weight, body mass index, and patient background, including comorbidities. Second, the sample size in this study was relatively small, and patients were only in a single center. Whether the treatment effects could be applied to patients from other ethnic backgrounds is unknown. Furthermore, the causes of chronic inflammation in HD patients are multifactorial and complex. Underlying disease, oxidative stress, chronic inflammatory state, obesity, immunological factors, membrane biocompatibility, and dialysate quality could have influenced our data in these patients.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The main findings of this study are as follows: (1) parenteral iron sucrose was at least as effective as parenteral ferric chloride with regard to short-term (10-week) use and (2) the most important outcome is the absence of differences in serum Hct, apart from the change from baseline, and other iron indices between each iron preparation, which long-term therapeutic effects of both iron preparations should be investigated in a larger study.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>PJH, JSC, KLW, and JSC were involved in the study concept and protocol design.
