After normal distribution had been ascertained by the Kolmogorov-Simirnov test, a sample size of 30 in each group was arrived at according to the standard normal distribution theory and fixing type-I error (&#x003b1;) at 0.05 and the power of the study (1-&#x003b2;) at 0.8. According to simple random sampling technique, out of all the cases being operated which fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study, every odd numbered case was assigned to Group-P and every even numbered case to Group-E. The null hypothesis was that there is no difference between etomidate and propofol regarding hemodynamic changes while the alternate hypothesis was that there is a statistically significant difference in the hemodynamic changes seen with both the drugs during entropy guided induction and intubation.</p><p>A detailed preanesthetic evaluation was done including airway assessment, clinical history, general and systemic examination, routine biochemical investigations, chest X-ray and electrocardiography. All patients were premedicated with oral alprazolam 0.5 mg at night before surgery and oral ranitidine 150 mg and oral granisetron 2 mg 1 h prior to surgery. In the operation theatre, IV line was established with 18G IV cannula. All monitors including entropy sensor were attached. Midazolam 0.03 mg/kg IV, 2 min before induction and fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;/kg 1 min prior to induction were injected.</p><p>Anesthesia was induced using IV propofol infusion titrated to response entropy (RE) of 40 in Group-P and IV etomidate was used in Group-E with similar titration to an RE of 40. The end point for the induction was an RE value of 40 since RE is more comprehensive than state entropy (SE) and includes uncovered nociception as well. Neuromuscular blockade was achieved by vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with 33% oxygen, 66% nitrous oxide and mask-ventilation. Trachea was intubated with portex cuffed endotracheal tube lubricated with KY jelly (Johnson and Johnson). No surgical stimulus was given; patients were not touched or otherwise disturbed for 5 min postintubation to discover the magnitude of RE-SE difference and the presence or absence of electromyography during anesthesia without surgery. Volatile anesthetic agents were started after 3 min of intubation. The cases in which orotracheal intubation could be performed successfully within 15 s in a single attempt were included in the study.</p><p>The rescue drugs utilized were ~ ephedrine 3 mg bolus was given if the mean arterial pressure (MAP) dropped by &#x0003e;20% from baseline. Boluses of 2 mg etomidate or 10 mg propofol at a time were given if at any time SE rose above 60.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] A bolus was defined as 1 ml (10 mg) of propofol or 1 ml (2 mg) of etomidate, each injected over a period of 10 s. These boluses were presumed to be equipotent as they were in the same ratio (5:1) as standard per kilogram body weight induction doses of propofol and etomidate respectively. Diltiazem 2.5 mg IV was used if MAP increased &#x0003e;20% from baseline and esmolol 20 mg was employed in case the heart rate (HR) rose above 100 beats/min.</p><p>Observation and measurement of HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), MAP, RE and SE at baseline, and T1-T6 till upto 3 min postintubation was done using M-entropy module (S5 Datex Ohmeda, Instrumentarium Corp., Helsinki, Finland) The data was plotted on a specifically prepared proforma for each patient where:</p><p>

</p><p>The entropy monitor displays two variables. SE is computed over the frequency range from 0.8 to 32 Hz and includes the electroencephalography (EEG) - the dominant part of the spectrum. Hence SE primarily reflects the cortical state of the patient. RE is computed over a frequency range of 0.8-47 Hz and includes both the EEG - dominant and electromyogram dominant parts of the spectrum. On the monitor display, SE values vary between 0 (suppressed EEG activity) and 91 (indicating an awake state). RE values vary between 0 and 100. The recommended range of adequate anesthesia for both parameters is from 40 to 60. When SE is in the recommended range for adequate anesthesia but RE discrepancy is 5-10 U or more, it indicates patient responsiveness to surgery and can be interpreted as a sign of uncovered nociception.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Statistical analysis of the effect of etomidate and propofol on hemodynamic responses during induction and intubation with entropy guided hypnosis levels was studied.

The dose of etomidate utilized by various studies ranges from 0.2 to 0.45 mg/kg.

The mechanisms of arterial hypotension following IV anesthetic induction are multifactorial. The hemodynamic stability seen with etomidate may be due to its unique lack of effect on both the sympathetic nervous system and baroreceptor function[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and capacity to bind and stimulate peripheral alpha-2B adrenergic receptors with a subsequent vasoconstriction.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Decrease in systemic blood pressure after bolus injection of propofol is dependent on both vasodilation with reduced preload and afterload and myocardial depression (negative inotropic action).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Saricaoglu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] after studying the hemodynamic effects of an induction dose of propofol and etomidate found that propofol was associated with significant decreases in SBP and mean blood pressure. They attributed this hypotension to the negative inotropic effect of propofol. Larsen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] examined the effects of propofol upon myocardial function by measuring changes in left ventricle function using transthoracic tissue-Doppler echocardiography and concluded that a decrease in MAP with propofol is secondary to reduce cardiac filling or a consequence of a direct negative inotropic action of propofol. Weisenberg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] concluded that lower doses of propofol (1.3 mg/kg) reduce hemodynamic instability.</p><p>This study reveals that at RE of 40, the hemodynamic variations with etomidate were less alpine than propofol throughout the period spanning induction and intubation.</p><p>As per the results of our study [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>], the mean absolute dose of etomidate required for the complete duration spanning induction and intubation was 9.4 mg or 0.153 mg/kg body weight. This is much less (just 50% of) than the conventional 0.2-0.4 mg/kg body weight dose (average: 0.3 mg/kg).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The mean absolute dose of propofol also showed a similar reduction (61.33 mg). The propofol dose per kilogram body weight was 0.98 which again is much less (56% of) than the conventional dose of 1-2.5 mg/kg body weight[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (average: 1.75 mg/kg body weight). We attribute this wholesome dose reduction to the anesthetic - sparing effect of the entropy monitor. Fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;/kg) and midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) may also have played a role in dose reduction of etomidate and propofol.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Anesthetic sparing effect of entropy monitor</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-31-180-g009"/></table-wrap><p>Riad <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] studied entropy guided propofol induction in 72 elderly patients and found that total dose of propofol and the per kilogram body weight dose were significantly reduced by 37.1% and 31.8%, respectively in the entropy group. They concluded that the use of M-entropy during induction of anesthesia in elderly patients reduces propofol requirements and maintains cardiovascular stability that is consistent with our findings.</p><p>To conclude, our induction technique utilizing midazolam, fentanyl and the entropy monitor can be utilized to give greater hemodynamic stability to both induction agents propofol and etomidate by dose reduction effect. On using the entropy monitor the fall in SBP, DBP, and MAP on induction with propofol and etomidate can be reduced whereas the rise in SBP, DBP and MAP during laryngoscopy and intubation with etomidate is also reduced. Dose reduction also resulted in a reduction in the incidence of myoclonus in case of etomidate. Our results highlight the importance of using the entropy monitor to guide hypnosis levels for induction, as it translates into significant dose reductions both for etomidate and propofol. Entropy guided reduced induction doses (0.15 mg/kg for etomidate and 0.98 mg/kg for propofol respectively) result in lesser hemodynamic changes than propofol and etomidate induction with standard per kilogram body weight doses.</p><p>Etomidate is more cardiostable than propofol at equipotent dosages.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
