Both diabetes and obesity have a profound effect on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Although CVD-related mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes has been decreasing over the past few decades, these patients remain at significantly (twofold to threefold) higher risk for CVD-related mortality relative to comparable groups without diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The influence of differing hypoglycemic treatment regimens on CVD has been of increasing clinical concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). To date, only a few randomized studies have addressed the impact of different hypoglycemic treatment regimens on the outcome of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Mostly, clinical trials examining the efficacy of various antidiabetes drugs have focused on intermediate clinical outcomes such as changes in levels of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, serum lipids, and blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Several studies suggest that improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes reduces microvascular risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However it remains unclear whether there is a specific effect of different hypoglycemic agents on &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; clinical outcomes from macrovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Because macrovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), it is important to explore whether any association exists between conventional approaches to hypoglycemic therapy and cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Therefore, we have examined data from the Sibutramine Cardiovascular Outcomes (SCOUT) trial (see list of participating investigators in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc13-0027/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>) conducted in &#x0003e;10,000 overweight and obese subjects to explore possible links between hypoglycemic treatment regimens and cardiovascular events. SCOUT demonstrated that long-term treatment with sibutramine had a slightly increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.04&#x02013;1.57; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) and nonfatal stroke (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.04&#x02013;1.77; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03), but not of cardiovascular death or death from any cause, among subjects at high cardiovascular risk. It has not been established, however, whether the type of therapy for diabetes affected the outcome.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>SCOUT was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial conducted in 300 centers in 16 countries worldwide. The protocol has been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In brief, SCOUT tested whether sibutramine (a norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor previously approved for weight management in individuals without history of CVD or diabetes) could safely and effectively reduce the burden of cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk overweight or obese patients with preexisting CVD, type 2 diabetes, or both (CV-DM).</p><p>Eligible subjects were 55 years of age or older, with BMI of 27&#x02013;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; subjects also were eligible if BMI was at least 25 but &#x0003c;27 and had a waist circumference of at least 102 cm for men and 88 cm for women. Enrolled subjects had history of CVD (previous myocardial infarction, previous coronary revascularization, or otherwise proven atherosclerotic disease such as peripheral arterial occlusive disease or stroke) or type 2 diabetes (or both) with an additional cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, current smoking, or diabetic nephropathy).</p><p>Exclusion criteria were symptoms of heart failure greater than New York Heart Association functional class II, blood pressure &#x0003e;160/100 mmHg, pulse &#x02265;100 bpm, scheduled cardiac surgery or coronary angioplasty, or weight loss of &#x0003e;3 kg within the previous 3 months.</p><p>Lower than expected overall primary outcome event (POE) rate enforced an adjustment to inclusion criteria after 15 months, restricting recruitment of CV-DM subjects to the highest cardiovascular risk group. As a consequence, the CV-DM group constituted 60% of the overall study group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>For safety reasons (to identify subjects with early and persistent increases in blood pressure or pulse, or both), all subjects underwent a 6-week lead-in period with single blinding (of the subject) in which 10 mg sibutramine was administered together with advice on diet and exercise. Patients eligible after this single-blind phase were randomly assigned to sibutramine 10 mg daily or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.</p><p>Patients had a physical examination performed at the initial screening and at every follow-up visit when information on body weight, vital signs, blood biochemistry, and hematology were obtained. This occurred on a monthly basis for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter for subjects using study medication, or annually after subjects had discontinued study medication. During follow-up, investigators could modify a subject's medication at any time after randomization baseline; they were permitted to add another class or to change drug class to achieve optimum management of all medical conditions. These changes were recorded.</p><p>For the present analysis, we evaluated the cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes (DM only and CV-DM) who had complete data for glucose-lowering treatment regimens at randomization baseline. We assessed the relative risks of a POE, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, or cardiovascular death. Death from any cause was a secondary outcome.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Ethics</title><p>All participating patients gave informed written consent before participation.

Insulin monotherapy was used as the reference in comparative analyses. This was chosen because the insulin treatment group was large and because, of all the hypoglycemic agents, insulin was considered to have the least direct influence on cardiovascular risk itself (i.e., metformin is considered to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk profile and sulfonylureas are considered to be potentially harmful). Furthermore, analyses of the risks associated with overall use compared with no use of metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin were performed as sensitivity analyses.</p><p>Continuous variables are presented as means (&#x000b1;SD) and discrete variables are presented as percentages. Unadjusted time-to-event curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and groups were compared by the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate HRs with 95% CIs. Models were adjusted for the following covariates: age, smoking habits, diabetes duration, congestive heart failure, history of hypertension, BMI, sex, history of CVD, tobacco use, HDL concentrations, LDL concentrations, HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, heart rate, actual systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, and sibutramine usage. Additional time-dependent Cox analyses were performed to adjust for changes in BMI, HbA<sub>1c</sub> values, and hypoglycemic therapy during follow-up. All statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS software (version 9.2; Cary, NC).

Although this confirms previous evidence of the benefit of metformin on all-cause mortality, we also found neither benefit nor harm from sulfonylureas, alone or in any combination, compared with insulin monotherapy.</p><p>Because it seems unlikely that a large-scale clinical trial to test the impact of existing hypoglycemic pharmacotherapies on CVD will be performed, data from observational studies may provide important information to guide clinical practice. Few comparative, prospective, clinical, observational trials have addressed the impact of various hypoglycemic treatment regimens on cardiovascular outcome in such a large cohort. The strength of SCOUT (and of this analysis) is that it provides data for a large number of type 2 diabetic obese patients at increased cardiovascular risks comprehensively studied in a cardiovascular outcome trial in which all events were ascertained and independently adjudicated.</p><p>The favorable effect of metformin in obese and nonobese individuals with type 2 diabetes previously has been shown in observational studies and from post hoc analyses of randomized trials investigating intensive glucose-lowering treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>Post hoc analysis of the Diabetes Mellitus Insulin-Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction 2 (DIGAMI 2) trial found that insulin treatment significantly increased the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke, whereas metformin was protective (although it did not reduce mortality) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Study populations and time of follow-up might account for this discrepancy. DIGAMI 2 recruited diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarction, whereas the SCOUT population comprised patients with wider ranges of cardiovascular risk factors. Neither study was designed to compare the potential effects of insulin against metformin and therefore may have an inherent selection bias.</p><p>The UK Prospective Study Group (UKPDS 34) also showed that patients using metformin had reduced outcomes (diabetes-related end points such as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke) compared with patients treated with insulin or sulfonylurea. Despite a modest hypoglycemic effect (HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduced by 0.6%), myocardial infarction was reduced by 39% and all-cause mortality was reduced by 36% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Proposed explanations for the benefits of metformin are its effects on weight (weight-neutral), ability to reduce insulin resistance, and low risk of hypoglycemia. In contrast, hypoglycemic drugs that increase weight, especially central adiposity, have been shown to be atherogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>A recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) of randomized clinical trials reporting the effect of metformin on cardiovascular events confirmed results of a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and concluded that metformin was associated with neither significant harm nor benefit when compared with an active comparator. However, when compared with placebo or no therapy, metformin was associated with lower cardiovascular event rates, and when administered in combination with sulfonylureas it was associated with reduced survival (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio, 1.432; 95% CI, 1.068&#x02013;1.918; <italic>P</italic> = 0.016). The authors further stated that metformin appeared to be associated with reduction of cardiovascular events in trials of longer duration.</p><p>In contrast to our findings, UKPDS 34 found that addition of metformin to sulfonylureas increased risk for diabetic-related deaths and all-cause mortality in nonoverweight and overweight patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). This discrepancy most likely can be explained by differences in study populations, follow-up time, and reference groups (sulfonylurea monotherapy in UKPDS and insulin monotherapy in our analysis, respectively).</p><p>A recent, randomized, clinical trial showed that the combination of extended-release metformin and sulfonylureas was significantly more effective in lowering HbA<sub>1c</sub> and glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Epidemiological studies confirm that the levels of glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub> are strong predictors of long-term morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Furthermore, observations from 1,294 participants in the Fremantle Diabetes Study concluded that combination therapy with metformin&#x02013;sulfonylurea appeared to be safe and not associated with increased cardiovascular risk in the most conservative model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Another recent meta-analysis of combination therapy with metformin&#x02013;sulfonylureas found that although there was no significant association with either cardiovascular mortality or all-cause mortality, there was a significant increase in the risk for a composite end point of cardiovascular hospitalization or mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Because many type 2 diabetic patients receive metformin and sulfonylurea in combination to improve their glycemic control, our findings that the combination did not cause adverse outcomes in this high cardiovascular risk group are of importance.</p><p>Despite the theoretical possibility that sulfonylureas, by closing ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels and hence reducing the protective effects of ischemic preconditioning, might exert a deleterious role on cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), our analysis found no detrimental association of sulfonylurea monotherapy compared with insulin. Conflicting data exist regarding cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes using sulfonylurea monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). University Group Diabetes Program study comparing insulin with placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) reported that tolbutamide was associated with higher cardiovascular mortality, whereas the UKPDS found no differences in the rates of myocardial infarction between patients treated with sulfonylurea compared with insulin. Whereas most concern has been in relation to older first-generation sulfonylureas, two large retrospective studies found that both first-generation and second-generation sulfonylurea use was associated with a significant excess risk of all-cause mortality compared with metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Our findings point to the notion of nonharmful effects of sulfonylureas on cardiovascular outcome.</p><p>The duration of diabetes previously has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Although it might be assumed that the groups receiving diet-only or metformin monotherapy had shorter duration of diabetes and, hence, lower probability of cardiovascular risk and mortality compared with insulin users, diabetes duration was not associated with either POE or all-cause mortality in our population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>BMI correlates robustly with ischemic heart disease in subjects with long-standing type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Caterson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) showed in the current study population (of overweight/obese subjects with preexisting CVD and/or type 2 diabetes) that modest weight loss is associated with lower POE and lower cardiovascular mortality over 4&#x02013;5 years. We therefore adjusted for the changes in BMI during follow-up and confirmed that metformin monotherapy and diet-only monotherapy were still associated with lower POE and all-cause mortality compared with insulin monotherapy.</p><p>Another important issue is the &#x0201c;severity&#x0201d; of diabetes associated with CVD in the separate treatment groups. Patients receiving insulin might be presumed to be at higher initial cardiovascular risk compared with those receiving diet-only or metformin-only treatment. Traditionally, severity of diabetes is classified according to the level of glycemic control measured by HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Andersson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) recently described, again in the current study population, that high baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> concentration was associated with increasing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risks. When we adjusted for changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub> during follow-up, the metformin monotherapy treatment group was still significantly associated with lower POE and all-cause mortality compared with insulin monotherapy. The diet-only treatment group was solely associated with lower POE after adjustment for HbA<sub>1c</sub> changes.</p><p>There is conflicting evidence regarding whether exogenous insulin and hyperinsulinemia in diabetes may exert adverse effects on CVD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Animal experiments indicate insulin to be atherogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Two large randomized studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) showed no macrovascular benefit from an intensive glucose control regimen that included insulin, and one suggested increase in all-cause and CVD mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). However, follow-up in the UKPDS 34 in subjects with type 2 diabetes in the intensive treatment group, which included insulin, showed a significant reduction in myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>This article is based on well-phenotyped patients studied with the rigorous standards of a cardiovascular outcome trial. The findings we report here, however, are based on post hoc associative analyses and are subject to confounding by indication that can be only partially accounted for by adjustment and use of propensity analyses. Unfortunately, we were not able to subdivide the sulfonylurea group into first-generation and second-generation classes, which differ in pharmacokinetics and in their cardiovascular risk profile in some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), but not all, studies.</p><p>We do not have information about hypoglycemic event rates, which have been proposed, but not confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), as an important risk for cardiovascular events. Furthermore, we did not have data regarding endogenous insulin production such as C-peptide concentrations. This would have been interesting because the roles of endogenous versus exogenous insulin production in CVD are as yet unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Thus, we cannot preclude that the findings may be reflective of other ongoing processes, rather than just of the method of treatment used to control blood glucose levels among those with endogenous insulin production.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that, compared with insulin monotherapy, treatment with metformin monotherapy was associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular events in obese type 2 patients with diabetes with known or increased risk of CVD. Furthermore, metformin monotherapy was associated with a lower incidence of all-cause mortality compared with insulin monotherapy. These findings are consistent with recent published studies. Providing glycemic control is adequate, our data reinforce the safety and benefit of metformin regarding cardiovascular risks. In addition, we found no evidence to support previous concerns with the use of sulfonylureas. In the absence of prospective, randomized, controlled trials in these diabetic individuals at high cardiovascular risk, our data provide important clinical information to inform treatment choices.</p></sec>
