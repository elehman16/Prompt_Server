Indeed, the case for a functional role of dietary silicon in humans (e.g. in optimal connective tissue health) may be best elucidated by a long-term, prospective intervention study but, in which case, a readily bioavailable and safe form of Si must be determined. Monomethylsilanetriol (MMST) has been an over-the-counter Si supplement of long-standing use throughout the world and especially in continental Europe (e.g. France). It does not contain nano-silica particles unlike some silicon supplements and, over which, safety concerns have been expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the European Safety Authority recently advised that insufficient data currently exist to justify the use of MMST as an oral supplement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>MMST is a monomeric, organosilicon molecule [Si(OH)<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>] that is stable in aqueous solution at high concentrations (~ 20 mM at room temperature; unpublished data) compared to its naturally occurring inorganic analogue (orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>). MMST is readily absorbed following ingestion and no adverse effects have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], although no formal studies on its safety have been undertaken. Moreover, whether cleavage of the Si-CH<sub>3</sub> bond occurs with bioconversion to the putative bioactive form of Si (i.e. Si(OH)<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> &#x02192; Si(OH)<sub>3</sub>OH) is not clear. In favour of this hypothesis is that MMST positively influences connective tissues, namely bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] in mammalian studies, in much the same way that dietary Si does [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and supplementation in rats leads to increased Si levels in the connective tissues (Jugdaohsingh <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished data). It has been proposed that biological cleavage of the Si-CH<sub>3</sub> bond in MMST should be possible, based upon clear evidence with other organosilicons <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The primary objective of this study, therefore, was to gain insight into the metabolism of MMST and its ability, or not, to contribute to the body pool of Si following sustained dosing at the maximum daily recommended dose of this product, in humans.</p><p>The &#x02018;body pool&#x02019; of Si is currently best assessed in fasting serum samples. Following ingestion, dietary and some supplemental forms of Si are relatively rapidly absorbed into the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and this is especially true for MMST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The majority is then rapidly excreted in urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], but a minority probably undergoes tissue loading and/or cellular metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and sustained low dose Si supplementation, with an inorganic source of Si, appears to lead to a marked rise in the body pool of Si, as reflected in fasting serum and urine Si concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Analysis of non-fasting serum levels, however, can lead to falsely high results as the measured Si may include not only that in equilibrium but also that recently absorbed and not yet lost from the circulation. Our previous studies show that serum Si levels fall to baseline 6 hours after ingestion of typical dietary doses of Si, suggesting that this, or later, is the optimum time point for measurement of fasting Si levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The actual time frame is both dose- and Si species dependent but for the rapidly absorbed MMST, at typical low doses (e.g. 3.5 mg Si three times per day against a usual dietary background of 20&#x02013;30 mg per day), post-absorptive clearance is very rapid (a few hours; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). To be extra careful, in this study, a minimum fasting time between last ingestion and blood or urine sampling of 10 hours was used. A secondary objective of this study was to investigate the safety of MMST supplementation in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-two healthy pre-menopausal females, aged between 22 and 38 years, with no history of serious illness and not taking any medication or silicon-containing food supplements, were recruited to the study by circular email from King&#x02019;s College London (UK) (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Volunteers were excluded who were pregnant and lactating, of child-bearing age and not taking contraception, or not able to follow the study protocol. Young women were chosen because Si supplementation is likely to be most relevant in this population since epidemiological data have shown a pronounced positive association between dietary Si intakes and bone mineral density in this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Indeed, it is hypothesised that estradiol is required for Si to have any biological effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The women were randomly assigned to coded Placebo or MMST (silicon supplement: 10.5 mg Si/day) for 4 weeks each, in a crossover design; i.e. 11 participants took placebo for four weeks followed by MMST for four weeks and the remaining 11 participants took MMST for four weeks followed by placebo for four weeks (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

All participants were supplemented with MMST (at the maximum daily recommended dose of 10.5 mg Si/d, which is equivalent to 40% of total average daily dietary Si intake in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]) and placebo, each for 4 weeks, but the order was randomised. All data analysis was completed and kept confidential by the authors prior to the codes being sent by the manufacturer.</p><p>Participants attended The Gastrointestinal Laboratory at St Thomas&#x02019; Hospital on three occasions at four-week intervals. They fasted from 10.30 pm on the night preceding each visit until 9:30 am when their blood and urine samples were collected. Participants were asked to empty their bladder upon waking or, if they had not done so, upon their arrival at The Gastrointestinal Laboratory. Blood and urine (second void) were collected and a quality-of-life questionnaire completed (complete details below). The age, height, weight and body mass index (BMI) of the participants were recorded during the first visit (week-0) and the subjects were randomised to receive 28 coded bottles of either the placebo or MMST supplement, i.e. one bottle per day for 28 days (4 weeks). The two solutions (MMST and placebo) were identical in appearance, colour, taste, odour and packaging. Participants were instructed to take 30 mL of either MMST (3.5 mg Si) or placebo three times a day before meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) during the next four weeks. To aid with compliance, a dosing cup was provided to each participant and all solutions were contained in 90 mL plastic bottles. At the second visit (week-4), participants were given 28 bottles of the opposite solution to that given at visit-1 and instructed to maintain the same dosing regimen until returning for the next visit (week-8).</p></sec><sec><title>Blood and urine collections</title><p>Twenty mL of blood was collected from a forearm vein of each fasted participant, and transferred for later analysis to: a) an EDTA tube; b) a fluoride (glucose) tube; c) two SST (biochemistry) tubes; and d) a Si- and anticoagulant-free polypropylene tube.

There appear to be two routes of bio-distribution for dietary silicon following its absorption: namely, rapid urinary excretion for the majority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and tissue loading and/or cellular metabolism for a minority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. As a result, sustained low dose silicon supplementation leads to a marked rise in the body pool of silicon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], presumably as the second, minor pathway is increasingly loaded. The biologically important target sites for dietary and supplemental silicon appear to be the connective tissues, such as blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], joints, skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and, especially, bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus the increase in fasting serum and urine Si concentrations following MMST supplementation must result from silicon that has entered the metabolic pool and not that which is destined for immediate urinary excretion following absorption. We were careful to avoid the latter by using fasting serum and urine samples following a minimum of a 10 h fast and previous data has shown this to be more than adequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This marked increase in the body pool of silicon supports the argument that MMST is an effective silicon supplement and also explains why this form of silicon has been shown to positively influence bone and blood vessels in mammalian studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] in much the same way that dietary silicon does [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Fasting serum Si levels in this study, before and after supplementation with MMST, were variable, but baseline levels were comparable to what we have previously observed for pre-menopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A few baseline samples were below the LOQ, but this is not unusual for this population and probably reflects either the ethnic diversity of the group with their different dietary Si exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and/or differences in circulating hormonal levels that could, in theory, impact upon serum and tissue Si levels, although further work is required to confirm this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Even with this variable Si baseline, MMST supplementation significantly increased fasting serum Si level above baseline. Whether this increase in serum Si level is beneficial is not known and was not the aim of this study. This would require a different study design with, probably, a longer period of supplementation. Conversely, the fact that fasting serum Si levels can be increased with Si supplementation could be interpreted to mean that normal dietary Si intake/exposure is sub-optimal but, again, the absence of any known Si deficiency state or symptoms makes this impossible to investigate directly. Nonetheless, as mentioned above, increased dietary Si intake is associated with increased bone mineral density at least in men and pre-menopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Importantly, we provide evidence for the conversion/metabolism of MMST to OSA; namely that organosilicon concentration in urine and serum accounted for only 10% and ca. 50% of the increase in total-Si in the fasting urine and serum samples, respectively. No previous data exist, specifically, for the conversion or metabolism of MMST to OSA. There are, however, data showing that methyl silanes per se (Si-CH<sub>3</sub>) are broken down/converted to silanols (Si-OH) in both the acid environment of the stomach and systemically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In designing the study, we considered how bioconversion of this proposed supplemental silicon [Si(OH)<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>] to OSA [Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>] could be demonstrated in humans. Stable isotopic labelling, with <sup>29</sup>Si, was discounted due to its relative high natural abundance (ca. 5% of all endogenous Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>) and the relative insensitivity of <sup>29</sup>Si by NMR. Experiments with <sup>32</sup>Si would not, these days, allow for administration to humans due to radioactive exposure and long half-life (170 years). Thus, we rationalised that if Si loading (i.e. increased fasting serum levels) is observed following sub-chronic ingestion of MMST in volunteers, as observed for absorbable dietary/supplemental silicon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], then quantitation for MMST (by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR) together with quantitative ICP-OES for the increase in total silicon, would allow for bio-conversion to be proven by &#x02018;balance&#x02019;. Moreover, <sup>1</sup>H-NMR would have detected the conversion of MMST to other organosilicons, although MMST is the smallest organosilicon molecule (building block) and its <italic>in vivo</italic> anabolism to form larger organosilicon species was neither anticipated nor seen.</p><p>Interestingly, and surprisingly, MMST was also detected in baseline urine samples and it is likely that this is due to exposure to other organosilicon compounds that are metabolised through this pathway (i.e. via MMST to OSA). Notably, silicones (e.g. dimethylpolysiloxane, E900) are added to foods such as juice and beer as an anti-foaming agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Finally, the serum biochemistry and quality of life data over the 4-week periods during which participants received MMST would suggest that this form of silicon is safe upon sustained dosing at supplemental levels (10.5 mg/day or less). This finding is in accordance with reported studies of MMST being administered orally and intravenously in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and with its long-standing use as a supplement without reported adverse events. Data in rats with the same and higher doses of MMST, over a longer (90 day) supplementation period, have also confirmed the safety of this material (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our data provide evidence for the metabolism and safety of MMST at supplemental levels.
