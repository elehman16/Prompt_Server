Some researchers argue that symptoms of deficient executive functioning (EF) are also involved in ADHD symptomology and consider ADHD a disorder of executive functioning dysregulation <xref rid="pone.0104175-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-Saylor1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. There are 2 ADHD dimensions believed to be important to executive functioning: the inattentive dimension (working memory, planning/problem-solving) and the hyperactive, impulsive dimension (behavioral inhibition, motor regulation) <xref rid="pone.0104175-Barkley1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. One group of researchers has grouped executive functioning into 6 clusters, all of which relate to core ADHD symptoms: activation (organizing tasks and materials, prioritizing and starting tasks, and estimating time); focus (sustaining focus, shifting focus to different tasks); effort (regulating alertness, sustaining effort, and processing speed); emotion (managing/controlling frustration and emotion); memory (utilizing working memory and accessing recall); and action (recognizing appropriate behavior in response to a situation, self-regulating action, and impulsivity) <xref rid="pone.0104175-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-Brown3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Executive functions become increasingly important as children mature and are expected to assume more responsibility for managing their behavior. Multiple studies have shown that children with ADHD are more likely to have executive function impairments that persist into adulthood <xref rid="pone.0104175-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, with neuropsychological studies consistently finding adults with ADHD to have impairments on measures of executive function <xref rid="pone.0104175-Faraone1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Deficits in any one aspect of executive functioning might contribute to impairment, some of which could be associated with ADHD <xref rid="pone.0104175-Barkley1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Response inhibition, working memory, and other executive functioning activities involve brain circuits that prioritize, integrate, and regulate other cognitive functions such as attention, motivation, and emotion. Many of these functions are controlled via regions of the brain that are known to have neurobiological differences in patients with ADHD compared to those without ADHD, and areas of the brain involved in executive function have neuronal projections that connect these different brain regions <xref rid="pone.0104175-Makris1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-Krain1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-DelCampo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-Arnsten1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The executive function areas of the brain and the circuits connecting them to the brainstem and other functional areas are heavily innervated with dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic neurons. Dysregulation in these neurotransmitter signaling systems is believed to be involved in the manifestation of ADHD <xref rid="pone.0104175-Makris1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-Stahl1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-Rogeness1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-Yudofsky1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Atomoxetine hydrochloride is a nonstimulant, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor approved in the US as a treatment for ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) <xref rid="pone.0104175-American1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

In these studies, the primary outcome measure was the Total ADHD Symptom Score, which is the sum of the Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscales of the investigator-rated Conners&#x02019; Adult Attention Rating Scale (CAARS). For the CAARS, each of the 18 items of the subscales corresponds to one of the 18 DSM-IV-TR symptoms for ADHD.</p><p>In a phase 4 study that focused on prospectively assessing the efficacy and safety of atomoxetine in young adults, atomoxetine was observed to reduce ADHD symptoms and improve quality of life in young adults compared with placebo <xref rid="pone.0104175-Durell1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

The BRIEF-A yields an overall score, the Global Executive Composite (GEC), which is a composite of 2 index scores: Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) and Metacognitive Index (MI). The BRI is comprised of 4 subscales (Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, and Self-Monitor) and the MI is comprised of 5 subscales (Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Task Monitor, and Organization of Materials). Patients rated behavior for each of the 75 items on a 3-point Likert scale (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;behavior is never observed to 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;behavior is often observed). GEC is a summary score that incorporates all of the clinical subscales of the BRIEF-A. Higher BRIEF-A scores indicate greater executive functioning impairment. Raw scores can be transformed (T-scores) based upon standardized population samples, with scores &#x02265;65 having been considered to be clinically significant <xref rid="pone.0104175-Isquith1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

Multiple studies have shown that there are size, structural, and signaling differences in several regions and structures in the brains of patients with ADHD compared with normal controls.

One area of focus for ADHD is the prefrontal cortex that is involved in attention and executive functioning; more specifically, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involved in inattention, the prefrontal motor cortex involved in hyperactivity, and the orbital frontal cortex involved in impulsivity <xref rid="pone.0104175-Stahl1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. An important function of catecholamines such as norepinephrine in these brain areas may be to facilitate or inhibit behavior <xref rid="pone.0104175-Makris1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-Rogeness1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-Yudofsky1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and medications that modulate this signaling may have effects on executive functioning <xref rid="pone.0104175-Arnsten2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

Thus, atomoxetine may affect executive functioning via its actions on norepinephrine levels in the central nervous system. Additionally, while atomoxetine is selective for norepinephrine transporters, microdialysis studies suggest that atomoxetine may selectively increase dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex, via the norepinephrine transporter or perhaps via a secondary signaling mechanism <xref rid="pone.0104175-Arnsten2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This could also play a role in signaling that affects executive function.</p><p>Interpretation of the currently presented BRIEF-A results should be tempered by the absence of neuropsychological assessments of executive function. However, neuropsychological tests have not been shown to reliably predict functional impairment in adult ADHD, while clinical ratings such as the BRIEF have been successful in this regard <xref rid="pone.0104175-Barkley2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-Barkley3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Moreover, Biederman and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0104175-Biederman1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> found only a modest overlap between psychometric and self-reported measures of executive function impairment among ADHD patients. Neuropsychological testing was largely found to identify patients with lower IQ and achievement testing, while behavioral questionnaire assessment chiefly identified patients with higher levels of ADHD symptoms, psychiatric comorbidity, and interpersonal deficits. As measured by the BRIEF-A at the end of 5 weeks and at the end of 12 weeks of treatment, atomoxetine treatment significantly improved executive functioning in young adults with ADHD compared with placebo. This is reflected in changes in the overall composite score, two index scores, and scores for seven of the nine BRIEF-A subscales (all but emotion control and organization). Over 90% of patients in this study had a GEC T-score &#x02265;60 which shows an impairment of greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean, suggesting an ADHD population with deficits in executive functioning. Additionally, results from the three validity scales built into the BRIEF-A suggest valid self-reporting when completing the BRIEF-A assessment and provide strength to the merit of the atomoxetine versus placebo results. These results demonstrate that atomoxetine reduces symptoms of ADHD believed to be associated with deficits in executive functioning in young adults compared with placebo. These results are also consistent with findings from another recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adults with ADHD, where atomoxetine was associated with significant improvement in executive function as measured by the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS), which measures executive functioning across 5 clusters of daily activity functioning <xref rid="pone.0104175-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Statistically significant differences in score mean change over a 6-month period were observed for BADDS total score and all 5 cluster scores.</p><p>Similar findings (score reductions across all BRIEF-A scales) to those presented here were observed in a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adult study evaluating the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (prodrug of dextroamphetamine) for executive function deficits in adults with ADHD as measured by the self-reported BRIEF-A <xref rid="pone.0104175-Adler2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Amphetamines are believed to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space <xref rid="pone.0104175-Vyvanse1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This could be a mechanism by which lisdexamfetamine dimesylate affected executive functioning. Other stimulant ADHD medications that affect norepinephrine and dopamine levels, such as methylphenidate, have also shown efficacy for improving deficits in some executive functioning categories but not others <xref rid="pone.0104175-Biederman2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-Biederman3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Additionally, some aspects of executive functioning in patients with neurocognitive deficits caused by diseases other than ADHD have been shown to improve with administration of stimulants <xref rid="pone.0104175-Morrow1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104175-Gehring1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Of note in the current study is that there were no statistically significant treatment group differences for the Shift (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.090), Organization of Materials (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.051), Initiate (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.051), and the Emotional Control (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.219) subscale scores, with <italic>p</italic>&#x02264;.05 denoting significance after Hochberg&#x02019;s p-value adjustment was used to control for potential multiplicity. Similar to this study, in the lisdexamfetamine study, the effect of lisdexamfetamine on BRIEF-A subscale scores was least pronounced for the emotional control score compared with any of the other subscale scores <xref rid="pone.0104175-Adler2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. This may indicate that emotional regulation may track separately from other executive function domains for ADHD patients. Low baseline scores for emotional control compared to the other index groups could have been a factor in the results for these studies. However, in comparison, in the atomoxetine study using the BADDS to assess executive functioning, the emotion domain had the lowest baseline BADDS cluster score and the lowest mean change from baseline score; but, in this case, the effect of atomoxetine on reducing the emotion cluster score was statistically significantly greater than placebo <xref rid="pone.0104175-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Potential limitations of the current results are that limited adjustments for multiple comparisons were made that included an overall gatekeeper analysis <xref rid="pone.0104175-Durell1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and use of Hochberg&#x02019;s p-value adjustment for analysis of BRIEF-A component scores. Although not commonly used in adult ADHD trials <xref rid="pone.0104175-Adler3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, there was an absence of formal informant ADHD ratings. There was also an overrepresentation of white participants relative to African Americans and Hispanics compared with the overall US demographics. Additionally, this study had a higher-than-expected drop out rate, which could have reduced the power of the study. The BRIEF-A assessments were only conducted at baseline, Week 5, and Week 12. For the BRIEF-A analyses, only those patients with both a baseline and post-baseline measurement were included. The drop-out rate and the large window before the first assessment accounts for the decrease in patient number between baseline demographics and the BRIEF-A analyses.</p><p>These data, combined with the fact that the BRIEF-A subscales cover 75 items within 9 nonoverlapping clinical scales measuring various aspects of executive functioning (inhibition, shifting, emotion, self-monitoring, initiation, memory, planning/organizing, monitoring, and organization), support the utility of the BRIEF-A scale in measuring responses to atomoxetine of young adults with ADHD. Moreover, these results provide evidence that executive functioning impairments exist beyond the core symptoms of ADHD noted as diagnostic criteria in the DSM-IV-TR. The BRIEF-A has advantages as a behavioral rather than neuropsychological assessment of executive functioning in that it relies on ratings of real-world life activities <xref rid="pone.0104175-Barkley3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Use of an executive function assessment such as the BRIEF-A may be an important tool for clinicians in diagnosing and monitoring ADHD symptomology relevant to patient real-world functioning outcomes and/or at least for managing a cognitive comorbidity often associated with ADHD <xref rid="pone.0104175-Biederman4" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0104175.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
