This study examined both adolescent and parent psychosocial outcomes while participating in a one - year multi-disciplinary family-based intervention: Curtin University&#x02019;s Activity, Food, and Attitudes Program (CAFAP).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Following a waitlist control period, the intervention was delivered to adolescent (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;56, ages 11&#x02013;16) and parent participants over 8&#x000a0;weeks, with one-year maintenance follow-up. Adolescent depression and quality of life, family functioning, and parent depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed at six time points: baseline and prior to intervention (e.g., waitlist control period), immediately following intervention, and at 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months post-intervention. Relationships between adolescent and parent psychosocial outcomes were assessed using Spearman correlations and changes in both adolescent and parent outcomes were assessed using linear mixed models. Changes in adolescent psychosocial outcomes were compared to changes in behavioural (physical activity and healthy eating) and physical (weight) outcomes using independent samples t-tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The majority of psychosocial outcomes were significantly correlated between adolescents and parents across the one-year follow-up. Adolescent depression, psychosocial and physical quality of life outcomes significantly improved before or following intervention and were maintained at 6-months or one-year follow-up. Parent symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were reduced during waitlist and primarily remained improved. Changes in adolescent psychosocial outcomes were shown to be partially associated with behavioural changes and independent of physical changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Adolescents in CAFAP improved psychosocial and physical quality of life and reversed the typical trajectory of depressive symptoms in adolescents who are obese during a one-year maintenance period.

Higher rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as poorer quality of life, have been identified as consequences of adolescent obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Whilst physical consequences of adolescent obesity tend to be observed in the long-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], psychosocial consequences of obesity such as depressive symptoms and quality of life, are believed to be more immediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In addition to compromised psychosocial states in adolescents who are obese, evidence suggests that parents of these adolescents also experience elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These poorer psychosocial states are likely to influence parents&#x02019; ability to provide optimal environments for promoting positive psychosocial outcomes and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviours for adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Further, poorer family functioning is positively associated with adolescents&#x02019; weight status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and more impaired psychosocial functioning in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore the psychosocial status of parents of adolescents who are obese may be an important factor when designing adolescent obesity interventions.</p><p>Best-practice recommendations suggest that treatment for adolescent obesity should be family-based and target behaviour change alongside psychosocial determinants in both adolescents and parents. Despite the evidence of psychosocial issues for parents of adolescents who are obese, intervention studies have primarily focused on adolescent behavioural and physical outcomes, with minimal attention to psychosocial outcomes in adolescents and their parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and no investigations of the associations between adolescent and parent psychosocial outcomes across pre- and post- intervention periods. In addition, despite the well-established need for a minimum of one-year follow-up to determine meaningful improvements following intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], few studies have explored the maintenance of changes following multi-disciplinary family-based interventions targeting adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Among these limited studies, promise has been shown in relation to improvements in global self-worth, well-being, self-concept, and body satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Depressive symptoms have however not been assessed and quality of life findings have been confounded by the inclusion of children (e.g. 8&#x02013;17 years of age) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], limited parental involvement (e.g., 2 sessions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and parent content delivered by a single health practitioner (e.g., dietician) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Curtin University&#x02019;s Activity, Food and Attitudes Program (CAFAP) was a community-centred family-based intervention delivered by teams of multi-disciplinary health professionals that targeted the promotion of healthy lifestyle behaviours within the context of enhancing adolescent and parent well-being. Evaluation of behavioural changes (physical activity, sedentary time, and healthy eating) showed small significant improvements immediately following the 8-week intervention and some of the changes were maintained up to one year, with non-significant reductions in physical outcomes (BMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The intervention also resulted in changes in perceived parental need-supportive behaviours and adolescent autonomous motivation to change behaviour (physical activity and healthy eating), with improvements in adolescent autonomous motivation partly mediated by improvements in adolescent health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The current analysis aimed to: 1) evaluate the relationship between adolescent and parent psychosocial outcomes, 2) examine psychosocial changes over the course of the intervention and 12-months follow-up, and 3) examine how adolescent psychosocial changes related to behavioural and physical changes. It was hypothesised that: 1) adolescent quality of life outcomes (psychosocial, physical, and health-related) would be negatively related to parent psychosocial outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress) and positively related to family functioning scores, with adolescent depressive symptoms showing an inverse relationship, 2) adolescent and parent psychosocial outcomes would improve with the intervention and improvements would remain across the one-year maintenance period, and 3) improvements in adolescent psychosocial outcomes (depressive symptoms and psychosocial and physical quality of life) would be related to improvements in adolescent behaviours (physical activity and healthy eating) and physical status (BMI).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was part of a larger waitlist controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] using a staggered cohort design to balance seasonal effects. This design controls for threats to internal and external validity while not unethically withholding a valid treatment from adolescents. Participants completed baseline assessments, were waitlisted for one school term (three months), and completed pre-intervention assessments in order to provide a within-participant control period. Post-intervention assessments were completed immediately after the intensive 8-week intervention and at 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months after intervention conclusion, totalling six assessment points. During the one-year maintenance period adolescents received tapered phone call and text message support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (No. 12611001187932), and approved by Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (HR105/2011). Informed consent was obtained from all adolescents and parents prior to commencing participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Adolescents and their parents were recruited through the health system, local schools, and the general community. Adolescents were eligible to participate if they were between 11 and 16&#x000a0;years of age, had greater than the 85th percentile on the Centers for Disease Control BMI-for-age growth charts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], passed screening conducted by a medical practitioner, were willing to attend the intervention and all assessments, and were not obese due to a medical condition or undergoing treatment for a psychological disorder.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Adolescent psychosocial outcomes</title><p>Depressive symptoms were measured using the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The 13-item scale is derived from the 34-item depression questionnaire (Moods and Feelings Questionnaire) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and assesses self-reported symptoms experienced in the preceding two weeks using a 3-point scale ranging from 0 (<italic>not true</italic>) to 2 (<italic>true</italic>), with higher scores reflecting more depressive symptoms. The SMFQ has high internal consistency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and has been validated in clinical and non-clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Quality of life was measured using the Paediatric Quality of Life &#x02013; Teen Report (PedsQL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The 23-item measure consists of generic core scales that encompass physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning. Adolescents indicated how much of a problem each item had been in the past month using a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (<italic>never a problem</italic>) to 4 (<italic>almost always a problem</italic>). Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a zero to 100 scale (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;100, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;75, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;50, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;25, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;0), so that higher scores indicate better quality of life. Scale scores are used to derive measures of psychosocial and physical quality of life, and are summed to provide an overall assessment of health-related quality of life. Changes in subscale scores are reported in the current study to align with assessment of the relationship to behavioural and physical changes. Changes in overall scores have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and are reported here in relation to parent psychosocial outcomes. The measure has been demonstrated to have good reliability and validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Parent psychosocial outcomes</title><p>The 21-item version of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] was used to measure parent symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Parents indicated the extent to which they had experienced each symptom in the past week using a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (<italic>does not apply to me</italic>) to 3 (<italic>applies to me most of the time</italic>), with higher scores indicating greater symptomatology. The DASS-21 has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure in non-clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Family functioning was assessed using the 12-item General Functioning scale of the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD-GF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Parents were asked to indicate their family&#x02019;s ability to respond to stressful events using a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 4 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>), with higher scores indicating more family dysfunction. The FAD-GF has been shown to have good reliability and validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intensive 8-week (two hour bi-weekly sessions) intervention was implemented in community settings (e.g., neighbourhood community centres) by locally recruited multi-disciplinary teams (physiotherapists/exercise physiologists, dieticians, and psychologists) across three waves in one rural and two metropolitan locations in Western Australia. CAFAP was based on self-determination theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and goal setting theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], with a focus on enhancing adolescents&#x02019; autonomous motivation for healthy lifestyle behaviours and parents&#x02019; autonomous motivation to support adolescents&#x02019; behaviour changes. Instructors and parents were trained in using need-supportive behaviours, and key messages focused on enjoyment of healthy lifestyle behaviours rather than weight loss. During the first hour of each session, adolescents participated in physical activity circuits led by physiotherapists/exercise physiologists instructors, while parents received education information (i.e., training in need-supportive behaviours and goal setting to support adolescents, understanding adolescence, parenting styles, and food budgeting) as well as opportunities for sharing experiences. The second hour was jointly attended by adolescents and parents, and included topics such as setting goals, nutrition principles, practical strategies for behaviour change, overcoming barriers and problem solving, and family cohesion. Additional details of the study&#x02019;s theoretical underpinnings, program rationale, and protocol have been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Histograms and q-q plots of dependent variables were examined for normality. Independent samples t-tests or ANOVAS were used to compare differences in baseline variables between waves, sites, and completers and those who dropped out either during the waitlist or maintenance period.</p><p>The relation of adolescent and parent psychosocial outcomes was assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients at baseline and across all time points. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station TX, USA).</p><p>To assess changes in psychosocial outcomes during the intervention, linear mixed models were used with an exchangeable correlation structure to compare outcomes immediately following the intensive 8-week intervention and at 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;month follow-up. Models included a random intercept for each participant to account for within-participant repeated measures. As the dependent variables deviated from normal distributions, sensitivity analyses using squared transformations of the health-related quality of life subscales and negative binomial regression for the SMFQ and DASS-21 were conducted. Residual plots were examined for appropriateness of the models and did not largely differ between alternate models. The magnitudes of trends were similar between alternative models, thus the linear regressions are presented for ease of interpretation. Standard errors were bootstrapped with 1,000 replications to adjust for slight deviations from normality.</p><p>Only participants who began the intervention (e.g., completed a minimum of two assessments) were included in the statistical models (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;56). Within the linear mixed model, non-biased estimates were calculated for the missing values using likelihood-based estimation which uses information from surrounding responses and the covariance structure which is an appropriate method in studies with high levels of drop-out and drop-out bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. For all participants across all time-points, the rate of missingness was 22% (see participant flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]). Additionally, sensitivity analyses with only those who completed the entire intervention and maintenance period were conducted to examine the robustness of the results.</p><p>A priori linear contrasts were used to compare mean point estimates at each assessment to point estimates at pre-intervention. Additionally, monthly rates of change were estimated for each assessment period to allow for adjustment in variations of time elapsed between assessment points. The rate of change during intervention (e.g., between pre-intervention and post-intervention) and maintenance periods (e.g., between post-intervention and 12-month follow-up) were compared to the rate of change during the waitlist control period (e.g., baseline to pre-intervention). No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons, rather 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals are presented for all parameter estimates and <italic>p</italic>-values included where appropriate.</p><p>To explore the extent to which changes in psychosocial outcomes were associated with changes in behavioural (moderate and vigorous physical activity and junk food intake) and physical (BMI) outcomes, participants were divided into tertiles based on their improvements in scores on the SMFQ and psychosocial and physical quality of life subscale scores, from pre- to post- intervention and from pre- to 12-months post-intervention. Independent samples t-tests were then used to compare differences in behavioural and physical changes between the top and bottom tertiles in psychosocial outcomes for both periods of change.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 68 adolescent/parent pairs participated in entry assessments, and 56 completed both entry and pre-intervention assessments and began the intervention (see for participant flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]). There were no differences in adolescent and parent variables at baseline among participants who dropped out during the waitlist period, maintenance period (i.e., grouped across 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months), and those involved for the duration of the study (all p values&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;.05).

Results revealed that adolescent and parent psychosocial outcomes were related throughout participation, improvements occurred prior to actual participation and were mainly maintained at one-year follow-up, and adolescent psychosocial outcomes were partially related to behavioural outcomes and fully independent of physical outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Relationship of adolescent and parent psychosocial outcomes</title><p>The study demonstrated significant associations in the predicted directions between adolescent and parent psychosocial outcomes, except for family functioning. Previous research indicates that psychosocial adjustment in youth seeking treatment is associated with parental psychological distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], yet no prior studies have reported on the association of adolescent and parent psychosocial outcomes for a minimum of one-year follow-up in a family-based healthy lifestyle intervention. The strength of association demonstrated between adolescent and parent psychosocial outcomes in the current study (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;.17 to .22) is similar, and even stronger in some instances, to relationships previously demonstrated between adolescent psychosocial outcomes and factors postulated to contribute to obesity (i.e., screen time, physical activity, healthy eating) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], suggesting that parent psychosocial outcomes may be just as significant, if not a more important variable, to consider in clinical practice.</p><p>The lack of association with family functioning scores was however surprising and may have been due to non-linear patterns of change sometimes demonstrated when navigating the implementation of new behaviours that challenge previous experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In contrast to parents&#x02019; potential challenges felt in implementing changes, adolescents may have still interpreted parental efforts as supportive. Despite differences in regard to family functioning, findings from the current study suggest parent psychosocial outcomes may be related to adolescents&#x02019; psychosocial outcomes with intervention participation and one-year follow-up. Although this relationship is likely to be bi-directional, due to high attrition it was not possible to examine the direction of the relationship. A key implication of the cross-sectional findings from the current study is that interventions targeting adolescents who are obese need to also address the psychosocial issues of their parents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Adolescent and parent psychosocial outcomes</title><p>Overall, participation in CAFAP was associated with a reversal in the trajectory of depressive symptoms previously demonstrated in adolescents who are overweight and obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. These findings add to the previously reported psychosocial benefits (e.g., self-esteem) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] demonstrated in the context of a family-based multi-disciplinary intervention, by extending psychosocial outcomes to include maintenance of reductions in depressive symptoms at one-year follow-up. Although this is the first study to report on depressive symptoms in this context, the magnitude of change in mean scores demonstrated in the current study were similar to those reported in previous interventions targeting adolescent obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p>It is interesting that depressive symptoms improved over the waitlist period, suggesting that changes may occur in adolescents&#x02019; psychological symptoms if they perceive impending availability of support. Fontaine et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] suggest that intervention outcomes may be influenced via placebo-related factors such as expectations of improvement, interaction with staff, and desires of improvement. Indeed, in psychotherapy settings where participant expectations have been extensively studied, researchers have noted the importance of considering the impact of expectations on participant outcomes following intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. A shift from enrolment (baseline) to intervention commencement (pre-intervention) may have restored participants&#x02019; hopes and positive expectations, and hence impacted on a reduction in symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Nevertheless, findings from the current study demonstrate the usefulness of participation in the intervention to maintain changes associated with potential expectations.</p><p>In addition to depressive symptoms, adolescent psychosocial and physical quality of life improved, and these changes were generally sustained up to 12-months post-intervention. The magnitude of changes in mean scores across intervention and maintenance periods were also consistent with the sparse literature available on sustained changes in quality of life outcomes in adolescents who are overweight and obese following participation in family-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, and surprisingly, significant reductions in parent depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were demonstrated during the waitlist period rather than following the intervention. It is possible that psychosocial outcomes for parents may have been linked with a sense of empowerment related to taking action and seeking support for managing their adolescents&#x02019; overweight issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Parents often feel judged by others and report experiencing a sense of guilt and shame regarding their adolescents&#x02019; overweight status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. It is interesting that parents&#x02019; likely perceptions of impending support was substantial enough to contribute to significant reductions in symptomatology during the waitlist period. However, changes in mean scores maintained over the one-year period are consistent with the magnitude shown for interventions promoting healthy lifestyle behaviours in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and suggests the importance of actual intervention participation.</p><p>The reductions in reported family functioning during the intervention suggest that family dynamics were likely evolving during these periods to reflect varying states of uncertainty experienced by adolescents and their parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. During the waitlist period adolescents and parents may have felt a sense of relief in relation to impending support leading to improved perception of family function. However once the intervention started, the realities of dealing with changing behaviours and challenges in parent-adolescent communication are likely to have highlighted family function difficulties. Previous investigations of parental expectations suggest that parents are likely to perceive intervention as resolutions to reducing current difficulties associated with their adolescents&#x02019; obesity and tend not to ascribe potential negative experience to implementing behaviour changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], which may predispose parents to experiencing a mismatch between expectations and reality. A positive aspect of the findings are that family function did not continue to deteriorate, but that providing a supportive environment for parents and adolescents enabled adaptive adjustments. Among the limited studies reporting on family functioning within the context of family-based interventions, outcomes have been mixed in both child and adolescent samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Findings from the current study suggest that previously reported inconsistencies in family functioning outcomes may be attributed to non-linear patterns of change overtime that reflect familial adjustment to changing dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Adolescent psychosocial, behaviour and physical outcomes</title><p>It was anticipated that changes in psychosocial outcomes would be associated with changes in behaviours and physical status, however only changes in psychosocial and physical quality of life were related to improvements in moderate to vigorous physical activity and reductions in junk food intake, respectively. Although evidence suggests a relationship between quality of life and behavioural outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], this relationship has not been previously investigated in a family-based multi-disciplinary intervention with minimum of one-year follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The mean improvement of 11.6&#x000a0;min in moderate to vigorous physical activity per day demonstrated between adolescents in the higher and lower tertiles of psychosocial quality of life is nearly double the amount typically demonstrated in previous intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In addition, a reduction of 4.5 junk food serves per day shown between adolescents in higher and lower tertitles of physical quality of life is greater than changes in similar measures of caloric intake shown in previous interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is possible that the association between psychosocial quality of life and moderate to vigorous physical activity is a response to adolescents engaging in physical activity with peers as a consequence of feeling more accepted. In comparison, personal perceptions of abilities to complete physical tasks may be a more salient factor in predicting one&#x02019;s choice to improve healthy eating behaviours. Both relationships highlight the clinical relevance of considering psychosocial changes in healthy lifestyle interventions. Given the paucity of studies exploring this relationship in the current intervention context, future research would do well to further explore changes in qualities of life in relation to behavioural outcomes.</p><p>The limited association between depressive symptoms and behaviour outcomes was surprising given prior evidence in support of a relationship between these variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. However, this is the first study to assess the relationship of these changes in adolescents following a multi-disciplinary intervention with one year follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. A possible explanation for the limited association between changes in depressive symptoms and behavioural and physical outcomes is that in comparison to adolescent depressive symptoms, qualities of life may be more sensitive to the small effect sizes in behavioural changes demonstrated in the current study. Future investigations should examine whether limited changes in depressive symptoms persists in the presence of larger effect sizes in behavioural outcomes.</p><p>The limited association demonstrated between psychosocial and physical outcomes suggests that adolescents may experience improvements in psychosocial outcomes independent of changes in physical outcomes. Such independence of outcomes has been previously observed in relation to quality of life and weight changes following multi-disciplinary interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], however, changes in depressive symptoms in relation to physical changes have not been previously explored in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Findings from the current study suggest that pathways in predicting psychosocial outcomes may differ from those predicting behavioural and physical outcomes. Future research should therefore examine mediation effects between psychosocial, behavioural, and physical changes of interventions. In the interim however, an implication from the current study is that interventions for adolescents who are obese should specifically target psychosocial outcomes in addition to behaviour and physical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This was the first study to examine the relationship between psychosocial outcomes of adolescents who are obese and their parents during participation in a family-based multi-disciplinary intervention, including one-year follow-up. While the ability to evaluate changes in psychosocial outcomes may have been weakened without a concurrent control group, the design was suited to the primary aim to explore the relationship between adolescent and parent outcomes, and the waitlist period with a double pre-test provided a within subject control comparison that&#x000a0;was used to explore changes during participation. Generalizability may be limited by the relatively homogenous sample in one state of Western Australia and sample size due to high attrition. The rates of attrition and magnitude of changes are however similar to those demonstrated in other adolescent interventions and sensitivity analyses confirmed no differences in outcomes for the total sample and those who completed the entire study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current study demonstrated a strong relationship between psychosocial outcomes in adolescents who are obese and their parents at both baseline and throughout participation in a family-based intervention that focused on the promotion of healthy lifestyle behaviours in a need-supportive context. Additionally, involvement in a family-based intervention positively impacted adolescents&#x02019; and parents&#x02019; psychosocial outcomes, and in some instances adolescent changes were related to changes in behaviour, but not physical status. The findings suggest interventions targeting adolescent obesity should: include parents and consider their psychosocial state, maximise the positive impact of families taking the initial action to engage with intervention, carefully support and manage family functioning during the change process by providing psychoeducation and normalising experiences, examine mediation in relation to psychosocial, physical and behavioural outcomes, and specifically target psychosocial outcomes independently of behaviour and physical outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by Healthway (grant number 19938).</p><sec id="FPar2"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AF collected the data and drafted the manuscript.
