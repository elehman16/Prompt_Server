All subjects performed squat exercises with the knees flexed to 30&#x000b0; and with the feet

performed with the non-paretic foot lifted than with the feet parallel to each other. The
activity of all muscles during the maintenance phase of the exercises was greater than
that during the downward and upward phases. [Conclusion] Lifting the non-paretic foot
during squats may represent an effective exercise for motor function rehabilitation in

associated with increased patient independence. Weight-bearing exercises, particularly
double-legged squats, can improve lower limb muscle strength. However, if hemiplegic
patients perform squats without supervision, the non-paretic leg tends to be used
predominantly, which leads to decreased muscle activity in the paretic leg, resulting in
asymmetry, learnt disuse of the paretic side<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and concomitant weakness. Therefore, a method to facilitate
quadriceps muscle activity on the paretic side during the double leg squat exercise is
required.</p><p>When performing sit-to-stand motions, muscle activity varies according to the initial
placement of the dominant foot in hemiplegic patients<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Laufer et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that lifting the non-paretic lower limb on a 10-cm-high step while standing
increased the proportion of body weight on the paretic limb by 20% compared to symmetrical
standing. Rocha et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that
asymmetry was reduced during the sit-to-stand motion when the non-paretic leg was
constrained by the inclusion of a &#x0201c;step-up&#x0201d; component. However, muscle activity did not
increase during the downward, maintenance, or upward phases of the squat exercise in
hemiplegic patients.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to characterize muscle activation during squats
involving parallel foot placement and lifting of the non-paretic foot in hemiplegic
patients. A secondary objective was to compare electromyographic (EMG) activity in the
quadriceps during the downward, maintenance, and upward phases of the squat exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 17 hemiplegic patients (9 males and 8 females) were recruited from the D Medical
Center, Busan, Republic of Korea. The mean age of the patients was 58.2 &#x000b1; 6.5&#x02005;years, and
their mean height and weight were 165.8 &#x000b1; 8.8&#x02005;cm and 66.1 &#x000b1; 8.8&#x02005;kg, respectively. Subjects
were eligible if they had a Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score of 35&#x02013;45, a Korean-Modified
Barthel Index (K-MBI) score of 60&#x02013;85, a Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score between 1 and 2,
and a Mini-Mental Status Examination-Korean version (MMSE-K) score &#x0003e;24. The mean BBS,
K-MBI, MAS, and MMSE-K scores of the patients were 41 &#x000b1; 3.4, 78.2 &#x000b1; 5.9, 1.5 &#x000b1; 0.5, and 29.4
&#x000b1; 1.1, respectively. Hemiplegic patients were recruited following their first unilateral
stroke, which was required to have occurred &#x0003e;6 months previously. The mean post-stroke
interval was 10.4 &#x000b1; 5.2 months. Prior to participation, all subjects read and signed an
informed consent form that was approved by the Institutional Research Review Committee of
the Inje University (Busan, Republic of Korea).</p><p>To acquire EMG signals, surface EMG data were recorded using a Trigno wireless EMG system
(Delsys, Inc., Boston, MA, USA). EMG data were collected from the rectus femoris (RF),
vastus medialis oblique (VMO), and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles on the paretic side. The
sampling rate and band-pass filter for the EMG signal were set at 1,000&#x02005;Hz and 20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz,
respectively. Data were analyzed using the EMGworks software package (ver. 4.0; Delsys,
Inc.). Root mean square values were calculated for all raw data. To normalize the data, the
reference voluntary contraction (RVC) was calculated for each muscle when subjects were in a
comfortable standing position<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Subjects performed the following two types of squat exercise: 1) parallel feet: feet
parallel, shoulder-width apart, with the toes pointing directly forward; and 2) foot
lifting: non-paretic foot lifted (normalized to 25% of the knee height). Subjects were
instructed to flex the knee joint to 30&#x000b0; while standing for 3&#x02005;s, until making contact with
the target bar. Following the maintenance of 30&#x000b0; knee flexion for 3&#x02005;s, the subjects returned
to the starting position over a 3-s interval. All test trials were repeated three times,
with a 1-min rest between trials to avoid fatigue. All EMG data are expressed as %RVC.</p><p>Significant differences between the downward, maintenance, and upward phases of the squat
exercise, and between the parallel feet and foot lifting conditions, were examined using a 3
&#x000d7; 2 repeated-measures analysis of variance. All data were analyzed using the SPSS for
Windows software package (ver. 18.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA); p &#x0003c; 0.05 was taken to
indicate statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>During the downward, maintenance, and upward phases of the squat exercise, RF, VMO, and VL
muscle activity was significantly greater with lifting of the foot than with the feet
parallel (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The activity of all three muscles increased significantly during the
maintenance versus the downward and upward phases (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Additionally, RF, VMO, and
VL muscle activity was significantly greater during the upward versus the downward phase of
the squat exercises (p &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

foot lifted. This may have important clinical implications for muscle strengthening in
hemiplegic patients.</p><p>Due to the presence of unilateral cerebral lesions, hemiplegic patients favor their
non-paretic limb during bilateral movements such as sit-to-stand, standing, and parallel
foot squats<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Strategies that selectively
constrain movement can increase loading of the affected limb by altering the unaffected foot
position during the sit-to-stand motion<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Brunt et al.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that in hemiplegic
patients, quadriceps activity in the paretic limb increased by 41% during foot lifting
versus normal sit-to-stand conditions. Squat and sit-to-stand movements may be similar in
terms of hip, knee, and ankle motion; the present results are in accordance with those of
our previous study, which involved sit-to-stand movement. Furthermore, squat exercises
performed with the non-paretic foot lifted might facilitate paretic limb use by inhibiting
the non-paretic limb. Therefore, we suggest that squats with the foot lifted allows for
greater activation of the quadriceps muscle on the paretic side.</p><p>The squat exercise involves both downward and upward body movements, during which flexion
and extension of the hip, knee, and ankle occur simultaneously<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hemiplegic patients exhibit greater deficits in force in paretic
muscles during concentric and isometric versus eccentric contractions<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our data indicate that quadriceps activity is greater
during the maintenance phase (i.e., isometric contraction) than during the upward phase of
the squat exercise. Foot lifting during the squat exercise could increase the effectiveness
of exercise programs aimed at restoring motor function in hemiplegic patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Taub</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Uswatte</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Mark</surname><given-names>VW</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The learned nonuse phenomenon: implications for
