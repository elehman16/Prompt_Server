Up to now, there is no clear consensus on which procedure should be applied in each respective case. Currently, laparoscopic gastric bypass (LRYGB) is regarded as the gold standard treatment, but this procedure is challenged by other procedures such as sleeve gastrectomy or single anastomosis gastric bypass, always expecting to find even more efficient but equally or even safer procedures.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Laparoscopic gastric banding temporarily gained popularity due to its easy application and the reversibility of this procedure. In the meantime, an increasing number of trials have shown the considerable drawbacks of this procedure (low grade of efficiency combined with poor quality of life and a high reoperation rate), and this intervention has more or less been abandoned in Europe.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>In LRYGB, the stomach is divided into a small upper pouch and a larger gastric remnant, and the small intestine is rearranged in a way that, in the final state, from the small gastric pouch the ingested food enters the jejunum (alimentary limb) directly and is not exposed to digestive liquids until it reaches the entero-enterostomy (&#x0201c;Y intersection&#x0201d;) at about 150&#x0200a;cm, where the biliopancreatic limb (excluded gastric remnant plus duodenum, and approximately 50&#x0200a;cm of proximal jejunum) is reconnected and the remaining small intestine forms the common channel. This rearrangement of the small intestine bears the risk of a typical complication &#x0201c;the internal hernia,&#x0201d; where the small bowel becomes trapped and obstructed; a condition that usually requires reoperation and can potentially have fatal consequences if not recognized and treated adequately. Internal hernia can occur many years after the original operation and is found in 1% to 11% of LRYGB patients.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>In laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) a large portion of the stomach along the greater curvature is removed resulting in a &#x0201c;sleeve&#x0201d;-like tube; however, no rearrangement of the small bowel is performed. Hence, this particular complication is not found after LSG (a clear argument in its favor); however, efficiency in remission of comorbidities is still a matter of debate.</p><p>Other potential advantages of LSG are that the procedure seems technically easier than LRYGB, shows lower early morbidity and lower prevalence of dumping symptoms. However, the LSG procedure is irreversible as the larger portion of the stomach is removed, whereas LRYGB is (at least to some extent) reversible. Furthermore, long-term outcome results after LSG are still scarce. A few randomized-controlled studies have compared outcome of LRYGB versus LSG, unfortunately with only a small number of patients or short follow-up.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Up to now there is no clear evidence showing that 1 of these 2 procedures is superior to the other in long-term outcome.</p><p>The Swiss Multicentre Bypass Or Sleeve Study (SM-BOSS) is the first, prospective randomized trial comparing outcomes of LSG to LRYGB with an adequate number of patients and a nearly complete follow-up rate of 97% after 3 years.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The rationale, design, and methods of this study have been reported previously.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the local ethical committees of each participating hospital and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the trial was registered at the clinical trials registry of the National Institutes of Health (NCT 00356213). To summarize, the trial was a 2-group, randomized, controlled, multicenter study involving 217 morbidly obese patients, in which the outcomes of LSG were compared to those of LRYGB. Four bariatric centers in Switzerland participated in this trial, each with at least 10 years of bariatric experience and at least 200 bariatric procedures performed per year. Only surgeons with a personal experience of at least 400 bariatric interventions participated in this trial. On a regular basis research meetings were held, to enhance adherence to the protocol and guarantee high data quality.</p><p>Patients were assigned to either the LSG or LRYGB group, using a computer-based randomization with sealed envelopes. Eligibility criteria included an age of 18 to 65 years, a body mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) &#x0003e;40 or &#x0003e;35&#x0200a;kg/m<sup>2</sup> with the presence of at least 1 comorbidity, and failure of conservative treatment over 2 years. Exclusion criteria were: symptomatic gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) despite medication (severe GERD), large hiatal hernia (para-esophageal hernia or axial hernia &#x0003e;4&#x0200a;cm), expected dense adhesions at the level of the small bowel, the need for endoscopic follow-up of the duodenum, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. All patients gave written informed consent.</p><p>This investigator-initiated trial was financially supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF grants 32003B-120020 and 320030-138439) and Ethicon Endo Surgery USA.

LSG: for calibration of the gastric tube, a 35-Fr bougie along the lesser curvature was used and the longitudinal resection of the stomach was done from approximately 3 to 6&#x0200a;cm orally of the pylorus to the angle of His. The staple line was oversewn with an absorbable running suture. Hiatal hernias were explored and repaired with posterior closure of the crura. LRYGB was performed with a 50-cm long biliopancreatic limb and a 150-cm antecolic Roux-limb using either a linear stapled or circular stapled (25-mm) gastrojejunostomy. To guarantee standardization of the 2 procedures, prior to inclusion of the first patient, all participating surgeons were invited to an instruction session by the principal investigator (RP), where the standardized operation techniques were demonstrated.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>To detect a 10% difference in EBMIL between the 2 procedures, we calculated a study size of 200 patients to reach 94% power at 5 years.

Of the 225 patients who underwent randomization from January 2007 through November 2011, a total of 8 patients were excluded after randomization; 1 patient crossed over from the LRYGB to the LSG group because of unexpected dense adhesions of the jejunum, which were detected intraoperatively, and 7 patients were operated on after November 2011 when the recruitment phase was closed. This resulted in a total of 217 patients who were included in the study and assigned to either the LSG or LRYGB group. After 3 years, 6 patients were lost to follow-up: in the LRYGB group 1 patient died within 30 days, another died due to lymphoma 2.5 years postop, 2 patients moved away; in the LSG group, 2 patients moved away.

After 3 years, in the LSG group, 61% experienced remission, 5% symptoms improved; in 15% symptoms were unchanged and in 20% worsened.</p><p>In the LRYGB group, 78% experienced remission, in 14% symptoms improved; in 6% symptoms were unchanged and in 2% worsened. At 3 years, the difference in remission rate between the groups did not reach significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.09), but worsening of symptoms was more often seen in the LSG group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In addition, of the 66 LSG patients with no GERD at baseline, 18% developed de novo GERD symptoms whereas this was only seen in 2% of LRYGB patients (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Quality of Life</title><p>The mean GIQLI score (GIQLI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index) and BAROS quality of life (QoL) (BAROS&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System) increased significantly in both groups after 1 year compared with baseline. Assessment of GIQLI score and BAROS QoL at 2 and 3 years demonstrates that patients experience a significant and sustainable improvement in quality of life compared with baseline with a slight decrease between years 2 and 3.

In the LSG group, there were 2 patients converted to bypass due to severe GERD, 4 patients needed cholecystectomy due to newly developed, symptomatic gallstones, 2 patients suffered from insufficient weight loss (1 conversion into laparoscopic bilio-pancreatic diversion duodenal switch and 1 to LRYGB), and 1 patient had an umbilical hernia repair. In the LRYGB group 6 patients required cholecystectomy, 2 had a small bowel obstruction, 3 patients were treated for internal hernia by laparoscopy, in 1 patient a Fobi-ring was inserted to increase weight loss by adding restriction.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In addition, 1 patient had an umbilical hernia repair, 1 patient underwent laparoscopy for gastroduodenoscopy, in 1 patient abdominal lavage had to be carried out due to an infectious early complication, and 1 patient had a resection of a Meckel diverticulum. In the 3-year follow-up there was no patient in either group with extreme weight loss (BMI &#x02264;18&#x0200a;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or hypoalbuminemia and no life-threatening complications or deaths associated with the intervention occurred. No statistically significant difference in complications treated conservatively such as peptic ulcer, stricture, kidney stones, and micronutrient deficiencies between the 2 groups was found (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study explored whether LSG compared with the current gold standard in bariatric surgery, laparoscopic gastric bypass (LRYGB) is equally effective in: 1) weight loss, 2) remission of comorbidities, 3) increase in quality of life, and 4) whether the 2 procedures are equally safe in long-term outcome.</p><p>Both procedures were highly effective in terms of weight loss with an excessive BMI loss at 3 years of 70.9% in the LSG group and 73.8% in the LRYGB group. The weight loss nadir was between 1 and 2 years postop with a discrete weight regain thereafter. LRYGB showed a nonsignificant better weight loss at each time point that is in line with most previously published series and meta-analyses.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>Differences in the amelioration of glycemic control in patients with T2DM between the 2 procedures are still controversially discussed. According to some study groups, LRYGB shows superiority to LSG in T2DM remission.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Other groups found the opposite and even describe superiority of LSG in diabetes remission.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> However, only a few, prospective randomized-controlled studies have compared outcome of LRYGB versus LSG, unfortunately with either only a small number of patients or short follow-up.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The STAMPEDE trial is doubtless the most important trial so far, comparing best medical treatment versus LSG and LRYGB with 50 diabetic patients in each arm over a period of 3 years.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Regarding HbA1c &#x0003c;6.0% the 2 surgical arms were clearly superior to the conservative arm, but no statistically significant difference between the 2 surgical groups was found. In contrast, other endpoints (HbA1C &#x0003c;7% without medications, insulin dependency, and number of medications used) showed superiority of LRYGB over LSG.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In our trial, no statistically significant difference in resolution of T2DM and amelioration of glycemic control could be shown, which is in line with a recently published trial by Yang et al.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, it should be noted that the SM-BOSS trial is not powered enough for this end-point.</p><p>Remission rates of other comorbidities showed equal effects, with the exception of GERD and dyslipidemia. Patients with severe, preexisting GERD (symptomatic GERD despite PPI medication) and big hiatal hernia (para-esophageal hernia or axial hernia &#x0003e;4&#x0200a;cm) were not included in the study, as in this case a LRYGB is clearly superior to LSG. Nevertheless, many morbidly obese suffer from intermittent reflux, which can exacerbate after LSG. Preexisting reflux was more efficiently treated with LRYGB and significantly more patients suffered from new onset reflux in the LSG group. In most cases, GERD could be treated conservatively with PPIs. However, in 2 patients, pharmaceutical treatment was insufficient and LSG had to be converted to LRYGB to treat refractory severe GERD. Dyslipidemia improved in both groups; however, decrease in total cholesterol and LDL was more pronounced in the LRYGB group compared with LSG and remission rate for dyslipidemia was higher in LRYGB compared with LSG. Quality of life improved significantly in both groups after surgery at 1 year compared with baseline, and remained stable up to 3 years postsurgery. There was no difference observed between the 2 groups, despite the difference seen in GERD. There was no statistically significant difference in complications within the first 3 years postop.</p><p>The rate of reoperations in the LRYGB group was slightly higher, but not statistically significant, which might probably be due to insufficient power for this secondary endpoint.</p><p>In the present study, we found no difference in vitamin deficiencies between the 2 groups, which is in contradiction to a previously conducted retrospective analysis, where we found a lower deficiency rate following LSG.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Both groups had a rather high rate of deficiencies despite regular vitamin supplementation in all patients. The very high follow-up rate (97%) with regular laboratory investigations may explain the high prevalence. No severe malnutrition was observed. These results demonstrate the need for life-long vitamin supplementation and monitoring of deficiencies following LSG and LRYGB.</p><p>As a limitation of this study we would like to mention that the design of the study was powered at 5 years for the primary endpoint (weight loss) and is underpowered for T2DM remission (with only 26 vs. 28 diabetic patients in each treatment arm) and reoperation rate (with 9 vs. 16 reoperations in each arm). The results discussed are part of an interim analysis. Up-to-date SM-BOSS is the largest randomized controlled trial comparing LSG to LRYGB with a nearly complete follow-up rate at 3 years.</p><p>In conclusion, in this trial, LSG and LRYGB were equally efficient regarding weight loss, quality of life, and complications up to 3 years postsurgery. Improvement of comorbidities was similar except for GERD and dyslipidemia that appear to be more successfully treated by LRYGB. In our opinion, patients with preexisting symptomatic gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) despite medication, or patients successfully treated with PPIs but refusing long-term acid-inhibitory medication, large hiatal hernia (para-esophageal hernia or axial hernia &#x0003e;4&#x0200a;cm), and severe gastroesophageal motility disorders are better treated with a LRYGB procedure. Concerning dyslipidemia, no conclusions can be drawn at this moment. However, LRYGB might be a better choice in patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors such as history of cardio-vascular event, smoking, arterial hypertension, or inherited predisposition for cardio-vascular disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank contributing clinicians Beatrice Kern, MD; Martina Gebhart, MD; Marc Slawik, MD; Dino Kr&#x000f6;ll, MD; Martin Thurnheer, MD; as well as Sandra Gagliardo &#x00026; Philipp Hendrickson for data management and Helen Thurston for proof reading.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This investigator-initiated trial was financially supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF grants 32003B-120020 and 320030-138439) and Ethicon Endo Surgery USA.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Finucane</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name><name><surname>Cowan</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
