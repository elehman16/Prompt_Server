taping (KT) on the static body alignment and overall balance function presented by the
coordinate and foot balance in stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-eight stroke
subjects were randomly allocated into the study groups. The kinematic analysis measured
deviation or changes from standard body alignment and foot pressure by the human
anatomy-based coordinates were examined using the Shisei Innovation System PA200 ver.9.0.
[Results] The glabellas on the front view, larynx on the front view, rt. greater tubercle
of the humerus (vertical changes), lt. greater tubercle of the humerus (vertical changes),
posterior superior iliac spine, and greater trochanter (horizontal changes) showed
statistically significant decreases, indicating dislocation from the axis center, after
taping. [Conclusion] The clinical use of KT for stroke patients who have asymmetrical and
imbalanced body posture could be an optimal therapeutic approach. Since more evidence
based practices are needed, future studies should include large numbers of subjects and
examine diverse KT application patterns.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Kinesio taping</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Postural balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke eventually induces various clinical symptoms and other severe complications, causing
many casualties<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among many types of medical conditions introduced by stroke, lack
of body balance, as well as abnormal muscle tone and reflexes may lead to gait
disturbances<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Body alignment and foot
balance are crucial factors of the intervention of stroke patients because patients have
trouble sustaining their body structure as a result of weakened muscle tone that leads to a
gradual disuse of the affected side and even the whole body<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Diverse therapeutic approaches have been attempted to treat the balancing ability of stroke
patients that focused on re-arranging the center of gravity and other aspects of body
balance or foot pressure or even compare findings with healthy adults&#x02019; performance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Kinesio taping (KT) technique is one of the most renowned clinical intervention methods
that has been widely applied for many years to help to correct body balance and gait
training<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In accordance with the findings of Kase et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, KT helps maintain lymph absorption, blood circulation, and
even joint fixation. One recent study reported that the KT application with intended tension
could reduce pain as well as improve range of motion (ROM) and proprioception<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite these advantages of KT and in the
same sense, healthy adults or athletes received the same effect<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Few clinical trials have used direct and strict measures
for stroke patients who struggled with weak body balance and gait function. It is important
that we precisely assess the effect of therapeutic applications after the intervention. The
Shisei Innovation System recently been acclaimed for its ability to assess body postural
alignment and foot pressure (static and dynamic) and is more accurate measurement system
than other methods.</p><p>Accordingly, the main focus of this study was to conduct a kinematic analysis of body
alignment and foot pressure using KT as an intervention for patients after stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 38 subjects diagnosed with stroke by medical doctors specializing in
rehabilitative medicine participated in this study. The patients, all of whom were from
across Korea, even Jeju Island, were hospitalized in the rehabilitation center in Ulsan
city. Patients who were diagnosed with stroke, did not have any skin problems, and completed
the informed consent form by themselves were included in the study. The exclusion criteria
were: previous experience with KT; use of foot orthoses; and inability to walk 10&#x02005;m. We
ultimately included 18 males (mean age, 55.0&#x02005;years; range, 49&#x02013;68&#x02005;years) and 20 females (mean
age, 57.0&#x02005;years; range, 50&#x02013;69&#x02005;years); stroke types included 13 hemorrhagic and 25
infarction; and duration of onset (month) was within 6 months for every subject. After the
patients were measured by Shisei Innovation System PA200 ver. 9.0, they were randomized to
treatment groups using drawing lots. In the first group, patients were first subjected to KT
application and then underwent body alignment and foot pressure analysis by the Shisei
Innovation System. Afterward, the subjects underwent the same procedure without KT. In the
second groups, the patients were subjected to the same procedures in the opposite order. The
KT tension was set at 55% (available tension is 100%) using 20&#x02005;cm &#x000d7; 5&#x02005;cm strips of Kinesio
Tape KT 545 (Visiocare s.r.l., Vedano al Lambro, Monza-Brianza, Italy) applied to the
extensor digitorum longus, surface of the cuneiform, 2&#x02013;5 toes, tibial plateau, peroneus
longus, and fibula head<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The kinematic analyses of postural alignment and foot pressure were performed using Shisei
Innovation System PA200 ver. 9.0 software. The changes in displacement from the center
standard line (also known as the center of the axis) on the coordinates and distribution
degrees of foot pressure were calculated. Foot pressure was divided into right/left and
front/backward portions. Smaller differences between each measurement point from the
standard line indicate better therapeutic results, and a smaller disparity in pressure
indicates that the subjects have good balance. Single markers were attached to the right
ankle of the front view, left ankle of the front view, right apex patella of the front view,
left apex patella of the front view, right anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) of the front
view, left ASIS of the front view, navel of the front view, right greater tubercle of the
humerus of the front view, left greater tubercle of the humerus of the front view, larynx of
the front view, glabellas of the front view, left posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) of
the back view, right PSIS of the back view, seventh cervical vertebra of the back view,
lateral condyle of the tibia of the right side view, grater trochanter of the right side
view, ASIS of the right side view, PSIS of the right side view, greater tubercle of the
humerus of the right side view, seventh cervical vertebra of the right side view, ear hole
of the right side view, lateral condyle of the tibia of the left side view, greater
trochanter of the left side view, ASIS of the left side view, PSIS of the left side view,
greater tubercle of the humerus of the left side view, seventh cervical vertebra of the left
side view, and ear hole of the left side view of all the subjects.</p><p>All of the subjects agreed to participate in the study, provided written informed consent,
and received a sufficient explanation prior to participating in accordance with the ethical
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Every process was examined by the hospital
director.</p><p>The data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 20. The subjects&#x02019; general
characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics, while the paired t-test was used
to compare the pre- and post-KT intervention differences. The level of statistical
significance was set at 0.05 for all of the analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The differences in the digitalized kinematic analysis of the fixed postural alignment are

other etiologies, and KT techniques have been broadly used for their treatment<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are various approaches to intervention for decreased balance
and posture controls such as physical training, general gait, and balance trainings, but in
the field of mechanisms of many interventions, therapeutic methods gradually shifted to
novel methods like virtual reality<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Such methods are usually conducted with mostly computer game-based activities<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, these kinds of clinical
practices would still be controversial among professionals due to difficult brain encoding,
which may not sufficiently substitute conventional therapies<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, KT results showed only glabellas of the front view, larynx of the front
view, rt. greater tubercle of the humerus (vertical changes), lt. greater tubercle of the
humerus (vertical changes), PSIS, and greater trochanter (horizontal changes). The numerical
data were automatically extracted from the center of the axis, while measured deviations or
changes in standard body alignment and foot pressure by the human anatomy-based coordinates
were examined by Shisei Innovation System PA200 ver. 9.0. Therefore, the lower score means
improved function. All of the other indicators presented clinically positive tendencies
except for vertical changes of the tibial lateral condyle.</p><p>The KT approach has already been conducted through numerous studies and presented filed
data. Related to this study, one published report showed that this therapeutic approach may
support balance and neuromuscular functions<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, and its instant effect is considered important in the clinical
stting<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to a recent study,
enhancing active ROM is also a crucial coverage provision<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study presented
ASIS-PSIS angles as 11.3 &#x000b1; 4.3<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, which
indicated results that were quite different from those of our study (63.10 &#x000b1; 10.68). We
assumed that the stroke patients would showed unlike appearances or clinical aspects versus
healthy or other invalid subjects. Thus, the main focus of this study is that its results
were derived from a digitalized kinematic analysis for treating stroke patients and
determining effects of KT in the field of balance and body. We intend to determine KT
feasibility using more precise assessments.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, it was not a fully randomized controlled trial
and its sample size was small. There remains a lack of evidence comparing conventional
therapy and KT for correcting balance or posture, so further studies including greater
numbers of subjects are strongly recommended to verify the final results of this report
since KT is already broadly used.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Smithard</surname><given-names>DG</given-names></name><name><surname>Smeeton</surname><given-names>NC</given-names></name><name><surname>Wolfe</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Long-term outcome after stroke: does dysphagia
