To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated a low&#x02013;saturated fatty acid (SFA) (&#x0003c;7% calories) diet that contains lean beef.</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> We studied the effect on LDL cholesterol of cholesterol-lowering diets with varying amounts of lean beef [ie, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH): 28 g beef/d; Beef in an Optimal Lean Diet (BOLD): 113 g beef/d; and Beef in an Optimal Lean Diet plus additional protein (BOLD+): 153 g beef/d] compared with that of a healthy American diet (HAD).</p><p><bold>Design:</bold> Thirty-six hypercholesterolemic participants (with LDL-cholesterol concentrations &#x0003e;2.8 mmol/L) were randomly assigned to consume each of the 4 diets (HAD: 33% total fat, 12% SFA, 17% protein, and 20 g beef/d), DASH (27% total fat, 6% SFA, 18% protein, and 28 g beef/d), BOLD (28% total fat, 6% SFA, 19% protein, and 113 g beef/d), and BOLD+ (28% total fat, 6% SFA, 27% protein, and 153 g beef/d) for 5 wk.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> There was a decrease in total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol concentrations (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) after consumption of the DASH (&#x02212;0.49 &#x000b1; 0.11 and &#x02212;0.37 &#x000b1; 0.09 mmol/L, respectively), BOLD (&#x02212;0.48 &#x000b1; 0.10 and &#x02212;0.35 &#x000b1; 0.9 mmol/L, respectively), and BOLD+ (&#x02212;0.50 &#x000b1; 0.10 and &#x02212;0.345 &#x000b1; 0.09 mmol/L, respectively) diets compared with after consumption of the HAD (&#x02212;0.22 &#x000b1; 0.10 and &#x02212;0.14 &#x000b1; 0.10 mmol/L, respectively). Apolipoprotein A-I, C-III, and C-III bound to apolipoprotein A1 particles decreased after BOLD and BOLD+ diets compared with after the HAD, and there was a greater decrease in apolipoprotein B after consumption of the BOLD+ diet than after consumption of the HAD (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 for both). LDL cholesterol and TC decreased after consumption of the DASH, BOLD, and BOLD+ diets when the baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration was &#x0003c;1 mg/L; LDL cholesterol and TC decreased when baseline CRP concentration was &#x0003e;1 mg/L with the BOLD and BOLD+ diets.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Low-SFA, heart-healthy dietary patterns that contain lean beef elicit favorable effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) lipid and lipoprotein risk factors that are comparable to those elicited by a DASH dietary pattern. These results, in conjunction with the beneficial effects on apolipoprotein CVD risk factors after consumption of the BOLD and BOLD+ diets, which were greater with the BOLD+ diet, provide support for including lean beef in a heart-healthy dietary pattern.

A dietary pattern that emphasizes fruit and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds is recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Skim and reduced-fat dairy products, moderate amounts of lean-protein sources, including meats, poultry, and eggs, and increased seafood (particularly fatty fish), as well as plant-based proteins also are recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). It is not necessary to exclude lean beef, and the Adult Treatment Panel III Guidelines and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans indicate that lean red meat can be included in a heart-healthy dietary pattern that is low in SFA and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Beef is a popular food and a source of many nutrients, and, consequently, lean beef can be an important lean-protein food source to meet current food-based and nutrient recommendations.</p><p>Epidemiologic studies have reported mixed associations between red-meat consumption and CVD mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). A recent report from the Nurses&#x02019; Health Study showed that the replacement of one serving of unprocessed red meat with poultry or fish was associated with 19% and 24% reductions in coronary heart disease risk, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Some of the discrepancies in the literature may reflect not differentiating higher-fat red meat from lean red meat (specifically beef) or not accounting for different meat processing and cooking methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) because some epidemiologic studies have not shown this association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), especially when SFA was controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) or when only red, and not processed, meat was included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>Previous free-living and controlled-consumption studies reported comparable LDL cholesterol&#x02013;lowering effects of a National Cholesterol Education Program Step I diet (total fat &#x0003c;30% and SFA &#x0003c;10% energy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) with lean beef or lean white meat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). To our knowledge, no studies have examined the effects of an SFA-restricted (&#x0003c;7% calories), heart-healthy diet with lean beef. Red meat is limited in the DASH diet as a strategy to decrease SFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>The cholesterol-lowering effects of a low-SFA diet with lean beef have not been rigorously evaluated. Thus, we conducted a well-controlled consumption study to evaluate the LDL cholesterol&#x02013;lowering effects of a DASH-like diet that contained lean beef (BOLD diet: 28% total fat, 6% SFA, 54% carbohydrates, 19% protein, and 113 g beef/d, and a moderate protein diet that contained lean beef (BOLD+: 28% total fat, 6% SFA, 45% carbohydrates, 27% protein, and 153 g beef/d) compared with a healthy American control diet in individuals with elevated LDL-cholesterol concentrations. A DASH diet was included because it is the gold standard for contemporary dietary recommendations. Because Erlinger et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) showed that moderate elevations in CRP concentrations attenuated lipid-lowering responses to diet, we also examined this relation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy men and women (30&#x02013;65 y of age) with elevated LDL-cholesterol concentrations (2.84&#x02013;4.55 mmol/L) were recruited. Additional inclusion criteria were as follows: BMI (in kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of 18.5&#x02013;37, triglycerides concentration &#x0003c;3.95 mmol/L, and blood pressure &#x0003c;140/90 mm Hg. Participants were allowed to take prescribed blood pressure&#x02013;lowering medications and were eligible as long as their blood pressure was below the entry criteria. All participants were nonsmokers and free of established CVD, stroke, diabetes, liver, kidney, or autoimmune disease. Exclusion criteria included the use of cholesterol and lipid-lowering medications or supplements (psyllium, fish oil, soy lecithin, and phytoestrogens), pregnancy or lactation, weight loss &#x02265;10% of body weight within the 6 mo before enrollment in the study, and vegetarianism. The Institutional Review Board at the Pennsylvania State University approved the experimental protocol, and all subjects provided written informed consent.

Subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment (diet) order; they consumed 4 diets (HAD and DASH, BOLD, and BOLD+ diets) for 5 wk each. A short compliance break (average of 1 wk) separated the diet periods. At the beginning of the study and at the end of each diet period, on 2 consecutive days, subjects completed a series of clinical and physical assessments (ie, blood draw, height, and weight measurements) at the General Clinical Research Center. The first participants began the study in September 2007; the last participant completed the study in March 2009.</p></sec><sec><title>Diets</title><p>The nutrient composition of experimental diets is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. Total energy was held constant for each participant throughout the 4-diet periods, and participants were monitored (daily weigh-ins) to ensure they remained weight stable. The 3 experimental diets (DASH, BOLD, and BOLD+ diets) contained similar amounts of total fat, SFA, PUFA, and cholesterol. The HAD was higher in total fat, SFA, MUFA, PUFA, and cholesterol and was lower in total fiber. BOLD and DASH diets were matched for macronutrient composition. The BOLD+ diet was higher in protein (27% of total energy) compared with the HAD (17%), DASH (18%), and BOLD (19%) diets and, thus, lower in carbohydrates (45% compared with 50&#x02013;55%) (<xref

In the current study, the BOLD and DASH diets decreased the LDL-cholesterol concentration by &#x02212;0.41 mmol/L compared with similar decreases, compared with baseline, of &#x02212;0.34 mg/dL and &#x02212;0.30 mmol/L in the DASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) and OmniHeart (carbohydrate diet) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) trials, respectively. In addition, the decrease in the LDL-cholesterol concentration for the BOLD+ and OmniHeart protein diets was similar at &#x02212;0.42 mg/dL and &#x02212;0.36 mmol/L, respectively. Decreases in LDL-cholesterol concentrations observed for the BOLD and BOLD+ diets were achieved with protein sources that differed from those used in the DASH (0.5 servings of beef, pork, or ham/d, and OmniHeart (0.9 servings of beef, pork, or ham/d studies. However, SFA concentrations were similar in the DASH, OmniHeart, and BOLD study diets (7%, 6%, and 6% of total calories, respectively). HDL cholesterol decreased during the DASH (1.2 mmol/L), BOLD (1.2 mmol/L), and BOLD+ (1.2 mmol/L) diets compared with during the HAD (1.3 mmol/L); these decreases were due to differences in total and saturated fat between diets (total fat: 33% compared with 28%; SFA: 12% compared with 6%). Thus, the protein source [with the exception of soy protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>)] does not appear to modify the TC or LDL cholesterol response to a cholesterol-lowering diet.</p><p>The LDL-cholesterol decreases we observed extend the findings of studies conducted by Davidson et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) and Hunninghake et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) with free-living subjects who were instructed to substitute lean beef for chicken, fish, or pork in a National Cholesterol Education Program Step I diet (&#x0003c;30% total fat, &#x0003c;10% SFA, and &#x0003c;300 mg cholesterol/d). Subjects who consumed the BOLD diet experienced a greater decrease in TC (&#x02212;9.3%) and LDL cholesterol (&#x02212;10.1%) (compared with consumption of the HAD) from baseline than reported by Davidson et al (&#x02212;1.0% and &#x02212;1.7% respectively) and Hunninghake et al (&#x02212;0.9% and &#x02212;1.9%, respectively). These differences most likely were due to the lower SFA intake after consumption of the BOLD diet (6% SFA). In a controlled-consumption study conducted by Beauchesen-Rondeau et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) to evaluate the substitution of lean beef compared with chicken or white fish, the decrease in LDL cholesterol (&#x02212;7.0%) was not as great as that (&#x02212;10.1%) with the BOLD diet. Again, this result may reflect differences in the SFA content of the experimental diets (10% compared with 6%) compared with the control diets between studies [BOLD study: 6% compared with 12%; Beauchesen-Rondeau et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>): 10% compared with 12%]. Despite the greater magnitude of the LDL-cholesterol decrease in our study than in some previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), a key consistent finding (from our study and in the literature) is the equivalent decreases in LDL cholesterol with lean beef than with white meat when macronutrient profiles of diets are similar.</p><p>Compared with the HAD, the BOLD+ diet was the only treatment diet that significantly decreased apolipoprotein B. Compared with the HAD, both lean-beef diets significantly decreased apolipoprotein A1 and total apolipoprotein C-III. Smit et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), by using NHANES (phase 1) data, reported that the highest quartile of apolipoprotein B was associated with the highest intakes of beef. However, SFA was highly correlated with the protein source, which, thus, prevented conclusions from being drawn on the basis of individual predictors (ie, beef or SFA). Our results concurred with the apolipoprotein B findings from the OmniHeart trial in which the moderate protein diet yielded the greatest decrease in apolipoprotein B. Mensink et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) reported that an isocaloric substitution (1% of energy) of carbohydrates for MUFA and PUFA but not SFA decreased apolipoprotein B; however, isocaloric substitution of protein for carbohydrate also decreases apolipoprotein B; the extent of this effect has yet to be fully quantified.</p><p>Changes in total apolipoprotein C-III on lean-beef diets reflected decreases in apolipoprotein C-III HS, which represents the number of apolipoprotein C-III molecules bound to apolipoprotein A1&#x02013;containing particles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Kawakami and Yoshida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) have suggested that apolipoprotein C-III bound to HDL inhibits the antiinflammatory properties of HDL. Although total apolipoprotein A1 was decreased in the BOLD and BOLD+ diets, the decrease in apolipoprotein C-III bound to apolipoprotein A1&#x02013;containing particles suggested that the antiinflammatory capacity of the apolipoprotein A1&#x02013;containing particles was improved.</p><p>Baseline CRP concentrations appeared to influence TC and LDL cholesterol responses of subjects to the experimental diets. The link between inflammation and lipid and lipoprotein changes has been known for several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>); however, the mechanism by which CRP modulates these responses is unknown. Previous studies have reported a blunted TC- and LDL cholesterol&#x02013;lowering response to DASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) and Step I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) diets in individuals with increased baseline CRP. However, we observed a different effect in the high-CRP group for diets that contained lean beef. We observed a greater decrease in TC (compared with in the DASH diet) and LDL cholesterol (compared with zero) with consumption of BOLD and BOLD+ diets in subjects with high CRP concentrations. In subjects with high CRP, the BOLD and BOLD+ diets significantly decreased concentrations of TC (&#x02212;0.53 and &#x02212;0.54 mmol/L, respectively) and LDL cholesterol (&#x02212;0.38 and &#x02212;0.39 mmol/L respectively) similarly. The mechanisms that account for these different diet responses in subjects with high compared with low CRP are not clear. Additional studies are needed to determine whether diets that contain lean beef benefit individuals with high CRP to achieve a substantial cholesterol-lowering diet response.</p><p>The BOLD study has several strengths. We conducted a tightly controlled clinical study and achieved high levels of dietary adherence as verified by the daily monitoring forms. To our knowledge, the BOLD study is first study to examine the effects of increased lean-beef consumption in the context of current dietary recommendations. Finally, our study population was representative of a large portion of the US population [LDL-cholesterol concentrations in approximately the 35th percentile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>)], and thus, the findings have broad applicability. A limitation of our study was that we had only self-reported compliance measures and no biological measures of adherence to the lean beef and other test diets. In addition, we used a controlled-consumption study design and lean beef was preselected for, prepared for, and consumed by participants. In a free-living setting, individuals would be required to select lean cuts of beef from a wide variety of options in the marketplace and be mindful of preparation techniques and portion control. Although there are 29 cuts of beef that meet lean beef criteria, many grocery stores would feature the following cuts: top loin and top round steaks, top sirloin bottom round roast, and 95% lean ground beef. Adhering to the BOLD and BOLD+ diets that we prepared might be challenging for consumers, at least initially, and therefore, decreases in LDL-cholesterol concentrations would be less than expected. It is important for consumers to be mindful of the types of cut, preparation techniques, and portion control. For many individuals, this can be challenging, which would lessen the expected LDL cholesterol&#x02013;lowering response.</p><p>In conclusion, the inclusion of lean beef (113 g/d) or the partial replacement of carbohydrates with protein (including lean beef) in a low-SFA, DASH-like diet significantly decreased TC and LDL cholesterol compared with in a HAD. These reductions were similar in magnitude to those observed for the DASH diet. The specific effects of the moderate protein, BOLD+ diet on apolipoprotein B and C-III merit additional study. These effects could reflect the increased lean-beef, total protein, or reduced carbohydrate content of the BOLD+ diet; additional research is needed to determine the role of each of these components in the BOLD+ diet on CVD risk. The results of the BOLD study provide convincing evidence that lean beef can be included in a heart-healthy diet that meets current dietary recommendations and reduces CVD risk.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank our research participant for their participation and commitment to the study.
