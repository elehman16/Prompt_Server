A training based on the stage-of-change model for smoking cessation and motivational interviewing was introduced to pharmacists. Pharmacists were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The control group attended a 3-hour training session, whereas the intervention group also attended a further 6-hour training session. At week 24, 12.2&#x02009;percent of the smokers quit smoking in the intervention group, whereas 1.6&#x02009;percent of the smokers quit smoking in the control group. The findings of this study showed that training pharmacists, in the stage-of-change model for smoking cessation and motivational interviewing, improves smoking reduction and cessation rates.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adults</kwd><kwd>clinical health psychology</kwd><kwd>community health psychology</kwd><kwd>health promotion</kwd><kwd>nicotine dependence</kwd><kwd>public health psychology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>July-December 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2055102917736429"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cigarette smoking is the single most important cause of avoidable premature mortality in the world, and quitting is known to rapidly reduce the risk of serious diseases (<xref rid="bibr29-2055102917736429" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (WHO), 2008</xref>).

Community pharmacies have increased the accessibility of smoking cessation treatments such as &#x0201c;over-the-counter&#x0201d; (OTC) nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). In a preliminary study focused on experiences of customers in a community pharmacy setting (<xref rid="bibr22-2055102917736429" ref-type="bibr">Sinclair et al., 1995</xref>), three-quarters of NRT users interviewed recalled having received some counseling from the pharmacist and/or the pharmacy assistant, and almost all of these customers felt that the counseling was helpful. However, more than a quarter did not recall receiving any counseling, and most of these customers reported they would have valued some smoking cessation counseling from a pharmacist.</p><p>Most pharmacists are eager to undertake a leading role in health promotion (<xref rid="bibr1-2055102917736429" ref-type="bibr">Bond et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bibr18-2055102917736429" ref-type="bibr">Mertinez et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-2055102917736429" ref-type="bibr">National Audit Office, 1992</xref>).

In the context of cigarette addiction, the stage-of-change model proposes &#x0201c;stage-matched interventions&#x0201d; to treat cigarette addiction. It is hypothesized that smokers progress linearly through the five stages and may relapse to earlier stages. Each stage is characterized by the presence of divergent beliefs and attitudes toward smoking behavior. This model may assist in determining the type and range of interventions required by pharmacy personnel and tailoring interventions to the smoker&#x02019;s current stage which may increase their likelihood of quitting (<xref rid="bibr7-2055102917736429" ref-type="bibr">Di Clemente, 2001</xref>).</p><p>MI is widely used to help smokers quit. It is a patient-centered counseling approach for helping people to explore and resolve their ambivalence about changing their smoking behavior. Evidence suggests that MI by general practitioners and trained counselors motivates patients toward change (<xref rid="bibr19-2055102917736429" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Rollnick, 2013</xref>). There is also evidence that MI may be more efficacious relative to other treatments with smokers who are low in motivation to quit (<xref rid="bibr12-2055102917736429" ref-type="bibr">Hettema and Hendricks, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Customers seeking help with smoking cessation from pharmacy personnel are already beyond the &#x0201c;precontemplation&#x0201d; stage of the stage-of-change model. Rather, these customers are people who have reached the &#x0201c;contemplation&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;preparation&#x0201d; stage and may be intending to purchase a smoking cessation aid. For smokers who decide to stop smoking, pharmacotherapy increases the chances of success (<xref rid="bibr10-2055102917736429" ref-type="bibr">Fiore et al., 2008</xref>). An understanding of the theory and practice of the stage-of-change model and MI could result in more effective counseling, by pairing the appropriate cessation advice to the stage of each customer and helping them resolve their ambivalences toward change. Well-designed smoking cessation training for pharmacists is needed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study designed to assess the outcome of training pharmacists in the stage-of-change model of smoking cessation and MI.</p><p>We hypothesized that pharmacists who participated in a training based on the stage-of-change model and MI would be more effective than untrained controls to help people quit smoking and that many of their customers would achieve long-term abstinence from smoking. Hence, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the training on smoking cessation outcomes. The training included specific content and recommendations pertaining to preparation, action, maintenance, and relapse.</p><p>The focus of the training was to help participants develop an understanding of the key principles of the stage-of-change model and MI approach. Participants learned a series of brief questioning to assess the stages of change of their customers. Strategies to match the stage to the most appropriate intervention to promote cessation were emphasized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-2055102917736429"><title>Methods</title><p>A training based on the stage-of-change model of smoking cessation (<xref rid="bibr7-2055102917736429" ref-type="bibr">Di Clemente, 2001</xref>) and MI (<xref rid="bibr19-2055102917736429" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Rollnick, 2013</xref>) was conducted in February 2016, by the Centro per la Prevenzione e Cura del Tabagismo at the University of Catania. The training was previously piloted on a cross section of pharmacy personnel.

These guidelines align with the principles of MI and the stage-of-change model. Training for pharmacists in Italy does not include smoking cessation. Therefore, it was critical to expose participants to these internationally accepted evidence-based practice guidelines for tobacco dependence.</p><p>Successively, pharmacies were randomly allocated, by sequential allocation, to the intervention or control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2055102917736429">Figure 1</xref>).

Pharmacy personnel offered these customers a patient information sheet specific to their group (intervention or control) informing them that Farmacia OK pharmacists were working with researchers studying smoking cessation at the University of Catania and inviting them to join the study. Specifically, in the intervention group, smokers were informed that their pharmacists were trained to specific anti-smoking counseling based on stage-of-change and MI theories. In the control group, smokers were informed that their pharmacists recently attended a conference on &#x0201c;Clinical Practice Guidelines for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence.&#x0201d;</p><p>Pharmacy staff maintained a confidential client record which documented their progress in smoking cessation, any product supplied, points raised by the client, and advice given. At each of the planned follow-up visits, telephone call reminders were carried out to improve participation. However, customers were not made aware of their group allocation (intervention vs control pharmacy). To monitor the level of non-recruitment, pharmacies in both groups maintained a tally record of customers who declined to join the study and their reasons. Intervention personnel offered their customers the professional anti-smoking counseling. The control group asked customers to register and then continued to provide standard professional support.</p><p>The main outcome measures were number of treated smokers, smoking reduction at week 24, and smoking cessation rates at week 24, in accordance with Russell Standard (Clinical) (<xref rid="bibr28-2055102917736429" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 2005</xref>). Validation was covered by measuring exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO). Participants who self-reported quit smoking with an eCO concentration of &#x02264;10&#x02009;ppm at the week 24 follow-up visit were defined as quitters (21). Those smokers who failed to meet these criteria (smoking abstinence and eCO &#x02264;10&#x02009;ppm) were categorized as smoking cessation failures (i.e. relapsers with eCO &#x02265;10&#x02009;ppm). Smokers setting a firm quit date was counted as &#x0201c;lost to follow-up&#x0201d; if, on attempting to determine and verify his or her quitter status, he or she could not be contacted. Success rates were measured as the 24-week (24WQ) success rate (<xref rid="bibr28-2055102917736429" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 2005</xref>).

Research strongly suggests that pharmacist-led tobacco cessation interventions in community settings are effective. Our study showed higher effectiveness of pharmacists trained in stage-of-change model on smoking cessation and MI to help smokers quit smoking compared to control group. Because of its design, there are a number of limitations that must be considered when interpreting the findings of this study (e.g. the small sample size). Some characteristics of the sample limit generalization of the findings; all participants were regular smokers with an elevated level of nicotine dependence (&#x02265;10 cigarettes per day), they were motivated to quit, and all participants were adults and customers of &#x0201c;Farmacia OK group.&#x0201d; Finally, the findings reported from urban Sicilian residents in this study may not be valid for other population samples. Nonetheless, our study indicated that training pharmacists in the stage-of-change model of smoking cessation and MI in a smoking cessation program is an inexpensive strategy that can be quite effective for smokers.
