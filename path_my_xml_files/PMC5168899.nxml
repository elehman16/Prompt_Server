Since then significant developments have occured including a better understanding regarding pain perception in neonates and advances in techniques of general anaesthesia, regional anaesthesia (RA) and perioperative pain management.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>By far the most commonly used RA technique in paediatric practice is the caudal epidural block. It is the easiest block to perform and to teach, with extensive safety record in children. However, it has the disadvantage of short duration of action after single injection.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Prolongation of single-shot caudal block has been achieved by the addition of various adjuvants such as opioids, ketamine, adrenaline and &#x003b1;2 agonists, but their utility has been challenged by unacceptable adverse effects in children.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid hormone with powerful anti-inflammatory as well as analgesic property. Its administration through epidural route has been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of post-operative pain in adults[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and improved morbidity such as nausea, vomiting, fever and delayed oral intake, in children.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Systemic administration of steroids suppresses tissue levels of bradykinin and the release of neuropeptides from nerve endings; it also inhibits synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2 in peripheral tissues and in the central nervous system resulting in a reduction in prostaglandin production which contribute to enhanced nociception in inflamed tissue.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Dexamethasone administration through intravenous (IV) route along with caudal block has been shown to significantly reduce severity of pain and rescue analgesic requirement in the post-operative period.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The present study was aimed at comparing the effects of dexamethasone on the duration of first rescue analgesia when administered through IV or caudal route.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The present prospective randomised double-blinded study was conducted after getting approval from hospital's ethical committee and informed/written parental consent. A total of 105 American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II children, aged between 4 and 10 years, undergoing inguinal herniotomy were enrolled. Exclusion criteria exercised were children with contraindications to the caudal block such as allergy to local anaesthetic (LA) agents, coagulation disorders, pre-existing neurological disease, spine abnormalities or any infection at the local site.</p><p>During pre-operative visit, patient's age, weight and baseline vital parameters were recorded. Detailed history, general physical and systemic examinations were done. Routine laboratory investigations including haemoglobin level were carried out for all patients. All patients were kept fasting as per institutional protocol (2 h for clear liquid and 6 h for semi-solid and solid). Parents were taught to perform their role in the study and the use of visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain assessment.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Computer randomisation with allocation concealment (sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes method) was carried out and all children were evenly assigned into three groups of equal numbers. A person not participating in the study kept the table of random numbers and prepared all medications. According to the weight, the volume to be injected was prepared in 1 mL syringes marked as IV test and caudal test.</p><p>On arrival of the patient to the operating room, all standard monitors were attached, and baseline heart rate [HR], mean arterial pressure (MAP) and oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] were recorded by an investigator who was unaware of the group allocation. All patients were induced with sevoflurane 8% in oxygen and air (50/50) with spontaneous ventilation and IV line was secured with appropriate size cannula (22 and 24 gauge) and Ringer's lactate was started at the rate of 4 ml/kg/h. All the patients were premedicated with IV atropine 0.01 mg/Kg, IV midazolam 0.05 mg/Kg and IV fentanyl 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg. An appropriate sized classic Laryngeal mask airway (cLMA) was inserted, and after insertion, sevoflurane concentration was reduced to 3% with fresh gas flow of 3&#x02013;4 L/min. All the patients were placed in left lateral decubitus position, and under aseptic precautions, single-dose caudal block was performed using a 23-gauge short-bevelled hypodermic needle according to the group assigned.</p><p>Patients in Group I received caudal ropivacaine 0.15% (1.5 ml/kg) (ropivacaine hydrochloride ampoule, 0.75%, one ml diluted in 5 ml distilled water) along with caudal normal saline (NS) 0.025 ml/kg and NS 0.125 ml/kg, IV. Patients in group II received caudal ropivacaine 0.15% (1.5 ml/kg) with caudal dexamethasone 0.1 mg/Kg (0.025 ml/kg) and IV NS 0.125 ml/kg. Patients in Group III received caudal ropivacaine 0.15% (1.5 mL/kg) along with caudal NS 0.025 ml/kg and IV dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg (maximum 10mg) (dexamethasone sodium phosphate vial 4mg/ml).</p><p>All the blocks were performed by the same anaesthesiologist throughout the study. The time of caudal block was recorded, and the surgery was allowed to start 10 min after caudal injection. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen and air (50:50), and its concentration was adjusted to achieve haemodynamic changes within 20% of baseline value. No other, sedatives, and anti-emetics were used intraoperatively. Sevoflurane was discontinued at the beginning of skin closure, and during emergence from anaesthesia, LMA was removed, and the patient was transported to the post-anaesthesia care unit.</p><p>Vital parameters were recorded every 5 min till 30 min and every 15 min till the end of surgery. The maximum concentration of sevoflurane used was also recorded. Post-operative monitoring including vitals and pain (using VAS score) was recorded every hour till 3 h, every 3 h till 12 h and thereafter every 6 h till 24 h.</p><p>The primary outcome of this study i.e., the meantime to first rescue analgesic (time interval between a caudal block to the recording of VAS score &#x02265;4) was recorded[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Rescue analgesia was provided with IV paracetamol (15 mg/kg). Secondary outcomes such as total doses of rescue analgesic and adverse effects such as post-operative nausea and vomiting, respiratory depression (fall in SpO<sub>2</sub> of &#x0003c;92% requiring supplementary O<sub>2</sub>), urinary retention, hypotension (fall in the blood pressure &#x0003e;20% of the baseline value) and bradycardia (HR below 60 beats/min) were looked for and recorded. Incidence of bladder catheterisation, the initiation of clear liquid and time to discharge from hospital were also recorded.</p><p>We calculated that 35 patients in each group would be needed to detect an intergroup difference in the mean time to first rescue analgesic of at least 20% (&#x003b1; = 0.05, &#x003af; = 0.2) based on previous study[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] demonstrating mean (standard deviation [SD]) time of 554.5 (114.6) min to first rescue analgesia in children who received caudal analgesia using 1.5 ml/kg of ropivacaine 0.15%. Based on the above study we assumed a prolongation of duration of analgesia by 20% using ropivacaine 0.15% 1.5ml/kg along with dexamethasone as an adjuvant, whose effect is to be assessed separately for caudal and IV route Summary data were tabulated and analysed using SPSS IBM software version 21 (IBM SPSS Advanced Statistics; Chicago, IL, USA). Results of the quantitative variables were represented as median (95% of confidence interval) or mean (SD), and results of categorical measurements were presented in numbers or ratio. Unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test and analysis of variance using Bonferroni multiple comparisons&#x02019; test were applied for comparing quantitative data, and Chi-square test was applied for qualitative data. Time to first analgesic administration was analysed by Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival analysis and log-rank test.

Our study results are in line with this, in which we demonstrated that the addition of dexamethasone through caudal or IV route could significantly prolong the mean time to first rescue analgesic with the significant advantage of caudal over IV route in children undergoing inguinal hernia repair.</p><p>Various literatures support the analgesic effects of dexamethasone when administered as an adjuvant to RA for post-operative pain in adults and children.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Even the systemic administration of steroids has to be effective for reducing post-operative pain, but the results are inconclusive.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>As for all additives in RA, the true question is to compare the potential local effects to a systemic administration, particularly when additives were used off-label. Lack of control group with IV dexamethasone did not allow researcher of previous studies to comment on the potential local effect of dexamethasone. Hence, to study the local effects of dexamethasone as a caudal adjuvant in detail, we included group with IV dexamethasone.</p><p>Hong JY <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] demonstrated that a single dose of i.v. dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) in combination with a larger volume (1.5 ml kg) of diluted ropivacaine 0.15% prolongs analgesic duration, reduces postoperative pain, decreases rescue analgesic requirements compared with a caudal block alone. Similarly Yousef GT <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found that addition of either magnesium sulphate (50mg) or dexamethasone (0.1mg/kg) to 0.15% caudal ropivacaine significantly prolonged the duration of analgesia with reduced analgesic consumption. Based on the above studies we used 0.15% ropivacaine along with dexamethasone IV (0.5mg/kg) or caudal route (0.1mg/kg) according to group allocation.</p><p>The mechanism of the analgesia induced by corticosteroids is not fully understood. However, this effect is suspected to be mediated by their anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Adjuvants such as epinephrine produce prolongation of RA by its vasoconstrictive property, but this is not responsible for block prolongation by dexamethasone because of its relatively rapid effect.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Corticosteroids may have a local effect on the nerve, and the dexamethasone effect may be related to this action. Some authors believe that analgesic properties of corticosteroids are the result of their systemic effect.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>The antiemetic property of dexamethasone is well known through direct central action at the tract nucleus, interaction with the neurotransmitter serotonin and receptor proteins tachykinin NK1 and NK2, alpha-adrenaline, etc.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Results of our studies are in line with this, we found that the incidence of nausea/vomiting was comparatively low in group receiving dexamethasone 8.6% (3/35) than control group 31.4% (11/35). It is advisable to use, therefore, prophylactic antiemetics to all patients administered caudal epidural with local anaesthetics alone. Other studies[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found no difference in the incidence of nausea and vomiting when dexamethasone was used as an adjuvant to caudal block.</p><p>Adverse effects with a single dose of dexamethasone are probably extremely rare and minor in nature, and previous studies[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] have demonstrated that short-term use of dexamethasone was safe.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Similarly, in our studies, there were no incidences of systemic complications such as hypotension, bradycardia and urinary retention or local complications such as neurotoxicity, respiratory depression and pruritus, postoperatively when dexamethasone was given intravenously or caudally along with ropivacaine.</p><p>In children with limited understanding and communication skills, reliable assessment of pain is challenging and assessments made by their parents are often used as a proxy measure. The paediatric pain assessment tools are based on either self-report or observation of behaviour. Self-report is the only truly direct measure of pain, and hence it is considered the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; of measurement. We used visual analogue scale (VAS) for assessing the post-operative pain because of its ease to perform and simplicity to teach parents and nurses; in addition, all observer-rated scales, except the simple VAS, are likely to require raters to be trained in their use. Although pain cannot be necessarily quantified based on parents&#x02019; report as VAS is subject to bias, there is a lack of sufficient literature to prove this pitfall and hence VAS was preferred.</p><p>The main limitation of our study is that motor block could not be evaluated as it is unlikely at the 0.15% concentration of ropivacaine we used. Although we used VAS as a pain assessment tool, the use of Faces Pain Scale-Revised would have been more appropriate. Moreover, we looked for immediate local complications of dexamethasone, but the delayed local complications could not be ruled out.</p><p>Several studies tried to investigate the analgesic effect of dexamethasone as an adjuvant to RA.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In line with this, our study is able to demonstrate the use of dexamethasone either caudally or intravenously as an adjuvant to caudal block could be a superior alternative to LA alone. Although dexamethasone is a safe drug with minimum side effects,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] there is a need for further multicentric RCT to confirm the findings of our study. So that dexamethasone can become adjuvant of choice in paediatric caudal block.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We conclude that the addition of dexamethasone either caudally or intravenously as an adjuvant to caudal 0.15% ropivacaine may significantly prolong the mean time to first rescue analgesic with the significant advantage of caudal over IV route in children undergoing inguinal hernia repair. In addition to this, dexamethasone can be considered as a safe adjuvant to caudal block with no potential side effects.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Motoyama</surname><given-names>EK</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name></person-group><source>Special characteristics of paediatric anaesthesia.
