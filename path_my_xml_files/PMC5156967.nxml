It has been reported that 60% of neonates and 80% of preterm infants are with jaundice in the first week of life[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] which, if untreated, can cause acute and chronic encephalopathy in high levels of bilirubin.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In the 1950s, phototherapy was introduced as a noninvasive method for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and in 1985, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development reported that phototherapy is effective as blood transfusions in preventing neurological complications of hyperbilirubinemia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Although phototherapy is used widely as a noninvasive method for treatment of infants with hyperbilirubinemia,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] it is associated with such complications as fever, dehydration, loose stools, erythematous rash, damage to retinal cells, and changes in blood flow to mesenteric.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Hypocalcemia is one of the complications which have been recently considered, and phototherapy-induced hypocalcemia has been approved in various studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Under normal acid and base conditions and also in conditions where serum albumin is normal, total serum calcium level and its ionization are exactly related, and exact status of disorders related to calcium can be obtained by measurement of total calcium. Normal levels of calcium in a premature infant can range from 8 to 10.6 mg/dL. Values &#x0003c;8 mg/dL are considered hypocalcemia.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Considering symptoms of hypocalcemia in many cases has differential diagnosis with other disorders such as neonatal sepsis and may be premature infants are placed under unnecessary antibiotics due to electrolyte imbalance such as hypocalcemia; on the other hand, hypocalcemia is associated with severe symptoms including jitteriness, lethargy, apnea, and seizures. In this study, effect of head covering in prevention of this relatively common and serious complication is studied. In case of having preventive effect, it not only reduces the unnecessary tests and treatment but also reduces the severe complications of hypocalcemia as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study is a prospective, randomized clinical trial that was conducted on premature infants with gestational age &#x0003c;35 weeks with jaundice which needed phototherapy and was hospitalized in Beheshti Hospital affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences since summer 2014 to winter 2014.</p><p>Inclusion criteria included preterm infants with gestational age &#x0003c;35 weeks with jaundice who needed phototherapy, lack of congenital malformations at birth, the infant's mother did not suffer from gestational diabetes or hyperparathyroidism, the infant's mother did not take anticonvulsive drugs during pregnancy, and lack of prenatal asphyxia.

Eyes and genitalia were protected using appropriate clothing, including eye blind and diapers. Head was covered using cloth helmet with a suitable size only in the first group (intervention group). Total serum calcium was measured before phototherapy and 36 h after initiation of phototherapy in both groups.

According to the obtained results, head covering during phototherapy had no impact on changes in the level of serum bilirubin, but serum calcium levels in the exposed group, under phototherapy, had significantly declined, and this decline was dependent also duration of phototherapy while no reduction in serum calcium levels was observed in the group with head covering. On the other hand, significant reverse correlation was observed between bilirubin and serum calcium levels after treatment, and it can estimate that covering head of infants during phototherapy probably prevents from incidence of hypocalcemia in infants. Of course, such conclusion was also obtained in other studies so that in the study by Sethi <italic>et al</italic>., it was shown that over 90% of preterm infants and 75% of term infants suffer from hypocalcemia after phototherapy.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Medhat in Cairo University indicated 75% of neonates and 90% of preterm infants who received phototherapy developed hypocalcemia.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In the study by Jain <italic>et al</italic>., it was found that 55% of preterm infants and 30% of neonatal infants developed hypocalcemia after phototherapy. In this research, preterm infants who were hypocalcemic, 63.6% had jitteriness and 97.6% of them irritability. Among the term neonates with hypocalcemia, 50% of them had jitteriness and 16.7% of them had irritability, and since most infants were symptomatic newborns, prophylactic administration of calcium was proposed in neonates under phototherapy for prevention of hypocalcemia. Furthermore, in this research, it was shown that the incidence of hypocalcemia is greater at higher levels of bilirubin.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In the study by Kumar <italic>et al</italic>., 80% of preterm and 66.6% term neonates were with hypocalcemia while the control group did not report any cases of hypocalcemia. Among preterm infants with hypocalcemia, 50% had jitteriness, 25% had irritation, and 25% had lethargy, but none of them developed seizures and apnea. Among term neonates, 80% were symptomatic and 30% had jitteriness, 20% had irritation, 30% had lethargy, and none of them developed seizures and apnea.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Gutcher and Odell specified a relationship between hypocalcemia and phototherapy.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Karamifar <italic>et al</italic>. in their study in Shiraz showed 22% of preterm infants and 8.7% of term infants developed hypocalcemia after phototherapy, but in this research, no infant developed symptomatic hypocalcemia and hypocalcemia was eliminated after phototherapy.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Eghbalian and Monsef in Hamadan studied 63 term infants above 2500 g under phototherapy and indicated incidence of hypocalcemia in infants under phototherapy was significantly higher than case group.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In the study by Ehsanipoor <italic>et al</italic>. in Shahid Akbarabadi Hospital, it was found that 82% of infants developed hypocalcemia after phototherapy.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS</title><p>Considering obtained results, it can be concluded that head covering during phototherapy probably prevents from hypocalcemia in preterm infants &#x0003c;35 gestational weeks and since Hypocalcemia can be associated with complications as jitteriness, lethargy, and seizures, it is recommended during phototherapy.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The current paper was conducted with support of research deputy of Isfahan Medical School.
