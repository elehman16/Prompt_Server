In recent decades, information disclosure and public reporting (PR) has become an instrument for encouraging good practice in healthcare. This study evaluated the impact of PR on antibiotic prescribing for URTIs in a sample of primary care institutions in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A matched-pair cluster-randomized trial was undertaken in QJ city, with 20 primary care institutions participating in the trial. Participating institutions were matched into pairs before being randomly assigned into a control and an intervention group. Prescription statistics were disclosed to patients, health authorities, and health workers monthly within the intervention group, starting from October 2013. Outpatient prescriptions for URTIs were collected from both groups before (1<sup>st</sup> March to 31<sup>st</sup> May, 2013) and after the intervention (1<sup>st</sup> March to 31<sup>st</sup> May, 2014). A total of 34,815 URTI prescriptions were included in a difference-in-difference analysis using multivariate linear or logistic regression models, controlling for patient attributes as well as institutional characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall, 90% URTI prescriptions required antibiotics and 21% required combined use of antibiotics. More than 77% of URTI prescriptions required intravenous (IV) injection or infusion of drugs. PR resulted in a 9 percentage point (95% CI -17 to -1) reduction in the use of oral antibiotics (adjusted RR =39%, <italic>P</italic> =0.027), while the use of injectable antibiotics remained unchanged. PR led to a 7 percentage point reduction (95% CI -14 to 0; adjusted RR =36%) in combined use of antibiotics (<italic>P</italic> =0.049), which was largely driven by a significant reduction in male patients (-7.5%, 95% CI -14 to -1, <italic>P</italic> =0.03). The intervention had little impact on the use of IV injections or infusions, or the total prescription expenditure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results suggest that PR could improve prescribing practices in terms of reducing oral antibiotics and combined use of antibiotics; however, the impacts were limited. We suggest that PR would probably be enhanced by provider payment reform, management and training for providers, and health education for patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antibiotics</kwd><kwd>China</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Public reporting</kwd><kwd>Upper respiratory tract infection</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Inappropriate use and overuse of antibiotics is a serious concern, especially in developing countries such as China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is perhaps the most prominent manifestation of irrational drug prescribing and contributes to bacterial resistance, which is an emergent threat to the global population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nosocomial or hospital-acquired infection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has the capacity to increase medical costs, length of hospital stay, and ultimately patient mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are one of the most common health conditions seen by primary care workers, and the associated overuse of antibiotics is widespread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the UK, for example, general practitioners prescribe antibiotics to 67% of patients presenting with respiratory infections, including 47% of those with URTIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It was estimated that 60% of respiratory infections prescribed with antibiotics in the UK are self-limiting conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A large cohort study of antibiotic usage associated with URTI in UK primary care settings concluded that prophylactic antibiotic prescriptions are unjustified in reducing the risk of serious complications in URTIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In China, approximately 75% of patients with seasonal influenza were estimated to be prescribed with antibiotics, more than doubled of the maximum rate (30%) recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Several systematic reviews have shown that antibiotics are of limited effectiveness in the treatment of URTIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and suggested no benefit in colds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Growing public health concerns regarding the implications of inappropriate use and overuse of antibiotics have resulted in global action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; China is no exception. The recent health reform (2009&#x02013;2011) in China articulated specific governance and incentive structures for public health organisations to address the issues of poor quality in prescribing, such as the enforcement of an essential medicine list policy and decoupling the nexus between medicine sales to health worker remuneration and bonus payments in primary care organisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Despite this, empirical evidence demonstrates that the effectiveness of these policy interventions has been short of expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In recent decades, public reporting (PR) has started to attract attention as a vehicle for improving the performance of health organisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The United States has led the PR movement, along with the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The rationale behind this approach draws experience from other industries with theoretical support from the domains of psychology, economics, and organizational behaviour. Public release of performance data is considered a bottom-up intervention compared with government regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and is intended to improve quality of care through imposing a higher level of transparency and accountability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Fr&#x000f8;lich et al. believe that PR can provide both financial and reputational incentives for health providers to improve quality of care, although contextual factors (at the levels of the markets and provider organisation) and characteristics of providers and patients may enhance or mitigate their responses to those incentives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Reputational incentives could also have financial implications.</p><p>This study aims to explore the potential use of PR for improving the quality of prescribing in primary care organisations using a social experiment. The study has important implications, primarily to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescription, but also as an analysis of whether greater transparency leads to improved healthcare outcomes. Provider-specific comparative performance reporting is currently being debated and implemented in a subset of developed countries, but only in a small group of developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Scant information is available regarding the effectiveness of PR in primary care settings, particularly in relation to prescribing behaviours. The concept of PR is almost completely novel for health workers in China.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting</title><p>This study was undertaken in QJ city of Hubei province, involving 20 primary care organisations. Hubei has a population of 58 million and a GDP of 2,225 billion (Yuan in 2012), ranking in the middle range of all Chinese provinces. QJ is located in central Hubei, with a land area of 2,004&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup> and a population of 1 million. The annual GDP of QJ reached 49.3 billion (Yuan) in 2012, just above the average level of all cities in Hubei. The majority of inhabitants in QJ are of Han ethnicity, with about 8,000 from Hui, Tujia, and other ethnic groups.</p><p>We selected QJ due to ready access to prescription data and implementation of intervention measures. Primary care organisations in QJ have the benefit of an electronic health information system (HIS). The QJ government has been very supportive of this project.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (No. IORG0003571).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Experimental design</title><p>This research adopted a matched-pair randomized trial design. The 20 participating primary care organisations were paired according to their size, geographic location and economic status, and population serviced. We considered all the organisational characteristics presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> in the pair-matching process. The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method was adopted to calculate a summed score from the matching variables (standardised) for each participating organisation. TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision analysis method that estimates the geometric distance between each alternative and the ideal alternative to a given solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The participating organisations were ranked in order according to their distances to the positive and the negative ideal alternatives.

This study demonstrated that PR interventions reduced the overall number of prescriptions associated with oral administrated antibiotics and retarded an anticipated potential rise in combined use of two or more antibiotics for URTIs. Although clinical outcomes of such a change were not explored in this study, it is reasonable to expect a positive outcome. Overuse of antibiotics is a widespread and serious problem in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], despite clinical guidelines for URTIs that advise against routine use of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials have shown minimal benefit associated with antibiotic prescriptions for URTIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Meanwhile, there are growing concerns about the possibility of antimicrobial resistance induced by irrational use of antibiotics. It was estimated that abuse of antibiotics for URTIs in low- and middle-income countries contributes to an additional 36% of medical costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Reducing irrational use of antibiotics can preserve these resources for more cost-effective interventions.</p><p>It is important to note that the overall use of antibiotics for URTIs in the participating primary care organisations remained at a high level despite the PR interventions. In addition, the PR interventions failed to show a significant impact on prescriptions using parenteral administration (injection and infusion). This study found that over 87% of prescriptions for URTIs contained antibiotics, much higher than the WHO recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The percentage of prescriptions requiring administration via IV injection and infusion for URTI reached a staggering level &#x02013; over 77%. Arguably, IV injection and infusion are more likely to impose health risks for the public, leading to iatrogenic and nosocomial problems such as transmission of blood-borne viruses and infection of infusion sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The persistent high prevalence of antibiotic misuse probably reflects both inertia in physician practice and continued demand from patients. Nevertheless, many Chinese patients regard parenteral administration as integral to high-quality care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The national zero-mark-up policy, introduced during 2009&#x02013;2011, prohibits primary care organisations from generating excessive profits from retailing drugs, with the intention of making drugs more financially accessible. Health providers are wily and resourceful: fees can be charged in relation to injection or infusion services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This may explain why the apparent consumer demand for antibiotics continues to be high, and why prescribing changes were mainly limited to oral antibiotics.</p><p>PR interventions did not have a significant effect on the average expenditure per visit. One plausible explanation could be that the expenditure had already been low due to a range of policies. The participating primary care organisations in both intervention and control groups had been exposed to the same policy environments over the past decade. Primary care organisations are only allowed to stock and provide drugs listed in the essential medicines list; these drugs can only be purchased through a regional centralized tendering and purchasing system at an agreed price; patients (and insurers) are charged with exactly the same purchasing price for their prescribed drugs. Empirical evidence showed that those policies have led to a significant reduction in drug expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Understandably, the capacity for further reduction of drug expenditure in primary care organisations is therefore limited.</p><p>There are policy implications arising from this study. Evidence from randomised control trials is regarded as the most robust and reliable. It is rare to find a study that uses a randomised control trial design to test the effect of PR interventions on physician prescribing practices within a complex health system and policy environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Internationally, healthcare systems are moving towards greater transparency and accountability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Performance reporting in healthcare has been shown to improve the health systems of developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Despite this, reporting systems must be properly developed, considering a system-wide stakeholder participation, a change of organisational culture, and the accuracy and relevancy of reported data. It is also important to be mindful of minimising unintended consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>PR of prescription performance may impose &#x0201c;pressures&#x0201d; on prescribers arising from consumers, payers, managers, and colleagues. The magnitude of the pressure depends on the level of PR awareness and how the population understands it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>We fear that consumer pressure to reduce irrational antibiotic and injectable prescription is limited in China, as the disclosed prescription indicators are difficult for consumers to understand due to limited health literacy. It is unlikely that the general public are either able or inclined to use the reported information to identify and choose healthcare providers. Previous studies show that consumer health literacy is low in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; overuse of antibiotics is common; and physicians may be under pressure to prescribe more, not fewer, antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The effect of PR on patients may also be jeopardised by limited exposure of patients to PR.</p><p>Pressure from payers is usually linked with financial incentives (or disincentives) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In this study, we found that the PR interventions are more likely to have an impact on the use of oral administered antibiotics compared with those administered via IV injection or infusion. This is perhaps because there are no financial incentives directly linked to reduction in irrational use of antibiotics, and fewer prescriptions of oral antibiotics (with zero-profit attached) are less likely to have a negative consequence on organisational revenues than reduced prescriptions of injected antibiotics (where a service fee can be charged). Clearly, these are demonstrable examples of perverse incentives.</p><p>Pressures from managers and colleagues may be a major driving force for the impact of PR interventions on prescribers. The working environment of physicians in China is characterised by strong administrative interventions from the government and organisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Physician buy-in of PR is also essential for success; after all, they make the final prescription decision. Our experience, together with studies conducted elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], show that physicians may challenge the validity of the PR and express concerns about performance reporting at individual levels for potential misinterpretations from patients. If a physician believes that the reported data are flawed (e.g., lack of adequate risk adjustment), he or she may be less likely to be influenced by the data. To make PR more acceptable, simplified data presentation, continued risk-adjustment refinement, and internal review before PR are necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>The development of an adequate PR system should be tailored to the macro- and micro-environment in which the healthcare organisations are operating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Consumers and health care providers should be involved in the design and specification of information requirements, reporting approach, and communication strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. An ideal PR system should be able to assist patients or potential users to make better informed decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Such a system should also address concerns from physicians in order to gain their acceptance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A high quality information system is also critical for easy access and quality assurance of data. Translating good practice from one program to others is a practical approach for building high quality information systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Nevertheless, none of these measures are likely to take place if the income for services remains as a fee for service, and opportunities remain that maximise income through unnecessary drug administration practices.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study was undertaken during an early stage of PR interventions, which may underestimate the true impact of the interventions. PR does not have a direct impact on prescriber behaviours. It may take time for healthcare providers to understand the rationale underlying the PR interventions and subsequently to change management and clinical practices. The mechanisms and long term effect of PR on prescribing behaviours warrant further studies.</p><p>The positive but limited effect of PR on prescription outcomes might also be indicative of shortfalls in project design and implementations. For example, this project included a mixed reporting system at both organisational and individual levels, which prevents us from exploring further mechanisms of the effect. Nevertheless, the study has provided important evidence for further improving the reporting system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated that PR interventions reduced the incidence of oral antibiotic prescription and slowed down the increase of combined use of antibiotics for URTIs. However, this effect is limited. Overall, the use of antibiotics remained at high levels, and the PR interventions failed to make an influence on the frequent use of injections and infusions as an administration route. The impact of PR interventions is dependent upon pressures from consumers, payers, managers, and colleagues. Patient empowerment mechanisms, financial incentives, reliable information systems, consumer education, and prescriber buy-in are required to maximise the impact of PR interventions.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>DID</term><def><p>Difference-in-difference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIS</term><def><p>Health information system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IV</term><def><p>Intravenous injection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCMS</term><def><p>New Cooperative Medical Scheme</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PR</term><def><p>Public reporting</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TOPSIS</term><def><p>Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>URTIs</term><def><p>Upper respiratory tract infections</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>XZ made substantial contributions to the project design, acquisition, and interpretation of data.
