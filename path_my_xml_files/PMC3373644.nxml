Differential effects of these interventions were noted. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate possible mechanisms underlying efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study design was a 3-arm non-blinded RCT. Participants were community-recruited adults &#x02265; 50 years old. Group 1 received meditation training; Group 2 &#x0201c;matching&#x0201d; moderate-intensity exercise training; and Group 3 were a waitlist control. Outcome Measures were assessed at baseline, 9 weeks (post-intervention) and 3 months. Primary outcomes were ARI duration and severity (area-under-the-curve global severity, Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey). Secondary outcomes were psycho-physical health questionnaires. Exercise minutes were tracked.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of 154 randomized, 149 completed the trial and were included into analysis. Participants were on average 59 (standard deviation 6.6) years old; 82% were women, 94% were Caucasian and 93% were non-smokers. Two age/gender-adjusted hypothesis-driven mediational models assessed effects of selected variables on primary outcomes. Stage 1 model contained group status and the change in a selected variable score over time; Stage 2 model additionally adjusted for the change in mindfulness scores. Stage 1 modeling showed that change in mindfulness scores at 3 months mediated the treatment effects on cold duration (p&#x0003c;0.05). Stage 2 modeling (double mediation structure) showed that changes in Optimism, Social Support and Mental Health scores at 3 months influenced (p&#x0003c;0.05) cold duration; however, these effects appeared to be mediated (p&#x0003c;0.05, p&#x0003c;0.05, and p=0.056, respectively) by the change in mindfulness scores at 3 months, with larger increases in mindfulness scores correlating with a shorter ARI duration. Change in exercise minutes did not appear to have significant effects on primary outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Positive effects of meditation and exercise on ARI illness burden may be explained by improved mindfulness scores over time. These results call for further research.</p></sec></body></article>
