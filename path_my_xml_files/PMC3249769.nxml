Children with chronic diseases such as thalassemia experience many pains during painful procedures including at times of diagnosis, treatment and control of their disease. Several methods have been reported to reduce pain. Clinical professionals usually use distraction techniques to reduce pain. However, there is no agreement between them that which distraction technique is better for reducing pain. The aim of this study was omparing the effects of regular breathing exercise and making bubbles on the pain of catheter insertion in school age children.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>This was a clinical trial on 60 children in the age range of 6 to 12 years, who were suffering from thalassemia and had a file in the Center for Thalassemia. Participants were randomly divided into two groups of experiment and control. Bubble making was performed for the first group and regular breathing exercise was performed for the second group. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, a scale for pediatric pain behavioral symptoms and Numeric Pain Rating Scale. Data were analyzed using descriptive (frequency, mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (ANOVA, Kruskal Wallis, and Mann Whitney U tests and Spearman correlation).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The mean pain score based on the numerical scale was 5.60 &#x000b1; 3.13 in the control group, 1.60 &#x000b1; 1.75 in the bubble-making group and 1.85 &#x000b1; 1.42 in the breathing exercise group. The mean score of behavioral pain symptoms was 3.80 &#x000b1; 2.80 in the control group, 1.15 &#x000b1; 1.13 in the bubble-making group, and 0.96 &#x000b1; 0.75 in the breathing exercise group. Results showed a significant difference in the mean pain scores (based on numeric scale and pain behavior scale) between the control group and other groups after the injection, but the difference in the mean pain scores between the two groups of experiment after the injection was not significant.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>According to the results of this study, both distraction methods of regular breathing exercise and bubble-making can reduce the pain of catheter insertion in children and since there was no difference between their effects, they can be used based on the individual child's interest.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>thalassemia</kwd><kwd>distraction</kwd><kwd>school-age children</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Thalassemia is the most common genetic disorder, so that 3% of world populations are carriers of thalassemia gene.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> According to world's statistics, the rate of thalassemia gene carrier in the Mediterranean region and Southeast Asia is 5 percent. Iran is also on the thalassemia belt.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>Nowadays, the advancement of technology has led to better diagnosis and control of many chronic diseases including thalassemia. This has caused an increase in the number of children suffering from these diseases. The nature of thalassemia is that the children who suffer from it should be hospitalized frequently<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> and undergo painful diagnosis and treatment procedures. Establishing intravenous line (IV catheter) is one of the most common invasive procedures that causes pain in these children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Injection pain in children is so important that is stated as the most stressful aspect of their disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> For thalassemia patients who are repeatedly exposed to the catheter and its pain and anxiety, providing strategies to reduce the pain and make it bearable is very important. Pain is one of the main nursing diagnoses and nurses can make care plans to reduce it.</p><p>There are various pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods to prevent and reduce pain. One of the non-pharmacological methods to reduce pain is distraction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Distraction method includes visual distraction (counting objects, watching TV), vocal distraction (listening to music), touch-motion distraction (slow regular breathing), and purposive distraction (using toys).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Distraction causes focus on triggers other than pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> and increases tolerance to pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> Distraction is one of the most practical, easiest and least costly method of non-pharmacological pain relief.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> A study conducted in the US to compare distraction method with other pain relief methods such as EMLA cream showed that distraction was more effective in reducing the pain in children who referred for vaccination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> However, some other studies such as that of Hassanpour et al. (2006), which aimed to compare distraction method and cryotherapy showed that both methods were effective in reducing injection pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></p><p>Considering the variety of distraction methods, studies showed that various distraction methods can have a great effect in reducing pain in children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></p><p>Almost all studies approved the effect of distraction on reducing pain in patients, but the effects of these methods on reducing pain of children who suffer from thalassemia and have to frequently undergo painful procedures have been less studied. The existing studies have mainly compared distraction with other methods such as EMLA cream<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> and cryotherapy and have not paid attention to compare two methods of distraction. It seems that comparing two methods of distraction help nurses to find the most effective method and use it if possible. The researcher's experiences of working with children with thalassemia have led to designing this study based on personal experiences and existing literature. First, pain relief in children at the time of injection is less paid attention by nurses and strategies to reduce pain are rarely used. Second, due to the big load of duties, nurses do not have enough time to learn methods for children, which require long term learning, even when they pay attention to distract children from pain. Therefore, if some simple methods such as bubble making that children do it easily can have the same effects of other methods such as breathing exercise and can replace them, it may be recommended to nurses to solve the problem of lack of attention to pain relief, while saving nurses&#x02019; time and make it possible for them to pay more attention to their jobs. It should be mentioned that children are more attracted to games, which in addition to distract them from pain, make the hospital environment attractive to children and make them accept treatment better. Therefore, comparing these two methods in a research project can achieve such objectives.</p><p>Based on the above discussion, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of regular breathing exercise and making bubbles on the pain of catheter insertion in children suffering from thalassemia who referred to the Thalassemia Center in the city of Kerman.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a clinical trial on 60 children in the age range of 6 to 12 years, who were suffering from major thalassemia and referred to the Center for Thalassemia in the city of Kerman (Kerman is one of the biggest cities in Iran and is the center of Kerman province in the South East Iran. This city is the central part of Kerman ward and its population according to the 2006 census by the Statistical Center of Iran is 515,114). in 2010, who met the entry criteria. The sampling was convenient method and participants were randomly divided into three groups (2 experiment and 1 control groups). Entry criteria included age range of 6 to 12 years old, having medical file in the Thalassemia Center and be willing to participate in the study. Those children who had physical problems (verbal, mental, visual and hearing) and psychological problems or were using pain relief or anxiety medicine were excluded from the study.</p><p>After obtaining permission from the Thalassemia Center, sampling was started. The researcher introduced herself to the participants and obtained written consent from the parents and verbal consent from the children and then, divided them randomly into three groups. The random selection was based on throwing dice. In one group injection was done in the usual way of the ward (without any activity for pain relief) and in the two other groups, distraction methods of bubble making toy for one group and regular breathing exercise for the other group were practiced.</p><p>In the bubble-making group, children were instructed to use bubbles and were asked to do it one minute before and during catheter insertion until fixation of angiocath. In the breathing exercise group, children were taught how to do regular breathing exercise and were asked to do it one minute before and during catheter insertion until fixation of angiocath. For this group, breathing method of Hey-hu was applied. In this method, first child takes a deep breath, exhale while whispering Hey, then inhale deeply again and exhale whispering Hu. The reason for choosing bubble-making toy and breathing exercise was to compare two different methods of distraction, game therapy and touch-motion therapy. Also, the other reason for using this toy was being inexpensive and being suitable for both boys and girls. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, a scale for pediatric pain behavioral symptoms and Numeric Pain Rating Scale. Demographic data questionnaire was completed by interviewing the child or one of the parents.</p><p>In the next stage, the behavioral pain scale during procedure in children of all three groups were observed and recorded. Behavioral pain scale was used to determine the severity of pain of catheter insertion through children's reactions during injection.</p><p>This scale includes five sections of face, leg, activity, cry and soothability. Each section has a score of 0-2 and higher scores show more reaction to pain. The score of each section are recorded separately and then, the scores of all 5 sections are added to calculate the total score of pain. The range of score is from 0 (the lowest) to 10 (the highest).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> The researcher scored the scale by observing children's behavior during injection. The reliability of this instrument is assessed in previous studies, including Hamed Tavassoli (1387) who calculated a reliability of r = 74% and Lwuiz et al. (2002) who reported a reliability of r = 88%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> The validity of this instrument was approved by content analysis by ten nursing teachers.</p><p>After injection, children's pain was assessed by numerical pain scale. This scale was showed to the children and they were asked to choose their pain from numbers 0 to 10. The linear scale of zero to ten for pain is a standard scale to assess pain. For some patients such as children and elders, using visual scale without signs is difficult. Therefore, in such cases, ranking scales, simple scales of describing pain or numerical scale of 0 to 10 can be used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Validity and reliability of this scale is also approved by other studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> The nurse responsible for catheterizing, size, type and manufacturer of angiocath, side of injection and environmental conditions were the same in all cases. Data were analyzed using descriptive (frequency, mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (ANOVA, Kruskal Wallis, and Mann Whitney U tests and Spearman correlation).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>The results of the present study showed that 56.7% of subjects were female and 43.3 were male.

However, the pain score based on behavioral pain scale in boys (2.30 &#x000b1; 2.66) was higher than that in girls (1.58 &#x000b1; 1.78), even though Mann Whitney U test showed no significant difference (p = 0.324).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study showed a significant difference in the mean pain score among the three groups of breathing exercise, bubble-making and usual method, but no significant difference between the children's mean score of pain in the two groups of bubble-making and breathing exercise. Considering that there was no significant difference among these three groups regarding various variables such as age, gender, etc. and the only independent impact factor was distraction, it can be concluded that distraction was effective in reducing children's pain. Many studies have mentioned the effect of distraction methods on pain relief. Cohen (2007) reduced vaccination pain and distress in babies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> and Bellieni (2006), Windich-Baimer (2007) and Hassanpour (2006) in different studies reduced the pain of catheter in children's of school age using distraction methods.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> The results of the study of Sinha et al. (2006) showed that distraction could reduce the pain of stitching in children under 10 years old.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></p><p>The results of this study showed no significant difference between the two distraction methods of breathing exercise and bubble-making, while other studies difference between various methods. Esmaeili et al. (2008) and Valizadeh et al. (2004) compared two methods of breathing exercise and music on pain of catheter at the time of blood transfusion and found that although both methods reduced children's pain significantly, the effect of music was more than breathing exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></p><p>Broome et al. (1998) used regular breathing technique on children with cancer at the time of pulling CSF and the pain was significantly reduced.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> Manne et al. (1994) used a tool called crystal party for regular breathing to distract from catheter and it reduced the pain significantly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></p><p>The results showed that bubble-making during injection as compared to the usual method can reduce children's pain. This result approves the finding of Alavi et al. (2005) who used bubble-making toy to reduce children's pain of catheter.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> In the study of Gupta et al. (2006) also distraction by using musical ball reduced the pain of catheter in school age children who underwent elective surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></p><p>Another finding of this study was no significant correlation between gender and self-reported pain and behavioral pain. The results of a study by Arts et al. also found no significant effect for gender on severity of pain and behavioral reactions, which is in agreement with the current study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref> Tootoonchi also found no significant relationships between the severity of pain and gender.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> Moreover, in the present study, there was a significant reverse relationship between the age and the score of numerical scale in two behavioral scales so that by increasing age, the score of reported pain decreased. Arden (2006) also believed that age is an effective factor in the severity of pain and as the age increases, the tolerance to pain increases too.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref> The results of other studies also showed reverse relationship between pain and age. In the study of Pourmovahed et al. (2008), the mean score of pain severity in the children of 10-12 years old was lower than those of 6 to 9 years old.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of the present study showed that distraction reduced pain of injection procedures in children of school age who suffer from thalassemia. Therefore, by using simple methods such as a bubble-making toy or breathing exercise according to the child's choice and cooperation, the destructive experience of invasive painful procedures in children with chronic disease who experience a lot of pain during painful procedures such as diagnosis, treatment and control of their diseases can be reduced. Since in the children's centers for treatment of thalassemia, currently nothing is done for distraction, the results of this study recommend using these methods to reduce pain in children with thalassemia.</p><p>Considering the key role of nurses in health care team, we hope that the results of this study help them reduce pain and undesirable mental, emotional and physical complications of hospitalized children who undergo painful procedures.</p><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest in this study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Researchers thank all the personnel and staff of
