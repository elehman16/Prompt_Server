The aim of the study was to understand family members&#x02019; experience during CPR. All participants were interviewed by phone at home three months after cardiac arrest. Saturation was reached after analysis of 30 interviews of a randomly selected sample of 75 family members included in the trial. Four themes were identified: 1- choosing to be actively involved in the resuscitation; 2- communication between the relative and the emergency care team; 3- perception of the reality of the death, promoting acceptance of the loss; 4- experience and reactions of the relatives who did or did not witness the CPR, describing their feelings.

The themes reported include the need to see or touch the body, to be able to say a final goodbye, to be certain that everything that could be done was done.[<xref rid="pone.0156100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Conversely, some authors have stressed the aggressive, traumatizing nature of the experience perceived by families present during CPR.[<xref rid="pone.0156100.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this ancillary study of our clinical trial was to understand, through a systematic qualitative analysis, how families experience CPR of a relative, by detailing the emotional meaning of the benefits and disadvantages of their presence. This analysis viewed from the perspective of these family members, may help us to understand the results of the randomized trial, by showing the subjective factors that played a role and which may explain the difference found in the psychiatric morbidity between the group that was offered a choice and the group that was not.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Study context and Recruitment</title><p>This study, using a sequential explanatory design, is the qualitative component of a French randomized multicenter trial (the PRESENCE study) and explores the experiences of relatives related to their choice to be or not during CPR of a loved one. The decision to conduct a qualitative analysis was made at the outset, in the initial planning and methodological design. Briefly, the PRESENCE trial randomized 570 family members present in the homes of persons who had a sudden cardiac arrest and had CPR performed there by a team of paramedical and medical emergency care professionals. In the intervention group, the team routinely asked the family members if they wanted to be present during CPR. In the control group, there was no change from the usual management (which does not include that offer). The results for the intervention group showed a significant reduction in the rate of post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD), a reduction in anxiety and depression scores 90 days later,[<xref rid="pone.0156100.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and a favorable effect on the work of grieving at one year.[<xref rid="pone.0156100.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Of the 540 participants included in the randomized controlled trial, 75 were randomly selected as possible candidates for the qualitative study. No family member of people who survived CPR was included. We contacted them sequentially by telephone according to an intentional sampling procedure known as purposive sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156100.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

Moreover, communication between health care personnel is directly affected by the family's presence.[<xref rid="pone.0156100.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156100.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] A randomized trial tested a strategy of proactive communication towards the families of patients who died during resuscitation. The authors showed the beneficial effect of this strategy on the psychological consequences on the relatives by a significant reduction in the frequency of post-traumatic stress syndrome.[<xref rid="pone.0156100.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Theme #4 suggests that the experience of watching resuscitation may be traumatizing. Some authors use this argument to deny families the choice to be present.[<xref rid="pone.0156100.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156100.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In a survey of 592 health-care professionals, 79% cited this point as the primary reason for not allowing families to be present at the resuscitation.[<xref rid="pone.0156100.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] A trial based on this observation showed an increase in the frequency of PTSD in 34 families that were present for failed resuscitations.[<xref rid="pone.0156100.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Analysis of theme #4 indicates ambivalence between the potentially traumatizing nature of the technically sophisticated resuscitation, which could be experienced as aggressive overtreatment, and the need to be present to say goodbye. This ambivalence underlines the need to prepare and support the family and maybe even to see them again after the death.</p><p>What this study shows is the benefit of feeling oneself an active participant, of being able to choose whether or not to be present, and of being able to show self-efficacy in so complex and emotionally delicate a situation. This result fits into the concept of <italic>sense of agency</italic>,[<xref rid="pone.0156100.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] defined as a person&#x02019;s capacity to perceive him- or herself as able to master and control his or her environment [<xref rid="pone.0156100.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], in contrast to passively undergoing a situation, being subjected to it. Offering family members the choice to be present during CPR contributes to developing this sense of agency. In addition, our results suggest that their presence has a positive effect on all 3 of its components: (i) perception (understanding of the reality of the death), (ii) cognition (thoughts related to support, and direct communication with the team), and (iii) emotions (experience of shock and relief). The health care team's consideration of the patient may facilitate an experience of active involvement in the resuscitation process. The feeling of active involvement counteracts the experience of helplessness and may thus be a factor that protects against traumatic grieving.</p><p>Our study is subject to limitations. First, the transferability of our findings should take into account the country-specific medical system. A second limitation, our conclusions should be generalized only with caution to different populations, including, but not limited to pediatric populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec029"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that the practice of offering family members the choice of whether or not to view resuscitation has an emotionally protective effect in the face of this potentially traumatic event and thus call for the reconsideration of standard practices about CPR of patients in the presence of their immediate family members.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156100.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Guide for semi-directive interview.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156100.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr Laurenne Paris for transcription support, and the family members who shared participated and graciously shared their experience during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0156100.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>. <article-title>Should family members be present during cardiopulmonary resuscitation?</article-title>
