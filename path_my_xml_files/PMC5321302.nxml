Intervention districts housed the 46 ACs who received the training programme. The primary outcome was district (health facility-based) perinatal mortality rates. Secondary outcomes included maternal mortality ratios, neonatal mortality rate, obstetric and birth variables. The study period was 2011&#x02013;2013.

Many of these ACs specialise in emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC), and are in the frontline providing care for mothers and babies. The value of ACs cannot be understated; it will take many more years before countries like Malawi and most countries in sub-Saharan Africa have enough doctors. ACs, known as clinical officers in Malawi, are providing essential, valuable, safe and effective EmONC services across sub-Saharan African countries.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;6</xref> Recent work has shown that while they are a valuable resource, they often feel undervalued and undersupported, and this has an impact on their performance and retention.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The WHO recognises the important role this cadre of health workers can play in maternal and newborn healthcare, and has made recommendations so that their role can be elevated.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Major surveys consistently show that extra training and support can improve task shifting, and reduce maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity in the areas where extra training and support have been piloted.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> To be effective, ACs need the appropriate knowledge, skills, equipment, drugs and the technology essential for managing obstetric complications in rural or deprived communities.</p><p>In 2011, the European Commission FP7 funded the enhancing of human resources and use of appropriate technologies for maternal and perinatal survival in sub-Saharan Africa (ETATMBA, Enhancing Training And Technology for Mothers and Babies in Africa) project. The project set out to implement and evaluate a programme of locally based clinical service improvement in Tanzania and Malawi. A cohort of EmONC ACs (in both countries) were provided with a programme of evidenced-based skills, knowledge and clinical leadership training delivered by European and African specialist clinicians and academicians. Trainees had links to specialist support and in Malawi, two UK-based obstetricians, at specialist registrar level with 5&#x02005;years of clinical experience, worked alongside the ACs for 2&#x02005;weeks in their districts, providing peer support and sharing of skills and knowledge.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Here we report on the evaluation of the impact of the training in Malawi. The main aim is to evaluate the impact of the ETATMBA training on health outcomes (maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality) by comparing districts where trainees were based with districts where there were no ETATMBA trainees.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Trial design</title><p>A cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a 1:1 allocation. However, for the purpose of analyses, we adopted a quasiexperimental research design, as we were using district population-level data, in order to capture the longitudinal effects of the intervention through regression modelling.

All of these outcomes were the numbers of events as recorded in maternity records by clinical staff within the health facilities. Each facility within a district records birth events in a maternity record book. This book is collated monthly and summarised, presenting a sum total of each of the variables from the book (eg, number of births, number of women with pre-eclampsia, number of stillbirths (macerated and fresh), etc) and sent to a central point within the district for reporting to the Ministry of Health. It is from these summary records that we gathered our data from each of the districts.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Power calculation</title><p>In this study, we based our power calculation on a neonatal mortality rate of 30 per 1000 live births.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The study was powered to detect a 20% difference between intervention and control districts in PNM rate (neonate survival until discharge from facility). The study has 0.80 power to detect the 20% difference with an &#x003b1; of 0.05. This was based on each of the trainees being exposed to 700 birth events in each of the eight intervention districts.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Using data from a 2011 Republic of Malawi Ministry of Health report,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> the study statistician looked at each of the 14 districts in terms of maternal deaths, stillbirths and neonatal deaths per 1000 (population), ranking each district for each variable. Summing these three ranks gave a score for each of the 14 districts. The 14 districts were then placed in two strata based on a median split of the ranked score (of which there were 7 in each). The strata represent high and low ranked districts. Using a random number generator in STATA software, four districts were randomised to the intervention from each strata.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were generated for all variables, and PNM rates (per 1000 live births) and maternal mortality ratios (per 100&#x02005;000 live births) were calculated (MS Excel and SPSS V.22) based on the number of birth events.</p><p>The primary outcome, PNM rates and maternal mortality ratios were examined using an interrupted time series (ITS). The time series looked at quarterly periods across the 3&#x02005;years with the intervention (interruption) being introduced in the first quarter of 2012 (giving a preinterruption slope of 12&#x02005;months prior to any training/exposure). The ITS, in our case, is a robust technique having the ability to evaluate both intended and unintended consequences of interventions, such as significant challenges, not least the confounding influence of training programmes in control districts that might have affected the intervention. The ITS (statistical comparison of time trends preintervention and postintervention) was carried out using SPSS (V.22). Autoregressive integrated moving average models were generated for the primary variable and maternal mortality ratios for intervention and control districts. Effects are reported from the slope of the regression line preintervention and postintervention (overall), and at 3-month intervals for 21&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> CIs (95%) are calculated for all effects. In addition, to aid the comparison between intervention and control districts, percentages of the absolute effects are calculated as &#x02018;relative effects&#x02019;, that is, 100&#x000d7;(actual effect)/(predicted effect)<bold>&#x02212;</bold>(actual effect).</p><p>Data are presented as tables, figures or charts, as appropriate.</p><p>Data were transcribed from records held at the district hospitals. Data represented the quarterly figures for a particular district and in total, we collected data for three whole years (2011&#x02013;2013 inclusive). Quarterly data from January 2011 to January 2012 (five quarters) represents the pre-ETATMBA training period. The remaining seven quarters up to December 2013 was the follow-up period. The outcomes chosen were linked to elements of the training provided to the ACs, and are data that are routinely recorded and stored.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Deviations from original protocol</title><p>Owing to unforeseen circumstances, we needed to adjust our protocol slightly once we started the study. We have, within this paper, clarified our power calculation and randomisation as there was some confusion with the original protocol. While our pragmatic decision was to split Lilongwe into two because of its size, in reality this proved impossible; hence, we ended up with eight intervention districts (Lilongwe, Nkhotakota, Ntcheu, Chitipa, Karonga, Mzimba/Mzuzu, Kasungu and Rumphi) and six control districts (Dedza, Dowa, Mchinji, Ntchisi, Salima and Nkhata Bay).</p><p>We stated in our protocol that primary data would be extracted from the maternity logs (Malawi Ministry of Health Maternity Register, V.2 (July 2008)) at the district hospital and also the summary data for all other facilities within the district, which were also held there. Data were collected at three points in time from all districts.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Local (project-related) and national (Government-related) resource issues early in the project period forced us to change a number of things. First, it was impractical within our resource constraints to extract data directly from the registers; therefore, we collected the monthly or quarterly summary data for the whole district from the district hospital. Second, our data collection was carried out in two rather than the three visits that was originally planned.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study was reviewed and approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (BREC) at the University of Warwick, UK (143/09/2011), and the College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (COMREC), Malawi (P.07/11/1102). It had also the approval and support of the Malawi Ministry of Health.</p></sec><sec id="s3k"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>The funders of this study had no input into the design and delivery of the programme and were not involved in any way with the studies data and its analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s4"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJGH2015000020TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> shows the total birth events for each district, and overall for the intervention and control districts.

in emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC) in the intervention districts. Of those recruited, 46 (85%) remained in the training programme till the end, 25 from the central region of Malawi drawn from nine hospitals (district and central hospitals) and 21 from the northern region drawn from six hospitals (district and central hospitals). One of the smaller districts in the northern region had one ETATMBA trainee working in its district hospital. Nearly all the trainees were male, with only two females. All of the 46 trainees completed the training and were awarded their degree in late 2014.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main aims of this study were to evaluate the impact on health outcomes (perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality) of the ETATMBA training programme. We are pleased to see an overall reduction in PNM rates (control and intervention). Attributing this reduction to our training is complex as reductions are statistically better in control districts. However, on closer examination of the early neonatal death rates (a key component of PNM), we find a fall by 31% (per 1000 births) in the intervention districts and a 2% increase in the control districts over the 3&#x02005;years of the project. There were twice as many birth events within the intervention districts compared with control over the lifetime of the project implying that our trainees were exposed to more birth events. Our original assumption was that training would reduce perinatal deaths in the intervention district more than control through early intervention (eg, effective resuscitation) and enhanced care of the neonate. We are cautious in interpreting these results as there are confounding factors, but evidence from our qualitative studies in Malawi and Tanzania do support the notion that our training has been effective.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>A problem with interpreting these data is that when resuscitating babies born in very poor condition, some cases end in reclassifying fresh stillbirths as neonatal deaths. The Helping Babies Breath initiative was occurring at the same time as the ETATMBA training programme across Malawi, and this effect of moving some fresh stillbirths to neonatal deaths occurred in the intervention and control districts and explains the drop in fresh stillbirths without a drop in neonatal deaths in the control districts. Importantly, in the intervention districts, both stillbirths and neonatal deaths decreased suggesting that our training (which included resuscitation and early neonatal care) ended in more successful resuscitations in the intervention districts.</p><p>For maternal mortality, we see a consistent reduction in ratio over the 3&#x02005;years in the intervention districts compared with a gradual increase within control districts. This does suggest that the training was starting to have an impact. Our qualitative work gave strong indications that at the local level (in the facilities where a trainee worked), maternal mortality had reduced. It takes effective teams to prevent maternal deaths, and the combination of knowledge, practical and leadership training was effective.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> We again are cautious in interpreting this result, but we do feel that there is evidence that women's lives were saved as a result of our training.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Caesarean sections increased in the intervention districts while remaining at a similar level in control districts. There are many factors that can contribute to this, but our process evaluation has shown us that trainees were more confident to intervene and work with the local team to provide a better outcome for mothers.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In high-income countries, the increasing caesarean section rates are associated with an increase in maternal morbidity.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In contrast, in low-income countries like Malawi where there are low caesarean section rates (&#x0223c;5%), increasing the rates is associated with an increase in maternal and perinatal survival.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Furthermore, our training included improving decision-making for indications of caesarean section, improving skills to avoid caesarean section (vaginal breech and vacuum delivery) and reducing complications from caesarean section (improved surgical technique, transverse skin incisions, antibiotic prophylaxis, use of WHO checklist, better management of intraoperative haemorrhage, improved communications between clinical team). Thus, the training may be responsible for the increased rate of caesarean section with a decrease in neonatal and maternal mortality.</p><p>As expected, carrying out an RCT in a sub-Saharan African setting has a number of limitations. Two major initiatives from US aid organisations were active across Malawi at the time of our study: Helping Babies Breathe and Kangaroo Mother Care. The control districts could not ethically be deprived of these initiatives, and this may have contributed as a major confounder to our results.</p><p>This was not a traditional cluster RCT design. There are no actual participants; the clusters are whole districts and intervention districts had a numbers of ACs who received the ETATMBA training, which did not happen in the control districts. Along with this, our reliance on locally recorded data in the districts health facilities is also a limitation. Indeed, we are cautious about overinterpreting results. Our researchers visited the districts at least twice, collecting the data and transcribing it from data pooled at the district centres/hospitals. While they were able to check some data against register entries, to do this for all facilities within a district would have required a huge number of research staff. While we do have missing data (and report this), we are confident that the data collected are an accurate reflection of events in all of the districts included in the trial. Our design using district data was pragmatic, and a limitation is that it will not give the true picture that would be obtained from population mortality surveillance; however, as all the trainees were practising at the district hospitals, we believe it provides a comparable measure of change.</p><p>Our original pragmatic plan to split Lilongwe into two was thwarted in reality, another limitation of this study. This is the largest district in the study with the largest concentration of ETATMBA trainees (nine) whose influence was potentially district-wide. This has somewhat unbalanced the study with many more birth events in the intervention districts overall (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref>). It may be considered that our randomisation failed because of the imbalance but, in good faith, we based our randomisation on previously published data. We believe that we ensured that all necessary steps in randomisation were taken care of by using the appropriate statistical programme and randomisation technique, which cover the control of variability, levels of randomisation, size of intervention arms and power to detect causal effects, as well as the many problems that commonly lead to postintervention bias. We present an accurate reflection of the reality.</p><p>We report elsewhere the high value the trainees placed on the mentoring and support they received from the visiting obstetricians and the ETATMBA team.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A key part, and indeed a unique part, of the ETATMBA training was the integration of clinical leadership with clinical skills and knowledge teaching. Trainees were actively encouraged to take leadership roles, and cascade their new skills and knowledge within their districts, which included travelling out to other facilities. Our qualitative work provides evidence that cascading took place with more effective team work and commitment to improve facilities.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, countrywide political and infrastructure problems (eg, fuel shortages and electricity outages) early in the project did place restrictions on the trainees&#x02019; ability to cascade their skills (eg, travelling to other facilities). Our hopes are that the ripples from the training are far reaching and ongoing; hence, our objective is to look at district-wide outcomes. Indeed, results from the Tanzanian arm of the ETATMBA show similar outcomes.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>A recent review looking at obstetric and newborn care capacity building in rural sub-Saharan Africa concluded that the millennium development goals will not be met, but suggests that simple packaged emergency obstetric interventions could have an impact in the future.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Given the critical shortages of qualified obstetricians in countries like Malawi, some have started training cadres like ACs in obstetric surgery, particularly in rural/remote areas, with the hope of alleviating the problem.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;26</xref> In Malawi, the health facilities have chronic shortages of essential equipment and drugs.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This coupled with the health provider crisis demonstrate the challenges faced in trying to make an impact on health outcomes.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref> Training in obstetric emergencies that includes high fidelity simulations, leadership training and clinical teaching can improve obstetric and neonatal outcomes; features included in the ETATMBA training.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref></p><p>Very few RCTs of training with the outcome measure of obstetric complications have been reported and there is an urgent need for these.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Reported improvements in obstetric complications have been demonstrated in &#x02018;before and after&#x02019; studies.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In low-income countries, the ability to control other variables (eg, confounders) is challenging and in judging the outcomes, one must take into account both qualitative and quantitative data over longer time frames and in context.</p><p>In conclusion, it is heartening to see the reductions in PNM, maternal and neonatal mortality rates/ratios presented here. We are cautious in our interpretation of these results. Attributing the changes to the ETATMBA training is complex. Although there have been a large number of challenges, we have successfully trained 46 ACs with advanced skills and knowledge in obstetric, neonatal care and clinical leadership. This training has had an excellent retention rate, and was well received by the trainees and those around them in the districts (all were awarded a BSc in International Obstetrics by the University of Warwick in October 2014). We feel that these results, supported by the qualitative evidence, show the training has changed practice, and as a result may have contributed to the positive downward trends in maternal and neonatal mortality rates, and an increase in numbers and quality of lifesaving obstetric interventions such as caesarean sections. Providing this cadre with the leadership and practical skills and knowledge, based on best evidence and tailored to be delivered in a low-resource setting, could be a practical solution to the doctor shortages in African countries. Our hope is that the ETATMBA trainees will have an enduring influence that will impact positively on future practice in Malawi and Tanzania, and will help in realisation of MDGs 4 and 5.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Enhancing Human Resources and Use of Appropriate Technologies for Maternal and Perinatal Survival in sub-Saharan Africa (ETATMBA) is a collaborative project funded by the European Commission, Seventh Framework Programme (THEME (HEALTH.2010.3.4-2) (Project no. 266290)).
