The Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST) reported smoking cessation rates of almost 12% in both trial arms at 1&#x02005;year follow-up, compared with the Danish population rate of 4%.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Quit rate was significantly higher in smokers who had a positive CT result that required repeat scans.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the Dutch-Belgian NELSON Trial, the overall quit rate at 2&#x02005;years follow-up was 16.6% compared with a background population rate of 3&#x02013;7%. Although a lower prolonged abstinence rate was observed in the screened arm (14.5%) versus control (19.1%), this effect disappeared following intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, suggesting an overall positive effect of trial participation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A non-significant trend towards increased smoking cessation was seen in those with multiple indeterminate screening results.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The US National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> found that compared with normal lung screening results, receiving any screen-detected abnormality significantly reduced the probability of continued smoking.</p><p>In addition to the moderating effect of lung screening results, demographic predictors of increased likelihood of smoking cessation have been observed in previous lung cancer screening studies.

<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The current study builds upon previous UKLS reports by examining the behavioural effects of trial participation and modifying variables on smoking cessation at short-term and long-term follow-up. It was expected that intervention arm participants would be more likely to report quitting compared with control arm participants, and that predictors of smoking cessation would include positive CT results (in screened participants), higher socioeconomic group and higher baseline distress/concern about lung cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants and procedures</title><p>A random sample of 247&#x02005;354 individuals aged 50&#x02013;75&#x02005;years residing in six recruitment areas in the UK (Liverpool, Knowsley and Sefton; Cambridgeshire, Peterborough and Bedfordshire) was sent trial information packs that included a self-report questionnaire regarding lung cancer risk factors.

The present study is the first to report the behavioural impact of CT screening in a UK high-risk population and confirms the findings of previous trials that lung cancer screening does not falsely reassure smokers or reduce their motivation to stop smoking. The net UKLS Trial cessation rate was 11% in the short term and 22% at up to 2&#x02005;years follow-up&#x02014;both higher than the background cessation rate of 4% in the general UK population. For participants who underwent CT screening, the short-term quit rate of 14% was similar to that of the Dutch-Belgian NELSON Trial<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and higher than that of the DLCST.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Participating in the UKLS appeared to prompt smoking cessation overall, with a differential and positive effect of lung screening at short-term and longer-term follow-up. While a degree of caution is needed due to imputation of missing responders as smokers,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> the present findings indicate that smoking cessation was higher in the intervention arm and that engaging in CT lung cancer screening increased the likelihood of stopping smoking in the longer term. Despite concerns about a negative lung screen offering a &#x02018;licence to smoke&#x02019;,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> there was no evidence that UKLS screening participants who received an all-clear CT result were less likely to quit. Analysis indicated that a positive CT scan result prompted smoking cessation in the longer term compared with participants who were not screened and participants who received a negative scan, suggesting that a positive lung screening result may provide an additional stimulus for quitting over and above that of screening participation. This mirrors the findings of other controlled trials, including the DLCST<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and US NLST,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> where smokers with identified abnormalities were more likely to stop smoking than those with normal results.</p><p>The current evidence suggests that an integrated package of CT lung screening and smoking cessation support has the potential to expedite quitting in smokers who are motivated and receptive. The voluntary nature of the trial meant that smokers who took part were self-selected and may already have been contemplating quitting.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> It is difficult, therefore, to directly attribute smoking cessation to UKLS participation, although Ostroff <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> reported that smokers who quit after CT lung screening ascribed their decision to screening participation. In the current trial, we observed a marginal trend towards higher baseline distress in those who reported quitting in the short term, which suggests that experiencing a degree of concern about lung cancer may be necessary to galvanise smoking cessation. However, we did not directly assess baseline quit intentions, and future evaluations of CT lung screening would therefore benefit from examining the influence of both mood-related and smoking-related cognitions on behavioural outcomes.</p><p>The limitations of sample size and study design are acknowledged. The UKLS Trial was not specifically designed to test the effects of lung screening combined with smoking cessation support; hence, the types of stop-smoking interventions accepted by participants were not recorded, nor were comparative data available on cessation rates in the Liverpool and Papworth regions during the life of the trial. It was not possible to ascertain the moderating role of nicotine dependence or biochemically validate self-reported smoking behaviour; therefore, the current findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the sole use of self-reported cessation. Nevertheless, the present study adds to growing evidence that integrating CT lung screening with evidence-based smoking cessation interventions could prompt quitting in motivated high-risk smokers. While our sample was not sufficiently large to examine continued smoking abstinence in those who reported quitting at short-term follow-up, the NELSON Trial indicated that combining low-dose CT screening with smoking cessation advice led to sustained abstinence.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Most smokers enrolling in CT lung screening studies are motivated to quit; therefore, it will be critical to evaluate actual quit rates prompted by screening and whether they are maintained over time in the context of a lung screening health service. We found that longer-term study retention was less likely in smokers who were from socioeconomically deprived areas and who had experience of lung cancer. Evidence from other studies suggests that these high-risk groups may be deterred from lung screening due to fearful and fatalistic beliefs about lung cancer outcomes,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref> stigma and scepticism.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;31</xref> The consistent association between smoking, deprivation and lower screening uptake is a problem for public health that must be addressed in future lung screening.</p><p>Implementation of a UK national lung cancer screening programme for high-risk groups offers opportunities for smoking cessation at multiple points in the screening process, from the initial screening invitation to CT scanning and disclosure of results.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Smoking cessation counselling combined with pharmacotherapy is effective<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32&#x02013;34</xref> and could be successfully implemented in the lung screening setting.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> However, further behavioural research is needed to identify ways of engaging harder to reach smokers and to robustly test the optimal type and timing of strategies for delivering stop-smoking support to high-risk participants. Successful integration of evidence-based strategies for smoking cessation with stratified lung cancer screening could be a prudent use of limited healthcare resources, translating into major health benefits for all smoking-related diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Bev Green for her invaluable contribution to trial administration, Fiona McRonald and Ghasem Yadegarfar for assisting with trial data collection and the trial participants who gave their time in completing questionnaires.
