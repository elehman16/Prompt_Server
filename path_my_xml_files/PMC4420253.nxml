Many patients in AMUs have a very short length of stay (&#x0003c; 1&#x02013;2 days), [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and are discharged home after assessment or a short period of stabilisation. More than 10% of all AMU attendees are frail older people, identified by the presence of one or more geriatric syndromes. [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121340.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Poor outcomes and high resource-use, observed for frail older people discharged from AMU, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121340.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] may be avoidable. [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] There is strong evidence for the effectiveness of the process to manage frail older people known as Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) in general [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121340.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] but little evidence for this approach applied in the urgent care context. We therefore developed a specialist geriatric medical intervention for older people at risk of adverse outcomes following discharge from acute medical units, to facilitate CGA aiming to reduce the incidence of adverse outcomes and associated high resource-use. This intervention comprised geriatrician assessment of patients on the AMU and further short term community follow-up to continue the assessment and oversight of the delivery of medical and non-medical community interventions.</p><p>A randomised controlled trial (RCT) in two hospitals in Nottingham and Leicester assessed the effectiveness of this specialist geriatric medical intervention (AMIGOS trial). [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121340.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] No effect of the intervention on patient outcomes at 90 days was shown: no significant differences between intervention and control group in days at home (primary outcome which took account of death, time spent in hospital, and any new care home placement), mortality, institutionalisation, dependency, mental wellbeing, and quality of life were found. [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The trial also showed no significant differences in health and social care resources use between groups. [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, the cost consequences and cost-effectiveness of the intervention in the AMIGOS trial have not previously been analysed. Our recent research provided innovative costing methodology to obtain accurate hospital cost estimates in the case of frail older people discharged from acute medical units, and to estimate both patient-level secondary and social care costs in the post-discharge period, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] which we could apply to the economic evaluation alongside the AMIGOS trial.</p><p>There are several reasons for undertaking economic evaluation in the AMIGOS trial even though the intervention being tested showed no clinical benefit (no statistically significant advantages on its primary or secondary outcome measures). First, economic analyses in geriatric medicine, conducted from health and social care perspectives, are important in guiding allocation of resources in elderly care. For example, a recent RCT of a specialist hospital unit for people with delirium and dementia showed no statistically significant benefit on its primary outcome measure [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and yet this unit was found to be cost-saving with a very high probability of cost effectiveness. [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Second, subgroup economic analyses can identify potential subgroups of patients in whom an improved clinical intervention might be targeted and evaluated in an appropriately powered study. Third, the evidence of the economic impact of other CGA interventions is inconsistent [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121340.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite recommendations to assess opportunity costs, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] only few include social care costs; the eight studies reporting costs in CGA trials in a recent review only reported costs from a hospital perspective, even though multiple health, social, private and voluntary agencies are involved in the care of frail older people which means that they did not consider whether costs were shifted to other areas of health care, or to social care or informal carers.[<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The objective of this study was to assess cost consequences and cost-effectiveness of the specialist geriatric medical intervention compared to standard care, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and publically funded personal social care. The trial-based economic evaluation is reported in accordance with the CHEERS Statement (<xref rid="pone.0121340.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Clinical trial</title><p>A one to one parallel group individual patient RCT, Acute Medical Unit Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Intervention Study (AMIGOS), was conducted.

Patients (aged 70 or over) at risk of future health problems (defined by a score of at least 2/6 on the Identification of Seniors At Risk tool [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), discharged from acute medical unit (AMU) within 72 hours of attending hospital, were eligible. Patients were excluded if they were not resident in the hospital catchment area, as were those without capacity to give informed consent and where there was no consultee available. Baseline clinical data collection was by interview with a researcher collected from the patient, family members, or other informal or professional carers. Research staff, not involved in recruitment or baseline data collection, and blind to allocation, determined outcomes at 90 days (&#x000b1;7 days) after randomisation. Routine records were examined for mortality, changes of address, and readmission.</p><p>Standard care on the AMUs before recruitment for both the control and intervention groups was delivered, and comprised assessment and treatment by a consultant physician and attending medical team (and by a multidisciplinary team of physiotherapist, occupational therapist and nurse, if needed). Patients&#x02019; general practitioners were responsible for all aftercare. Participants in the control group received no additional intervention over and above standard care. The specialist geriatric medical intervention was delivered in the intervention group. Participants in the intervention group were assessed before discharge from the AMUs by a geriatrician, who delivered and coordinated the delivery of any additional immediate care or aftercare they deemed necessary (a review of diagnoses; a drug review; further assessment at home or in a clinic or by recommending admission rather than discharge; advance care planning; or liaison with primary care, intermediate care, and specialist community services). The intervention was expected to be complete within one month of randomisation. Further details of the intervention are described elsewhere.[<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Between October 2010 and February 2012, 433 patients were recruited: 217 in the control group and 216 in the intervention group. Sixteen participants (11 in the intervention group) withdrawn at baseline after initial consent and were not included in clinical analysis at 90 days, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] nor they were included in the cost-effectiveness analysis (cost data and status (dead or alive) at follow-up were not available for those patients). Therefore, in the trial-based economic evaluation, 212 standard care and 205 intervention group participants were analysed at 90-day follow-up (262/417 (63%) patients from Nottingham). Baseline characteristics of the population and clinical effectiveness outcomes have been reported previously.[<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Trial-based economic evaluation</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Health effects</title><p>The health outcome for the cost-effectiveness analysis was quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, constructing utility values from the 3-level EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-3L) [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] with societal weights. [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Patient-reported EQ-5D-3L valuations at baseline and 90-day follow up (measuring health state on a scale in which 0 and 1 represent death and full health, respectively) were applied to estimate QALYs gained, assuming baseline utility until date of death for a patient dead at follow up. Therefore, a patient&#x02019;s QALYs gained were calculated as the area under curve using linear interpolation between EQ-5D-3L measurement points, and health outcome was summarised into a single index. Other trial health status measures, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] used in the imputation of missing self-reported EQ-5D-3L valuations, were: dependency in personal activities of daily living (Barthel ADL [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]), Charlson comorbidity score [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Identification of Senior at Risk (ISAR) items and score [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], presence of geriatric conditions, and cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Costs</title><p>To estimate cost of delivering the intervention, the interaction time of the geriatrician was recorded for every patient that received the intervention, which included the duration of interaction for: initial assessment including all related activities; home visits (travel time was included); phone calls with the patient; and other patient related activities.

Based on our previous research,[<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] extensive fieldwork was completed with the included agencies to derive parameters covering resource-use (details in <xref rid="pone.0121340.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Appendix</xref>).</p><p>Hospital care data (day-case, inpatient, outpatient and intensive care) were obtained from two patient administration systems for patients that attended five hospitals in Nottingham. The Secondary Users Service (SUS) database was interrogated to obtain day-case, inpatient and outpatient data in Leicester&#x02014;intensive care data was not available from this database.</p><p>Primary care resource-use data were obtained from Nottingham and Nottinghamshire GP practices. Of 84 GP practices serving our cohort, data were obtained from 53 practices (192/262 participants), coming from five electronic administrative record systems: SystmOne, 109 (57%); EMIS LV, 59 (31%); EMIS Web, 17 (9%); Synergy, 5 (3%); and EMIS PCS, 2 (1%), and were anonymised at the GP practice.</p><p>Ambulance service resource-use was extracted from the Caller Aided Despatch (CAD) IT service. The CAD system was cross-referenced with paper-based Patient Record Forms to identify participants (using participant name and place of pick-up). Data from mental healthcare services for older people were provided by the Nottinghamshire Healthcare Trust data via the RiO system. [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Social care services within two different catchment areas in Nottingham (City and County), operating two different electronic systems, were identified. Services consisted of contacts and assessments, and care plans. Care plans included home, day, residential and telephone care, housing and meals-on-wheels. Similarly, social care data were collected from two catchment areas (City and County) in Leicester.</p><p>Unit costs for primary care services were applied based on time taken to perform each task using time assumptions obtained from PSSRU 2011/12, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] empirical literature, or expert opinion, and mid-point yearly salary estimations taken from the NHS &#x0201c;Agenda for Change&#x0201d; pay rates. [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Unit costs of hospital care were applied using national reference costs according to Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) case-mix. Inpatient spell costs were adjusted for length-of-stay using standard excess bed day costs. Unit costs for other services were obtained from PSSRU, standard Department of Health costs and other reference costs for the 2011/12 financial year. [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The detail costing methods are described elsewhere, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and the sources of unit costs are presented in <xref rid="pone.0121340.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Appendix</xref>.</p><p>Unit costs were combined with resource-use to generate patient-level costs. Patient-level secondary (inpatient, daycase, outpatient) and social care cost, collected for both sites, incurred during the trial period were calculated for all trial participants who remained in the study at 90-day follow-up (patients who died during the study were not classed as &#x02018;withdrawn&#x02019;). Critical care, ambulance service, Mental Health Trust, and primary care costs, omitted in the two-centre cost-effectiveness analysis, were analysed for the Nottingham sub-sample.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The economic evaluation adopted a secondary (inpatient, daycase, outpatient) and social care perspective.

Forty five imputed datasets were generated; based on rule of thumb, number of imputations was equal to the percentage of patients with at least one variable in the imputation model missing, 45% (apart from missing EQ-5D-3L data, Barthel ADL scores were missing at baseline and follow up, 14% and 26%, respectively).</p><p>Secondary (inpatient, daycase, outpatient) and social care cost data, collected for both Nottingham and Leicester sites, and analysed in economic evaluation, were complete.

<sup>a</sup>Inpatient, day-case and outpatient cost data were collected for both locations, Nottingham and Leicester.

This statistically significant difference may be attributed to significantly higher percentage of care home residents in the Leicester sub-sample (34.2% vs. 21.0%, p &#x0003c; 0.01), for whom healthcare cost was significantly lower than for non-residents in the whole sample (by -&#x000a3;880 (95%CI: -1631, -192)), to other non-observable differences between Leicester and Nottingham patient populations, as well as to different coding systems between sites (<xref rid="pone.0121340.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Appendix</xref>). The two centre retrospective resource use datasets obtained for this study, and for related previous cost cohort study, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] did not allow us to ascertain the latter hypothesis and explain fully the reasons of the difference in secondary care costs between Nottingham and Leicester.</p></fn><fn id="t004fn002"><p>

This study showed that the total cost for participants who received the intervention was higher than for those receiving standard care. The intervention was not cost-effective, and probability that it was dominated by standard care (more costs and less QALY) was high. Subgroup analyses did not identify any group in which there was a significant advantage of the intervention over the control, although there were trends towards greater cost-effectiveness of the intervention in care home residents and moderate-risk (but not high risk) patients (2&#x02264;ISAR&#x0003c;4). Comparing the intervention to standard care, cost savings for inpatient care and higher costs for social, day case and outpatient care were observed (however, these unadjusted cost differences were non-significant, except day case care).</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Strengths and limitations: internal validity</title><p>The strengths of this study were that it was conducted as an independent but pre-planned part of a RCT, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121340.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and that resource-use data collection from various electronic systems and costing methods (tested previously in [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]) allowed accurate cost estimates to be produced. We applied EQ-5D-3L valuations to estimate QALYs due to its relevance for the UK policy makers. There were considerable EQ-5D-3L missing data at baseline and follow up, due to inability of frail older people, recently discharged from an acute medical care unit and in the post-discharge period, to complete EQ-5D-3L questionnaires. Additionally, 27% and 16% of participants had a prior dementia diagnosis and presented with cognitive impairment/confusion at baseline, respectively, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] which is likely to have negatively affected the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire response rate. The large set of clinical measures collected as part of RCT enabled imputation methods to deal with missing EQ-5D-3L data. Economic evaluation of such complex services needs to consider broader outcomes than the QALY, however other health and well-being potential benefits of the intervention were investigated previously in the RCT, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and no benefits were shown. A weakness was that full resource-use data were collected from only one of the two centres of the AMIGOS study, thereby limiting the analysis to the secondary care and social service perspective and reducing the precision of the findings. However, it did not affect the main findings because primary and tertiary care accounted for 1% of the difference in total costs in the Nottingham sample. Another limitation was that the study sample was too small to conduct stratified cost-effectiveness analysis, and to provide convincing findings from subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Findings in context: external validity</title><p>AMIGOS was one of the few studies to examine the value of a specialist geriatric medical intervention to at risk patients on acute medical units (AMUs), and this is the only economic study of this approach. There is evidence that comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is effective in older people, including acute care settings. [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121340.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] However, the cost-effectiveness studies on CGA are limited, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121340.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the economic value of CGA in the urgent care context was not yet known. The question how healthcare services can be configured to deliver high quality and efficient acute care for frail older people remains a challenge, and new forms of AMU services for older people which improve efficiency without adversely affecting mortality or re-admission rates merit further investigation. [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] The AMIGOS intervention was an attempt to deal with these needs, but despite no negative effect on mortality or re-admission, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] the overall economic impact of this intervention was shown to be unfavourable.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Interpretation</title><p>This study illustrates that although there are reasons to anticipate that specialist medical intervention might demonstrate clinical and economic advantages over standard medical care for at risk older people in acute medical units, these may not be seen when tested rigorously. The results presented here suggest there is a reasonable chance that standard treatment could be economically preferable. Thus, those developing, commissioning and providing such specialist services should carefully evaluate them and they should be seen as experimental until better models of care are developed that demonstrate robust evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. We had previously suggested that developments of this approach should consider targeting of the intervention upon higher-risk patients. [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] These results do not support this suggestion because there was a trend towards lower cost-effectiveness of the intervention in higher-risk group (ISAR&#x02265;4), compared to moderate-risk patients (2&#x02264;ISAR&#x0003c;4).</p><p>However, given the tendency towards better results in patients living in care homes, it is reasonable to consider developments of services focussed upon this group of patients and integrated with this sector of care. That is, in this sub-group of patients, the higher social care costs in the intervention arm were reversed to demonstrate some cost savings, resulting in favourable overall cost comparisons and a trend toward cost-effectiveness. This could be the consequence of the explicit intervention components of advance care planning or end of life care. These were more efficient for care home patients who were already primed for these events (more than patients living in their own homes). It is likely that, in the case of care home residents, social care resource use structure prior to the intervention made it possible to reduce spending as intended by other intervention components (social care maintenance costs), and keeping unchanged the costs that had already occurred (advance care planning). The (pre-planned) sub-group analysis (net benefit regression), supported by the above post hoc explanation of social care costs differences, suggests that the intervention targeted at patients admitted from care homes (or offered at care homes after a short stay at acute medical unit) might result in social care costs savings, overall cost reduction, and might be cost-effective. Hence, the specialist geriatric medical intervention is worth further evaluation in an appropriately powered study, in a larger population of care home residents.</p><p>Whilst the findings were not statistically significant, some savings were observed for inpatient care, and higher costs occurred for social, day-case and outpatient care, when comparing the intervention to standard care. The trade-off between inpatient stay and social care (combined with day-case hospitalizations and outpatient visits) was critical for the overall cost consequences and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. This observation demonstrates the need for inclusion of the social care perspective in economic evaluations of specialist services for older people, as reporting only hospital or secondary care costs would not depict the true economic impact of such services. The intervention was intended to limit the need for social care maintenance costs, but it did not reduce resource use in this sector, [<xref rid="pone.0121340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] as we showed higher overall costs occurred for social care in the intervention arm, resulting in unfavourable cost-effectiveness of the new service.</p><p>One of the explicit components of the intervention was to make use of outpatient and day case care to try to reduce subsequent health deterioration, the need for acute care, and readmissions. This study showed significantly higher costs of day case care and non-significantly higher costs of outpatient care, in the intervention arm, compared with standard care; the same patterns were observed for all sub-groups analysed as well. These findings are in line with the strategy of the delivery of medical interventions within the new model of care. Although some savings were observed for inpatient care (non-significant differences between groups), which might be the intended effect of more intensive use of day case and outpatient care, the overall economic impact of the intervention was negative and was driven by its effect on social care costs. The above discussion on the subgroup of care home residents, for whom the structure of social care spending is different, supports this notion.</p><p>This study provides evidence to guide resource use data collection for future economic evaluations of geriatric hospital services. The negligible impact of primary care on theoverall cost of the intervention suggests that resource use data from this sector of care might not be worth collecting and costing in future research; this process was found to be extremely time consuming and expensive and so this study provides the argument that more time and effort should be put into secondary and social care cost data. The large differences in secondary care costs between Nottingham and Leicester and different costs of the intervention between the two sites (suggested by the Nottingham sub-sample cost analysis for all services) confirm the value of the two-centre trial and justify the need for multicentre studies to obtain more generalisable results on cost-effectiveness.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0121340.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist for AMIGOS clinical trial manuscript (Edmans J., Bradshaw E., Franklin M., Gladman J., Conroy S. &#x0201c;Specialist geriatric medical assessment for patients discharged from hospital acute assessment units: randomised controlled trial.&#x0201d; <italic>BMJ</italic> 2013;347:f5874 doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.f5874">10.1136/bmj.f5874</ext-link>)</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0121340.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0121340.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Judi Edmans, Simon Conroy, Rowan Harwood, Sarah Lewis, Rachel A Elliott, Philippa Logan et. al. &#x0201c;Acute medical unit comprehensive geriatric assessment intervention study (AMIGOS): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.&#x0201d; <italic>Trials</italic> 2011, 12:200.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0121340.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0121340.s003"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>CHEERS Statement for the AMIGOS economic evaluation study</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0121340.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0121340.s004"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Summary of resource-use parameters obtained in the AMIGOS study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0121340.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0121340.s005"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><title>Cost subgroup analyses.
