It was approved by FDA and Health Canada in November 2014. The 6-year results from the FDA Core clinical trial are presented. Comparison of data for the three types of implants reveals certain advantages of the structured implant over saline and silicone gel implants.</p><p>This third type of implant is filled with saline, but uses an internal structure to make it behave as if filled with silicone gel. It contains a series of nested shells that support the upper pole when upright and control fluid movement to prevent bouncing. The result is an implant that combines certain key features and benefits from both saline and silicone gel implants. Like the saline implant, the filler is only saline, which women like for peace of mind in case of a rupture/deflation. Like the silicone gel implant, it has a natural feel, but without the risk of silent rupture and FDA-recommended MRIs - women can simply look in the mirror and know their implants are intact.</p><p><bold>METHODS:</bold> This US clinical trial began February 2009, with 502 women enrolled by February 2010: 399 for primary augmentation and 103 for replacement of existing saline or silicone gel implants. Investigators included 45 ABPS certified plastic surgeons at 35 sites.</p><p><bold>EXPERIENCE:</bold> Of the 502 women enrolled, 438 completed their 6-year follow-up visits, a rate of 87.3%. This follow-up visit rate is higher than for any other breast implant clinical trial, providing robust clinical data for analysis.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> For the 438 patients with 6-year follow-up, patient satisfaction with the outcome was 89.7% for primary and 91.6% for replacement augmentations; surgeon satisfaction with the outcome was 92.6% for primary and 94.0% for replacement augmentations. Adverse events per patient were tabulated by Kaplan-Meier risk rates of first occurrence: Baker class 3 &#x00026; 4 capsule contracture &#x02013; 5.7% for primary, 11.5% for replacements; rupture/deflation &#x02013; 1.8% for primary, 4.7% for replacements.</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> 6-year results from 438 women show that the structured breast implant has a high rate of patient and surgeon satisfaction, a low rate of capsule contracture and a low rate of rupture/deflation.</p></body></article>
