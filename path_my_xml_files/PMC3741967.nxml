Eighty-three live-related transplant recipients were randomly allocated to protocol biopsy group (Group I, <italic>n</italic> = 40) and a control group (Group II, <italic>n</italic> = 43). Other immunosuppressants in these groups consisted of either mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine and steroids. Protocol biopsies were conducted in biopsy group at 1, 6, and 12 months post-transplant. The non-biopsy group was followed by serial serum creatinine and biopsies in them were conducted as and when clinically indicated. Both groups were analyzed at 12 months with respect to graft function and survival. The two groups were similar with respect to age, number of dialysis pre-operatively, tacrolimus levels, induction therapy, donor age, and donor glomerular filtration rate. Forty protocol biopsies were conducted at 1 month, 31 at 6 months, and 26 at 12 months. The prevalence of sub-clinical rejection at 1, 6, and 12 months in these biopsies was 17.5%, 11.2%, and 10.3%, respectively. The prevalence of calcineurin inhibitor toxicity during same period was 15%, 15.5%, and 14.4%, respectively. The cumulative rejection rate in Group I and Group II at 12-month follow-up was 10.3% and 11.3% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.78), respectively, and cumulative calcineurin inhibitor toxicity at 12 months was 14.4% and 9.3% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.59), respectively, were not statistically significant. There was no difference in graft survival and function at 1 year. Protocol biopsies have a limited role in a well-matched renal transplant program with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression in the short term. However, the long-term impact of protocol biopsies needs further evaluation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Calcineurin inhibitors</kwd><kwd>live-related renal transplantation</kwd><kwd>protocol renal biopsy</kwd><kwd>sub-clinical rejection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The focus of interest is to increase the life of the transplanted graft. The introduction of cyclosporine in early 1980s and tacrolimus in early 1990s has decreased the incidence of acute rejection episodes, but it has not been translated into improved long-term graft survival. Pascual, <italic>et al</italic>, reported the annual rate of graft loss at 3-5%. They found chronic rejection and death with a functioning graft as leading cause for this graft loss.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>The development of chronic rejection has been consistently correlated with acute rejection episodes. But since the long-term survival has not improved with concomitant decline in episodes of acute rejection, the focus has shifted to know the prevalence and pathological significance of sub-clinical allograft inflammation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] It has been shown that treatment of clinically silent tubulitis lead to a significant improvement in renal function and improved long-term graft survival.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Serum creatinine has been shown to be a relative insensitive marker for detection of early graft pathology and is considered unreliable for assessment of adequacy of immunosuppression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Indeed, it has been shown that the features of chronic allograft nephropathy are reversible only within first 12 weeks post-transplant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>The introduction of tacrolimus in early 1990s led to various studies comparing it with cyclosporine.

Ethical clearance was taken from the hospital ethical committee. All patients were informed that they do not have to participate and were informed the risks and benefits of protocol biopsies. They were also explained that they could opt out at any stage. Patients who underwent a live-related renal transplant from April 2006 to May 2007 were enrolled. Patients with stable graft function having a serum creatinine of &#x0003c;1.9 mg/dl with a normal ultrasound and diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) scan at 1 week post-transplant were included in the study. In addition, patients had to have no clotting abnormalities and have tacrolimus levels within the therapeutic range. All patients undergoing a second renal transplant were excluded from the study. There was no difference between the two groups as regards body mass index and lipid profile at 1 week and 1 year post-transplantation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Immunosuppression</title><p>The immunosuppression was started on the day before transplantation. Tacrolimus was given in dose of 0.15 mg/kg along with either mycophenolate mofetil in dose of 500 mg twice a day or azathioprine in dose of 1.5-2 mg/kg. Patients who could afford were put on mycophenolate mofetil and those who could not were put on azathioprine. The dose of tacrolimus was adjusted to keep trough levels at 10-12 ng/ml in first 3 months, 8-10 ng/ml in the next 3 months, and 5-8 ng/ml thereafter. Tacrolimus levels were determined by the Abbot IMx tacrolimus II assay (Abbot Laboratories, Abbot Park, IL, USA). This procedure is based on the micro-particle enzyme immunoassay technology. All patients received methylprednisolone, in the morning of surgery pre-operatively and evening of surgery post-operatively. Oral prednisolone was started on first post-operative day at a dose of 20 mg once a day. It was tapered to 10 mg at the end of 6 months and 7.5 mg at the end of 12 months. Induction therapy with an IL-2 inhibitor was given to all patients who could afford this therapy. Daclizumab induction was used in 9 patients in the biopsy group and 12 in the non-biopsy group. Since this sample size was not sufficient, the impact of induction therapy was not analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Biopsy protocol</title><p>The patients included in the biopsy group were biopsied at 1, 6, and 12 months and as and when clinically indicated. The patients who underwent biopsy when clinically indicated were not again biopsied at the time required in the protocol, if it was done within 1 month of time of protocol biopsy. But they continued to be part of the biopsy group. The results of this biopsy were excluded from protocol biopsy for analysis. Crossover to other treatment regimen was considered as endpoint. Specimens were taken under ultrasound guidance from upper pole of the transplanted kidney under local anesthesia using 18-gauge spring loaded automated punch biopsy gun. Specimens reported as inadequate were re-biopsied.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Analysis of biopsy specimen</title><p>The specimens were fixed in formalin. They were analyzed by a single consultant pathologist who was blinded with respect to nature of immunosuppression. The Banff criteria[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] were followed for reporting. Since the study commenced in 2006, the Banff criteria of 1999 were used. The state of glomeruli, tubules, blood vessels, and interstitium were analyzed and abnormal histology if any was reported. Opinion on the single most probable cause for the given histological picture was taken with respect to the various causes of graft dysfunction which are as follows:</p><p>

One of the patients was converted to everolimus as the patient had biopsy features suggestive of calcineurin inhibitor toxicity and had persistently high levels of tacrolimus despite lowering the dose. The other patient was converted to cyclosporine due to failure to achieve adequate levels of tacrolimus. There was no clinically indicated biopsy. Out of the possible 38 protocol biopsies, 31 were conducted. In seven patients, protocol biopsies were not conducted, six patients did not turn up at required time, and one patient had high sugars requiring admission at the time of protocol biopsy.

The study showed that there may not be any benefit of protocol biopsy on graft function in short term.</p><p>The cumulative rejection frequencies in protocol biopsy group in our study at 1, 6, and 12 months were 17.5%, 11.2%, and 10.3%, respectively. Solez, <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] in their randomized study, had reported the rate of rejection at 1 year in patients on tacrolimus to be 32.9%. The higher rate of rejection in their study may be due to the fact that the study had cadaveric renal transplant recipients and used azathioprine as second immunosuppressant. Nankivell, <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] had reported that mycophenolate mofetil reduced tubulitis in graft kidney and was more effective than azathioprine in reducing sub-clinical rejection.</p><p>Gloor, <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] had reported prevalence of sub-clinical rejection to be 2.4% at 3-month surveillance biopsies in live-related transplant in patients on tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily). The low rate of sub-clinical rejection could be possibly due to higher dose of mycophenolate mofetil than used in our study. Also our study included patients who were on azathioprine.</p><p>Moreso, <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] had reported the prevalence of sub-clinical rejection in patients on tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil to be 14.2% biopsied between 4 and 6 months. The prevalence reported by Rowshani, <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] on similar treatment at 6 months was 15.2%. These rates were similar to our study.</p><p>Rush, <italic>et al</italic>., in their multicenter randomized study, had shown that there is no benefit of protocol biopsies in patients on tacrolimus- and mycophenolate mofetil-based immunosuppression. They reported the prevalence of sub-clinical rejection at 6 months was 9% in their study. Creatinine clearance in their study at 6 months was 72.9 &#x000b1; 21.7 ml/min in biopsy arm and 68.9 &#x000b1; 18.35 ml/min in control arm (<italic>P</italic> = 0.18) which was not statistically significant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the prevalence of calcineurin inhibitor toxicity was more than sub-clinical rejection, 14.4% versus 10.3%, respectively. Solez, <italic>et al</italic>. had reported the prevalence of tacrolimus toxicity to be 24.1% at 2-year protocol biopsy. They had also shown that nephrotoxicity and acute rejection were significant predictors of chronic graft nephropathy at 2 years after transplantation. To assess the impact of this on graft function requires a longer follow-up.</p><p>In conclusion, protocol biopsies may have a limited role in patients on tacrolimus in well-matched live-related renal transplant program role as far as detection of sub-clinical rejection and its impact on graft function are concerned. However, it may be an important tool to assess toxicity of calcineurin inhibitors as suggested by Racusen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Ekberg, <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] had recently reported that recipients on low-dose tacrolimus have better graft function as compared to standard dose cyclosporine and low-dose cyclosporine and sirolimus. Thus, protocol biopsy may be required to assess the best possible dose of tacrolimus without compromising graft function.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
