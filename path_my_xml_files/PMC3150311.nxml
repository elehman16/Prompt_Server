Potential mechanisms that link small LDL particles to increased risk of vascular events include: augmented oxidizability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and increased permeability through the endothelial barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As for HDL particle size, the mechanisms that link this parameter to increased CHD risk have yet to be firmly established, but may involve the altered activity of lipases involved with the maturation and transformation of lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Overweight and obesity are associated with an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype that is characterized by the predominance of small LDL and HDL particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Weight loss, by means of dietary restriction or exercise, has been shown to decrease the proportion of small LDL particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Two forms of dietary restriction currently implemented include calorie restriction (CR) and alternate day fasting (ADF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. CR regimens involve reducing energy intake by 15-40% of needs every day, whereas ADF regimens involve a day of partial energy restriction alternated with a day of ad libitum feeding. Both diets effectively reduce the proportion of small LDL particles once 5% weight loss is achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Moderate intensity endurance training is another lifestyle strategy that has been shown to decrease the concentration of small LDL particles with 5% weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. As for the effect of these interventions on HDL particle size, data are very limited. For instance, to our knowledge, no studies to date have examined the impact of either ADF or CR on HDL size. In terms of the effect of exercise on this CHD risk parameter, two recent reports demonstrate increases in HDL size after short intervention periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A key question that remains unresolved is whether these lifestyle therapies (i.e. diet versus exercise) are able to beneficially modulate HDL particle size <italic>in conjunction </italic>with LDL particle size. Given that small LDL and HDL particles are key risk factors for CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], a lifestyle regimen that could beneficially modulate <italic>both </italic>of these parameters may be considered highly cardio-protective. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to compare the effects of ADF, CR, and endurance exercise on changes in LDL and HDL particle size in overweight and obese subjects when a similar degree of weight loss is achieved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design and subject selection</title><p>A 12-week, randomized, controlled, parallel-arm trial was implemented as a means of testing the study objectives. Overweight and obese subjects (n = 60) were randomized into 1 of 4 groups: (1) ADF, n = 15, (2) CR, n = 15, (3) exercise, n = 15, or (4) control, n = 15. Key inclusion criteria were as follows: body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; age 35 to 65 y; non-diabetic; no history of cardiovascular disease; non-smoker; weight stable (&#x0003c;6 kg weight loss or gain for 3 months prior to the study); sedentary or lightly active (&#x0003c;3 h/week of light intensity exercise for 3 months prior to the study); and not taking weight loss, lipid, or glucose lowering medications. The experimental protocol was approved by the Office for the Protection of Research Subjects at the University of Illinois, Chicago. All volunteers gave their written informed consent to participate in the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Diet protocol</title><p>Only the ADF and CR groups participated in the diet intervention. Baseline energy needs were assessed using the Mifflin equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. ADF subjects were restricted by 75% of their baseline needs on the fast day, and ate ad libitum on each alternating feed day. The feed/fast days began at midnight each day, and all fast day meals were consumed between 12.00 pm and 2.00 pm. ADF subjects were provided with calorie-restricted meals on each fast day, and ate ad libitum at home on the feed day. CR subjects were restricted by 25% of their baseline energy needs each day, and were provided with all of their calorie-restricted meals throughout the trial. Study diets were provided as a 3-day rotating menu, and were formulated based on the American Heart Association guidelines (30% kcal from fat, 15% kcal from protein, 55% kcal from carbohydrate). Subjects in the control and exercise groups were permitted to eat ad libitum every day, and were not provided with meals from the research center. The ADF and CR diets were designed to produce ~5% weight loss after 12 weeks of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise protocol</title><p>Only the exercise group participated in the training intervention. These subjects participated in a moderate intensity exercise program 3 times per week under supervised conditions, for 12 weeks. Exercise was performed using stationary bikes and elliptical machines. Training intensity was estimated for each individual using an age-predicted heart rate maximum (HRmax) equation [209 &#x02212; (0.7 &#x000d7; age)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and a Polar Heart Rate Monitor (Polar USA, Inc., NY). At the beginning of the study, each exercise session ran for 45 min and correspond to 60% of the subject's HRmax. Training duration and intensity was then increased incrementally at week 4, 7 and 10 by 5 min and 5% HRmax. As such by week 10, each subject was exercising for 60 min at an intensity of 75% HRmax. Subjects in the ADF, CR, and control groups were asked to maintain their regular level of activity throughout the course of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical measures</title><p>Twelve-hour fasting blood samples were collected at baseline (week 1) and post-treatment (week 12). Plasma total cholesterol, direct LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations were measured in duplicate using enzymatic kits (Biovision Inc., Moutainview, CA, USA). LDL and HDL particle size were measured by linear polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] (Quantimetrix Lipoprint System, Redondo Beach, CA). High-resolution 3% polyacrylamide gel tubes were used for electrophoresis. Briefly, 25 &#x000b5;L of sample was mixed with 200 &#x000b5;L of liquid loading gel containing Sudan black, and added to the gel tubes. After photopolymerization at room temperature for 30 min, samples were electrophoresed for 1 h (3 mA/gel tube). Lipoware computer software (Quantimetrix, Redondo Beach, CA) was then used to divide LDL into small (&#x0003c;255 &#x000c5;), medium (255-260 &#x000c5;), and large (&#x0003e;260 &#x000c5;) particles, and HDL into small (&#x0003c;73 &#x000c5;), medium (73-88 &#x000c5;), and large (&#x0003e;88 &#x000c5;) particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Results are presented as mean &#x000b1; SEM. Differences between groups at baseline and post-treatment were tested by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey's tests. Changes from baseline to week 12 within an intervention group were tested by Student's paired t-test. Baseline values of the subjects who did not complete the trial were included in the analysis. <italic>P </italic>values &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered significant.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], 5% weight loss by ADF decreased the proportion of small LDL particles in obese volunteers after 8 weeks of treatment. The present study adds to this body of evidence by demonstrating that ADF may be <italic>more effective </italic>than CR at modulating LDL particle size. For instance, we show here that ADF was able to increase the proportion of large LDL particles while decreasing the proportion of small LDL particles. Conversely, these effects on LDL distribution were not demonstrated by CR. Since a decrease in the proportion of small LDL particles is a stronger predictor of CHD risk than LDL integrated size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], these results suggest that ADF may confer added protection against CHD when compared to CR. The mechanisms whereby ADF and CR confer different effects on LDL particle size are unknown at present, but will be an interesting area of future investigation in this field. These two diets were similar, however, in that neither had any impact on HDL particle size distribution. Although the reason for this lack of effect is not clear, it is possible that a greater degree of weight loss (i.e. 10-15%) may be required to modulate HDL particle size. Since this is first study to test the effects of ADF and CR on HDL particle size, there are no studies to which to compare the present findings.</p><p>The impact of 12 weeks of endurance exercise on HDL and LDL size was also investigated. We show here that exercise beneficially modulated HDL particle distribution by decreasing the proportion of small HDL particles and increasing the proportion of large HDL particles. These results are complementary to other recent reports. For example, Brown et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] demonstrated significant decreases in the proportion of small HDL particles after 12 weeks of endurance training in obese women with only 2% weight loss. Likewise, Obisesan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] observed significant increases the proportion of large HDL particles with 24 weeks of endurance training in overweight adults with 6% weight loss. As for LDL particle size, no beneficial exercise-induced effects were noted in the present study, which is in contrast to what has been demonstrated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A couple of factors may account for the lack of effect of exercise on LDL subfractions. Firstly, our intervention period may have been too short to observe an effect since previous work only demonstrates decreases in LDL particle size with &#x0003e;24 weeks of training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Secondly, the intensity of our exercise program may have not been sufficient (i.e. 60-75% HRmax), since decreases in LDL size are generally only shown with training intensities &#x0003e;75% HRmax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It will therefore be important for upcoming trials testing similar objectives to take into account these minimal requirements for trial length and training intensity.</p><p>In summary, these results indicate that dietary restriction is able to markedly increase LDL particle size, while endurance training is able to augment HDL particle size, with minimal weight loss (5% from baseline). None of these interventions were able to modulate <italic>both </italic>LDL and HDL size, however. Nevertheless, since these lifestyle strategies appear to have complementary effects, it will be of interest for future studies to test whether concomitant increases in HDL and LDL particle size can be attained when ADF or CR is combined with exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KAV designed the study and prepared the manuscript.
