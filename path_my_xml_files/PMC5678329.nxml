Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) is an addition to the surgical armamentarium. The study aims to compare the outcomes of FLACS using LenSx&#x02122; (Alcon Inc., USA) to standard 2.2 mm clear corneal phacoemulsification. Prospective case&#x02013;control, comparative, interventional study was conducted in a tertiary care center.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>In each group, 55 eyes of 55 patients underwent cataract surgery using either FLACS or conventional phacoemulsification (control group). The primary outcome variables, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), specular microscopy, pachymetry, mean absolute error (MAE), and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were compared between two groups at 4 weeks postoperatively. Intraoperative effective phaco time (EPT), postoperative circularity of the rhexis, capsular overlap over the edge of the intraocular lens (IOL), and decentration of the IOL were the secondary variables which were compared.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>No significant difference was found between the groups for UCVA, pachymetry, MAE, and ACD at 4 weeks postoperatively. The FLACS group had better BCVA (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0294).

The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of FLACS to standard 2.2 mm clear corneal phacoemulsification.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p>Fifty-five patients who opted for FLACS constituted the study group. The control group was chosen consecutively from among the patients undergoing standard 2.2 mm clear corneal phacoemulsification, matched for the nuclear hardness of the study group after the fulfillment of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This was because the study was not supported by any industry contribution or funded from other sources. Both surgeries of study and control group were done by the same surgeon.</p><p>We compared the primary outcome variables which were uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 4 weeks, difference in specular microscopic endothelial counts pre- versus post-operative at 4 weeks, pachymetry pre- versus post-operative at 4 weeks, fluid used intraoperatively, mean absolute error (MAE), and comparison of incidence of complications and wound integrity as assessed by Seidel test after the surgery.</p><p>We also compared secondary outcome variables which were anterior chamber depth (ACD) preoperatively versus postoperatively, circularity of the capsulorhexis, capsular overlap over the edge of the intraocular lens (IOL) optic, decentration of the IOL, and effective phaco time (EPT). All patients signed informed consent and the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki were adhered to.</p><p>Patients with visually significant cataract undergoing cataract surgery were included. Exclusion criteria were coexistent retinal pathology, glaucoma, nondilating pupils, and subluxated lens/zonular weakness, or preoperative endothelial counts &#x0003c;2000 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Preoperatively, we documented BCVA as assessed by Snellen chart, grade of cataract as per the LOCS III classification, fundus examination, biometry with the third generation formulas, specular microscopy to record endothelial cell count, pachymetry, and slit lamp photograph (retro illumination and slit). A single surgeon (PRM) performed both the surgeries for all study patients.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery</title><p>Under topical anesthesia, in the laser operation theatre (OT), FLACS standard procedure was used with Soft fit&#x02122; patient interface, and femtosecond laser was used to make the rhexis, nucleofractis, main and two-side port incisions. The patient was shifted to the OT, and under topical anesthesia, the subsequent steps of the surgery was done after the incisions were opened. The phacoemulsification machine used was Infinity&#x02122; (Alcon Inc., USA). The viscoelastic used was Viscoat&#x02122;. Preset parameters were used for each grade of cataract. Wherever mydriasis was insufficient, intracameral adrenaline was used.</p><p>Standard 2.2 mm phacoemulsification: Under topical anaesthesia, clear corneal incisions, and two-side port incisions were made by keratome and side opening knives. The phaco technique used was direct Phaco chop technique. Viscoat&#x02122; was the viscoelastic used, and the machine used was Infinity&#x02122; (Alcon Inc., USA). The same preset parameters were used for each grade of cataract. Intraoperatively, we documented EPT, volume of fluid consumed, and any complications during the surgery.</p><p>Postoperatively, seidel test was done at the end of procedure, at end of 1 h of surgery, and at 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day. At 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day; visual acuity and anterior segment examination of the operated eye in both procedures were assessed. At postoperative 4<sup>th</sup> week, in both procedures, following were assessed: UCVA, BCVA, anterior segment examination, residual refractive error (analyzed using the MAE, i.e., the difference between predicted and achieved postoperative spherical equivalent refraction), documentation of anterior chamber depth, specular microscopy for endothelial cell count, and pachymetry. Dilated pupil slit lamp retro-illuminated photograph of the eye to assess circularity of capsulorrhexis and capsular overlap, and decentration of IOL was also taken. Photographs were imported into Adobe Photoshop CC 2014 version (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, California, USA) to measure the circularity, capsular overlap over the edge of the IOL, and decentration of the IOL. The above parameters were measured by Adobe Photoshop software [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Calculation of secondary outcome variables using Adobe Photoshop software</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJO-65-942-g001"/></fig><p>Circularity is a parameter used to determine the regularity of the shape of the capsulotomy according to the following formula: Circularity = 4&#x003c0; &#x000d7; (area/perimeter<sup>2</sup>). The values of 1.0 indicate a perfect circle/superior circularity [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>]. Capsular overlap was evaluated to record whether the capsulotomy shows uniform overlap over the edge of the IOL optic. Capsular overlap is the ratio of the shortest and longest distance between the edge of the capsulorhexis and the edge of the IOL optic (distance minimum/distance maximum). A value close to 1 indicates a superior capsular overlap [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>]. Decentration of IOL is the distance from center of the pupil to center of the optic of IOL.

The amount of difference and statistical significance, however, is not very high (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0294), also no difference was seen between the groups in UCVA. The ESCRS study on long-term clinical outcome after femtosecond cataract surgery also showed only a slightly better mean postoperative BCVA in the femtosecond group[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] (96.37% vs. 93.55% achieving 6/12 or better, <italic>P</italic> = 0.07).</p><p>Specular microscopic central endothelial counts decreased postoperatively for both the groups but the percentage of cell loss in the femtosecond group was found to be higher (14.4% cell loss in the femtosecond group and 10.2% in the control group, <italic>P</italic> = 0.032) as compared to the control group. This slightly higher endothelial cell loss in the femtosecond group in our study could be due to the fact that the incisions in the laser group tend to be more corneal, which could have caused the drop in the central endothelial cell count due to turbulence of the fluid. The extent to which corneal incisions were into clear cornea from the limbus has not been analyzed in our study. Jun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] concluded in their study that the pupil size decreased significantly after femtosecond laser pretreatment of cataract surgery. Although we did not document the incidence of miosis after femtosecond laser pretreatment in our study, the intracameral use of adrenaline in patients with miotic pupil could have caused the loss of corneal endothelial cells in the femtosecond group. Although the endothelial cell count had decreased postoperatively, pachymetry was not significantly affected between both the groups. This shows that the reduction in the endothelial count in both the groups did not have a morphologically measurable effect and was not clinically significant. Other studies in literature have found no difference in endothelial counts between the two groups.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In our study, there was no significant difference in the MAE between the femtosecond and the control group. Filkorn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] found that at 6 weeks after the surgery, MAE was significantly lower in the femtosecond group as compared to the control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04). This difference was accounted possibly due to more precise capsulorrhexis, resulting in more stable IOL position. Our study, however, despite demonstrating the superiority of the circularity of the rhexis and IOL centration, did not show difference in the MAE between the groups.</p><p>Intraoperatively, both the groups did not have any significant difference in the incidence of complications. Abell <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] had similar results. The change in the ACD postoperatively is an indicator for lens positioning. In our study, it was found that both the procedures did not have any significant difference in the ACD change postoperatively. We could, therefore, infer that effective lens position postoperatively would be similar in the two groups. The findings in our study and other published reports do substantiate the fact that femtosecond cataract surgery results in a more consistent capsulorhexis and IOL centration with more ideal overlap of rhexis margin over the IOL.</p><p>The overall mean effective phacoemulsification time was significantly lower in femtosecond group (49.61 &#x000b1; 38.87 s) as compared to the control group (96.43 &#x000b1; 65.36 s) for similar grade of cataract. The ESCRS study[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] also showed that effective phacoemulsification time was reduced by 85% in the FLACS group.</p><p>The final results of the study from the European Registry of Quality Outcomes for Cataract and Refractive Surgery comparing the two surgical techniques, however, found that FLACS did not yield better visual or refractive outcomes than conventional phacoemulsification cataract.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Abell <italic>et al</italic>., in a study of more than 400 cases at a single center, found that the two cataract surgery techniques appear to be equally safe.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study does not include cost-effective analysis of the femtosecond laser pretreatment. As stated in the ESCRS study,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] at current cost to patients and utilizing real comparative cohort data, femtosecond laser pretreatment does not represent a cost-effective addition to conventional phacoemulsification (&#x02248;$3500 AUD cost/quality-adjusted life year for conventional phacoemulsification).</p><p>The corneal incision of FLACS is planned on a two-dimensional image on the screen while the actual incision happens on a curved albeit applanated cornea through the patient interface. Sometimes, incisions end up being more corneal than planned. Due to blanching of the Limbal vessels, following application of suction by the patient interface, the incision may not be completed in a vascularized corneal periphery. The number of times a corneal incision failed to open or was placed in a position which was different than where it was intended could have been studied. Femtosecond laser takes more time compared to conventional surgery because it is a staged procedure. We have not assessed this aspect in our study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of FLACS are by and large comparable to the results of standard 2.2 mm phacoemulsification.
