SCC represents about 20% of non-melanoma skin tumors, second only in frequency of occurrence to basal cell carcinoma [<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. SCC frequently occurs on the skin of the head or face in elderly people. In recent years, its incidence in the younger population has increased [<xref rid="b4-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Traditional treatments, including surgery and radio- chemo- and immune-therapy, may result in various injuries to the treated skin area (e.g., face) or to related organ functions [<xref rid="b6-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, focal non-invasive or mini-invasive treatment has become a research priority for skin tumors.</p><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a novel technique using photodynamic effect to diagnose and treat diseases [<xref rid="b8-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. PDT is a light sensitization reaction involving oxygen molecules accompanied with biological effects, based on related photodynamic effects [<xref rid="b9-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a common light sensitive reagent. PDT treatment process involves the excitation of the light sensitive reagent that has been absorbed into the tissue by applying a laser irradiating at specific wavelengths. The light sensitive reagent, when in excitation status, transduces the energy to peripheral oxygen molecules to generate reactive single oxygen molecules, which can then produce oxidative reactions. Moreover, adjacent biological macromolecules may produce cytotoxicity, further causing cell damage or apoptosis [<xref rid="b10-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Molecular studies have found that photodynamic therapy can directly damage the DNA structure of tumor cells; chromosomes have been shown to be in a condensed status, with the inhibition of enzymes that interrupts the DNA template structure and functionality, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis [<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Photodynamic effects also strongly inhibit transmembrane transport, directly causing tumor cell death [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, photodynamic effects can also cause destruction of endothelial cells of micro-vessels, accelerate the formation of platelet clots, and induce hypoxia and ischemia death of tumor cells. It can also destruct mesenchymal to prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis [<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. ALA-PDT is a combined mini-invasive therapy combining photosensitive reagents and respective light sources to generate free radicals and single oxygen molecules, both of which work as strong oxidants to damage focal tumor cells, and induce their apoptosis or necrosis [<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

PDT can destruct the genetic structure of tumor cells, and cause clotting or necrosis of chromosomes, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis, decreasing the bioactivity of DNA synthase, inhibiting membrane transportation, causing vascular endothelial cell injury, inducing tumor cell apoptosis, facilitating ischemia necrosis, and suppressing tumor metastasis or recurrence. PDT has high specificity in SCC treatment, as it can focally kill tumor cells without damaging normal tissue or cells [<xref rid="b17-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In addition to PDT targeted tumor cell killing effect, the selection of an effective light sensitive reagent is of critical importance, as the reagent can specifically targeted tumor cells via absorbing and emitting photons at specific wavelengths to accelerate killing targeted cells by photo polymerization effects. ALA is a second generation photosensitive reagent, and is the precursor in hemoglobin synthesis. Besides strong photosensitive activity, it also overcomes some of the weakness of first generation reagent, including photo-allergy and insufficient function on target cells. By using the endogenous light sensitive activity of ALA absorbed by cells with higher proliferative activity such as tumor cells, ALA can aggregate selectively to induce tumor cell apoptosis [<xref rid="b20-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For those SCC patients who are unwilling to accept surgery, ALA-PDT has satisfactory efficacy on tissue pathology, with advantages including ease, safety, effectiveness, small adverse effects, and better retention of cosmetic effects. The curative rate of primary and original SCC cases is high, including certain cases of complete cure. For late stage SCC, however, ALA-PDT had unfavorable efficacy, mainly due to limited penetrative depth of PDT (around 0.6 cm) [<xref rid="b22-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, a study has shown the correlation between PDT efficacy and tumor size, infiltrative depth, and malignancy [<xref rid="b23-medscimonit-23-1347" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, in our study, attrition was first performed on SCC at stage II&#x02013;IV, to reduce tumor size and infiltrative depth, followed by ALA-PDT under the full effective range as a focal anesthesia only. Results showed the satisfactory efficacy using attrition combined with ALA-PDT or single ALA-PDT in treating late stage SCC. The combined therapy, however, had improved overall effective rates compared to the single treatment, and decreased recurrence rate. Comparison among different stages of SCC showed decreased effective rates with SCC progression and higher recurrence rates. Minor adverse effects were found in both methods but without the requirement of adverse effect treatment and no difference between groups. Pathology examination showed significant improvement in tumor pathology after either treatment, without scars or facial injury. Further analysis of apoptotic protein p53 also showed elevated positive rates of p53 expression in both groups after treatment, with a more potent increase in the experimental group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Attrition combined with ALA-PDT in treating SCC effectively improved overall effectiveness rates, and reduced recurrence rates with reliability and safety. Due to this confirmed treatment effect, ALA-PDT can be considered as one of the selective plans for SCC treatment, with promising application in clinics.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
