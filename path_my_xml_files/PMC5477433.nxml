Routine oral calcium and Vitamin D supplementation have been proposed to prevent symptomatic hypocalcemia preventing morbidity and facilitating early discharge.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>A total of 208 patients with nontoxic benign thyroid disorders, undergoing TT, were serially randomized into four groups: Group A (no supplements were given), Group B (oral calcium &#x02013; 2 g/day given), Group C (calcium and calcitriol &#x02013; 1 mcg/day are given), and Group D (calcium, calcitriol, and cholecalciferol &#x02013; 60,000 IU/day are given). Patients were monitored for clinical and biochemical hypocalcemia (serum calcium, [Sr. Ca] &#x0003c;8 mg/dl), along with serum intact parathormone (Sr. PTH) and magnesium 6 h after surgery and Sr. Ca every 24 h. Intravenous (IV) calcium infusion was started, if any of the above four groups exhibit frank hypocalcemia. Patients are followed up with Sr. Ca and Sr. PTH at 3 and 6 months.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>All groups were age and sex matched. Hypocalcemia was observed in 72/208 (34.61%) cases. Incidence of hypocalcemia was higher in Group A (57.69%) and Group B (50%) compared to Group C (15.38%) and Group D (15.38%). Hypocalcemia necessitating IV calcium occurred in 31/208 (14.90%) patients. IV calcium requirement exceeded in Group A (26.92%) and Group B (23.07%) compared to Group C (5.76%) and Group D (3.84%). There was no statistical difference in basal levels of serum Vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, intact PTH, and 6 h after surgery. Permanent hypoparathyroidism developed in five patients on follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Routine postoperative supplementation of oral calcium and Vitamin D will help in the prevention of postthyroidectomy transient hypocalcemia significantly. Preoperative Vitamin D levels do not predict postoperative hypocalcemia.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hypocalcemia</kwd><kwd>total thyroidectomy</kwd><kwd>Vitamin D</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Postoperative transient hypocalcemia is observed in one-third to one-half of patients undergoing total thyroidectomy (TT).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It is now considered sequelae of TT rather than a complication.

This study was conducted between December 2013 and November 2014. Institutional Ethical Committee approval obtained as per requirements (Approval No. 46062014/ECR/270/Inst./TN/2013).</p><p>Patients with nontoxic, benign thyroid disorders undergoing TT were included in the study. Exclusion criteria comprise patients with proven or suspicious of malignancy, hyperthyroidism, reoperative surgery, elevated renal parameters (serum creatinine &#x02013; &#x0003e;1.2), patients already on supplemental calcium, and Vitamin D.</p><p>A total of 208 patients comprising 178 females and 30 males were enrolled in the study. Informed written consent was obtained from all patients. The patients were assigned into four groups using systematic sampling randomization method. Four is used as the sampling interval.</p><p>Group A is a control group in which no supplements were given; intervention was started only after the onset of clinical or biochemical hypocalcemia. In Group B, patients were started with supplemental oral calcium alone. Calcium carbonate tablets containing 2000 mg of elemental calcium were given in four daily divided doses. In Group C, patients were supplemented with oral calcium (2000 mg/day) and oral calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) 1 mcg/day in four divided doses. In Group D along with oral calcium and calcitriol, cholecalciferol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH) D<sub>3</sub>]) granules 60000 IU/day for 5 days were given. All these supplemental interventions were started 6 h after surgery.</p><p>The preoperative investigations include renal function test (blood urea and serum creatinine), thyroid function test (free T3, free T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]), serum calcium (Sr. Ca), Sr. magnesium (Sr. Mg), Sr. phosphorus, Sr. albumin, serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP), Sr. iPTH (Cobas e411; Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo), and Sr. 25(OH) D (DiaSorin; Liaison, von Hevesy-Strasse, Dietzenbach).</p><p>TT was performed in all the cases with a standardized technique as per the institution protocol. The procedures were carried out by one of the authors. An attempt was made to identify and preserve all four parathyroid glands. Parathyroid glands, if inadvertently devascularized or removed, were autotransplanted into sternocleidomastoid muscle immediately.</p><p>Sr. PTH, Sr. Ca, and Sr. Mg were measured after 6 h, and then, supplemental interventions were started for Groups B, C, and D as per the protocol. Sr. Ca was measured every 24 h for 5 days.</p><p>Patients were monitored for clinical and biochemical hypocalcemia and graded accordingly. Symptoms monitored for mild hypocalcemia are perioral numbness, tingling, paresthesiae of the distal extremities, and occasional muscle cramping. For moderate hypocalcemia, more severe muscle cramps and for severe hypocalcemia, tetanic muscle cramps, carpopedal spasm, seizures, life-threatening laryngospasm, and coma were considered.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Standard Chvostek's and Trousseau's sign were monitored in the postoperative period every 6<sup>th</sup> hourly.</p><p>Sr. Ca (corrected) &#x0003c;8.0 mg/dL is considered biochemical hypocalcemia.

The requirement of IV calcium infusion is minimized with calcium and Vitamin D supplementation. The addition of cholecalciferol did not provide any added advantage over calcitriol. Preoperative levels of Vitamin D are not a reliable marker to predict the occurrence of hypocalcemia. Immediate autotransplantation of parathyroids results in higher incidence of temporary hypocalcemia but is effective in negating the ill effects of long-term hypocalcemia and permanent hypoparathyroidism.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no
