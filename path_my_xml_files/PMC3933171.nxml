<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Similarly, we found that maternal vitD deficiency predicted low vitD status in EPTIs in agreement with our hypothesis.

As reported in studies in term infants,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> African&#x02013;American ethnicity, lack of maternal prenatal vitD intake and winter birth were predictive of low vitD status at birth in EPTIs. Since EPTIs are usually hospitalised after birth, vitD synthesis from sunlight exposure is lacking. Thus, repletion of vitD status during hospitalisation depends entirely on exogenous sources. There are limited recent reports on vitD intake in preterm infants during birth hospitalisation.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Our study demonstrated that although total daily vitD intake from all sources increased progressively with age (data not shown), only 60% of this cohort of infants achieved an intake of 400&#x02005;IU/day of vitD by 36&#x02005;weeks PMA or at discharge. During hospitalisation, low vitD status at birth and suboptimal vitD intake appear to militate against the achievement of serum 25(OH)D concentrations &#x02265;50&#x02005;nmol/L in many preterm infants. Although professional bodies<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> recommend 25(OH)D concentrations &#x0003e;50&#x02005;nmol/L to promote bone health, the effect of target serum 25(OH)D concentration on clinical outcomes in infants is lacking and merits evaluation.</p><p>Our study had several strengths. To our knowledge, it is the first reported multicentre investigation of vitD status in infants born &#x0003c;32&#x02005;weeks gestation and monitored longitudinally from birth until hospital discharge. It provides data on the vitD status achieved by EPTIs born &#x0003c;32&#x02005;weeks PMA based on conventional nutritional practices in the NICU settings. Thus, our results are likely generalisable to infants in NICUs and will inform future intervention trials to assess the effect of optimising vitD status in preterm infants on short- and long-term clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, neither the vitD intake, nor the recommended serum 25(OH)D concentrations of &#x02265;50&#x02005;nmol/L were attained in many EPTIs. The serum 25(OH)D concentrations of infants were directly correlated with maternal vitD status at birth. Therefore, vitD status should be optimised in pregnant women as part of strategy to replete the offspring. In addition, EPTIs require heightened attention to vitD supplementation in the NICU to improve vitD intake and vitD status. In view of potential putative roles for vitD in several biologic functions, studies are needed to test the effect of targeting serum 25(OH)D concentrations of &#x02265;50&#x02005;nmol/L on clinically relevant health outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the research nurses and staff of the Ohio Perinatal Research Network (OPRN) and the staff at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center NICU for assistance in collecting study samples.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> NM obtained Institutional Review/Ethical Board approval at University of Cincinnati Medical Center, enrolled subjects at the Cincinnati centre, extracted data from the electronic medical records, collated data on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D concentrations and wrote the first draft of the manuscript; JLS obtained Institutional Review/Ethical Board approval at the Columbus centres, enrolled subjects in Columbus, Ohio, collated and analysed the demographic and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D data, and contributed to several revisions of the manuscript; CS collated data on dietary intake of vitamin D and contributed to the Methods section of the manuscript; AD developed the concept for the study, supervised the conduct of the study and contributed to the revisions resulting in the final version of the manuscript; HTA developed the concept for the study, supervised the management of the data, supervised the conduct of the study and contributed to the later versions of the manuscript.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> None.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> University of Cincinnati, Ohio and Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio (Note: Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University have a reciprocity agreement in place.
