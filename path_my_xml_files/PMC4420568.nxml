However, it has not been fully determined whether the renoprotective effect of statins is independent of their lipid-lowering action. In addition, no reports are available that directly compare conventional statins and potent statins in terms of their renoprotective effects against CKD in patients with diabetes. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of pravastatin and atorvastatin on renal outcomes in diabetic patients with early diabetic nephropathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The present research project was a prospective study spanning 12&#x000a0;months, and was a randomized, open-label, clinical study. Patients were recruited from 2008 through 2010 from Kanazawa University Hospital, Toyama City Hospital and Fukui-ken Saiseikai Hospital. The enrolment criteria were as follows: the participants had to (i) be diabetic patients currently being seen on an outpatient basis, who had not been treated with statin therapy within 3&#x000a0;months of the start of the study; (ii) had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 120&#x02013;150&#x000a0;mg/dL two consecutive times; and (iii) had a blood serum creatinine (Cr) level of 0.9&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;mg/dL simultaneously with a test result of either microalbuminuria (&#x02265;30&#x000a0;mg/gCr) or positive proteinuria (qualitative) more than twice. Microalbuminuria and proteinuria were derived from proper laboratory tests. Participants could have either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, could be any age between 18 and 80&#x000a0;years, and could be either sex. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) poor blood pressure (BP) control (160/100&#x000a0;mmHg or higher); (ii) glycemic control that was either poor or unstable (the most recent glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c; National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) value] was 10% or higher, or change in HbA1c over the most recent 3&#x000a0;months was 2% or higher); (iii) patients with hematuria; (iv) patients with a urinary tract infection; and (v) patients with a past history of atherosclerosis, such as coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral artery disease. Informed consent to the study was obtained in writing from all study participants. The research protocol was approved by the ethics committee of each facility involved, and the study was carried out in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2">Figure S1</xref> summarizes the participants' progress through the trial from the perspective of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials criteria for randomized trials. After a prior assessment, 120 patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a group that would be treated with diet therapy, a group that would be given a statin (pravastatin) and a group that would be treated with a potent statin (atorvastatin). The subjects' identification number on their medical chart determined their group. Over the 12&#x000a0;months of the study, 43 of the patients would be provided with dietary guidance (the diet therapy group). The dietary guidance was provided by a national registered dietitian at the hospitals at least once every 3&#x000a0;months. The dietitian checked the meals and gave the participants some advice about the diet for diabetic nephropathy, such as restriction of protein (&#x0223d;0.8&#x000a0;g/kg) and salt intake (&#x0003c;6&#x000a0;g/day). The other 28 patients would be given 10&#x000a0;mg/day of pravastatin in addition to being provided with dietary guidance (the pravastatin group), and 35 patients would be given 10&#x000a0;mg/day of atorvastatin in addition to dietary guidance (the atorvastatin group).</p><p>Blood and urine samples were collected at minimum intervals of 3&#x000a0;months. If a patient began dialysis during the 12&#x000a0;months of the monitoring period, a final evaluation of that patient was carried out at that point. It was decided that, as a rule, the medications listed here would not be added to a patient's regimen during the monitoring period: therapeutic agents for the treatment of hyperlipidemia other than statins (fibrates, ezetimibe, nicotinic acid, probucol, resins, ethyl icosapentate formulations and others) and medications having an effect of reducing proteinuria, such as dipyridamole. Administration of the following would be carried out only at the minimum necessary level during the monitoring period: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics that affect renal function. It was decided that standard therapies consisting primarily of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) would be given with the aim of keeping BP under 130/80&#x000a0;mmHg (or under 125/75&#x000a0;mmHg if proteinuria 1&#x000a0;g/day or higher was observed). Adjustments for glycemic control would be made as necessary with oral medications or insulin dosages, in addition to diet and exercise programs, to keep HbA1c under 6.9% (NGSP) according to the guidelines of the Japan Diabetes Society<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><sec><title>Measurements</title><p>Height, bodyweight, BP, fasting blood values, and urine values were measured at baseline and at every consultation for 3&#x000a0;months. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height<sup>2</sup> (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TGs) were measured using commercially available kits. LDL-C was calculated by the Friedewald method. HbA1c was measured using the Tosoh G8 analyzer (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) at Kanazawa University Hospital, the Tosoh G7 analyzer (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) at Toyama City Hospital and the ADAMS A1c HA-8180 analyzer (ARKRAY, Kyoto, Japan) at Fukui-ken Saiseikai Hospital. Quality control of HbA1c measurements was carried out using the standard certified by the Japanese Diabetes Society (JDS). HbA1c values were converted to NGSP values using the formula provided by the JDS: HbA1c (NGSP)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.02&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;HbA1c (JDS)&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;0.25<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.</p><p>Serum cystatin C (CysC) was measured using nephelometry at Kanazawa University Hospital, the gold colloid aggregation method at Toyama City Hospital and the latex agglutination turbidimetric immunoassay at Fukui-ken Saiseikai Hospital; that is, in different ways at the different facilities. However, according to in-house test reports, there is an extremely strong correlation between nephelometry and the gold colloid aggregation method (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.996), and between the gold colloid aggregation method and the latex agglutination turbidimetric immunoassay (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.999). The urinary albumin-to-Cr ratio (U-Alb/Cr) was measured using the first morning urine. Albumin was measured using immunonephelometry. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the following formula recommended for Japanese patients<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>: eGFR (mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;194&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;Cr<sup>&#x02212;1.094</sup>&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;age<sup>&#x02212;0.287</sup>&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.739 (if female).

Atorvastatin, but not pravastatin, significantly decreased the U-Alb/Cr from the baseline, and the degree of this decrease was significantly greater compared with the diet therapy. Although there were no significant differences in the changes of eGFR among the three groups, atorvastatin significantly preserved CysC levels and eGFRcys compared with paravastatin. These findings showed that the renoprotective effects are different between atorvastatin and pravastatin, and that atorvastatin is more useful than pravastatin for its renoprotective effect in diabetic patients with early diabetic nephropathy.</p><p>Some studies have reported that atorvastatin has a protective effect on renal function<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. In the Greek Atorvastatin and Coronary-heart-disease Evaluation (GREACE) study, aggressive administration of atorvastatin induced an increase in Cr clearance (CrCl) after 6&#x000a0;weeks, and the effect was continued for up to 48&#x000a0;months<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. However, in the present study, eGFR did not change during the 12&#x000a0;months in the atorvastatin group, as well as in the diet group and pravastatin group. Our study findings are in concert with a previous single arm study<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, that in patients with CKD, administration of rosuvastatin, one of the other strong statins, at a dose of 2.5&#x000a0;mg for 24&#x000a0;weeks, significantly decreased U-Alb/Cr and CysC, but did not change eGFR.</p><p>These differences in the results might due to the low dose of statins used in the present study. In our study, we used 10&#x000a0;mg/day of atorvastatin, whereas, in the GREACE study, atorvastatin was started at 10&#x000a0;mg/day, and the dose was titrated up to a maximum of 80&#x000a0;mg/day (mean dose 24&#x000a0;mg/day)<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. The Treating to New Targets study showed that atorvastatin administration increased eGFR in a dose-dependent manner, and the increase was significantly greater in patients who received a high dose (80&#x000a0;mg/day) compared with those who received a low dose (10&#x000a0;mg/day)<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>.</p><p>Differences in the renal function of the study participants might also affect the results. In the GREACE study, renoprotective effects have been particularly prominent with respect to early-stage renal disease. The Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study also showed that atorvastatin improves eGFR in patients with type 2 diabetes with albuminuria, but not in those with normo-albuminuria<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Similar to the atorvastatin, pravastatin also prevented the decrease in eGFR in patients with moderate CKD (eGFR &#x0003c;40&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>), but not in those with mild CKD (eGFR &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>)<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. In our study patients, mean eGFR (61.4&#x02013;66.3&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>) was relatively preserved even though they had albuminuria/proteinuria. This might relate to the result that eGFR did not change in our study participants.</p><p>Furthermore, the short follow-up period may also affect the results. The Protection Against Nephropathy in Diabetes with Atorvastatin trial reported that in patients with type 2 diabetes with early renal disease, no statistical difference was observed in renal function between those taking high- (80&#x000a0;mg/day) or low-dose (10&#x000a0;mg/day) atorvastatin over 2.1&#x000a0;years<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. However, the study periods of this trial and our present study are shorter than those of the GREACE study and the Treating to New Targets study. Therefore, it is difficult to compare these results directly.</p><p>In the present study, U-Alb/Cr was significantly improved in the atorvastatin group, but not in the pravastatin group, at 12&#x000a0;months compared with the baseline. More strikingly, the change in CysC was significantly smaller, and eGFRcys was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group compared with the pravastatin group. To date, there are no reports that have compared the preventive effect on renal dysfunction progression between atrovastatin and other statins using CysC and eGFRcys as indices.</p><p>To date, eGFR and U-Alb/Cr calculated from serum creatinine (sCr) is commonly used for the diagnosis of CKD. However, because sCr does not change in a mild to moderate decrease in creatinine clearance (CrCl), eGFR and U-Alb/Cr calculated by sCr might not be effective to evaluate the renal function in a relatively early stage of CKD. In recent years, CysC has been tested as a better marker that detects an early decrease of CrCl in mild CKD. CysC is a low molecular mass serum protein that is freely filtered by the glomerulus and reabsorbed by the proximal kidney tubule. Serum Cr increases when CrCl decreases to 31&#x02013;50&#x000a0;mL/min, whereas CysC starts to increase from a milder CrCl decrease of 51&#x02013;70&#x000a0;mL/min<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Because eGFR is calculated based on the serum Cr, it does not reflect a mild decrease in CrCl in patients with relatively high CrCl. Thus, using the CysC and eGFRcys as indices for renal function could detect slight changes in CrCl, especially in patients with an early stage of CKD. Therefore, in the present study, we compared the differences of these makers for renal function. Together with the discussion here, longer study is required to conclude the effect of atorvastatin on eGFR calculated from sCr.</p><p>We postulate the reasons for the discrepancy between a significant, but subtle, effect on U-Alb/Cr and the obvious effect throughout the study period on CysC of atorvastatin beyond pravastatin. First, the Cr serum level is affected by diet, inflammation, age, sex, muscle mass, exercise and other parameters, whereas the CysC serum level is not affected by these factors<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Indeed, the standard deviation was much larger in U-Alb/Cr than CysC in the present study. Second, the discrepancy might suggest the specific mechanism underlying the protective effect of atorvastatin on renal function; statin might more preferentially improve GFR rather than hyperfiltration or size/charge barriers of the glomerular basement membrane. It is postulated that statins gradually increase GFR as a result of their pleiotrophic actions, such as endothelial vasodilation (and the increase in circulating plasma volume accompanying it), regression of atheromatous renovascular stenosis, regression of intimal hyperplasia in arcuate arteries or arteriosclerosis progression delay in afferent arterioles<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Future study evaluating the effect of atorvastatin stratified by impaired GFR-dominant and albuminuria/proteinuria-dominant types of diabetic nephropathy might test this hypothesis. Interestingly, a similar result was reported as a protective effect of an Nrf2 activator bardoxolone methyl on kidney function in CKD with type&#x000a0;2 diabetes<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Patients receiving bardoxolone methyl had a significant increase in eGFR and had a slight, but significant, increase in the U-Alb/Cr as compared with placebo at 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks. Therefore, the effect of statins on the Keap1/Nrf2 system in the kidney might be a novel issue worth investigating. Indeed, several statins were reported to activate Nrf2 signaling in the liver<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, embryonic fibroblasts<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, vascular smooth muscle cells<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and brain<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>.</p><p>The present results from multiple regression analyses showed that the use of atorvastatin affected CysC independently of its cholesterol-lowering effect. The previous prospective studies in diabetic patients with progressive renal disease compared the renoprotective effect of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin for CKD patients<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, and showed that the renoprotective effect was stronger in atorvastatin (80&#x000a0;mg/day) than high-dose rosuvastatin (40&#x000a0;mg/day), whereas rosuvastatin had stronger cholesterol-lowering effects. These results suggest that the renoprotective effect of atorvastatin would be due to pleiotropic effects beyond its lipid-lowering effect.</p><p>The strength of the present study is that it is a direct comparison between atorvastatin and pravastatin with respect to their effect on renal function. There has been no previous report that directly compared the effect of potent statins and conventional statins on the progression of CKD in patients with diabetes. Furthermore, there have been no reports that compared the preventive effect on renal dysfunction progression between atorvastatin and other statins using CysC as an index. Previous studies<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> suggest that the renoprotective effect of pravastatin is limited to moderate to severe kidney disease, and that atorvastatin has a superior effect on early diabetic nephropathy through its pleiotropic effect. Such properties of the different classes of statins might underlie the advantage of atorvastatin over pravastatin in the renoprotective effect, because the subjects enrolled in the present study had relatively mild CKD.</p><p>There were several limiting factors in the present study. First, CysC was measured in different ways at the different facilities. However, according to in-house test reports, there is an extremely strong correlation between nephelometry and the gold colloid aggregation method, and between the gold colloid aggregation method and the latex agglutination turbidimetric immunoassay. As a result, we postulate that as long as CysC is measured using the same method, there is a strong possibility that similar results can be obtained. Second, the number of patients happened to be different in the three groups because we used the participants' identification number on their medical chart to determine their group. However, baseline characteristics, such as sex, age and blood pressure, were not different among the three groups, and the results observed in the present study are independent of these confounding factors, which affect the changes in renal function. Finally, kidney biopsy was not carried out in all cases. In particular, three patients out of 14 patients with macroalbuminuria were not complicated with diabetic retinopathy. We ruled out malignancy-associated membranous nephropathy and other nephritis syndrome clinically in these patients.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study showed that atorvastatin inhibits the elevation of CysC in diabetic patients to a greater extent than pravastatin. In addition, this renoprotective effect was considered to be the result of the pleiotropic effect of atorvastatin independent of its lipid-lowering effect. For lipid management in diabetic patients, atorvastatin is more effective than pravastatin in terms of preventing increase in CysC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all of the medical and nursing staff at the Kanazawa University Hospital, Toyama City Hospital, and Fukui-ken Saiseikai Hospital for their dedication and commitment to collecting and examining the patients' blood and urine samples.
