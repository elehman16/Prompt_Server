The proportion of acute medical emergencies contributed to by this age group has seen a significant rise in the last 5 years from 9.5% to 14% and with ageing trends, this is expected to increase significantly over the next 10 years [<xref rid="afw149C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For older people, hospital length of stay is much longer, the risk of hospital acquired complications much higher, discharge planning more complex and 28-day readmission rates much greater, compared to younger patients admitted to hospital [<xref rid="afw149C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although, some hospitals in the UK have seen a significant reductions in hospital length of stay, 28-day readmission rate has increased. Nationally over the last 6 years, 28-day readmission rate has increased from 11% to 14% (DH, Emergency Admission Rates, 2008). The reasons for these readmissions are multifactorial, but an important component is the availability of appropriate resources in the community, which are able to respond to the needs of these patients in a responsive manner. Patient safety is often compromised during this vulnerable period, with high rates of medication errors [<xref rid="afw149C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="afw149C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], incomplete or inaccurate information on transfer [<xref rid="afw149C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and lack of appropriate follow-up of care [<xref rid="afw149C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Collectively, this leads to fragmented discharge planning and increased rates of recidivism to high-intensity care settings.</p><p>In England and Wales, to address the problem of rising readmission rates, the Department of Health has allocated &#x000a3;300 million, as part of the &#x02018;funding for reablement linked to the hospital discharge&#x02019; funding stream (Department of Health, 2012). This money was to be spent on developing local plans in conjunction with the Local Authority, Foundation Trusts/NHS Trusts and Community Health services, to facilitate seamless care for patients on discharge from hospital and prevent avoidable hospital readmissions. Some Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) have invested in &#x02018;early supported discharge at home&#x02019; schemes, some into &#x02018;community-based rehabilitation&#x02019; schemes and some very little investment at all. Reviews of the literature (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Appendix 1 in the Supplementary Data, available at <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online</xref>) suggest that it is currently unclear which are the most effective and efficient structures and organisation of community/intermediate care services in relation to their purpose [<xref rid="afw149C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="afw149C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The aims of this study were therefore to examine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such a service, the Community In-Reach and Care Transition (CIRACT) service, compared to standard current UK practice, the traditional hospital-based rehabilitation (THB-Rehab) service.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="afw149s10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="afw149s10a"><title>Trial design</title><p>Single-centre pragmatic randomised controlled trial (1:1 allocation ratio) with an integral health economic study.</p></sec><sec id="afw149s10b"><title>Participants</title><p>Frail older people (aged 70 years and older) admitted to the elderly care medical wards as an acute medical emergency.</p></sec><sec id="afw149s10c"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Eligible if all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were met.</p><sec id="afw149s101b"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>

The EQ-5D-3L scores were converted into QALYs using linear interpolation and area under the curve methods for the trial period. These were adjusted for baseline differences between the groups. The results are presented using the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER).

[<xref rid="afw149C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] which reported that a structured discharge plan tailored to the individual patient showed a small but significant reduction in hospital length of stay and readmission rate for older people admitted to hospital with a medical condition (mean difference -0.91 days, 95% CI &#x02212;1.55 to &#x02212;0.27). However our findings were similar to the review by Bachmann <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="afw149C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] which showed no significant difference in length of hospital stay in inpatient rehabilitation specifically designed for geriatric patients.</p><p>An important factor in the interpretation of the systematic review and meta-analysis above is the definition of the intervention, where it is delivered and the subsequent understanding of the relative contribution of each member within the makeup of the team. It was acknowledged in the review by Sheppard <italic>et al</italic> that while the authors of all of the trials provided some description of their interventions, it was not possible to assess how some components of the process or working makeup of the team members compared between trials. In the review by Bachmann, half of the studies included patients in community hospitals in contrast to our study-acute hospital care. The context in which an intervention such as discharge planning is delivered may also play a role, not only in the way the intervention is delivered, but in the way services are configured, which may also explain some of these differences. In the systematic review by Sheppard <italic>et al</italic>, ten of the trials were based in the USA, five in the UK, three in Canada, one in Australia, one in Denmark and one in France. In the systematic review by Bachmann, of the 8 general geriatric rehabilitation studies, only 2 were UK studies, both of which were undertaken in community hospitals. In every country the orientation of primary care services differs, which may affect both the delivery and communication between services. Different perceptions of care by professionals of alternative care settings, and country specific funding arrangements, will also influence timely discharge. Of the five UK studies highlighted above, three were studies of psychiatric in-patients, one stroke patients, and only one, general medical in-patients [<xref rid="afw149C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Readmission rates were a secondary, but also recognised as an important outcome. Our findings are in contrast to recent published studies which have evaluated similar transition care models. The systematic review by Shepperd <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="afw149C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported a 15% reduction in the 30-day readmission rate. The BOOST toolkit which included a number of similar components as our CIRACT service: risk assessment, medication review, discharge checklist and a multidisciplinary team-based approach to the discharge process showed modest reductions (2&#x02013;6%) in the 30-day readmission rate [<xref rid="afw149C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The Transitional Care Model (TCM), which incorporated a multidisciplinary approach to patient care, led by a transitional care nurse &#x02018;transition coach&#x02019; (TCN), who followed patients from the hospital to home, facilitated communication with outpatient providers and performed a series of home visits and telephone follow-up calls in the post-discharge period, similarly showed a reduction in the 90-day readmission rate between 13% and 48% [<xref rid="afw149C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="afw149C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>There are several possible explanations why the CIRACT service did not shorten hospital length of stay or reduce short-term readmission rates, compared to THB-Rehab service. The timing of delivery of an intervention such as discharge planning, which depends on organising other services, will have some bearing on how quickly these services can begin providing care. Although the CIRACT service was different to the THB-Rehab service, both services fed into similar community configured services; therefore, bottlenecks in providing community personal care services (for example community care support provided by social services) may have led to delays in both groups and potentially masked any significant benefits of the CIRACT intervention. Other service models that have been successful, but of which key interventions were not included as part of our CIRACT service have incorporated a more focused review on medicine management and the development of a portable personal health record. Project Reengineered Discharge (RED) focused on a multidisciplinary approach to patient care, coordinated by a nurse discharge advocate (DA) [<xref rid="afw149C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The DA engaged patients during their admission to hospital, provided clinical information and an individualised, illustrated plan post-discharge. However, following discharge, a pharmacist performed a telephone follow-up including a medication review with direct communication to the primary outpatient provider. There was a non-significant 6% reduction in the 30-day readmission rate and significant 8% reduction in 30-day visits to the Accident and Emergency post-discharge. In the Care Transitions Intervention, an advanced practice nurse &#x02018;transition coach&#x02019; performed the post-discharge home visits and telephone calls emphasising patient engagement and self-management in the care of chronic diseases. This program reduced 30-day readmissions by 4&#x02013;6% [<xref rid="afw149C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="afw149C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and 90-day readmission rate by 6&#x02013;22% [<xref rid="afw149C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="afw149C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Some of these elements were not present in our service. Another feature of many of the successful studies is the management of patients with specific chronic diseases, such as congestive cardiac failure, chronic obstructive airways disease and stroke disease rather than patients as in this study, who had a high prevalence of multiple co-morbidities: mean age 84 years, mean MMSE 22/30 (significant cognitive impairment), mean Barthel 11/20 (significant disability) and mean co-morbidity score 7.4 (no co-morbidities equal to 0). In disease-specific states, medication management may have a greater role in patient outcomes and interventions which address this, possibly by incorporating the patient's GP or a community geriatrician may be more effective.</p><p>A number of limitations are recognised in this study. Patients were recruited from a single catchment area with a high number of patients excluded who were not living in the study catchment area, but admitted to the medical wards where participants were being actively rehabilitated. Thus, there were situations where the case workload of the THB-Rehab staff on some occasions was almost twice that on the CIRACT team, although there were no significant differences in any of the outcomes. Secondly and perhaps more important was the power of the study. The study was powered to show a large difference of 3 days, between the two groups, based on our early pilot work. The lower CI would have been unable to exclude any significant differences of less than 2.3 days, which clearly are important.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="afw149s13"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the CIRACT service as a complex intervention did not reduce major hospital length of stay nor short-term readmission rates compared to the THB-Rehab service; however, a modest (&#x0003c;2.3 days) but worthwhile effect cannot be excluded The estimated ICER appears cost-effective, although it is subject to much uncertainty that spans all four quadrants of the cost-effectiveness plane such that caution should be used in interpreting this result. Further studies are necessary powered with larger sample sizes, cluster randomisation (to reduce bias), but more importantly including a more integrated community medical model as part of the CIRACT team.<boxed-text position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key points</title></caption><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The proportion of acute medical emergencies contributed by older people has seen a significant rise in the last 5 years from 9.5% to 14% and is expected to increase significantly over the next 10 years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Optimal models of integrated service delivery to reduce length of stay and readmissions remains unclear.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A community in reach and care transition team consisting of a senior occupational therapist (transition coach), senior physiotherapist and assistant practitioner, linked directly to a social services practitioner, working across multiple boundaries with patients and their carers does not reduce major length of stay or readmissions.</p></list-item></list></p></boxed-text></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="aa-15-0794-File001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="afw149ack1"><title>Acknowledgements and Funding</title><p>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Appendix 5 in the Supplementary data, available at <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online</xref>.</p></ack><sec id="afw149s15"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>
