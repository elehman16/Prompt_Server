Night Shift was developed to recalibrate the process of using pattern recognition to recognize moderate-severe injuries (representativeness heuristics) through the use of stories to promote behavior change (narrative engagement). Physicians were randomized with a 2&#x000d7;2 factorial design to intervention (game <italic>v</italic> traditional education apps) and then to the experimental condition under which they completed the outcome assessment tool (low <italic>v</italic> high cognitive load).

Participants completed the simulation within four weeks of their intervention. Decisions to admit, discharge, or transfer were measured. The proportion of patients under-triaged (patients with severe injuries not transferred to a trauma center) was calculated then (primary outcome) and again six months later, with a different set of cases (primary outcome of follow-up study). The secondary outcome was effect of cognitive load on under-triage.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>149 (81%) physicians in the game arm and 148 (80%) in the traditional education arm completed the trial. Of these, 64/100 (64%) and 58/100 (58%), respectively, completed reassessment at six months. The mean age was 40 (SD 8.9), 283 (96%) were trained in emergency medicine, and 207 (70%) were ATLS (advanced trauma life support) certified. Physicians exposed to the game under-triaged fewer severely injured patients than those exposed to didactic education (316/596 (0.53) <italic>v</italic> 377/592 (0.64), estimated difference 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.16; P&#x0003c;0.001). Cognitive load did not influence under-triage (161/308 (0.53) <italic>v </italic>155/288 (0.54) in the game arm; 197/300 (0.66) <italic>v</italic> 180/292 (0.62) in the traditional educational apps arm; P=0.66). At six months, physicians exposed to the game remained less likely to under-triage patients (146/256 (0.57) <italic>v</italic> 172/232 (0.74), estimated difference 0.17, 0.09 to 0.25; P&#x0003c;0.001).

</p><p>Behavioral scientists agree that people develop well calibrated heuristics when the decisional context provides reliable valid cues to the problem and they have the opportunity to learn the relevant contextual cues.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Typically, calibration&#x02014;the process of refining the accuracy of judgment&#x02014;requires an experience-feedback loop. Researchers in other specialties (such as aviation, organizational science, threat detection), however, have experimented with different behavioral interventions that serve as surrogates for this process.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> We created such an intervention for a medical diagnosis task that has proved difficult to improve: trauma triage decisions.</p><p>Trauma triage involves the identification and transfer of severely injured patients to trauma centers, either directly from the field or after evaluation at a non-trauma center. High levels of under-triage (the failure to transfer severely injured patients to trauma centers) persist, despite efforts to improve best practice. The problem is particularly acute at non-trauma centers, where fewer than 30% of severely injured patients are transferred as recommended by clinical practice guidelines.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>

<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> We selected one promising method of recalibrating heuristics&#x02014;narrative engagement&#x02014;and developed a theoretically grounded intervention delivered through the platform of a video game. Narrative engagement is defined as the use of compelling stories to communicate and encode principles of best practice decision.</p><p>We compared the efficacy of a narrative engagement video game with that of a prominent education intervention for improving simulated decisions in trauma triage with emergency medicine physicians practicing at non-trauma centers as participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>We have previously published the study protocol for this trial.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> We developed a video game (Night Shift) in collaboration with Schell Games (Pittsburgh, PA) and conducted a randomized controlled trial of the effect of the game compared with traditional didactic education, administered through commercially available applications, on triage by US emergency physicians practicing at non-trauma centers. We hypothesized that physicians exposed to game based education would under-triage fewer patients on a virtual simulation than those exposed to the didactic education program (primary trial outcome) and that experimentally induced cognitive load would degrade triage performance less among physicians exposed to the game than among those exposed to the didactic program (secondary trial outcome). Process measures included adherence to the interventions, as well as their usability and likeability.</p><p>Subsequently, we assessed the duration of the treatment effect among a random sample of those who completed the outcome assessment tool by measuring physician performance again six months after the completion of the initial trial protocol (primary six month reassessment outcome). We hypothesized that physicians exposed to game based education during the initial trial would continue to under-triage fewer patients on the simulation than physicians exposed to the didactic program.</p></sec><sec><title>Conceptual model</title><p>In our conceptual model, grounded in behavioral decision research, physicians first judge the severity of the injury and then decide how to manage it.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Those judgments reflect the interaction between what are called system one processes, which are fast, automatic, and heuristic, and system two processes, which are slow, deliberate, and analytic.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Under time pressure, people increasingly default to heuristics (or mental shortcuts) that can produce accurate answers but also predictable errors.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> As time pressure decreases, people are better able to synthesize the complex uncertain elements of difficult decisions&#x02014;assuming that they have the training to do so.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The decisions themselves also reflect the influence of other variables.<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In triage, these could include physicians&#x02019; attitudes towards guidelines, institutional norms, resource constraints, and patient preferences.</p><p>Our intervention sought to modify system one processes so as to improve heuristic thinking in decision making in trauma triage. Our specific strategy was based on clinical experience and experimental observations.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> For example, we observed that patients with gunshot wounds were far more likely to be transferred to a trauma center than patients who had fallen, even when they had similar injury severity scores. That pattern is consistent with judgment by representativeness: physicians have an archetype (a pattern) of how severely injured patients present and then transfer patients who match (&#x0201c;representative&#x0201d; cases) but admit or discharge those who do not (&#x0201c;non-representative&#x0201d; cases). Crucially, representativeness does not depend on how often a case occurs but reflects an associative judgment, informed by experience and training.<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> As a result, physicians can systematically make correct decisions for cases they deem &#x0201c;obvious&#x0201d; (representative) but make errors with those that are less obvious (non-representative), regardless of frequency.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Furthermore, physicians with different backgrounds (such as trauma surgeons versus emergency medicine physicians) might make different judgments by representativeness. Heuristics are well calibrated if they align with the reference standard for the specific decision context. We developed Night Shift to recalibrate the heuristics of emergency medicine physicians in trauma triage.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The triage of trauma patients by physicians occurs at non-trauma centers and level III/IV centers. The designated trauma level of a hospital reflects its ability to manage injuries definitively, based on an accreditation process conducted by the American College of Surgeons and state authorities. The scale ranges from I (fully resourced hospital; serves as regional referral center) to IV (minimally resourced hospital; capable of stabilizing patients but must refer severe injuries to a higher level of care). Hospitals that have not applied for accreditation are referred to as non-trauma centers. Our goal was to recruit a national sample of emergency medicine physicians who make triage decisions. To that end, we recruited board ertified and board eligible physicians working primarily outside level I/II trauma centers in the US at the 2016 annual scientific meeting of the American College of Emergency Physicians (October 16-18).</p><p>We randomized physicians using a 2&#x000d7;2 factorial design, with a 1:1:1:1 allocation to complete either game based or didactic educational applications and to complete the outcome assessment tool under conditions of low or high cognitive load. We anticipated that variation in the cognitive load would amplify the effect of heuristics on performance, thereby allowing us to isolate the mechanism by which the game influenced performance.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Our randomization scheme was generated in Stata 13.0 with block sizes of four and eight. After participants registered, study personnel obtained their assignment to the intervention and outcome assessment condition from a central database. Although we could not maintain blindness after allocation, we masked group assignment during the analysis phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Study protocol</title><p>At enrollment, physicians received an iPad mini 2 loaded with their intervention. We asked them to spend at least an hour with the intervention and then log onto a secure website that hosted a questionnaire to assess demographics and personal characteristics; a questionnaire to assess use of the interventions (adherence, usability, likeability); and a virtual simulation that served as the outcome assessment tool. Responding to the questionnaires and simulation took about 60 minutes. Participants completed the protocol at their convenience and could keep the iPad (worth about $260 (&#x000a3;195, &#x020ac;218)). They received weekly email reminders until the study closed on 14 November 2016 or until they completed the protocol.</p><p>Six months after the completion of the initial trial (May 2017), we emailed a random sample of 100 physicians from each group who had completed all primary study procedures to ask if they would participate in a second assessment. We asked respondents to complete the outcome assessment tool a second time (with a different set of cases) and offered a $100 Amazon gift card on completion of the task. Physicians who agreed to participate received weekly email reminders until the study closed on 15 June 2017.</p><sec><title>Questionnaire to assess demographics</title><p>Each physician completed a questionnaire with items on age, sex, race, ethnicity, educational background (board certification, ATLS (advanced trauma life support) certification, years since completion of residency), and practice environment (trauma designation of their hospital, affiliation with a level I/II trauma center, affiliation with an emergency medicine residency program). We used the Big Five Inventory-10 for an exploratory analysis of personality traits that might influence the efficacy of the different interventions.<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</p></sec><sec><title>Questionnaire to assess physicians&#x02019; use of interventions</title><p>To measure adherence, we asked physicians to report how long they spent using their interventions. To measure the usability and likeability of the interventions, we asked physicians to provide qualitative feedback about the experience.</p></sec><sec><title>Game based education: Night Shift</title><p>Based on the input of an expert panel of seven trauma surgeons, we distilled the clinical practice guidelines for the triage of trauma patients into three simple principles. The following types of patients have severe injuries until proved otherwise: elderly (&#x0003e;70) and frail patients; patients with injuries affecting more than one body region; and patients with rib fractures or open long bone fractures. We built Night Shift, a two dimensional adventure video game that relies on narrative engagement (that is, the use of compelling stories to promote behavior change) to disseminate these principles. Three research threads support the potential for narrative engagement to alter judgment. One research thread finds that stories facilitate the processing and retention of new data.<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The second body of research finds that practicing desired behaviors in a safe environment helps people to gain warranted feelings of self efficacy, providing the confidence needed to deploy newly acquired skills.<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The third body of research finds that stories can engage players cognitively and emotionally in ways that transcend traditional forms of education.<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
</p><p>Players take on the persona of Andy Jordan, a young emergency medicine physician who moves home after the disappearance of his estranged grandfather and takes a job in the local emergency department. They are given the dual objective of solving the mystery of the grandfather&#x02019;s absence and of interacting with the patients who present to the department. These patients have various traumatic and non-traumatic complaints, ranging from the obscure (such as foul smelling body odor and fever after exposure to camel&#x02019;s milk) to the common (such as low speed motor vehicle collision with minimal injuries). The game centers on a series of trauma patients who arrive with &#x0201c;non-representative&#x0201d; severe injuries&#x02014;cases in which the injury complex does not fit the popular archetype for the problem. As players interact with these patients, they gain experience with the consequences of under-triage. Specifically, these patients return with complications from their injury. Not only do players have to find a solution for the patient&#x02019;s deteriorating clinical condition, they also have to explain the outcome to characters in the game (such as family members, consultants). In their responses, the characters provide didactic information about relevant contextual cues for the evaluation of the trauma patients. At the same time, they highlight the repercussions of under-triage (such as preventable disability from a delay in treatment) to evoke an emotional response that would make the feedback memorable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Selected screenshots from interaction between Andy and his boss, the department chair. In this instance, Andy has failed to transfer a patient (Benjamin) with a cervical spine fracture to a trauma center, and Benjamin has returned with a central cord syndrome. During the conversation, players can choose how they want to respond to the department chair&#x02019;s criticism of their performance, either accepting responsibility or arguing that the complication represents the natural evolution of the disease process rather than a diagnostic error</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mohd039847.f1"/></fig><p>We made three additional design decisions to enhance players&#x02019; emotional and cognitive engagement with the game. First, we embedded the medical component of the game within an overarching mystery. During the quest to find Andy&#x02019;s grandfather, the player uncovers Andy&#x02019;s background and motivation. The process allows the player to gain empathy for Andy, which in turn makes the feedback provided by characters in the game feel personally relevant. Second, we included patients with &#x0201c;representative&#x0201d; severe injuries&#x02014;injuries that do fit the popular archetype of the problem&#x02014;in the mix of cases that arrive at the emergency department. These patients decompensate shortly after arrival. To salvage them, players have to participate in various team based resuscitation scenarios. In play tests, we found that even a small amount of structured role playing embedded in the adventure increased immersion in the story. Third, we incorporated a puzzle solving mechanic into the medical portion of the game to increase its cognitive challenge. We based the non-trauma patients on abstracted versions of clinical case challenges published in the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>.<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>

Only if they make the right connections, do patients offer the information required to make the correct diagnosis, allowing the player to initiate the correct treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Didactic education apps: myATLS and Trauma Life Support MCQ Review</title><p>The ideal standard educational strategy in trauma is Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)&#x02014;a two day seminar designed to teach participants to resuscitate and stabilize trauma patients and to determine if the patient&#x02019;s needs exceeds the capabilities of their facility.<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Participants must complete a multiple choice test before and after the course to receive certification. As a surrogate, we provided physicians with two educational software apps: myATLS and Trauma Life Support MCQ Review. The former contains a summary of all the content provided in the ATLS course.<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The latter is designed to help users prepare for the ATLS exam and contains 550 multiple choice questions. We asked participants to use their discretion in deciding how to allocate the hour they spent reviewing the two apps.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome assessment</title><p>We developed a virtual simulation to provide a high fidelity replication of the emergency department environment so that we could assess trauma triage decision making in a controlled environment.<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> When designing the simulation, we designated certain cases as &#x0201c;representative&#x0201d; (fitting the popular archetype for severe or minor injuries) and others as &#x0201c;non-representative&#x0201d; (not fitting the popular archetype for severe or minor injuries) based on clinical experience and experimental observations. We previously established the simulations&#x02019; internal reliability and construct validity. In prior research, we found that physicians, as a group, make similar diagnostic (such as acquisition of computed tomogram) and triage decisions (such as transfer) for trauma patients on the simulation as in clinical practice.<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
</p><p>The simulation presents 10 cases over 42 minutes, representing a busy eight hour shift. It includes four patients with severe injuries, two with minimal injuries, and four with non-traumatic complaints (see appendix for details). Each case includes a 2D rendering of the patient, a chief complaint, vital signs that update every 30 seconds, a history, and a written description of the physical exam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">fig 2</xref>). Users evaluate and manage patients by selecting from a prespecified list of 250 medications, studies, and procedures. Some orders affect a patient&#x02019;s clinical status, leading to corresponding changes in their vital signs and findings on physical exam. For example, a blood transfusion given to a patient in hemorrhagic shock will stabilize his/her blood pressure. Other orders generate additional information, presented as reports added to the patients&#x02019; charts. The cases end when physicians either make a disposition decision (admit, discharge, transfer) or the patient dies.</p><fig id="f2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig 2</label><caption><p>Screenshots from the virtual simulation (outcome assessment tool).

In addition to their clinical responsibilities, participants also have to respond to various audiovisual distractors, including nursing requests for help with disruptive patients, interruptions by families asking for information, and paging alerts.</p><p>During the initial study, we randomized physicians to complete the simulation under conditions of low or high cognitive load to test the mechanism of the treatment effect. We manipulated cognitive load in two ways. First, we varied the complexity of the non-trauma cases. In the low load arm, non-trauma patients had routine complaints (such as appendicitis), arrived hemodynamically stable, and did not deteriorate over the course of the simulation. In the high load arm, non-trauma patients were critically ill (such as septic), arrived hemodynamically unstable, and deteriorated without adequate management. Second, we reduced the number of rooms that physicians could use to evaluate patients from eight in the low load arm to four in the high load arm, which increased the number of distractors that they received.</p><p>Our primary outcome for the trial was physicians&#x02019; performance on the simulation as measured by the proportion of under-triaged severely injured patients. The secondary outcome of the trial was the effect of cognitive load on these simulated triage decisions.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of duration of treatment effect</title><p>Physicians who participated in the follow-up study completed the virtual simulation a second time after six months, with a different set of trauma cases (see appendix). Given the limited cohort size, we standardized the cognitive load manipulation for all participants, exposing all participants to high load conditions. The primary outcome of this follow-up study was the proportion of severely injured patients under-triaged.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Analyses</title><p>We calculated the response rate as the proportion of enrolled physicians who logged into the website and the completion rate as the proportion who finished the virtual simulation. We conducted our primary analysis using an intention to treat approach. Specifically, we included physicians who did and did not adhere to the requirement to spend an hour on their assigned intervention but restricted our analysis to physicians with outcome data (that is, those who completed the virtual simulation). We assumed that physicians who did not complete would not differ substantially from those who did but then performed a sensitivity analysis in which we explored the effect of departures from that assumption.</p><p>We summarized physician characteristics using means (and SD) for continuous variables and proportions (%) for categorical variables.</p><sec><title>Adherence, usability, and likeability</title><p>We measured adherence as self reported minutes spent on the intervention, summarized using medians and interquartile ranges. We categorized qualitative feedback about the usability and likeability of the intervention as positive or negative. We compared adherence across interventions using a Kruskal-Wallis test and the usability and likeability across interventions using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome assessment</title><p>We first evaluated participants&#x02019; performance on each trauma case based on a review of their disposition decisions (transfer, admit, discharge). We categorized patients who died before a disposition decision as &#x0201c;transferred&#x0201d; as we could not predict what the physician would have done given a successful resuscitation and wanted to give him/her the benefit of the doubt. We then calculated each group&#x02019;s proportion of under-triage (defined as the number of patients not transferred to a trauma center divided by total number of severely injured patients who should have been transferred to a trauma center).<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> To be consistent with our statistical analysis plan, we treated the proportion of under-triage as continuous and compared the effects of the intervention (primary outcome), cognitive load (secondary outcome), and the interaction of these factors on under-triage using a two way analysis of variance. In response to the recommendation of an independent statistical reviewer, we completed a post hoc analysis in which we treated under-triage as binomial and used a Poisson regression model with robust standard errors to test these effects.</p><p>We included all participants who had outcome data (that is, they completed the outcome assessment tool (simulation) within four weeks of exposure to their assigned treatment). In sensitivity analyses, we tested three different imputation scenarios to explore the potential bias introduced in our effect estimates based on types of non-random missingness. In scenario 1, we imputed worse than cohort average scores for missing physician outcomes in the game arm, assuming they performed like physicians in the education arm. In scenario 2, we imputed better than cohort average scores for missing physician outcomes in the educational arm, assuming they performed like physicians in the game arm. In scenario 3, we imputed worse than cohort average scores for missing physician outcomes in the game arm and better than cohort average scores for missing physician outcomes in the education arm.</p><p>We also performed sensitivity analyses to determine the effect of excluding participants who worked at both level I/II trauma centers and non-trauma centers, because they might have different heuristics to physicians who only ever worked at non-trauma centers, and participants who experienced usability issues with the interventions. Finally, we excluded from the analysis cases in which the patient died in the emergency department to see if changing our definition of the outcome would affect our estimate of the effects of the interventions.</p><p>In exploratory analyses, defined post hoc, we further assessed the relation between triage decisions and patient representativeness, defined as injuries fitting or not fitting the archetype; adherence, measured as time spent on the intervention (in thirds); and likeability, measured as whether the participant reported liking the intervention. Again we used analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Poisson regressions to test the associations between predictors and outcome measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Duration of treatment effect</title><p>As during the main trial, we scored each participant&#x02019;s responses to the simulation, summarized triage decisions at the group level, and compared the effects of the intervention on under-triage using both ANOVA (primary six month reassessment outcome) and Poisson regression analyses (post hoc).</p><p>All statistical analyses were conducted with Stata 13.0 (Statacorp, TX).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Human subjects and power calculation</title><p>We registered the trial and the follow-up study on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02857348; NCT03138304). We planned the six month reassessment after initiating the trial, based on our receipt of supplemental funding, and therefore registered the follow-up study as a second trial.</p><p>We used Cohen&#x02019;s method of estimating power for behavioral trials and assumed a 70% completion rate.<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> We planned to perform a two way analysis of variance and predicted the mean proportion of under-triage and standard deviation based on results from prior work.

The change in behavior was concentrated on the cases we had designated as &#x0201c;non-representative&#x0201d; or least likely to evoke the common archetypes used to classify patients. The game exerted an effect on behavior despite the fact that physicians in the game arm were less likely to describe the intervention as usable or enjoyable.</p><p>We hypothesized that the game would recalibrate physicians&#x02019; representativeness heuristics by changing their archetypes of patients with minor and severe injuries. We predicted that this change would manifest as a differential response to cognitive load. We found, however, that cognitive load did not affect physicians in either arm of our study. One explanation is that the experimental manipulation of cognitive load did not work. Given that the same manipulation affected performance in prior research, we speculate that the interventions interacted with the load manipulation, inducing a ceiling effect. An alternate explanation is that the game changed behavior through a mechanism other than heuristics. For example, the format could have convinced physicians of the need to transfer injured patients to trauma centers.</p><p>Players exposed to the game did not uniformly enjoy the experience. Physician dissatisfaction could reflect the well described observation from the video game literature that people have preferences for different genres of game (such as puzzle games).<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Age could also play a role in physicians&#x02019; reactions to Night Shift. Younger physicians, with greater tolerance for games used for training purposes, might represent a more suitable target population for this type of intervention.<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Finally, usability issues with the game probably also affected enjoyment. The game itself was a proof of concept prototype, without the full production values of commercially available games that participants might have come to expect.</p><p>Design decisions for the intervention reflected our belief that effective interventions compensate for deficiencies in the experience-feedback loop by immersing or engaging the user in the training task.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> We speculated that enjoyment would offer a means to that end and chose our mechanism (narrative) and delivery platform (video games) accordingly. We found that while adherence influenced performance, however, enjoyment did not. We therefore conclude that though enjoyment is one pathway to engagement, it is not the only one.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Our study had several limitations. First, we selected participants attending a national conference; if they differ from the overall population of practicing emergency medicine physicians this would affect external validity. Use of a convenience sample would have affected both arms equally, however, rendering the results internally valid. Second, the simulation included only 10 cases with an enriched base rate of severe injuries, potentially introducing bias and precluding the assessment of individual physician performance.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Case volume imposes a well known barrier to reliable and valid estimation of individual physician performance.<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> One solution is to create instruments that focus on conditions of interest.<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Another is to aggregate responses to assess group level performance.<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> We have previously validated our use of simulation to measure performance by comparing the responses of emergency medicine physicians on the simulation with their practice patterns, finding that key decisions (such as acquisition of radiologic studies, disposition) match.<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Third, physicians exposed the video game might have had an unfair advantage when completing the virtual simulation. We designed the game and simulation, however, with different objectives in mind (engagement versus assessment). As a result, the two products included different mechanics and interfaces (video 1 and video 2). In addition, both groups of physicians reviewed the same tutorial and completed a non-trauma case before beginning the trauma cases, further reducing any carryover effects. Readers who review the trial registration website will note a difference in our terminology regarding the primary outcome measure. In the trial registration, we used &#x0201c;under-triage rate&#x0201d; whereas here we use &#x0201c;proportion of under-triage.&#x0201d; Though the literature on trauma triage uses these terms interchangeably, in the clinical trials literature, &#x0201c;rate&#x0201d; connotes events per time period, whereas proportion does not. Our use of rate and proportion interchangeably reflects imprecision in our language and not an attempt to manipulate outcome reporting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and policy implications</title><p>Trauma triage exemplifies the complexity and importance of diagnostic decisions made under time pressure and uncertainty.

<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> In other words, physicians must make their decisions quickly and with incomplete information. Additionally, most physicians have relatively little experience with severely injured patients: physicians working at a non-trauma center evaluate 1000 patients for every one with severe injuries.<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> These conditions make it extremely challenging to learn appropriate triage. Existing interventions, which emphasize physician knowledge of and attitudes towards the clinical practice guidelines, do not adequately deal with the challenges faced by physicians at non-trauma centers.</p><p>To address this, we developed a novel intervention that combined video game technology with narrative engagement to recalibrate physician heuristics and tested its efficacy in reducing diagnostic errors in simulated trauma triage. Our results suggest that narrative based video games have the potential to influence physician behavior, although the real world implications remain unclear.</p><boxed-text id="boxa" position="float" orientation="portrait"><sec><title>What is already known on this topic</title><list list-type="simple" id="L1"><list-item><p>Strategies designed to change physician decision making have had limited success</p></list-item><list-item><p>No interventions exist to improve physician heuristics&#x02014;the intuitive judgments that drive much of medical decision making</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What this study adds</title><list list-type="simple" id="L2"><list-item><p>In this randomized clinical trial, physicians exposed to a video game intervention were more likely to follow clinical practice guidelines in the triage of simulated trauma patients than physicians exposed to a traditional educational program</p></list-item><list-item><p>A theoretically grounded video game intervention has the potential to modify physician behavior, although the magnitude of the effect and real world effectiveness remain uncertain</p></list-item><list-item><p>Key limitations include our use of a convenience sample of physicians and the use of a virtual simulation as the outcome assessment tool</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Jesse Schell, Michal Kacziewski, Jared Mason, Alex Pizzini, Lucy Gouvin, Gabe Yu, and other members of the team at Schell Games for developing Night Shift; Christy Steele, Mia Yoon, and Andrew Cupp for their help with recruitment; Dan Ricketts for help with programming; and the many physicians at the University of Pittsburgh who participated in play testing the video game and the physicians who participated in the trial. </p></ack><notes notes-type="data-supplement"><label>Web Extra</label><p>Extra material supplied by the author</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Appendix 1: Supplementary information</p></caption><media xlink:href="mohd039847.ww1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1679" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></notes><notes><fn-group><fn fn-type="participating-researchers"><p>Contributors: All authors were responsible for study concept and design.
