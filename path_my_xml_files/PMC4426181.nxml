It is estimated that the global prevalence of dementia will rise from 24.3 million in 2005 to 81.1 million in 2040. AD has a devastating impact on sufferers, caregivers, their communities and the healthcare system in general. &#x0201c;Di-tan decoction&#x0201d; (DTD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula frequently used to treat symptoms that are now defined as AD in clinical treatment. However, the existing evidence for recommending DTD in clinical practice derives from studies that were methodologically flawed. In this study, we aim to determine the efficacy and safety of DTD in AD patients based on a rigidly randomized controlled trial. It will provide critical information on sample size and treatment regimen for conducting a full-scale clinical trial of DTD later.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, add-on trial. After a 2-week run-in period, eligible patients with mild to moderate AD will be recruited and given either DTD or placebo twice daily for 24&#x000a0;weeks with follow-up 6&#x000a0;weeks after the last treatment. An increase of four points or greater on the scores of Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAD-cog) will be considered as a positive primary outcome. Total scores of the ADAD-cog, the Chinese version of Mini-Mental State Examination (C-MMSE), and the Chinese version of the Disability Assessment for Dementia (C-DAD) score will be used as secondary outcomes. Adverse events will also be reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomized trial will be the first rigorous empirical study on the efficacy of DTD for treating cognitive symptoms in AD patients.

It is the most common type of dementia in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Progressive atrophy is seen in all parts of the brain, especially in the hippocampus region, due to nerve cell death and tissue loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is estimated that the number of people suffering from dementia over the world will rise from 24.3 million in 2005 to 81.1 million in 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is expected that a new case of AD will be diagnosed every 33&#x000a0;seconds in America by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>AD has a devastating impact not only on sufferers, but also on caregivers, their communities and the health care system in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While much research is being done on many aspects of AD, including its basic biology, no drug has been found to alter the course of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Current pharmacological treatment for AD such as cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and memantine are symptomatic and may commonly associated with some side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness and anorexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Given that the efficacy is mild but with some side effects, patients often seek alternative treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), AD is described in terms of TCM principles; it could be caused by (1) a deficiency of vital energy of the kidney, heart and spleen or (2) the stagnation of blood and/or phlegm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The guidelines that classified dementia into different subtypes according to the TCM theory was published in 1990, and symptoms of &#x0201c;phlegm turbidity obstructing the orifices&#x0201d; (PTOO) is considered to be one of the major contributing factors to AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, the primary TCM strategy for treating AD is to &#x0201c;resolve phlegm in order to open the orifices&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The classic Chinese medicine formula &#x0201c;Di-tan decoction&#x0201d; (DTD) was developed by a famous TCM doctor, Dong Su, in 1449 with the specific function of &#x0201c;resolving phlegm to open the orifices&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It has been and still is frequently used to treat symptoms that are now defined as AD in clinical treatment with TCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In recent years, modern studies have attempted to verify the clinical effects of DTD in biochemical terms. Laboratory studies have shown that the memory impairment of AD model mice was significantly reduced by DTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the brain tissue in mice treated with DTD, acetylcholine (Ach) and acetylcholine transferase (ChAT) were significantly increased, while acetylcholine esterase (AchE) was decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The results of another study indicate that DTD may inhibit the decline of the dopamine content in brain tissue of model mice as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>In our previous systematic review, there was no clinical trial using DTD as the main intervention for treating AD. For the AD clinical trials that had involved DTD as an adjunct intervention, we found that most of them support the efficacy of DTD in treating AD. However, the evidence for recommending DTD in clinical practice derives from studies that were methodologically flawed. None of them was a randomized controlled trial. They not only lacked randomization, blinding, and the use of control groups, but also failed to define inclusion and exclusion criteria and the quality of the intervention medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Because of the methodological problems in previous studies, evidence to suggest that DTD is effective in treating AD is not strong. There is a lack of conclusive evidence to recommend a clinical trial.</p><p>As there is no basic information of DTD to conduct a comprehensive AD clinical trial, a rigorous pilot study, which focuses on the efficacy and safety of DTD for treating AD, will be needed before conducting a full-scale clinical trial. In this study, we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of DTD in patients with AD in a randomized controlled trial. This study will be a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, with restrictive inclusion and exclusion criteria and a clearly defined quality control intervention medicine. We hope the results from this study will provide critical information on sample size and treatment regimen for conducting a full-scale clinical trial later.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study will be a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, add-on trial.

This clinical study will be carried out at the Hong Kong Baptist University Chinese Medicine Specialty Centre. It has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hong Kong Baptist University&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board (code: HASC/11-12/24) and registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-TRC-12004548). If there is any amendment to the protocol, approval must be again sought from the Ethics Committee. Written informed consent will be obtained from every patient before participation in any study-related activity. The protocol design is based on the guidelines of Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) [see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>], and study results will be reported according to these guidelines as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Inclusion criteria are as follows: Adults who (1) have been clinically diagnosed with AD based on the criteria of National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADARA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and (2) present symptoms classified as PTOO [see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>] as defined by the Guidance for Clinical Research of New Chinese Herbal Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] during a screening visit, will be eligible.

It is composed of Arisaema Cum Bile (DanNanXing in Chinese), Pinelliae Rhizoma (FaBanXia in Chinese), Aurantii Immaturus Fructus (ZhiShi in Chinese), Poria (FuLing in Chinese), Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (ChenPi in Chinese), Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma (ShiChangPu in Chinese), Ginseng Radix (RenShen in Chinese), Bambusae in Taeniam Caulis (ZhuRu in Chinese), Glycyrrhizae Radix (GanCao in Chinese), Zingiberis Recens Rhizoma (ShengJiang in Chinese) and dextin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The test report of the DTD quality control is attached in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. The placebo is made of caramel (2%), gardenia yellow pigment (0.05%), sunset yellow (0.02%), tartrazine (0.02%), dextrin (95%) and broadleaf holly leaf (2.91%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The granules were produced in a single batch (DTD batch no.: A12074 Placebo batch no.: A120817) strictly in compliance with standards of Good Manufactory Practice (GMP) and Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2010 to ensure the stability and homogeneity of the composition as produced by PuraPharm Pharmaceuticals Company Limited. The chemical compositions of the final products were analyzed for contamination with heavy metals, toxic elements, microbe and pesticide residues; both final products were analyzed for stability and adherence to quality standards. The active treatment granules and the placebo granules have identical appearance and smell, and both have been packed in sealed opaque aluminum sachets and put in zip lock bags (10 sachets each). Only the treatment code is printed on the package to ensure successful blinding of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. One sachet contains 13.5&#x000a0;g, a dosage equivalent to 67.5&#x000a0;g herbs. All herbal and placebo granules will be distributed by L.L. Chen with both written and verbal instructions for each participant. Patients will be instructed to take the granules orally by dissolving a sachet of granules in 150&#x000a0;ml hot water, stirring well, then drinking the solution, two times per day, at least two hours apart from taking any routine Western medication. Patients will be allowed to discontinue the study granules temporarily if any adverse events occur. Patients will be instructed to report such events to a special e-mail account or by a direct telephone line. Additional treatments for a newly occurring illness, for example, flu or diarrhea, or adverse event during the study will be allowed but must be reported to the assessor.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

In order to maximize subjects&#x02019; compliance, first, we will have a thorough consent process for all participants; we will explain in detail the study schedule, potential side effects of treatment, and the responsibilities of the subjects. Second, we will screen potential subjects carefully during a 2-week run-in period in order to exclude ineligible patients or patients who are unlikely to comply with treatment regimen before randomization. Third, we will try to prevent dropouts by providing ongoing support to patients. A special e-mail account and a direct telephone line set up for this clinical trial will enable the study team to personally communicate with the patients. An information sheet will be given to each participant providing them and their caregivers with means of urgent contact. Extra visits and free medical care will be arranged for any participant who feels harmed by the trial protocol. Fourth, this is an add-on design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which means that the study treatment is added to their existing treatment.

Chinese medicine has been used to treat neurological diseases for thousands years with efficacy, safety, and relatively few side effects - albeit without rigorous and objective testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>This randomized trial will be the first rigorous testing of DTD for the treatment of AD patients. Success in this clinical trial will provide evidence acceptable to the scientific community of the potential of DTD to become an effective medicine for AD. The success of this study would represent justification and impetus for a large-scale clinical trial to further consolidate the evidence for the use of DTD in the treatment of AD.</p><p>It is noted that the sample size calculation does not apply to this study. Normally, 10 to 20 patients in each group would be sufficient to implement the method of a pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Since there is no previous data indicating the sample size needed to unequivocally determine the effect of DTD by the ADAS-cog, the evidence will still be weak even if we have a positive result. Nevertheless, the one aspect of this study that could undermine its value is sample size. There is no information on what sample size is needed to give statistically significant results. On the other hand, this study could find out what specific symptoms, like mood or cognitive, that DTD may improve. This information should be an important evidence for a much precise clinical trial with larger sample size in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study are expected to provide evidence for the efficacy and safety of the Chinese herbal formula, DTD, for treatment of AD patients who also meet the diagnostic criteria of &#x0201c;phlegm obstructing the orifices&#x0201d; syndrome according to TCM diagnostics. It may also provide a new direction for the clinical research on AD and TCM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial has been approved and registered.
