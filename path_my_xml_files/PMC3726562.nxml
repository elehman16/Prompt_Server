Protocols that employ multiple images covering the entire body are considered the reference method for the assessment of whole-body composition in humans. Indeed, the validity of MRI to estimate fat and SM has been compared with dissection in human cadavers and shows strong correlations between cadaver and MRI area measures of SM and fat depot <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Several studies in adults examined the changes in total and regional fat distribution in response to exercise and/or diet perturbations in obese men <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and women <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> using whole-body MRI.

Compared with other imaging modalities [e.g., MRI and CT (computed tomography)], DXA is readily available, inexpensive and involves low X- ray exposure by comparison to CT, thereby permitting repeated measurements. However, DXA can only provide overall measures of LBM as it is unable to distinguish SM from other lean tissues <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. While some studies have shown that appendicular lean soft tissue measured by DXA is able to predict total SM <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, others have questioned the ability of DXA to detect changes in soft tissue with exercise training in older adults <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Therefore, the purpose of this study was twofold.

Although DXA-measured changes in total and regional fat and LBM in response to exercise training are strongly correlated with changes in MRI-measured fat and SM, there were substantial differences and systemic biases between the two methods in evaluating body composition in youth. These differences translated into differences in the observed changes in fat and SM/LBM with intervention as assessed by MRI and DXA. This means that the ability to observe significant changes in body composition is influenced by the imaging method employed.</p><p id="P26">Due to the lack of rigorously controlled studies, the efficacy of regular exercise alone as a treatment strategy to improve whole-body composition has not been clearly established in children and adolescents. A few randomized controlled studies attempted to examine the effect of exercise on visceral fat in obese children <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and adolescents <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>; however these studies were hampered by age-associated increases in visceral fat <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and poor compliance to the prescribed exercise regimens <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In the current study, we are successful maintaining high exercise compliance rate in both aerobic and resistance exercise groups. Our observation is consistent with previous adult studies demonstrating that engaging in regular exercise alone, in the absence of calorie restriction, is beneficial to reduce both abdominal SAT and visceral fat (kg) in obese women <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and obese men with and without type 2 diabetes <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Our findings of preferential reductions in visceral fat with exercise training are similar to adult studies reporting greater reductions in visceral fat as compared with abdominal SAT in response to aerobic exercise <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, weight loss induced by either diet or exercise <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> or a long-term lifestyle intervention <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine changes in intermuscular fat in response to aerobic vs. resistance exercise using whole-body MRI in youth. Our finding that regular exercise, independent of exercise modality, is associated with significant reductions in intermuscular fat (kg) is of significance given that adipose tissue within skeletal muscle increases with increasing total adiposity and that intermuscular fat is associated with lower insulin sensitivity in adolescents <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Our finding extends previous observations from the STRRIDE trial <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, which examined the effects of differing amounts and intensities of aerobic exercise on intermuscular fat area (cm<sup>2</sup>) in overweight/obese dyslipidemic men and women. In that study, 8&#x02013;9 mo of aerobic exercise alone was associated with significant reductions in thigh-intermuscular fat measured by a single-slice mid-thigh CT in both men and women and that reduction in thigh-intermuscular fat was inversely correlated with changes in both HDL and LDL size in men. Together, these observations reinforce the utility of regular exercise as a strategy to improve skeletal muscle morphology in obese individuals, independent of age.</p><p id="P28">DXA and MRI are two commonly used tools that use different principles to assess body composition. MRI uses the magnetic differences of atoms to generate cross-sectional images of the body to assess tissue volumes which are converted to mass based on assumed densities <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Typically, MRI protocols acquire a series of ~41 non-contiguous images throughout the body as they produce similar results for total and regional fat and SM as the contiguous protocols (~200 images), but require much less acquisition time and image analyses labor <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. DXA uses the amount of radiation attenuation by the body to estimate fat and LBM within specific predefined areas of interest using proprietary equations. Unlike MRI, DXA cannot differentiate the fat depot types (i.e. visceral versus subcutaneous or intermuscular fat) and is unable to distinguish SM from other types of LBM (i.e. organs, connective tissue, vasculature, etc). As there are many other types of LBM other than SM, it is logical that total and regional DXA LBM is significantly greater than MRI measured SM.</p><p id="P29">At baseline, DXA significantly underestimated total fat by &#x02212;3.1 kg and the differences increased in magnitude with increases in total fat. These findings are similar to a previous observation in adults by Kullberg et al. <sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> who showed that DXA underestimated total fat by &#x02212;5.23 kg and &#x02212;4.7 kg as compared to both whole-body CT and MRI, respectively. In this study, DXA was able to detect significant reductions in total fat, but not changes in LBM with exercise. Although mean changes in fat were similarly estimated by the methods, there was a similar underestimation in fat change by DXA that increased with increasing total fat change. This means that MRI and DXA measures are more analogous at the lower levels of adiposity and fat change and that MRI is more likely to observe larger reductions in fat mass.</p><p id="P30">Regional changes in fat mass also differed by method of assessment. At baseline, we observed that trunk fat mass by DXA to be significantly larger than MRI abdominal fat and DXA leg fat mass to be smaller than MRI leg fat. One reason is that MRI and DXA use different borders for defining trunk and leg. Using MRI, the abdominal region is defined as 5 cm below L4-L5 extending to 15 cm above using an established method <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, whereas automated DXA software uses the entire trunk and pelvic region. The leg region by MRI extends to the femoral head which includes the gluteal area whereas DXA leg is defined by approximately the inguinal line which excludes some of the gluteal tissue. Given the different region of interest between two measurements, it is intuitive that there would be differences in the absolute trunk and leg measures.</p><p id="P31">Interestingly, on average changes in abdominal and leg fat were similarly estimated by DXA and MRI although there was a bias that remained in that DXA tended to underestimate larger fat changes. Mean changes in leg LBM was similarly estimated by DXA and MRI, but changes in trunk LBM was overestimated by 0.5 kg. Again, there were biases in that increases in trunk and leg SM were overestimated by DXA as compared to MRI. Thus, DXA appears to be more likely to observe improvements in LBM but less likely to distinguish reductions in fat mass as compared to MRI.</p><p id="P32">The limitations of this study warrant mention. Although this is the first study in adolescents to compare changes in body composition using whole-body MRI and DXA, our observations are based on pubertal obese adolescent boys. Whether our findings would remain true in girls or pre-pubertal children is unknown. In this study, we did not employ contiguous MRI scans but used a well-accepted MRI protocol to quantify SM and fat. Further, different models of DXA use different technologies and algorithms for assessing body composition, and the degree these observation are true for other DXA machines is unclear. Lastly, the effect of other intervention strategies, such diet weight loss, on the agreement between DXA and MRI changes in measuring fat and SM is unknown and warrants investigations.</p><p id="P33">In summary, our findings indicate that regular aerobic or resistance exercise over a period of 3 months is associated with significant improvements in whole-body composition in the absence of calorie restriction in obese adolescent boys. However, the ability to observe significant changes in SM and fat mass is influenced by the imaging method employed.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><p>This research was funded by the American Diabetes Association (7-08-JF-27), NIH (UL1 RR024153 CTSA), Department of Defense (FA7014-02-2-001) and Cochrane-Weber Foundation at Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC (to S Lee).
