Lack of time in daily practice has been identified as one of the main barriers to implementation of BI. There is growing evidence that facilitated access by primary healthcare professionals (PHCPs) to a web-based BI can be a time-saving alternative to standard face-to-face BIs, but there is as yet no evidence about the effectiveness of this approach relative to conventional BI. The main aim of this study is to test non-inferiority of facilitation to a web-based BI for risky drinkers delivered by PHCP against face-to-face BI.</p></sec><sec><title>Method and analysis</title><p>A randomised controlled non-inferiority trial comparing both interventions will be performed in primary care health centres in Catalonia, Spain. Unselected adult patients attending participating centres will be given a leaflet inviting them to log on to a website to complete the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) alcohol screening questionnaire. Participants with positive results will be requested online to complete a trial module including consent, baseline assessment and randomisation to either face-to-face BI by the practitioner or BI via the alcohol reduction website. Follow-up assessment of risky drinking will be undertaken online at 3&#x02005;months and 1&#x02005;year using the full AUDIT and D5-EQD5 scale. Proportions of risky drinkers in each group will be calculated and non-inferiority assessed against a specified margin of 10%. Assuming reduction of 30% of risky drinkers receiving standard intervention, 1000 patients will be required to give 90% power to reject the null hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The protocol was approved by the Ethics Commmittee of IDIAP Jordi Gol i Gurina P14/028.

In total, 74% of Europeans aged 15&#x02005;years or older drink alcohol and 15% of them (58 million people) drink above the recommended level.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Around the world, 3.8% of premature deaths and 4.6% of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost are attributable to alcohol use.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>In Catalonia, one of five patients attending primary healthcare are risky drinkers.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, the proportion of people who access treatment out of those who need it varies from 4% (Germany) to 23% (Italy). In Spain, the percentage of the in-need population-accessing treatment is 15.3%.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Early identification (EI) and brief intervention (BI) are among the most effective approaches for risky drinkers in primary healthcare.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, there is an important gap between research and clinical practice.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Less than 10% of risky drinkers attended the primary healthcare benefit from BI.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The main barriers in implementing EI and BI in primary care are time constraints, lack of financial incentives, insufficient training or absence of services to refer patient to and risk of upsetting patient.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Web-based BIs (e-BIs) are an alternative to improve the implementation, acceptance and viability of BI and to overcome barriers that have hampered their use in daily practice.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The provision of facilitated access by primary care professionals to an alcohol reduction website could significantly increase BI rates by offering a time-saving alternative to face-to-face intervention.

<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The use of new technologies for mental health problems is becoming common in primary care, as, for example, in smoking cessation.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A review of trials of computer-based interventions in college drinkers found them to be more effective than no treatment and as effective as alternative treatment approaches.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Down Your Drink (DYD; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.downyourdrink.org.uk">http://www.downyourdrink.org.uk</ext-link>) is an online intervention developed in UK based on BI, cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy, self-control therapy and motivational interviewing. An online trial of DYD indicated potentially significant reductions in alcohol consumption and risky drinking behaviours in participants who used the trial websites,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and, following this, a number of initiatives have been initiated to test the acceptability and effectiveness of facilitating access to websites of this kind in primary care settings. The EU-funded ODHIN trial<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> currently underway in five European countries is designed to determine the impact of facilitated access on levels of implementation of BIs by primary care practitioners. The EFAR FVG study in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region in Northern Italy<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> has been designed to test the effectiveness relative to face-to-face intervention of facilitated access to an Italian version of DYD by general practitioners. This trial involves 40 general practices and has recruited more than 500 patients.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> EFAR-Spain is based on the EFAR-FVG study, but has the following differences: (1) participation is open to doctors as well as nurses; (2) primary healthcare centres are constituted by a team of different professionals (nursing, medicine, social work, administration, etc); and (3) the website has not only been translated but also adapted to Spanish culture.</p><p>In Catalonia, no efficacy studies on e-BI exist. However, some limited e-BI initiatives have been undertaken in order to support the implementation of the &#x02018;Beveu Menys&#x02019; programme,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> a programme aimed at implementing EI and BI by, among other strategies, identifying a Network of Alcohol Referents in Primary Health Care (XaROH) throughout the territory and providing continuous training and support to them.

A 3&#x02005;h seminar on new technologies, and EI and BI, introducing the trial, will be offered to all members of the XaROH, and those attending will be invited to sign up for the trial. In addition, several advertisements will be posted on the &#x02018;Beveu Menys&#x02019; platform offering participation in the trial. In selecting practices, preference will be given to those with at least 5000 registered patients. Those practices that are selected as participants will be required to undergo a 1-day training programme. The training has four steps: (1) introduction to trial; (2) familiarisation with website; (3) update about EI and BI; and (4) practice in EI and BI (role-playing). Finally, participants will be encouraged to use the website and to tailor-make patient messages.

Non-inferiority will be considered if the difference between groups is not greater than 10%. Based on an anticipated reduction of 30% in the proportion of risky drinkers in control group and an overall attrition of 10%, it is calculated that 500 patients in each group will be needed to reject the null hypothesis (facilitated access is inferior to standard face-to-face intervention) with 90% power.</p><p>No interim analysis is planned.</p><p>All analysis details will be set up in a predesignated statistical analysis plan before the data are accessed.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Impact on screening rates of facilitated access to the website</title><p>It is hypothesised that the provision of facilitated access to the website will lead to an increase in alcohol screening rates in the trial practices. A substudy will therefore be carried out comparing pre-trial and post-trial alcohol screening rates in the participating practices, calculated on the basis of entries in the electronic care records of patients attending over a 6-month period. Further comparison will be carried out with a matched control group of practices that did not participate in the EFAR trial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The trial has several strengths. The research team includes international expertise and the protocol benefits from extensive experience gained through the EFAR FVG trial, which has recruited well and achieved high rates of follow-up. Recruitment of PHCPs will be achieved using an established, structured and well-trained network that has been involved in previous alcohol projects including ODHIN, PHEPA and Beveu Menys. The trainers have also had extensive experience of SBI training, and the network includes nursing as well as medical professionals, thus offering the potential to recruit a wide range of patients. It is the first trial testing the utility of facilitated access in Spain. It is carried out in the context of the daily work of PHCPs and can be embedded in the alcohol SBI activities undertaken in Catalonia so far. It is a natural evolution of the work being done and if results are positive such a website could be included in the future in the personal file of PHCPs and promoted as a complementary tool throughout all primary healthcare centres.</p><p>There may be initial professional resistance to engaging with facilitated access activity as the trial will be carried out by PHCPs with little or no experience of promoting the use of the internet for the delivery of alcohol screening and BI. However, we have taken account of this by using conservative estimates in calculating the anticipated facilitated access rates, and will offer training to all the participating PHCPs in order to overcome usability problems. The current version of the website has been well-accepted by Italian professionals and patients,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and all the professionals participating in the EFAR Spain trial will be invited to familiarise themselves with the website prior to the start of the trial. Furthermore, the research team will provide continuous support though email, an internet forum and by telephone. Support materials will also be provided, including Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), feedback data and alcohol-related problems management documents.</p><p>It is likely that a degree of selection bias will result from increased participation by younger and better educated patients likely to be more familiar with the internet. However, baseline assessment will provide data on a range of demographics, enabling comparisons to be made with the general population. While it is also possible that the trial will select more motivated participants who are especially concerned about their alcohol use, randomisation should ensure that these effects are equally distributed between the intervention and control groups.</p><p>In conclusion, while the trial poses significant challenges, it also has the benefit of international experience and expertise and delivery by PHCPs from a structured network with extensive previous experience.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e268" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-007130.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e269" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-007130.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work is supported by the following institutions: University College of London (UCL), Institut d'Investigacions Biom&#x000e8;diques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nic i Universitari de Barcelona and the Program on Substance Abuse (Public Health Agency, Government of Catalonia).
