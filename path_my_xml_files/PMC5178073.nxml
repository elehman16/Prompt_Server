Salvage treatments present significant challenges for locally recurrent NPC. Surgery, stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy, and brachytherapy have been used to treat locally recurrent NPC. However, only patients with small-volume tumors can benefit from these treatments. Re-irradiation with X-ray&#x02014;based intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMXT) has been more widely used for salvage treatment of locally recurrent NPC with a large tumor burden, but over-irradiation to the surrounding normal tissues has been shown to cause frequent and severe toxicities. Furthermore, locally recurrent NPC represents a clinical entity that is more radio-resistant than its primary counterpart. Due to the inherent physical advantages of heavy-particle therapy, precise dose delivery to the target volume(s), without exposing the surrounding organs at risk to extra doses, is highly feasible with carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT). In addition, CIRT is a high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation and provides an increased relative biological effectiveness compared with photon and proton radiotherapy. Our prior work showed that CIRT alone to 57.5 GyE (gray equivalent), at 2.5 GyE per daily fraction, was well tolerated in patients who were previously treated for NPC with a definitive dose of IMXT. The short-term response rates at 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months were also acceptable. However, no patients were treated with concurrent chemotherapy. Whether the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to CIRT can benefit locally recurrent NPC patients over CIRT alone has never been addressed. It is possible that the benefits of high-LET CIRT may make radiosensitizing chemotherapy unnecessary. We therefore implemented a phase I/II clinical trial to address these questions and present our methodology and results.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-treatment using raster-scanning CIRT plus concurrent cisplatin will be determined in the phase I, dose-escalating stage of this study. CIRT dose escalation from 52.5 to 65 GyE (2.5 GyE&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;21&#x02013;26 fractions) will be delivered, with the primary endpoints being acute and subacute toxicities. Efficacy in terms of overall survival (OS) and local progression-free survival of patients after concurrent chemotherapy plus CIRT at the determined MTD will then be studied in the phase II stage of the trial. We hypothesize that CIRT plus chemotherapy can improve the 2-year OS rate from the historical 50% to at least 70%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Re-treatment of locally recurrent NPC using photon radiation techniques, including IMXT, provides moderate efficacy but causes potentially severe toxicities. Improved outcomes in terms of efficacy and toxicity profile are expected with CIRT plus chemotherapy. However, the MTD of CIRT used concurrently with cisplatin-based chemotherapy for locally recurrent NPC remains to be determined. In addition, whether the addition of chemotherapy to CIRT is needed remains unknown. These questions will be evaluated in the dose-escalating phase I and randomized phase II trials.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer</kwd><kwd>Carbon ion radiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Re-irradiation</kwd><kwd>Salvage therapy</kwd><kwd>Chemotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Shanghai Hospital Development Center (Joint Breakthrough Project for New Frontier Technologies.</institution></funding-source><award-id>SHDC 12015118)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Jiade J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (CN)</institution></funding-source><award-id>15411950102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality</institution></funding-source><award-id>15411950106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Jiade J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai</institution></funding-source><award-id>14ZR1407100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Despite substantial improvements in treatment outcomes for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) owing to new radiation technologies, such as X-ray&#x02014;based intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMXT), and concurrent chemoradiotherapy, local recurrence remains a common reason for treatment failure. Unfortunately, approximately 10%&#x02013;15% of patients with non-metastatic disease will experience local recurrence after high-dose IMXT, with or without chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Re-treatment with definitive intent after high-dose IMXT poses a significant challenge to oncologists who specialize in head and neck cancer.</p><p>Several modalities have been used with some success in the re-treatment of local NPC when the initial treatments failed. For example, nasopharyngectomy, for a selected group of NPC patients with limited tumor volume in the post-nasal space, might achieve a long-term control rate of over 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Re-irradiation using stereotactic radiosurgery or brachytherapy can also be used for recurrent foci with limited tumor volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, for more extensive local recurrences after high-dose radiation, IMXT is currently the treatment of choice in the endemic region. Several retrospective studies have addressed the long-term results of using IMXT for locally recurrent NPC; the documented 3- to 5-year overall survival (OS) rates for most patients who presented with locally advanced recurrent disease were usually less than 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Challenges in the re-treatment of locally recurrent NPC</title><p>Re-irradiation of locally recurrent NPC after a prior course of definitive radiation is challenging for many reasons. The high-dose volumes encompassed in the initial course of definitive radiotherapy for the primary disease consist of not only the gross tumor volume (GTV) but also the organs at risk (OARs), such as the pharyngeal mucosa, optic nerve/chiasm, temporal lobes of the brain, and brain stem, as necessitated for the coverage of subclinical disease. A substantial portion of the temporal lobes and most parts of the nasopharynx are often irradiated with a dose of 66&#x02013;70&#x000a0;Gy, especially in patients with locally advanced recurrences. When the combined radiation dose of both initial radiotherapy and re-irradiation exceeds 100&#x000a0;Gy, the likelihood of radiation-induced adverse effects increases substantially (from 4% to 39%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, re-irradiation to a dose that exceeds 60&#x000a0;Gy may cause severe long-term adverse effects, including temporal lobe necrosis and soft-tissue ulceration and necrosis. Nasopharyngeal mucosal ulceration and necrosis is a potentially life-threatening condition. In addition to causing a significant reduction in quality of life, high-dose re-irradiation can cause death from necrosis, infection, or massive hemorrhage of the internal carotid artery, despite optimum clinical management.</p><p>Local recurrence of NPC after definitive radiotherapy with photons is most likely caused by radio-resistant NPC cells that survived the first course of radiation. Treatments might also fail locally due to the technical limitations of two-dimensional conventional radiotherapy or three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, in which inadequate imaging, targeting, and delivery reproducibility may result in under-dosing of the primary disease and neck adenopathy. The prevailing use of IMXT, along with advanced imaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), have significantly improved locoregional disease control over the years. Despite these advances, 10%&#x02013;15% of patients who complete IMXT at 70&#x000a0;Gy still experience local treatment failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, having largely eliminated the technological limitations of treatment, it is reasonable to speculate that there are subgroups of cells within the gross disease that are more resistant to X-ray&#x02014;based radiation and are enriched within recurrent tumors. Whether such features of radio-resistance are secondary to inherently radio-resistant clones, the presence of cancer stem cells, or hypo-oxygenation remains unknown. Regardless of the mechanisms, radio-resistance of the recurrent tumor confers a worse outcome after re-treatment using IMXT with doses similar to the initial radiotherapy (i.e., 60&#x02013;70&#x000a0;Gy at standard fractionation). Thus, previous IMXT for primary NPC poses additional biologic challenges to re-treatment of local recurrence. This clinical scenario requires the targeting of a more radio-resistant disease while several critical OARs may have already been encompassed in the high-dose region. Nearly all patients reported in the literature so far were treated with two-dimensional conventional radiotherapy. As such, previous data may not be comparable to studies conducted in the IMXT era.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characteristics of particle radiotherapy in cancer treatment</title><p>Charged-particle therapy, such as proton therapy, helium therapy, and carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT), possess distinct physical characteristics that make it superior to photon therapy. These include a sharp lateral penumbra; minimal energy deposition within the beam&#x02019;s entry path prior to the Bragg peak, which is defined by its steep dose deposition; and a sharp dose-deposition fall-off after the Bragg peak. Thus, beams exhibit both a precise and a finite range with respect to their dose delivery capability. The depth of the Bragg peak can be altered by altering the beam&#x02019;s energy. These properties enable the sparing of surrounding normal tissues, which is crucial when irradiating the head and neck area, especially for patients who have received prior radiotherapy to this region. Several reports have shown improved dose distributions using particle therapy for primary or recurrent NPC, with acceptable efficacy and toxicity profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In addition to its superior dosimetric properties, the heavy carbon ion is a high linear energy transfer (LET) modality. Furthermore, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of CIRT is substantially higher than that of photon- and even proton-based radiation. The value of RBE is 3&#x02013;5 for carbon ion. The actual calculated value is dependent on both the tissue type and the biologic endpoint of RBE assessment. High-LET radiation inflicts more damage via direct DNA double-strand breaks, which are more difficult to repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Improved efficacy could be expected after the delivery of high-LET radiation, such as CIRT, especially in the treatment of photon-resistant cancer cells that have been selected for their ability to more efficiently repair DNA single-strand breaks. Per convention with CIRT (and other particle-based modalities), the differences in RBE and LET between CIRT and photon radiotherapy will be taken into account, and the CIRT doses will be reported in terms of gray equivalents (GyE), which refer to the biologic effective doses (BEDs) of photons.</p><p>Results from retrospective and prospective studies have shown improved outcomes after CIRT for several malignancies, including chordoma/chondrosarcoma of the skull base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These results also demonstrated the safety of CIRT to critical OARs such as the optical nerve/chiasm, brain, brainstem, and spinal cord. At the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center in Germany and the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan, CIRT is currently the routine treatment for patients with these conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Particle therapy for local recurrence in head and neck cancers</title><p>Particle therapy has also been used successfully in the re-treatment of local recurrences of the above-mentioned conditions of the head and neck, including locally recurrent NPC. In one study, 16 NPC patients who developed a local recurrence after conventional photon-based radiotherapy and were re-irradiated by proton radiation achieved an OS rate of 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Those who were re-irradiated with 61&#x000a0;Gy or more achieved a local control rate of 60%; however, the local control rate was only 38% for those irradiated with a lower total dose (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The median cumulative dose of both the initial radiotherapy and re-irradiation was 133.5&#x000a0;Gy (range, 110&#x02013;148&#x000a0;Gy). The 2 of 9 (22.2%) surviving patients who developed osteonecrosis and mucosal necrosis were successfully treated with surgical debridement and hyperbaric oxygen. With radiation doses of 60.0, 60.0, and 57.0&#x000a0;Gy to the optic chiasm, surface of the brainstem, and center of the brainstem, respectively, no patient experienced clinically detectable neurological dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>A series from the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center included 18 patients with base-of-skull tumors who developed local recurrences after an initial course of radiotherapy and were re-irradiated with CIRT to a median dose of 51 GyE (range, 42&#x02013;60&#x000a0;GyE) over 17 consecutive days (3&#x000a0;GyE per daily fraction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this study, 3 of 18 patients received two courses of radiotherapy prior to the re-irradiation and received CIRT for their third course. Based on this calculation, the cumulative biological effective dose with an &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; ratio of 2 (BED2; usually for late-responding tissue) and cumulative biological effective dose with an &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; ratio of 9 (BED9; usually for tumor and early-responding tissue) were 127.5 and 68&#x000a0;GyE, respectively, using an &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; value of 2 for late toxicity of normal tissue. No patient developed grade 3 or 4 early or late toxicities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Concurrent chemotherapy with CIRT for locally recurrent NPC</title><p>Concurrent chemotherapy with IMXT is the current standard treatment for locally advanced NPC and has been studied against other chemotherapy scheduling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the addition of chemotherapy during IMXT for re-irradiation of locally recurrent NPC has never been studied in any prospective clinical trial. In the above-mentioned retrospective studies, some patients with recurrent NPC were treated with IMXT plus chemotherapy (either concurrent or adjuvant). However, multivariate analyses did not confirm that the addition of chemotherapy was a significant prognostic factor. The underlying mechanism of chemotherapy used with radiotherapy for recurrent NPC is not clear. However, in vitro studies have indicated the chemo-resistant characteristics of NPC stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is reasonable to presume that locally recurrent NPC foci harbor chemo-resistant (and radio-resistant) cells that may reduce the efficacy of chemotherapy. In addition, the early onset of life-threatening adverse effects may mask the synergistic effects of combined chemoradiotherapy on disease control and survival.</p><p>The combination of CIRT with concurrent chemotherapy has never been studied prospectively for any malignancy. Given the superior physical and biological properties of CIRT and the potential benefits of concurrent chemotherapy, it is also reasonable to postulate that CIRT plus concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy may produce an optimal outcome in the treatment of locally recurrent NPC after high-dose IMXT. In this trial, we will first determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of CIRT when used with concurrent cisplatin (weekly dose, 40&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) for the re-irradiation of locally recurrent NPC after IMXT. We will then evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy at the MTD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Selection of CIRT dose for re-irradiation in the phase I study</title><p>In the phase I part, we will use a Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method (TITE-CRM) design to determine, via a dose-escalation scheme, the MTD for re-irradiation using CIRT plus concurrent chemotherapy for the treatment of locally recurrent NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Patients will be monitored and evaluated for acute and subacute treatment-induced adverse effects, local control, local and distant progression-free survival, and OS.</p><p>Doses between 60 and 70&#x000a0;Gy (1.8/2.0&#x000a0;Gy per daily fraction) were commonly used for re-irradiation with IMXT for the treatment of locally recurrent NPC. Unfortunately, this dose range is associated with at least 35% of severe adverse effects (defined as grades 3&#x02013;5 toxicities), including soft-tissue ulceration and hemorrhage, especially at higher doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In a series of 239 patients treated with a mean dose of 70.04&#x000a0;Gy (range, 61.73&#x02013;77.54&#x000a0;Gy) to the GTV, grades 3&#x02013;5 re-irradiation-induced severe late toxicities occurred in approximately 52% of the patients and were the cause of death of almost 70% of the 120 patients who died [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. More recently, in a study of salvage IMXT for the treatment of locally recurrent NPC after previous definitive IMXT, Kong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] reported a similar rate of severe toxicity (approximately 40%) after re-irradiation using IMXT. In addition, many patients developed two or more late toxicities after retreatment, and almost 70% of mucosal necrosis occurred within 6&#x000a0;months after re-treatment. Currently, a reduced dose range from 60 to 66&#x000a0;Gy at conventional fractionation (i.e., BED9 73&#x02013;81&#x000a0;GyE) is commonly used for re-irradiation with IMXT for the treatment of locally recurrent NPC. However, long-term results after treatment at this dose level, especially for patients who recurred after receiving definitive IMXT for their primary treatment, have not been reported.</p><p>Two articles on re-irradiation using proton or heavy-particle therapy have reported clinically acceptable long-term toxicity outcomes. In these studies, a BED2 of approximately 120 GyE was delivered to the recurrent tumor. Doses of re-irradiation using proton and carbon ion exceeding or below 120&#x000a0;GyE conferred grade 3/4 late toxicity rates of approximately 22% and 0%, respectively [11, 17]. A total dose of 55&#x000a0;GyE (at 2.5&#x000a0;GyE per daily fraction) resulted in a BED2 of 124&#x000a0;GyE and a BED9 of 70&#x000a0;GyE. Since concurrent chemotherapy with CIRT may provide additive, if not synergistic, effects on efficacy as well as toxicity, 55&#x000a0;GyE at 2.5&#x000a0;GyE/day should serve as an acceptable starting dose/fraction schedule. In our previous phase I/II trial on CIRT alone for the treatment of locally recurrent NPC, we chose 57.5&#x000a0;GyE as the starting dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Owing to the potential additive toxicity of concurrent chemotherapy combined with CIRT, it will be prudent to set the starting dose of the phase I trial somewhat lower, at 55&#x000a0;GyE delivered at 2.5&#x000a0;GyE/day.</p><p>Because of the sharper penumbra offered by CIRT, we anticipate that the delivery of higher doses to the clinical targets&#x02014;while potentially lowering the integral dose to, and high-dose volumes within, the non-targeted structures&#x02014;will be more feasible compared with traditional photon-based radiotherapy. Because of these unique properties of CIRT, in addition to determining the straightforward MTD, toxicity will be associated with other unique dosimetric characteristics, such as dose-volume histogram parameters and gradient and conformality indices of the various BEDs within normal structures and tissues. This will provide supplemental three-dimensional and dynamic information to determine the tolerance of previously treated tissues to CIRT. Lastly, we will be able to determine the additive or synergistic effects of adding platinum-based chemotherapy to CIRT, as previous studies, with toxicity data, have consisted primarily of CIRT-alone regimens.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods and design</title><p>As a single-center, single-arm phase I/II clinical trial, its purposes are to determine the MTD of re-irradiation using CIRT combined with concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy in the treatment of locally recurrent NPC and to evaluate the efficacy of this strategy at the determined MTD.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Phase I trial</title><p>The primary objective is to determine the MTD of CIRT combined with concurrent chemotherapy in the treatment of locally recurrent NPC, by observing the acute or subacute grade 4 or 5 toxicities [Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.03] that are possibly, probably, or definitively caused by the treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

Patients who complete 90% or more of the planned CIRT dose but become un-evaluable for 6&#x000a0;months will be counted as evaluable in the final analysis and weighted by the proportion of the observation period for which they were evaluable. Replacement of any accrued patient can only be considered if the patient did not complete therapy for reasons other than toxicity.</p><p>At the end of the trial, a simple two-parameter logistic regression model will be used to estimate the pDLT at each dose level.

Previous studies of re-irradiation with IMXT showed suboptimal outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and it is reasonable to postulate that recurrent lesions after definitive IMXT, which are usually fully encompassed by the high-dose target volume, may harbor cells that are more resistant to photon-based irradiation. Clearly, more effective local treatment is needed.</p><p>An effective re-treatment modality should have two important simultaneous characteristics: being efficacious in disease control and being mild or moderate in causing adverse effects to the surrounding OARs. Owing to its physical properties, CIRT is a precision radiotherapy modality. Additionally, it has higher RBE compared with lower-LET irradiation; therefore, it can be more effective in the treatment of neoplasms that are more resistant to photon or proton therapy.</p><p>Compared with IMXT or proton-beam therapy, CIRT for re-irradiation has been shown to improve treatment outcomes for several diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Previous studies of CIRT in the re-treatment of locally recurrent tumors, including those that recurred in the base of the skull, after previous courses of high-dose irradiation have indicated overall safety and effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, no patients with locally recurrent NPC were included in any of these studies. Although the RBE of CIRT for NPC cells remains to be investigated, preclinical data have demonstrated that the RBE ranges from 2 to 5 for radio-resistant cells, such as glioblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In addition, early results from clinical studies have indicated that such advantages might translate into improved clinical outcomes against these resistant recurrences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Our previous work at the SPHIC showed that patients with locally recurrent NPC who received re-irradiation alone using intensity-modulated CIRT up to 57.5&#x000a0;GyE in 25 fractions tolerated it well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Within 3&#x000a0;months after completion of CIRT, most patients achieved a PR or CR, without grade 2 or higher radiation-induced adverse effects. However, longer follow-up is needed to determine the likelihood of developing late CIRT-induced toxicities. A phase I/II clinical trial with the aims of determining the MTD of re-irradiation with CIRT and the efficacy of CIRT at the MTD is ongoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Induction chemotherapy may be used for the treatment of locally advanced NPC at recurrence to reduce the tumor burden and to control subclinical distant metastases. However, chemotherapy is not being used concurrently with CIRT.</p><p>Concurrent chemotherapy with definitive radiotherapy has been proven effective in the treatment of NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; however, its effectiveness in the management of locally recurrent NPC has not been confirmed. In addition, the use of concurrent chemotherapy plus high-LET irradiation, such as CIRT, for the purpose of radiosensitization has never been addressed. Therefore, after the initiation of the previous phase I/II trial that focused on CIRT alone and after completing the accrual of patients for the first dose level (57.5&#x000a0;GyE with a daily fraction dose of 2.5&#x000a0;GyE), we initiated this trial to address the safety and effectiveness of CIRT plus concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Although all patients completed 57.5&#x000a0;GyE without experiencing any moderate or severe adverse effects (unpublished data), the starting dose used in the current study was 55&#x000a0;GyE, which is one echelon lower than the starting dose used in our CIRT-alone trial. This was done to avoid possible severe adverse effects from the potential synergistic effects of concurrent chemotherapy plus CIRT.</p><p>In summary, this trial will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of intensity-modulated CIRT (using the pencil-beam scanning technique) delivered concurrently with cisplatin-based chemotherapy to patients with locally recurrent NPC. In the phase I trial, dose escalation will be performed to determine the MTD (i.e., the recommended dose) of intensity-modulated CIRT that can be prescribed with concurrent chemotherapy for locally recurrent NPC lesions. Thereafter, the phase II trial will address the effectiveness of intensity-modulated CIRT plus concurrent cisplatin at this recommended dose as definitive treatment for locally recurrent NPC.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>The radiotherapeutic techniques, doses used and treatment goals, assessment of efficacy parameters, and statistical calculation of this clinical trial are similar/identical to those of our previous clinical trial of CIRT alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].
