When an anesthesiologist encounters a difficult airway, fiberoptic intubation is a reliable technique for airway management. Use of airway blocks and providing proper sedation during fiberoptic intubation procedure will result in patient comfort, reduction in airway reflexes, and increase in cooperation and hemodynamic stability of the patient, as well as proper amnesia accompanied by airway preservation and spontaneous ventilation in the patient.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Numerous compounds have been used for the induction of conscious sedation during fiberoptic intubation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Dexmedetomidine (Dex) is an &#x003b1;<sup>2</sup>-adrenergic agonist that has been used as a valuable drug during fiberoptic intubation. Proper sedation and analgesia without respiratory depression are among the advantages of prescribing intravenous (IV) Dex during fiberoptic intubation in patients.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Use of Dex adjuvant in local or neuraxial blocks for inducing analgesia or elongating the duration of sensorimotor blocks became worldwide in the past few years, yet few studies have evaluated the side effects of local use of this drug.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The positive effects of local Dex regarding pain management after surgery and desirable control of hemodynamic signals have been reported in some studies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] On the other hand, some studies have deemed its local use inefficient for some procedures such as epidural block.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Therefore, the present study was designed and carried out aiming to evaluate the effects of local Dex on sedation rate and hemodynamic changes in candidate patients for fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This randomized controlled trial was conducted in our university hospital from March 2013 to February 2015. Candidate patients for elective surgery with indications for nasotracheal intubation, aged between 18 and 65 years from both sexes with Class I and II American Society of Anesthesiologists, were considered in the study. Patients with a history of cardiac diseases, high blood pressure, consumption of blood pressure medication or agonist or antagonists of &#x003b1;-adrenergic receptors, those with liver and kidney diseases or history of addictive of psychotropic drug abuse or any psychiatric disease as well as pregnant women, those who had not fulfilled the fasting period (&#x0003c;8 h for solids and &#x0003c;3 h for transparent liquids), and emergency surgeries were excluded from the study. Patients with a baseline heart rate (HR) lower than 60 beats/min or atrio-ventricular block in electrocardiogram or history of allergy to &#x003b1;-receptor agonists and those with coagulation disorders were also excluded from the study.</p><p>Sample size was calculated based on Type I error of &#x003b1; = 5% and power = 80% and minimum difference <italic>d</italic> = 30%, which was clinically significant in the pilot study. Patients were divided into three groups using random number table as follows: control group: patients whose airway block was done with the aid of lidocaine with a total dose of 5 mg/kg; IV Dex group: patients who received a single dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight IV Dex during 10 min in addition to a total dose of 5 mg/kg local lidocaine when undergoing airway block; local Dex group: patients whose airway block was done using a combination of lidocaine with a total dose of 5 mg/kg and local Dex with a total dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight.</p><p>Due to unknown effects of Dex on trachea, glossopharyngeal, superior laryngeal, and recurrent laryngeal nerves were blocked by local anesthetic injection and intranasal anesthesia using lidocaine in all groups. Immediately after blocking and local anesthetic injection, propofol infusion pump was injected with the initial dose of 30 mg/kg body weight to adjust the cerebral state index (CSI) to 65&#x02013;75. The time of reaching 75 CSI was recorded for all patients. Propofol infusion continued up to sedation induction. Fiberoptic intubation was carried out by paying attention to CSI and symptoms of airway block. In all patients, fiberoptic intubation was done by an anesthesiologist with sufficient experience. The anesthesiologist in charge of intubation, patients, anesthesiology resident, and nurse were all blinded to the drug used, and the drug provided to the team was prepared by another anesthesiologist.</p><p>Four methods are used for evaluating airway block and intubation in patients:</p><p>

(1 = open, 2 = moving, 3 = closing, 4 = closed)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient tolerance score during nasotracheal intubation based on a 1&#x02013;5 scale of patient comfort during fiberoptic intubation (1 = no reflex from the patient, 2 = mild grimace, 3 = significant grimace, 4 = verbal complaining, 5 = defensive posture with head or hands)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient tolerance score immediately after nasotracheal intubation on a 1&#x02013;3 scale (1 = calm and cooperative, 2 = restless, 3 = complete resistance and in need of rapid general anesthesia).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Blood pressure, HR, electrocardiogram, arterial blood O<sub>2</sub> saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and CSI condition were monitored in all patients during and after airway blocking and then for every 2 min until general anesthesia. For blinding the procedure, the one who performed the local airway block was different than the one who assessed the mentioned outcomes. The assistant controlled drug infusion and condition of the patients and the nurse controlled and recorded the hemodynamic status of the patients and their SpO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>All quantitative variables are reported as mean and standard deviation, and qualitative variables are listed as number (percentage). Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test and Q-Q plot were used to assess normal distribution of data. To evaluate the difference between groups, ANOVA, Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact test were used. Linear mixed model was used to evaluate the difference between the groups throughout the study. In all these evaluations, multiple comparisons were corrected by Bonferroni method.

Local Dex like IV Dex could result in propofol dose saving during the procedure. As far as we know, there is no similar clinical trial in literature that assessed the efficacy of local Dex in same situation. However, the findings are compatible with previous studies that all just assessed the IV form of Dex.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Mean HR and diastolic blood pressure in IV Dex group were lower than the other two groups, which is obviously due to bradycardia caused by systemic Dex effect. Although Dex can stabilize hemodynamics, in patients with hypovolemia and heart block, it should be used cautiously.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>IV Dex injection for facilitating fiberoptic intubation was studied frequently, and most of researches stated the ease of patient care and patient satisfaction during and after the procedures.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Moreover, it could be said that due to low systemic uptake, the effect of local Dex is different from that of IV Dex. In fact, local Dex with more powerful local anesthesia and low systemic uptake not only stabilizes hemodynamics better but also improves the quality of intubation. Unlike IV Dex, local Dex does not have a hypnotic effect, does not decrease O<sub>2</sub> saturation during fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and enables awake intubation with beneficial local effects.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Local Dex was used and studied in different procedures such as septoplasty, third molar surgery, and peripheral nerve blockade, and usually reported as a proper option with less adverse effects than IV administration of this agent.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>The superiority of local Dex in decreasing the required propofol dose needed for sedating the patients in comparison with control group was another interesting finding of the present study, which had also been noted in some previous studies for IV Dex.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This study also revealed that local Dex improves intubation score and decreases coughing compared to control and IV Dex groups.
