The disorder is characterized by three symptom clusters: reexperience of the event, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal resulting from exposure to a traumatic event[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Data from the National Comorbidity Survey in United States estimated a lifetime PTSD prevalence rate at 7.8% (10.4% for women and 5% for men) and to be more prevalent among women and the previously married. The trauma most likely to be associated with development of PTSD among men (69%) and women (45.9%) alike was rape. Survival analyses demonstrated that PTSD failed to remit in more than one third of persons even after several years of the occurrence of the traumatic event, demonstrating that PTSD tends to be a chronic disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, PTSD has a high comorbidity with other psychiatric conditions such as substance abuse/dependence, anxiety disorders, and major depressive disorder causing a worsening prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The development of treatments for PTSD is challenging due to the complexity of the symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are the two main classes of PTSD treatment. In the Cochrane systematic review, Bisson and Andrew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] evaluated the efficacy of five categories of psychotherapeutic interventions: trauma-focused cognitive- behavioral therapy/exposure therapy (TFCBT), stress management, other therapies (supportive therapy, nondirective counseling, psychodynamic therapy, and hypnotherapy), group cognitive behavioral therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). The authors analysed thirty-three studies and concluded that individual TFCBT, stress management, group TFCBT, and EMDR were more effective than wait list and other therapies. Bradley et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] conducted a multidimensional meta-analysis of psychotherapy studies published between 1980 and 2003. The meta-analysis included twenty six studies and reviewed exposure therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure plus CBT, EMDR and others. The authors found that exposure therapies, other cognitive behavior therapy approaches, and EMDR are efficacious in reducing PTSD, but found no significant differences between the various CBT modalities and between CBT and EMDR. Several review of psychotherapy have been published demonstrating that cognitive-behavioural and similar psychotherapies are effective in the treatment of PTSD.</p><p>The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] recommended trauma focused psychological therapy as a routine first-line treatment for adults in preference to pharmacotherapy. In cases that drug treatment is required, paroxetine and mirtazapine were approved for general use, and amitriptyline and phenelzine for use only by mental health specialists. Although controlled trials with paroxetine did not show significant benefits on the main outcome variables, this is the only drug approved for PTSD in UK.</p><p>In a recently published systematic review, Stein et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] evaluated thirty five short term randomized controlled medication trials for PTSD (4597 participants). In thirteen trials, response to medication occurred in 59.1% of patients (644 participants), while response to placebo was seen in 38.5% of patients (628 participants). Significant reductions in symptom severity were observed for patients who received medications in seventeen trials. The mean total CAPS score for the medication group was 5.76 points lower than that for the placebo group (95% CI &#x02013; 8.16 to -3.36 and 2507 participants). Evidence of treatment efficacy was most convincing for the SSRIs. Furthermore, medication was superior to placebo in reducing the severity of the three symptom clusters of PTSD, as well as alleviating the symptoms of depression, and in improving the quality of life measures. The current evidence base of randomized clinical trials is unable to demonstrate superior efficacy or acceptability for any particular medication class.</p><p>Nevertheless, the bulk of evidence for the efficacy of medication has been with the SSRIs and supports expert consensus guidelines that these medications constitute the first-line medication choice in PTSD.</p><p>The American Psychiatric Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] practice guidelines rated the SSRIs as first-line pharmacotherapy, with sertraline and paroxetine being US Food and Drug Administration approved for PTSD. The authors did not find efficacious pharmacological intervention to recommend in preventing the development of acute stress disorder or PTSD. The tricyclics antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors may also be beneficial (recommended with moderate clinical confidence) and the benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics and adrenergic inhibitors may be recommended on the basis of individual circumstances. Trials of atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone found some evidence in terms of efficacy for PTSD with psychotic symptoms. Olanzapine, a second-generation antipsychotic agent, when prescribed to augment ongoing sertraline treatment, was shown to produce improvement in PTSD, depressive, and sleep-related symptoms in Vietnam veterans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Open-label studies of adjunctive olanzapine have demonstrated symptom reduction in veterans with PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A small controlled study of risperidone in chronic combat related PTSD and comorbid psychotic symptoms demonstrated that reexperiencing and global psychotic symptoms were reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although the SSRIs are the mainstream treatment for PTSD, many patients do not have a satisfactory response to these antidepressants. The development of pharmacological treatments for PTSD is challenging due to the heterogeneity of symptoms. Recently, anticonvulsants have been evaluated for their potential efficacy for the treatment of PTSD. Open and randomized trials of carbamazepine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], valproic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and lamotrigine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] suggested that these agents may be efficacious in PTSD treatment.</p><p>The hypotheses on the etiology of PTSD have suggested that after exposure to traumatic events; the limbic nuclei may become kindled or sensitized, resulting in increased susceptibility to physiologic arousal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The implication of the limbic kindling-like phenomenon in the pathophysiology of PTSD has stimulated clinical research in antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of PTSD.</p><p>Topiramate is an anticonvulsant with inhibitory activity in animal kindling models and with multiple mechanisms of action: inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, blockade of Na+ channels, inhibition of some high-voltage-activated Ca2+, negative modulating effect on the kainate/AMPA (&#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid) subtype of glutamate receptors, ability to modulate NMDA (Nmethyl-D-aspartate) glutamate receptor and enhancement of GABAergic activity at GABA2 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The blockage or the stabilization of the AMPA (&#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5 methyl-4 isoxazole propionic acid) receptor may be a possible mechanism responsible for the increase in the threshold for flashbacks and nightmares that may explain the treatment response to topiramate in PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Several animal model studies show that AMPA antagonists attenuate acoustic startle response when administered into the amygdala. For instance, Khan and Liberzon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] demonstrated that topiramate reduced significantly the acoustic startle response in rats after a single prolonged stress episode.</p><p>Glutamatergic neurons play a role in the neuronal plasticity associated with longterm potentiating in adaptation to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Glutamate NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate) receptors have been implicated in reconsolidation, and extinction of memories. The reconsolidation of spatial and contextual fear memory and odor reward association is impaired by NMDA antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Lee et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] demonstrated that the NMDA receptor antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-SHdibenzo [a, d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) blocked and the agonist D-cycloserine (DCS) potentiated extinction of fear memory when they were administered before a long extinction training session whereas MK-801 impaired and DCS increased reconsolidation of memory when they were administered before brief memory reactivation session.</p><p>Although much of the research associate the glutamatergic systems with learning and memory; the GABAergic (&#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid) system in the basolateral amygdala, is also involved in the acquisition and extinction of fear memories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Reduced GABA function is involved in the formation of fear memories and the development of anxiety disorder. Stork et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] found that conditioned fear in mice is associated with a reduction of extracellular GABA levels in the amygdala indicative of a reduced GABA release and/or increased GABA uptake from the extracellular space.</p><p>Clinical studies with topiramate suggest that it is effective as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in PTSD. Two open-label studies demonstrated topiramate to be effective and to have a rapid onset of action. Berlant and van Kammen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] have reported that topiramate decreased nightmares in 79% and flashbacks in 86% of civilian patients with chronic PTSD with improvement of nightmares in 50% and of intrusions in 54% of patients with these symptoms. A partial response was reported for 95% of patients at a dosage of 75 mg/day or less and in 91% of full responders at a dosage of 100 mg/day or less. The nonhallucinatory subgroup achieved a higher response rate (89%). In a prospective open-label study, Berlant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] treated thirty three civilians with chronic PTSD, with topiramate as monotherapy or augmentation therapy. The PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) total symptoms declined by 49% at 4th week, with similar subscale reductions for reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal symptoms. Topiramate suppressed nightmares in 79% and decreased symptoms of intrusions in 94% in those patients with these symptoms. There is only one double-blind, placebo- controlled study of topiramate as a monotherapy in PTSD. Tucker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] conducted a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of topiramate as a monotherapy in thirty eight civilian PTSD patients. Patients in the topiramate group exhibited significant reductions in reexperiencing symptoms (CAPS cluster B: topiramate = 74.9%; placebo = 50.2%; p = .038) and reductions approaching statistical significance, based on a nominal p value, were noted in mean total Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale scores (topiramate = 1.9 &#x000b1; 1.2; placebo = 2.6 &#x000b1; 1.1; p = .055). Although there was a reduction in total Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score from baseline (topiramate = -52.7; placebo = -42.0), the difference was not statistically significant (p = .232). But not all studies found positive results, Lindley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study using topiramate as an augmentation therapy in forty male veterans with PTSD did not find significant treatment effects versus placebo. However, there was a high dropout rate from the study with 11 (55%) topiramate and 5 (25%) placebo subjects not completing the seven week treatment, with 40% of topiramate and 10% of placebo dropping because of adverse effects. Patients in the topiramate group that completed the study, had a significant improvement in the reexperiencing subscale of the CAPS suggesting efficacy for the patients that continued the medication.</p><p>Extensive efforts have been made to establish guidelines based in evidence for PTSD treatment, however there is still no specific drug proved efficacious. Although there are limited clinical studies with topiramate in the treatment of PTSD, the findings of prior topiramate studies suggest that this anticonvulsant may be promising in the management of patients with PTSD.</p><sec><title>Aims of the Study</title><p>1) To compare the efficacy of topiramate with placebo in the treatment of PTSD. Clinical response will be considered when there are a 20% reduction on CAPS scale scores from baseline and remission when CAPS score is less than 19.</p><p>2) To study the tolerability of topiramate in the treatment of PTSD, through the dropout rate in each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Research Goals</title><p>The trial will compare the efficacy of topiramate with placebo in the treatment of PTSD, and will study its tolerability through the drop out rate in each group. The primary hypothesis is that topiramate will be superior to placebo in the treatment of PTSD. Secondary research goals includes studying the efficacy of topiramate in social adjustment, functioning and quality of life. Additionally, evaluating treatment adhesion, and studying the efficacy of topiramate in depressive symptoms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>All elegible patients admitted at the outpatient clinic from the violence program of Federal University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo Hospital (UNIFESP) who read and signed a consent inform approved by the UNIFESP Institutional Review Board (IRB) will enter the study.

Those having a significant improvement of the symptoms (a CGI-I score less than 3) will be excluded (avoiding premature placebo effects).</p></sec><sec><title>Active treatment phase</title><p>Those patients without improvement during the placebo trial, and do not show any laboratory and clinical condition exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo or topiramate, in a 1:1 ratio using computer- generated code. The active and placebo pills will be identical. All research and clinical staff will be blinded to the randomized assignments.</p><p>Study medication will start at 25 mg/day once daily, at night, and will be increased 25 mg weekly, as tolerated, until complete or nearly complete efficacy is achieved or until 200 mg/day is reached. No other psychotropic medications will be allowed during the study, except for zolpidem (10 mg/day), if needed, for insomnia.</p><p>Study follow-up visits will be conducted at baseline, and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12.</p><p>Symptoms and side effects will be assessed, as well as measurement of systemic blood pressure and pulse rate in each visit by the investigator, who is blind to medication assignment. Compliance will be assessed by counting the amount of pills left in the bottle of medicine in each visit.</p><p>Treatment will be continued for 12 weeks (active treatment phase); then drug administration will be withdrawn gradually during 2 weeks with reductions of 25/50 mg every three days, according to the final dosage reached.</p><p>Patients will be assessed until completing 6 months during a follow-up period. If a patient showed a symptomatology worsening during the active treatment phase (12 weeks) when receiving active drug treatment, characterized by a one-point decrease at CGI -I or present serious adverse effects related to medication, he/she will be excluded from the study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample Size</title><p>The number of subjects calculated for the trial is 72, being 36 on each cell. The sample size was calculated considering a 5% probability of type I error (significance level), and 20% for type II error (power test of 80%), on a bi-caudal test. To the calculation we use an average of 60% for response from PTSD for active drugs, based on published literature, and 30% of placebo response.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All data will be analyzed by SPSS (version 13.0). The frequencies of nominal variables from all patients will be calculated. The data analysis will be conducted using a ANOVA comparing each scale during the 2 continuous measures from baseline and 12 weeks with a Between Subject factor was included as independent variable (treatment group). The confidence level that will be used for all comparisons will be 5% (p &#x0003c; .05). All observed Power as a type II error function will be presented with minimum values of significance for each comparison. CAPS scores from baseline and endpoint will be stratified according severity, as nominal data they will be compared using the chi-square test and the Fisher test when there were cells that counted less than five or at least one cell counted zero subjects. For missing data we will use the last observation carried forward strategy for an intention-to-treat analysis.</p><p>Efficacy analyses will be performed in the intent-to-treat population of patients who received at least one dose of topiramate. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the change in PTSD Scale- CAPS total score from baseline to the final visit at 12 weeks, which will be compared between treatment groups. Missing efficacy data at 12 weeks will be imputed with the last observation carried forward. The secondary outcomes between groups will be comparing the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Global Assessment of Function (GAF), and the PANAS scales. Other secondary analyses will include an evaluation after 24-weeks (12-week after last patient visit with drug) data with endpoint analyses between the treatment groups covarying for baseline scores. On all secondary outcomes, the Bonferroni correction will be applied for testing multiple variables. Response will be defined as a 20% improvement in the baseline CAPS total or positive symptom scores at 12 weeks and will be compared between treatment groups using a chi-square test. Proportions of patients completing the 12-week double-blind study will be compared between treatment groups using a chi-square test. Adverse events reported by 10% of patients in each treatment group will be compared using a chi-square test. Laboratory values, vital signs and physical examinations are going to be compared from baseline and in reference to normal ranges, and reported as normal or abnormal. Changes in body weight (lb), body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) at last visit in the 12-week dataset will be compared as mean changes between treatment groups using t-tests.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JJM, MFM, developed the design of the randomised clinical trial and participated in writing the article.
