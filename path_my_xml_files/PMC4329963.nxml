Background</title><p>Methamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant, which is produced by synthesis and combination of extremely dangerous chemicals (<xref rid="A20024R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). According to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report in 2013, Iran holds the fifth rank among the countries with high consumption of methamphetamine (<xref rid="A20024R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Methamphetamine abuse often leads to numerous sequels including serious psychological problems, criminal involvements, matrimonial problems and divorce, emotional and social problems, and job instability. These all demote quality of life (QoL) and lifestyle of methamphetamine users (<xref rid="A20024R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Nonetheless, medical interventions for methamphetamine abuse has received due attention mostly and its psychological tangles such as QoL lack that attention (<xref rid="A20024R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). According to World Health Organization, 70% to 80% and 40% to 50% of mortalities in respectively developed and developing countries emanate from lifestyle-related diseases and habits such as drug abuse (<xref rid="A20024R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Pender defines lifestyle as a pattern of daily living voluntarily activities that seriously affect one's health, which originates from demographic, environmental, and social milieu and context (<xref rid="A20024R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Pender also considers the health-promoting lifestyle as a multidimensional pattern of self-initiated actions and perceptions that maintains or enhances the level of health, QoL, self-actualization, and self-fulfillment. Therefore, lifestyle is one of the important elements in promoting health (<xref rid="A20024R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). On the other hand, health-related QoL can provide a comprehensive picture of individuals' health, which can be used in monitoring people's health, determination of health-related needs and priorities, evaluation of interventions effectiveness, and comparison of interventions with each other (<xref rid="A20024R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Given the problems in changing and maintenance of health-promoting lifestyle and QoL among methamphetamine users, it is necessary to use relevant behavior change theories and patterns along with effective interventions to draw people out of such an addictive trap. One of the most comprehensive and predictive models on health-promoting lifestyle and health-related QoL is Pender's health promotion model (PHPM), which is considered as a framework to determine health-promoting lifestyle behaviors. PHPM consists of three groups of factors:</p><list list-type="order" id="L3"><list-item><p>individual characteristics and experiences;</p></list-item><list-item><p>behavior- specific cognition and affect; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>behavioral outcomes (<xref rid="A20024R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>Behavior-specific cognition and affect factors, which points to most fundamental behavioral motivations, consist of a series of variables including perceived self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived barrier, and perceived social support that are in the core of empowerment-driven interventions (<xref rid="A20024R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Similar to other drugs, methamphetamine abuse has negative effects on the user and contaminates the family and even the whole society. Therefore, it is necessary to empower methamphetamine user as well as their family members to control the addiction and adopt a healthy lifestyle and better QoL. Most scientists hold that empowerment is a dynamic, positive (<xref rid="A20024R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="A20024R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), interactive, and a social process (<xref rid="A20024R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) that takes place in the relationship with others and leads to the improvement of QoL and health promotion among the patients and better response to treatment (<xref rid="A20024R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Family-centered empowerment model (FCEM),which emphasizes on individuals and their family members' role, is comprised of three motivational, psychologic, and problem characteristics (<xref rid="A20024R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The main purpose of FCEMis to empower the family system, ie, patient and other family members, to promote health. This model has been used for health promotion among patients with chronic diseases; however, it has not been used for drug and stimulant abuse, especially for methamphetamine abuse. Therefore, given the results of numerous studies on alarming magnitude of methamphetamine use in Iran, a family-centered effective planning with a direct focus on society seems necessary to reduce consumption of drugs and stimulants, especially methamphetamine.</p></sec><sec id="sec75222"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>This study aimed to determine the effects of educational intervention based on FCEM and PHP Mon health-promoting lifestyle and health-related QoL among methamphetamine users, who were admitted to Tehran University of Medical Sciences Substance Abuse Treatment centers, and their families.</p></sec><sec id="sec75235"><title>3. Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec75223"><title>3.1. Study Population and Sampling</title><p>In this randomized clinical trial with an educational intervention and a preintervention/post intervention design, methamphetamine-dependent individuals and their families were recruited. All subjects were in recovery phase and were admitted to Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, clinics during a 12-month period from 2012 to 2013. Inclusion criteria were as follows: being between 20 to 64 years old, a history of drug abuse of less than ten years, being in recovery phase, detoxified, and willing to participate in the study. Drug use relapse and unwillingness to participate were the exclusion criteria. Random numbers table was used to select subjects and their family members. Then they were randomly allocated to two intervention and a control groups. Intervention groups comprised of one group of methamphetamine users in recovery (95 subjects) and one group of their family members (father, mother, sister, or brother of single patients and wife or child of married ones) (95 subjects).Control group included methamphetamine users in recovery phase who received no educational intervention (95 subjects).</p></sec><sec id="sec75224"><title>3.2. Sample Size</title><p>Odds ratio (OR) was used to choose the required sample. A study showed that about 50% of uneducated methamphetamine users had a low level of QoL (<xref rid="A20024R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>); indeed, its OR among educated users was 2.5 times as high as OR among uneducated ones. Considering 95% confidence interval (CI) and 80% power, the following formula was used to choose the sample.</p><p>
<inline-formula>p<sub>1</sub> = 0.5, p<sub>2</sub> = (p<sub>1</sub> &#x000d7; OR)/[1 + (OR &#x02212; 1) p<sub>1</sub>] = 0.7, P = (p<sub>1</sub> + p<sub>2</sub>)/2 = 0.6, and 1 - P = 0.4</inline-formula>

Health-Related Quality of Life Scale</title><p>To measure health-related QoL, SF-36 (Short Form 36) QoL questionnaire, validity and reliability of which had been confirmed in Iran, was used (<xref rid="A20024R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This questionnaire includes 36 questions in eight dimensions: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, mental wellbeing, social functioning, pain, and general health. This questionnaire is designed in a five-choice Likert scale, with scores ranging from one to five. For the scoring purpose, raw scores of each section are calculated and summed together and then are converted to standard scores. Standardized score for each dimension of QoL ranges from zero to 100.

Discussion</title><p>Effective interventions based on health promotion models are considered as solutions for public health problems. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of an educational program, based on FCEM, on health-promoting lifestyle, health-related QoL, and constructs of PHPM among methamphetamine abusers and their family members. Results showed that among methamphetamine users and their family members, performed educational program, based on FCEM that focuses on supportive psychotherapy, effectively worked towards total health-promoting lifestyle, total health-related QoL, and constructs of PHPM. In other words, educational intervention was acceptable and desirable for methamphetamine users and their family members. Individuals under the aegis of FCEM were taught on following issues: problem solving methods that help better deal with life issues; identification of opportunities for catharsis; relaxation and positive imagination to reduce stress and create internal calmness; investigation of reasons for feeling guilty and ways to tackle it; methods to increasing self-confidence with reliance on personal abilities; and encouragement to do useful daily tasks. These all led to considerable improvement in subjects&#x02019; lifestyle, QoL, and perceived-cognitive factors. Comparing to preintervention scores, post intervention average score of health-promoting lifestyle scale among groups under the educational intervention was statistically significant. Healthy lifestyle literally means a kind of balance in life so that one can make wise choices through life. According to recent studies, a healthy lifestyle includes the following components: a sense of security, a risk-free life, participation in voluntarily social activities, and perception and recognition of risks (<xref rid="A20024R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Post intervention average score of perceived social support, including support from parents, relatives, and friends, was significant among intervention groups. This finding was in line with Heidari et al. study who investigated the effect of supportive psychotherapy sessions on permanent drug withdrawal (<xref rid="A20024R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). It was also in line with Knowlton et al. study who investigated the positive effect of social support behaviors of drug injectors (<xref rid="A20024R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Social support is considered as an important factor in the process that stops drug abuse. A study conducted in the United States among methamphetamine users showed that they related committing suicide to inappropriate relations between parents and children, lack of support from family, and improper social relations at school and in society (<xref rid="A20024R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This indicated that if an individual receives proper social support, they would be more likely to learn and use encountering skills such as problem solving, social skills, and communicational skills and would try to make these skills more effective. Indeed, their health becomes more important for them and consequently, provided treatment and care works better in preventing them from drug abuse recurrence in high-risk situations (<xref rid="A20024R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Our findings revealed that post intervention average score of health-related QoL among intervention groups was significantly higher than controls, which was in line with Hosseinian et al. study (<xref rid="A20024R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In fact, this vulnerable group needs supportive and psychologic education to enjoy a high quality and healthy life. This type of education is also expected to reduce their physical and mental problems. our results showed that post intervention average score of total self-efficacy among intervention groups was significantly higher than controls, which was in line with the study of Rounds-Bryant et al. on tobacco and alcohol misuse treatment (<xref rid="A20024R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In another research on self-efficacy and addiction, it was shown that high self-efficacy would reduce the risk of methamphetamine and alcohol use (<xref rid="A20024R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). One of the effective ways to increase self-efficacy among addicts is to provide a proper education for those who are highly exposed to risks and create opportunities for them to observe others peoples&#x02019; success. These might create a context for self-efficacy and consequently, might minimize depression symptoms. Moreover, they can be used as tools to avoid drug use after withdrawal (<xref rid="A20024R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Difficulty in recognition of positive excitements and insufficiency in establishment of emotional relationships with others are of main characteristics of drug abusers (<xref rid="A20024R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The ability to perceive emotions can make individuals resistant and secure when encountering momentums and challenges. In present study, post intervention average score of perceived emotions among intervention groups was also significantly higher than controls. Studies have revealed that with growth of positive emotions and excitements, communicational skills also improve and individuals get determined to stop addiction (<xref rid="A20024R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="A20024R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). This study showed that post intervention average score of perceived barriers for intervention groups was significantly higher in comparison to preintervention scores. Barriers are often considered as obstacles or personal expenses resulting from a particular behavior. Concerning methamphetamine use, overcoming perceived barriers requires an attempt to change improper beliefs about methamphetamine as well as inappropriate and incompatible purposes, and to make wise decisions to stop methamphetamine addiction. To realize that, methamphetamine users need special consultation, medical treatment for addiction symptoms, and special centers equipped sufficiently for methamphetamine treatment. One of the strength points of this study is that it was a randomized clinical trial, which doubles its worth in comparison to other similar descriptive studies. However, those addicts who entered the study and experienced methamphetamine abuse for the first time were not able to answer questions correctly and this could cloud the results. In addition, although the present study tried to consider cultural diversity, such a consideration defies to be fully done and it should be considered when interpreting the results. Administration of FCEM among methamphetamine users and their family members is practically feasible and results in enhancement and improvement of their QoL and lifestyle. Therefore, family-centered empowerment approach can be used in future interventions to improve lifestyle and QoL of other vulnerable groups and their family members.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was part of a PhD thesis conducted at Tehran University of Medical Sciences.
