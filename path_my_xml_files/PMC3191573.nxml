Patient enrolment started in February 2011 and is expected to end in February 2012 with a total of 200 patients included. The study is performed in compliance with the ethical principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, as well as the Danish and Swedish data-protection agencies and ethical committees. Patients receive complete oral and written information about the trial, and a written consent has to be signed. The study protocol has been registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link> (identifier: NCT01287637).</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Patients eligible for enrolment into EASY are 18+&#x02005;years of age and have all received surgical treatment (low anterior resection of the rectum) for rectal cancer with the construction of a temporary ileostomy. Adjuvant therapy will be registered in the case report form, and is not an exclusion criterion.</p><p>During the first days after surgery, the patients undergo an individual assessment and screening process describing their postsurgical state. The assessment is carried out by a surgeon, and the patients are categorised and scored regarding bowel function, functional level of nutrition and mobilisation. The surgeon performs a physical examination 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;days after surgery and states whether or not faeces and gas have passed from the ileostomy, how the patient is nourished and how many hours the patient is out of bed. This assessment is carried out before scanning of the anastomosis, to prevent the surgeon being biased by the result.</p><p>Six to 8 days after creation of the stoma, patients eligible for inclusion will undergo a CT of the rectum with a water-soluble contrast medium to visualise the anastomosis and possible leakage. The contrast medium (eg, Omnipaque, with an iodine concentration of 350&#x02005;mg/ml, manufactured by GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wisconsin) is diluted in isotonic saline to a 5% solution (50&#x02005;ml of Omnipaque, with an iodine concentration of 350&#x02005;mg/ml in 1000&#x02005;ml of isotonic saline).</p><p>The contrast medium is instilled using a Foley catheter placed in the rectum just below the anastomosis. The catheter must be placed high enough in the rectum to prevent it from sliding out accidentally, as the balloon is not inflated. The infusion of the contrast (300&#x02013;500&#x02005;ml) takes about 5&#x02013;10&#x02005;min, and patients do not experience any discomfort during this procedure. If there is a leak of contrast outside the rectum, the patient will not be included in the study.</p><p>Data on the assessment and the results of the CT scan are entered into a screening log, where information on all patients, entering or not entering the study, is described.</p><p>The exclusion criteria are: patients with diabetes, patients being treated with steroids, patients with linguistic difficulties and patients with expected low compliance.</p><p>Patients are included if they consent to participate after receiving both oral and written information, and if they meet the inclusion criteria, do not have radiologically identifiable anastomotic leaks and are assessed to be fit to undergo surgery, based on the aforementioned screening and assessment process.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Patients who have provided written informed consent preceding inclusion and who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are randomised to either early or late reversal of the temporary ileostomy. Inclusion and randomisation are carried out shortly after the CT scan.</p><p>The randomisation is based on blocks of six. The randomisation list is computer-generated using dedicated software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>). The randomisation list is not known to the local or head investigators, as it is kept by an administrative employee, who sends out the needed case report forms and the correlating randomisation numbers.

Whether something is to be classified as a minor or major complication or as &#x02018;severe&#x02019; or &#x02018;less severe&#x02019;, is avoided by using the classification. This ensures that data are based on objective criteria, whereby the influence of personal and/or cultural conditions is minimised. There are seven grades (I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb and V), starting with grade I, &#x02018;any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for pharmacological treatment or surgical, endoscopic and radiological interventions&#x02019; and ending with grade V, &#x02018;death of a patient&#x02019;. In this sense, mortality, tied to the surgical intervention, is classified as the most severe complication of all.</p><p>The classification has been used in several clinical studies, and the method has been validated extensively.</p><p>All complications are logged, and both the type and severity of each complication are documented at hospital discharge, and 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Health-related quality of life: the instruments</title><p>Short form 36 is a generic tool that evaluates quality of life from patients' self-reports on different states influencing quality of life. It consists of 36 items that measure eight dimensions of health on a multi-item scale. The instrument measures physical functioning, social functioning and role limitations because of physical and emotional problems. The scoring scale ranges from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating worse health. The instrument has been extensively validated, and baseline data in both Danish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and Swedish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> populations have been published.</p><p>The Ostomy Adjustment Scale is a disease-specific questionnaire that measures the patients' subjective adaptation to life with a stoma. The focus is on physical, mental as well as social modifications following stoma creation. The questionnaire has 34 questions and is widely used and validated within different cohorts of patients with stomas. Scoring ranges from 1 to 6, and lower scores indicate a lower quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref></p><p>European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer CR30 is a cancer-specific questionnaire of five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea, and vomiting), one global health status and quality-of-life scale, and six single-item measures (dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea and financial difficulties). A high score for a functional scale represents a high level of functioning, whereas a high score for a symptom scale represents a high level of symptoms.</p><p>The CR29 is a questionnaire designed for use in patients undergoing treatment for colorectal cancer. It consists of questions assessing disease symptoms, side-effects of treatment, body image, sexuality and future perspective.

With the differences in describing the main outcome in mind, we propose a conservative assumption of 30% complications in the control group and 10% in the intervention group, a power of 80% and a significance level of 5%. This gives a needed total sample of 144 patients (72 in each group). We have chosen to include 100 patients in each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Regarding the primary end-point, the two groups will be compared using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Furthermore, a CI for the difference between the two proportions will also be calculated, using a Gaussian approximation. For comparing the cost assessment between the two groups, a Student t test will be used, or a Welsh version of the test in case of differing variance. If the distribution is significantly skewed, the Mann&#x02013;Whitney test will be used instead. For analysing quality of life, non-parametric tests will be used in all analyses&#x02014;that is, we will use the Mann&#x02013;Whitney test, Wilcoxon test and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, where relevant. Variations over time within the same patient group will be analysed with the Friedman analysis of variance. Data will be described using medians and ranges. We plan to carry out an intention-to-treat analysis as well as a per-protocol analysis. Generally, p&#x0003c;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. If randomisation fails with generating comparable groups, that is, if the two groups differ significantly at the start, for example, country, gender and age, we will use multivariate approaches in order to adjust for these differences.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>EASY is a randomised clinical trial in patients with rectal cancer and explores the efficiency of early reversal (8&#x02013;13&#x02005;days) of a temporary ileostomy created simultaneously with a low anterior resection compared with the standard reversal, which is usually after 3&#x02005;months.</p><p>A randomised and controlled study with 186 patients reversed the stoma 8&#x02013;10&#x02005;days after surgery compared with the standard procedure, where the stoma was reversed after 62&#x02013;69&#x02005;days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> In this study, there were no significant differences in frequencies of complications (15% in both groups), but there were significant differences in types of complications, where the early closure group had significantly more wound complications, and the late closure group had significantly more cases of small-bowel obstruction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref></p><p>A prospective study showed that earlier reversal (median 11&#x02005;days instead of 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;months) was not associated with increased morbidity or mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> A small randomised study investigated the role of early closure (10&#x02005;days after surgery) of ileostomies in 36 preoperatively selected patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> This study found that the length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the intervention group and that the time until bowel function and resumption of oral nutrition did not differ between the groups.

The term &#x02018;wound complication&#x02019; covers major as well as minor levels of severity, and as such does not offer a precise description. Moreover, The Clavien&#x02013;Dindo Classification of Surgical Complications seems to be influenced by the level of experience with the medical staff using it,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> and it is recommended that the assessment be carried out by committed personnel, which in this study is achieved by engaging specialist professionals as local investigators.</p><p>A variety of questionnaires or tools have been used to assess quality of life as it pertains to specific health outcomes. In the healthcare sector, the counterpart of quality-of-life measures are health-outcome measures other than biomedical. These may include an ability to perform tasks of daily living, energy level and other indicators of well-being associated with, but not identical to, the medical condition.</p><p>When measuring health-related quality of life, some studies have failed to use a precise and sufficient tool, as questionnaires may have to be combined in order to obtain valid data.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> Other studies have focused on health-related quality-of-life measurements that solely monitor gastrointestinal symptoms, which might explain difficulties in the interpretation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> Although some of the findings have been inconsistent, the main results were that patients with colorectal cancer both with and without a stoma reported limitations to their quality of life, but patients with a stoma generally reported more impairment than patients without a stoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> However, a low anterior resection with routine temporary loop ileostomy produced a marked impairment in health-related quality of life in the months after construction, and improved after ileostomy closure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref></p><p>In designing a trial that undertakes socio-economic measurements alongside the medical and health-related data, we wished to obtain, as far as possible, a real-life design. Although all trials present challenges to those undertaking socio-economic measurements, these are methodologically lessened in the case of more realistic trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref></p><p>For this reason, the inclusion criteria are based on everyday surgical decision-making, which includes and combines extensive surgical experience of the individual surgeon with the systematic stratification model offered. Besides that, all patients eligible for inclusion, but not included, will be logged in order to present a detailed description with clinically relevant real-life data.</p><p>The economic data include costs related to hospital care and out-of-hospital care, for instance in the stoma clinic. However, in order to present data that supersede the hospital-based care and treatment, this trial focuses on costs generated from visits to the general practitioner, primary care as well as costs related to patients' individual socio-economic data. This entails, for instance, patient-reported time-data covering returning to work, and socially relevant data indicating cancer patients' adaptation to living with a stoma versus living without a stoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref></p><p>In conclusion, we have designed a multi-centre study, in order to answer a relatively unexplored and complex scientific question within everyday surgery, the timing of the reversal of a temporary ileostomy created to prevent leakage after low anterior resection due to rectal cancer. Earlier studies have shown that the timing is a central element regarding morbidity and mortality, but so far only a few studies have explored the additional issues such as the psychosocial and economic impact of early versus late reversal of stomas with a follow-up period of 12&#x02005;months. With the dimensions of the EASY trial, we hope to be able to make evidence-based recommendations for timing of the closure of a temporary ileostomy after surgery for rectal cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d32e163" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000162.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e164" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000162.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>To cite:</bold> Danielsen AK, Correa-Marinez A, Angenete E, <italic>et al</italic>.
