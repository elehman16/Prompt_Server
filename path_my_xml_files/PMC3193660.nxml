Yoga therapeutics is an increasingly appreciated discipline, particularly in India where it is overseen by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH). Not many studies have assessed the influence of integral yoga practices on psychological and health variables, establishing many possible benefits. This study apart from establishing the benefits of internal yoga investigates the relationships between the variables themselves. Up till now, this correlation aspect has not been much investigated, since this requires simultaneous measuring of many variables for a large group, and then to correlate. The aim of the present study is to begin to remedy this deficiency. It measured many variables on a group of volunteers large enough to identify significant correlations between variables. Specifically it evaluated correlations between measures of sustained attention, emotional intelligence, general health and <italic>guna</italic> personality before and after a one-month Yoga instructor's course.</p><p>Sustained attention is the capacity to attend to a task for a required period of time. The ability may be related to steadiness of focus, which in turn is a sign of mental stability. Sustained attention may thus depend on emotionality.</p><p>A self-controlled study on 20 male volunteers measured immediate effects of three yoga-breathing techniques on performance of a letter cancellation task (LCT).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Practice of alternate nostril yoga breathing (<italic>Nadi suddhi pranayama</italic>) and right nostril yoga breathing (<italic>Surya anuloma pranayama</italic>) improved task performance. No significant change was observed following left nostril breathing, or simple breath awareness. The authors concluded that anxiety-reducing effects of pranayama might have contributed to better LCT performance, since this requires selective attention.</p><p>Patil and Telles[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] measured the effects of two yoga-based relaxation techniques on six letter cancellation (SLC) test performance, a task requiring selective attention, concentration, visual scanning abilities and repetitive motor response. Cyclic meditation brought about a greater improvement than supine rest again suggesting anxiety reduction.</p><p>Khemka <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] in a two separate control studies measured immediate effects of two relaxation techniques and immediate effect of <italic>Kapalbhati</italic> and breath awareness on healthy volunteers on performance of SLC task and digit letter substitution (DLS) task and found significant increase in both task performances of attention in all four interventions of two studies.</p><p>Emotional intelligence has been variously defined as &#x0201c;the ability to control one's own and other's feelings and emotions, to discriminate amongst them, and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions&#x0201d;,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] &#x0201c;&#x02026; the capacity for recognizing our own feelings and those of others, for motivating ourselves, and for managing emotions well in ourselves and in relationships.&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Goleman claims that about 80% of a person's success in life depends on emotional competencies as measured by EQ.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>A controlled study of 170 subjects by Kumari <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] assessed the effects of a six week part-time self management of excessive tension (SMET) program for managers on their emotional well-being. EQ scores increased significantly on four of the five subscales.</p><p>General health is not just absence of disease, but is well being on physical, mental and social levels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Many studies have found improvements due to yoga practice. A small randomized control trial of <italic>sahaja yoga</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] evaluated effects on depressive disorders. Anxiety and depression scores reduced more in the yoga group. In a study of Yoga's effects on distress symptoms in survivors of the 2005 tsunami,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] self-rated fear, anxiety, sadness and disturbed sleep decreased significantly along with heart and breathing rates for indigenous people. A review of <italic>Sudarshan Kriya Yoga</italic> for stress, anxiety, and depression concluded that the technique enhances well being, mood, attention, mental focus and stress tolerance,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and seems beneficial as a low risk, low cost adjunct to treatment of many conditions, and for criminal rehabilitation. A study of <italic>hatha yoga's</italic> effects in 107 healthy adults found improved physical and mental health and well-being.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>A controlled pilot study evaluating a comprehensive yogic breathing program observed reduced anxiety, depression and stress, and increased optimism in the experimental group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] An RCT comparing meditation stress-management and education programs as adjuncts to pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorder found reduced anxiety and depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] These results consistently find that professionally administered yoga programs improve many health variables.</p><p><italic>Guna</italic> personality variables are three Vedic personality patterns named <italic>sattva, rajas</italic> and <italic>tamas</italic>: Sattva brings calmness, lightness, illumination, control, and the beginning of selflessness, all triggering constructive action; <italic>rajas</italic> is a more compulsive tendency to action and selfishness, producing pain, and a restless mind; <italic>tamas</italic> manifests as lethargy, drowsiness or sleepiness, blocks, and stagnation. According to Vedic psychology, these <italic>gunas</italic> constantly control a person's tendencies: &#x0201c;Everyone is helplessly driven to action by the <italic>gunas</italic>&#x0201d;.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>An evaluation of yoga's impact on the <italic>gunas</italic>, and on self-ideal disparity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] found significant correlations between self and ideal self for the yoga group, but not for controls. <italic>Tamas</italic> was associated with disparity between self and ideal self. Another study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] found that the Hare Krishna mantra increased <italic>sattva</italic> and decreased <italic>rajas</italic> and <italic>tamas</italic>. Generally, Yoga aims to improve <italic>guna</italic> quality, until <italic>sattva</italic> dominates all the time.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Correlations between attention and <italic>gunas</italic>: <italic>gunas</italic> are related to cognitive characteristics,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] perceptual acuity and field independence,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] intelligence, memory, and attention-concentration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Negative correlations are reported between <italic>tamas</italic> and field independence, short-term memory, intelligence and attention-concentration, and positive correlations between <italic>sattva</italic> and general intelligence, short-term memory and attention-concentration. Ability to focus attention correlates positively with <italic>sattva</italic>, and negatively with <italic>tamas</italic>.</p><p>Correlations between EQ and <italic>gunas</italic> have been studied by Kumari <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Finding none, they concluded that the two are distinct personality concepts.</p><p>Correlations between health and <italic>gunas</italic>: A study of <italic>rajas</italic> and <italic>tamas</italic> in psychological disturbance found the two predominant factors in the patient population,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] suggesting that elevated levels of <italic>rajas</italic> and <italic>tamas</italic> give rise to mental ill health. It is generally agreed that predominance of <italic>rajas</italic> and <italic>tamas</italic> leads to psychological disturbance. <italic>Sattva guna</italic>, on the other hand, leads to positive mental health and optimal functioning. It embodies spiritual values, considered to take subjects beyond mental health problems. Similarly, a study of 100 cancer patients found that patients high in <italic>rajas</italic> or <italic>tamas</italic> are more prone to cancer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, an RCT on <italic>gunas</italic> and health[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] found <italic>sattva</italic> improved more in the yoga group than in controls. <italic>Rajas</italic> reduced significantly in the physical exercise (control) group. General health status improved in both groups, consistent with the finding that, while <italic>sattva</italic> correlates positively with health, <italic>rajas</italic> correlates negatively. Based on previous studies on various variables and their correlations, we give below details of different tests by which these variables are measured.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>The tests</title><p>The SLC and DLS tests assess selective, focused and sustained attention, visual scanning and activation and inhibition of rapid responses.

Therefore, one may conclude that yoga imparts significant benefits to healthy people also.</p><p>In correlation studies, pairs of variables are usually correlated if there is overlap between the various brain regions that each involves, even secondarily. Sustained attention variables, though well correlated with each other, do not correlate significantly with most other variables. The reason is probably that there is little overlap between the principal brain regions utilized. Sustained attention is primarily governed by cortical areas concerned with various stages of cognition.</p><p>In healthy subjects, cortical areas concerned with variables like EQ and health are only secondarily involved. Sustained attention is strongly dependent on <italic>tamas</italic> probably due to common influence of stress, anxiety or depression, on both task performance and personality. Cognitive processing is mostly cortical, but emotions and imbalances are more connected to mid-brain centers, which also modulate cortical function. Negative influence on these centers will have corresponding effects on cortical function. <italic>Sattva</italic> on the other hand may be postulated to be a state where modulation of cortical processing is optimal.</p><p>Common use of brain regions, which tends to correlate variables with each other as seen between EQ and guna personality, may be predicted from traditional guna analysis. Detailed characteristics of guna personality types identify <italic>sattvic</italic> people as having higher EQ, <italic>rajasic</italic> people as slightly negative, and <italic>tamasic</italic> people as low in EQ. Could this be due to insensitivity to mirror neuron functions? This sequence is reflected in pre-pre and post-post correlations between EQ and <italic>sattva, rajas</italic> and <italic>tamas</italic>: Positive for the first, a little negative for the second, and far more negative for the third. One way to understand Yoga's strong positive effect on EQ is that it first increases alertness (exemplified by increases in sustained attention); next it erases negative influences on personality (exemplified by decreases in <italic>tamas</italic>); and finally this leads to increased sensitivity to others&#x02019; feelings and emotions (exemplified by increases in <italic>sattva</italic>).</p><p>Previous failure to observe the EQ-<italic>guna</italic> correlations identified here[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] may have been due to a more restricted sample: Industry managers, with a more limited range of personalities. Our observations of independence of <italic>sattva</italic> and <italic>rajas</italic> agree with previous results as do negative correlations between <italic>sattva</italic> and <italic>tamas</italic>. However, our study found high correlation between <italic>rajas</italic> and <italic>tamas</italic>, not seen previously.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] These correlations may be due to a restricted range of subjects (healthy), manifesting less <italic>tamas</italic> than a general population. Kumari's result[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] suggests it is probably not due to inherent weakness in the questionnaire. This topic merits further investigation.</p><p>When these correlations are compared with each other, many offer self-consistent results; negative correlations between scores on the SLC test and <italic>tamas</italic>, and between <italic>tamas</italic> and <italic>sattva</italic> are consistent with positive correlations observed between SLC scores and <italic>sattva</italic>.</p><p>Remarkably, although the SLC and DLS tests are considered equivalent, they produced inconsistent correlations with the variables EQ, <italic>tamas</italic> and <italic>sattva</italic>. It is not clear whether these are chance results or if they effectively distinguish between SLC and DLS tests.</p><p>Of particular interest are the correlations between general health and other variables. GHQ is scored according to negative health findings, so high scores indicate susceptibility to disease, particularly psychic illness. Thus, positive <italic>r</italic>-value correlations with GHQ scores indicate a tendency to fall sick, while negative correlations indicate tendencies to better health. Here negative correlations between GHQ and EQ indicate improved health with improved EQ. Positive correlations with <italic>tamas</italic> confirm tendencies of high <italic>tamas</italic> people to disease.</p><p>The result that <italic>tamas</italic> correlate negatively with <italic>sattva</italic> confirms that the two oppose each other. Post-post correlations between GHQ and <italic>tamas</italic> increased, while correlations between GHQ and <italic>sattva</italic> and <italic>rajas</italic> remained similar. Yoga's improvements in these three variables did not alter their mutual correlations. The failure of <italic>tamasic</italic> personalities to improve in health increased the negative correlations between GHQ and <italic>tamas</italic>.</p><p>Correlations observed between the <italic>gunas</italic> themselves do not necessarily indicate poor choice of variables, as normally holds for tests of individual differences in personality. Rather, they tend to confirm that elevated levels of <italic>tamas</italic> (and to some extent <italic>rajas</italic>) prevent subjects from manifesting high levels of <italic>sattva</italic>. The observed negative correlations between <italic>sattva</italic> and <italic>tamas</italic> are therefore to be expected.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>A single month of integral yoga practices imparts significant benefits to healthy volunteers in all psychological and health variables. It improves sustained attention and EQ. It improves the personality of the healthy person by increasing <italic>sattva</italic> and decreasing <italic>rajas</italic> and <italic>tamas</italic>. It also improves all dimensions of general health.</p><p>Cognitive processes involved in sustained attention tests did not correlate with health and personality tests. This may be because the major brain regions involved in cognitive abilities were sufficiently different from those of personality for this group of healthy subjects. Enhancement in the functioning of one would not then seem to affect the other.</p><p>On the other hand, the impact of <italic>sattvic</italic> personality on both emotional intelligence and tamas was established. These significant results would not emerge by measuring single variables alone. It suggests that regular yoga practice benefits people for deeper reasons than immediate effects on the physical body. As Yoga practice transforms people's dominant <italic>guna</italic> making them more <italic>sattvic</italic>, their ability to spontaneously maintain high levels of health increases while not being affected by unhelpful emotions.</p><p>Thus, it is seen that integral yoga practices impart significant benefits and measuring correlations between different variables can yield significant information of potential importance that would not otherwise be available. Such studies should definitely be continued in future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work forms part of a dissertation to be submitted by the first author (SSK) to the Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusamsthana Sansthana in partial fulfillment of his doctoral degree.
