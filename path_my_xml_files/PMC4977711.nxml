Such waits have also been associated with increased anxiety and decreased levels of community participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Strategies most commonly used for managing waitlists and reducing waiting time in health services are often ineffective, or are successful only under specific circumstances. Injections of resources to temporarily boost supply of health services without a subsequent change in service delivery often have only short-term effects, with waiting lists tending to recur over time. The Netherlands provides a case in point, where $3 billion was made available in addition to normal health funding for waiting list reductions in 1999&#x02013;2001, and had no impact on waiting list reduction. The same number of people were still waiting for care five years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Increasing resources in isolation are not sufficient to affect waiting list reductions; substantive changes to the delivery of services are required.</p><p>Triage systems that place new patients onto a waitlist and then use protocols to guide decisions about who should be seen next are a common strategy across a wide range of outpatient services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] but are not always effective in improving patient flow. While triage systems may have an important role in discriminating between patients who require health care services and those who do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and prioritising those who need urgent care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], they also have drawbacks. The assignment of triage categories is often unreliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and triage systems can lead to inefficiencies in service delivery by diverting resources from frontline care inadvertently contributing to waiting time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, a study of the triage system in community rehabilitation in a large metropolitan health service showed that the system made little difference to waiting time for the vast majority of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>There are several specific elements in access and triage processes that have been shown to reduce waiting time and improve patient flow. For example, a recent review of the literature found that the ability to manage less resource intensive cases and/or commence initial management at triage was effective by providing the opportunity to quickly address simple needs on identification rather than placing a patient on a waiting list to be reassessed in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Commencing initial management at triage requires triage to be conducted by somebody close to the face of service provision, and has been used successfully in emergency departments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], outpatient clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Another important consideration in maximising patient flow is to identify whether there is a true imbalance between supply and demand, and to target interventions accordingly. Some waitlists are stable over time, indicating that the number of referrals being received must roughly equal the number of patients being discharged, but a constant backlog leads to a constant delay. Triage systems are then used to sort the patients who are waiting according to urgency. The Advance Access system designed for primary care used an initial injection of resources to manage the backlog followed by a system level change to maintain patient flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and has been shown to reduce the time to see a general practitioner from several weeks to 1 or 2&#x000a0;days in clinics with previously long waiting times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Finally, reducing complexity in access, triage and booking processes can free up resources for frontline care, thereby increasing the efficiency of patient flow. For example, where triage processes are used, there is evidence that simpler systems (using only two categories for &#x0201c;urgent&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;routine&#x0201d; cases, for example) may be equally as effective and more reliable than more complex multi-category systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>STAT: an alternative approach to access and triage</title><p>An alternative approach to the traditional &#x02018;waitlist and triage&#x02019; approach to managing access to outpatient and community services, known as Specific &#x00026; Timely Appointments for Triage (STAT), was developed using the evidence-based principles describe above. The STAT model requires clinicians to schedule a specified number of appointments for triage and assessment of new referrals in their weekly schedule, based on systematic analysis of supply and demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. All patients are assessed in the first available time slot, and the clinician then prioritises the patient within the context of his/her caseload. Unlike traditional triage systems, clinicians are able to consider the relative priority of both new patients and those already under their care, and the system drives clinicians to seek efficiencies in patient management and make decisions in response to demand. Triage is done by people at the point of service delivery with options for management, and is flexible and based on clinical judgement. The need for complex triage protocols with high reliability becomes irrelevant. Key features of the system and comparison to a traditional waitlist are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of traditional STAT and &#x02018;Waitlist and triage&#x02019; models (originally published in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/270/paper/AH13033.htm">http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/270/paper/AH13033.htm</ext-link>, reproduced with permission<sup>5</sup>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2016_1611_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>A large controlled trial with a before and after design of a community rehabilitation program, found that STAT reduced waiting time by 40&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

A qualitative analysis of 32 in-depth semi-structured interviews showed that the model was well received by staff and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A further evaluation using action research methods also showed improvements in patient flow when the STAT model was applied to an outpatient physiotherapy department [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The success of both trials suggests that the model is well suited to single discipline or multi-disciplinary services that treat patients over a series of appointments, allowing service providers to exploit flexibility in scheduling a mixture of new assessments and review appointments.</p><p>This project aims to find out if this evidence-based alternative to the traditional use of triaged waiting lists reduces waiting time for a variety of community health and outpatient services, with no additional ongoing costs and without adversely affecting patient care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/research design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Research design</title><p>The research design is a Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial (SWCRCT), to evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of the STAT model when compared to the traditional waitlist system.

This is the first time that this approach will have been tested in a fully powered stepped wedge cluster randomised trial including an economic analysis, incorporating a range of differing outpatient and community health services that share key features. This paper outlines the study protocol for this trial to establish whether the STAT model of access and triage can work beyond small, well controlled pilot settings and be implemented on a large scale across multiple outpatient and community services. Secondary outcomes will determine whether the model is cost-effective, and impacts on other aspects of service delivery, patient satisfaction, or health-related quality of life.</p><p>The SWCRCT design is favoured over a traditional randomised controlled trial due to the intervention of interest being at the service level, and the high likelihood of contamination if patients were individually randomised to intervention or control groups within services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The SWCRCT also has advantages over other cluster randomised controlled trial designs. It allows all participating services to receive the intervention, thereby reducing concerns associated with withholding a potentially useful intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. At the same time it also provides the opportunity for discontinuation or modification of an intervention that is found to be leading to adverse outcomes at the initial sites, before replicating the situation at others. Furthermore, the sequential manner in which the intervention is introduced in a SWCRCT will increase feasibility of the project, given that the transition to the STAT model involves considerable planning and behaviour change at each site.</p><p>The intervention involves significant organisational change, and adherence to known principles for effective change management is an important element of this trial. The STAT model will be introduced in accordance with change management literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and factors known to facilitate patient flow interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], including those affected by the change in the planning and implementation, providing opportunities for those involved to provide feedback and contribute to problem solving, and identification of champions within each service who will assist in facilitating change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Addressing the existing backlog of patients waiting for services is a necessary pre-requisite in introducing the STAT model. The model is designed to maintain flow at the rate of demand, but this can only result in consistent and sustainable reductions in waiting time if there is an initial &#x02018;one-off&#x02019; effort to address the needs of patients currently on the waiting list. Gradually working down the backlog over time has been achievable in previous trials of the STAT model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], but the specific timelines associated with the SWCRCT design require an approach that will lead to more rapid reductions in the existing waiting list at each site at the commencement of the implementation period. For this reason a small budget has been allocated to provide financial support to assist services to transition to the STAT model, including reduction of the backlog of patients currently on the waiting list. It is not anticipated that these funds will cover the cost of providing full services to all patients waiting. However, it will be available for targeted measures such as a temporary increase to an aspect of the service that is the source of a bottleneck, and is consistent with change management literature that recommends the provision of adequate resources to support change processes.</p><p>This STAT model has the potential to become a highly effective, generalisable model that will have substantial health benefits for patients and organisations delivering outpatient health services. If successful, the project will provide a significant body of evidence for a model that can significantly reduce waiting times, describe features of services that are likely to be successful in use of the model, and provide the necessary tools to support implementation in other settings. Improving access through reducing or eliminating waiting for outpatient services not only has the potential to reduce physical and psychological costs of waiting, but also ensures more resources can go directly into providing services rather than administrative processes associated with managing waiting lists. If this trial is successful, it will equip providers of outpatient and community services with an evidence-based, practical model of access that can substantially reduce waiting time with subsequent benefits for both efficiency of health systems and patient care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AQOL-8D, Assessment of Quality of Life-8D; HRQoL, health related quality of life; ICC, Intra-cluster correlation coefficient; STAT, Specific Timely Appointments for Triage; SWCRCT, stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Nil.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This project is funded by the a Partnerships for Better Health Grant from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (ID 1076777), with this funding matched by contributions (cash or in kind) from partnership organisations Eastern Health and the Victorian Department of Health and Community Services.
