A fragility (or osteoporotic) fracture is a fracture sustained from a low-energy mechanism during normal activities of daily living, such as a fall from standing height or without obvious trauma. Patients with a fragility fracture have a much higher rate of morbidity and mortality than their counterparts without such fractures.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr7-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Such fractures can be prevented via primary or secondary prevention of osteoporosis. Primary prevention of osteoporosis is defined by protecting healthy patients against developing the disease, whereas secondary prevention of osteoporosis screens and treats patients either at high risk for developing the disease or diagnosed with an earlier stage of osteoporosis. Research has shown that when treatment for osteoporosis is initiated after sustaining a fragility fracture, the risk of future fractures is decreased by as much as 50%.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Prevention of future fracture after sustaining a fragility fracture is known as tertiary prevention of osteoporosis.</p><p>Unfortunately, osteoporosis is overshadowed in an era of chronic illnesses, and a medical care gap exists between physicians and patients. Fewer than 12% of postmenopausal women have a diagnosis of osteoporosis before their index fracture.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> By their first presentation with the disease, they typically have already become symptomatic with a fragility fracture. A strikingly low rate (&#x0003c;15%) of patients with a fragility fracture seek and receive treatment for osteoporosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr12-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> A recent retrospective study by Balasubramanian et al revealed that treatment rates are continuing to decline.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This low rate is multifactorial and due in part to various barriers such as the lack of physician recognition of their role to encourage patient follow-up, lack of patient knowledge, the potential cost of workup and treatment, and the presence of multiple patient comorbidities. A growing body of literature supports the initiation of an osteoporosis intervention program to encourage patient follow-up and treatment. A variety of osteoporosis programs have been proposed and they all reveal significant efficacy as compared to no intervention at all. For example, our prior study showed a 60% response rate compared to 15% without any intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001).<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>
</p><p>Much of the literature examines only one osteoporosis intervention program at a time, however, and research that compares the effectiveness of differing osteoporosis intervention is limited. The purpose of the present study was to address this lack of data and to determine if the type of intervention makes a difference in an effort to close the existing care gap. Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of two interventions in prompting patients to obtain osteoporosis follow-up after a fracture. We hypothesized that a follow-up phone call plus letter would yield greater response toward osteoporosis evaluation versus a letter alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-2151458515604359"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a prospective study that was reviewed by our institutional review board (IRB) committee and qualified for exemption. The study was given a nonresearch determination by our IRB, so informed consents were not necessary. Patients aged 50 years or older with a fracture were identified upon arrival to our emergency department (ED) from December 1, 2011, to May 14, 2013. In total, 1191 billing records were compiled and patients were tagged with an <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</italic> (<italic>ICD-9</italic>) diagnostic code at the time of discharge from the ED. The billing department determined the code based on the documentation in the electronic medical record. Study patients were then identified based on specific <italic>ICD-9</italic> fracture codes that initially suggested a fragility fracture diagnosis. Hospital encounter screening identified the patients linked to these codes, and patient information was downloaded in monthly increments by an individual in the hospital&#x02019;s financial department. The data were autopopulated into our &#x0201c;Orthopaedic Osteoporosis Registry/Database.&#x0201d; We used Filemaker Pro for our database application. Manual chart reviews were performed on each patient chart to determine how their fracture occurred to confirm if indeed it was a fragility fracture (ie, fall from standing height). Patients were excluded if their mechanism of injury was not consistent with the definition of a fragility fracture such as those fractures resulting from high-energy traumas, falls from higher than standing height, and motor vehicle accidents. Patients with polytrauma were exempted even if the injuries sustained were from low-energy forces. Patients were also excluded if they were dead, repeated in the database (ie, multiple ED visits for fractures), or had fracture treatment at another institution. Finally, patients currently treated for osteoporosis or individuals unable to be contacted for various reasons (phone disconnected/out of service, patient admitted to nursing home, or having dementia) were also excluded. Upon completion of chart review, 1050 patients were excluded from the study for the reasons listed previously.</p><p>One hundred forty-one participants were eligible for the study after exclusion, as their mechanisms of injury fit the definition of a fragility fracture and they each have neither been diagnosed with nor treated for osteoporosis. The following fracture codes were identified: (10) pathologic fracture-vertebrae 733.13; (2) pathologic fracture femoral neck 733.14; (10) dorsal vertebra 805.2; (10) lumbar vertebra 805.4; (5) sacrum/coccyx 805.6; (3) vertebral fracture not otherwise specified (NOS) 805.8; (6) proximal humerus 812; (16) Colles fracture 813.41; (27) distal radius 813.42; (2) distal ulna 813.43; (10) distal radius with ulna 813.44; (2) femur, midcervical neck 820.02; (2) femur, base of cervical neck 820.03; (8) femur, transcervical 820.09; (1) trochanteric NOS 820.2; (12) intertrochanteric 820.21; (1) subtrochanteric 820.22; and (14) femoral neck NOS 820.8 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2151458515604359">Table 1</xref>).

The targeted outcome of these programs is multifactorial. The primary outcome is to enhance the continuum of care for high-risk patients or to improve patient follow-up and physician-to-physician communication so that appropriate workup and diagnosis of osteoporosis are not missed. Other projected outcomes include improving osteoporosis treatment rates, reducing morbidity and mortality, and decreasing the annual cost burden of fragility fractures. A wide variety of intervention programs has demonstrated effectiveness in improving the continuum of care, with the rate of patient follow-up significantly greater with an intervention program in place compared to no program.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="bibr21-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr22-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr23-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr24-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr25-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr26-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>

They determined a 90% probability that hiring a coordinator costs less than C$ 30,214 per hip fracture avoided and that greater savings are anticipated after the first year.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>
</p><p>A growing body of evidence has shown that involvement of the orthopedic surgeon in osteoporosis care significantly improves patient follow-up and compliance.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The orthopedic surgeon is often the first and possibly the only physician involved in the patient&#x02019;s care for their fragility fracture. An opportunity for patient education and osteoporosis intervention can potentially be missed in these situations. A prospective randomized trial by Miki et al determined that early and continued management of osteoporosis treatment by the orthopedic team in patients with a hip fracture resulted in 58% pharmacologic treatment at 6 months, which is compared to only 29% of patients who were to follow-up with their PCP (<italic>P</italic> = .04).<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Similarly, another prospective randomized study by Rozental et al compared 2 different interventions: group 1 consisted of osteoporosis screening initiated by the orthopedic physician via ordering a bone mineral density test and sending the results to the patient&#x02019;s PCP. Group 2 consisted of the orthopedic surgeon sending a letter to the patient&#x02019;s PCP describing the guidelines for osteoporosis evaluation and treatment. The results revealed that the patients randomized to group 1 had 2 to 3 times greater rates of bone mineral density testing (93% compared with 30%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001), discussion of osteoporosis with their PCP (89% compared with 35%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001), and initiation of osteoporosis therapy (74% compared with 26%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) compared with patients randomized to group 2.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Programs such as the Own the Bone project<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and the Healthy Bones Program<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> have been initiated to enhance the rate of counseling by the orthopedic surgeon to patients with fragility fractures.</p><p>It is important to note that the outcome of patient follow-up for osteoporosis testing does not always equate successful treatment. A prospective study by Hawker et al implemented an intervention program in an outpatient setting that consisted of educating patients with fragility fractures of their osteoporosis risk and encouraging them to follow-up with their PCP. A standardized letter was also sent out to each patient&#x02019;s PCP. The results revealed that patients who received the intervention were more likely to follow-up with their PCP (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.85, <italic>P</italic> = .02) and to be recommended for bone density screening (adjusted OR: 5.22, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001) but were not more likely to receive a treatment recommendation (adjusted OR: 2.07, <italic>P</italic> = .07).<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The previously mentioned study by Edwards et al found that if actual treatment was initiated early, the outcome of treatment care initiation at 6 months was more than 2 times greater than with delayed patient follow-up.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, there is evidence that education alone prior to patient discharge does demonstrate effectiveness and improved rates of treatment. Patients prepared with questions to ask their PCP were twice as likely to receive osteoporosis treatment as those without questions (42% vs 19%, respectively).<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2151458515604359" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>
</p><p>As with any study, the present study does have some limitations. This study consists of a relatively small sample size, and the cohort comparison between the letter group and phone call plus letter group is underpowered. Additionally, a potential limitation to this study is that we did not specify if each fragility fracture was the patient&#x02019;s first one or if they have sustained prior fragility fractures. We felt that this information extended beyond the scope of our study as our focus was on determining whether or not our patient followed up for evaluation after diagnosis of their current fragility fracture, and any patient with prior osteoporosis workup and treatment were excluded from the study.</p><p>The present study further supports the notion that osteoporosis intervention programs enhance the continuum of care for high-risk patients, which could ultimately decrease the morbidity, mortality, and financial impact of the disease on society. We have shown that contacting the patient whether with a letter or also a phone call does improve follow-up care for osteoporosis management following a fragility fracture diagnosis requiring an ED visit. We also showed that a more personalized approach with a phone call to the patient increased osteoporosis follow-up care by an additional 10%, however, this was not a statistically significant difference from just sending out a letter alone. Future studies may look at sending out a letter first and then placing a phone call to see if this reveals any significant findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Special thank you to Ananya Das for her exceptional work and dedication to this project.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-2151458515604359"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: E.
