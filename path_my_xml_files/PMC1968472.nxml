Verapamil 480 mg day-1 was given for 3 days starting 24 h prior to chemotherapy which consisted of bolus vindesine 7 mg followed by ifosfamide/mesna 5 g m-2 over 24 h, followed by mesna alone for a further 8 h. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for up to six courses. Sixty-six patients were eligible for tumour response analysis and responses occurred in 41% of those randomised to chemotherapy plus verapamil and in 18% of those randomised to chemotherapy alone (P = 0.057). Median survival from start of treatment was significantly better in the verapamil arm (P = 0.02). Toxicity of the combination of chemotherapy plus verapamil was principally neurological and was manageable. Thus the addition of oral verapamil to vindesine/ifosfamide chemotherapy is feasible and in this study was associated with improved outcome. Further confirmation of these observations is required in non-small cell lung cancer, a tumour characterised by resistance to conventional chemotherapy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00207-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1031" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00207-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1032" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00207-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1033" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00207-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1034" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00207-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1035" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
