The study group was taught integrated yoga and the control group the non-yogic physiotherapy exercises by certified therapists. After this, they were asked to practice only the supervised practices of 40 min daily at home for the next three months. Compliance was supervised by telephone calls once in three days and a weekly review class at the center.

Looking at the degree of changes in all the three yoga studies which is similar (37-47%), we may speculate that yoga is beneficial when used with or without a session of physiotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Early morning stiffness</title><p>Haslock <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] showed the beneficial effects of specific integrated yoga practices in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had secondary OA in several joints. They observed better increase in hand grip strength (63%, left, 66% right) in yoga group than non yoga controls (8% left and 5% right) indicating reduced stiffness. Our study showed a reduction in early morning stiffness scores by 69 and 98% after 15 and 90 days respectively. None of the other yoga studies have noted morning stiffness as an outcome variable.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15"><title>State trait anxiety</title><p>There was better reduction in state and trait anxiety scores in the yoga group with significant differences within and between yoga and control groups at two weeks and three months. In our earlier study on patients with chronic neck pain,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] we had observed significant 19.3% reduction in STAI-1 scores as compared to 8.2% in control group within 10 days of intervention. In the present study, we used both state and trait anxiety measures since this was a long-term follow up of three months. The reduction in anxiety scores after yoga in both STAI-1 (36% -post 1 and 58% -post 2) and STAI-2 scores (post 1-35% and post 2-57%) were much higher in these patients with chronic knee pain as compared to those with neck pain.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Blood pressure and pulse rate</title><p>In a randomized controlled study in patients with chronic neck pain, we observed a reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 16% after ten days&#x02019; of add -on IAYT for neck pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] In the present study also, we observed similar reduction of 16% in both systolic and diastolic BP after 90 days of intervention. The pulse rate reduced by 10% in the chronic neck pain study which is similar to the present study with 12.4% reduction after 90 days of IAYT for knee pain. A significant correlation observed in this study between pain and early morning stiffness after yoga points to the global improvement in the patient's condition. Again, a significant correlation between pulse rate and anxiety with pain shows the mind body interaction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>] We know that there exists an etiological relationship between an aging disease such as OA and life style, obesity and stress.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Whether this positive correlation has an etiologically predictable relationship needs to be studied in future studies.</p><p>There are some studies that have looked at anxiety and autonomic variables in normal healthy volunteers after yoga for promotion of positive heath. Raghuraj <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>] observed significant reduction in heart rate variability and blood pressure immediately after 20 min practice of alternate nostril breathing (<italic>nadishuddhi pranayama</italic>).</p><p>In a study by Vempati <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] in healthy adults, the yoga-based guided relaxation was shown to reduce the sympathetic activity as measured by reduced heart rate and skin conductance, oxygen consumption and breath volume. Reduction in heart rate has also been observed after meditation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>]</p><p>The immediate effect of a 30 min practice of a meditation technique called cyclic meditation on STAI 1 was measured in normal healthy volunteers, which showed significantly better reduction in state anxiety after the cyclic meditation session as compared to a session of supine rest. Studies on different types of meditation have consistently shown increased mental alertness even while the patients are physiologically relaxed. These autonomic changes of reduced sympathetic arousal, reduced anxiety and alertful rest points to stress reduction after yoga both in health and disease which seems to be the inner healer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Mechanisms</title><p>The experience of pain in OA patients is not only due to activation of sensory nociceptive fibers in the arthritic joint but it is compounded by other factors such as affective, behavioral and cognitive factors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Stress reducing effect of yoga seems to be a major mechanism of its efficacy in pain management in patients with OA knees.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>] The multi-factorial approach of yoga includes not only physical practices (asanas) but also has the components of breathing (pranayama), meditation (dharana and dhyana), introspective intellectual (jnana yoga) and emotional (bhakti yoga) practices. These practices help in bringing about mastery over the modifications of the mind (<italic>chittavritti nirodhah</italic>) which is the definition of yoga according to Patanjali.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] This may contribute to a consistent change in behavior and life style that can reduce anxiety and the resultant effect on pain reduction.</p><p>Baser <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>] have shown the association between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with physical, psychological and social well being. The concepts in philosophy of yoga are similar to those of CBT which says that chronic pain is not simply a neurophysiologic state but is influenced by the way a person sees the world and attributes meaning to the events. Lip chick <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>] showed that the increased sense of personal control over pain following a pain management program of CBT was accompanied by a reduction in negativity. Thus the present study gives evidence to the relationship between reduction in pain, anxiety and sympathetic tone after yoga in patients with OA knees. This may offer preliminary evidence to the reversibility theory of yoga in a degenerative disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-18"><title>Strengths of the study</title><p>Good sample size, randomized control design, active supervised intervention for the control group for the same duration as the experimental group and follow up for three months with good compliance (6% dropout) are the strengths of this study. The result of this study that has shown marked differences between groups on all variables offers strong evidence for incorporating this module of IAYT for OA knees by the clinicians.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-19"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The study was on a selected group who presented to a specialty orthopedic center and hence not generalizable.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-20"><title>Suggestions for future work</title><p>A longer follow up of &#x02265;12 months is necessary to check the long-term efficacy and acceptability. Studies using MRI and biochemical variables may throw light on the mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Adjunctive program of integrated approach of yoga therapy for OA knees reduces &#x02018;rest pain&#x02032;, early morning stiffness, anxiety, and blood pressure and pulse rate. Yoga offers a good value addition as a non-pharmacological intervention in management of OA knees.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are thankful to Dr. Ravi Kulkarni for his help in statistical analysis.
