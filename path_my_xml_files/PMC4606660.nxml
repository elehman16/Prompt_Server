The negative control used sterile files pass through 2.5% NaOCl into the culture medium. The first positive control used contaminated patency files in teeth with saline. The second positive control group placed contaminated files into broth next to teeth filled with NaOCl (to evaluate potential chlorine leakage). The results were as follows.

</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample selection and preparation of tooth samples</title><p>Fifty extracted single-rooted human teeth which were intact, noncarious, nonfractured, un-restored were used in this study. Each tooth was radiographed to confirm the presence of the single canal. Conventional access preparation was made with #4 round diamond (SS white). Standardized canal preparation was done with Protaper rotary NiTi files (Dentsply-maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) in a crown down technique 1 mm short of the apical foramen to a 50 size that is up to F5. The apical foramina are enlarged and kept patent using #15 K-file (Mani Co, Tokyo, Japan) approximately 1 mm beyond the apical foramen. 10 ml of 2.5% NaOCl was used as an irrigant during instrumentation. Final flush was completed with aqueous 17% EDTA (B N Laboratories, Mangalore) to open all dentinal tubules to facilitate bacterial ingress. Canal was then dried with a paper point, cementum was coated with two layers of nail polish and apical patency was confirmed. Ligature wire was wrapped around a cervical portion of the teeth to suspend the teeth into the culture media [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Teeth were autoclaved twice to kill the native bacteria.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patency files coated with <italic>Streptococcus sanguis</italic> passed into the teeth with sodium hypochlorite, and teeth was suspended into culture medium with ligature wire</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-7-563-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Preparation of inoculum</title><p>Initially, a stock of <italic>Streptococcus sanguis</italic> (HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai) was streaked onto a plate of tryptic soy agar (HiMedia Laboratories Mumbai) with 5% defibrinated sheep blood.

Teeth were suspended into test tubes with ligature wires wrapped around its cervical portion so that the roots are 3&#x02013;4 mm into the broth. 15 K-type file coated with <italic>S. sanguis</italic> was placed into the root canal and extended 2&#x02013;3 mm beyond the apical foramen.

The predominance of anaerobic microorganisms in the apical third, including the cemental canal, is a common trait in most studies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Further, the presence of bacteria in the cemental canal has been strongly demonstrated in cases of necrotic pulps with the periapical lesion.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Therefore, from a biological standpoint, it does not seem acceptable to preclude the instrumentation of this portion of the canal.</p><p>It is clear that there are two major goals concerning cemental canal instrumentation. The first is to establish apical patency. Establishing apical patency is leaving the apical foramen accessible, free from dentin chips, pulp fragments, and other debris. The second goal is apical cleaning. It is intended to eliminate the infection established in the cemental canal. Therefore, from a biological standpoint, it is recommendable that, in cases of pulp necrosis (with or without periapical lesion), both patency and cleaning of the apical foramen are performed. It is important to remember that the second goal is achieved through the first.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Several instrumentation methods that are currently used to debride and shape root canals advocate the use of patency and recapitulation files.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Because patency files are used before the canal space has been thoroughly debrided, the files are subject to contamination by bacteria initially present in the canal. If these contaminated files are reused, bacteria can be introduced into the tooth after the canals have been thoroughly debrided. Because patency files are taken through the apical constricture, contaminated files can also potentially introduce bacteria into the periapical tissues.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This may affect the outcome of endodontic treatment and may decrease the chances of success. So it is important to disinfect these patency files with an effective irrigant.</p><p>This study demonstrated that patency files contaminated with <italic>S. sanguis</italic> can be disinfected by 2.5% NaOCl present in the root canal after irrigation. <italic>S. sanguis</italic> was the chosen organism in the study. It is a Gram-positive asporogenous, facultatively anaerobic, catalase-negative cocci. It is an early colonizer in the formation of dental plaque.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] <italic>S. sanguis</italic> is also commonly found in endodontic infections. Culture studies have shown that in teeth with clinical and radiographic signs of apical periodontitis, streptococci appeared to survive following root canal treatment.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It has been shown to invade cervical and mid root dentin and 60 &#x003bc; at apical dentin.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Finally, <italic>S. sanguis</italic> is easily grown on tryptic soy agar with 5% sheep blood. Because of alpha hemolysis, they reduce iron in hemoglobin, resulting in greenish color on blood agar, which is clearly evident in this study.</p><p>Sodium hypochlorite was the chosen disinfectant in this study. NaOCl is used in concentration varying from 0.5% to 7%.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The antibacterial effect and tissue dissolving capacity of aqueous hypochlorite is a function of its concentration, but so is its toxicity. At high concentration, severe irritation have been reported, when the solution were inadvertently forced into periapical tissues.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] On the other hand, the poorer antimicrobial effectiveness of NaOCl <italic>in vivo</italic> is somewhat disappointing. One natural explanation to poorer <italic>in vivo</italic> performance of NaOCl is complex root anatomy in the apical third of the canal.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In addition, the chemical milieu in the canal is different from a test tube. Haapasalo using dentine powder showed that the presence of dentine caused marked delays in the killing of the test organism <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (Group D streptococci), by 1% NaOCl.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Considering all these factors, it would be rational to use NaOCl in the concentration of 2.5%, which was the concentration used in this study.</p><p>Sodium thiosulfate was added in order to neutralize any leakage of residual chlorine into the culture medium. The first positive control group consisted of contaminated files placed through teeth that did not contain NaOCl. All cultures for this group showed bacterial growth as expected. However, it was possible that leakage of NaOCl into the culture medium could prevent bacterial growth despite the addition of sodium thiosulfate. Therefore, sterilized teeth in the second positive control group were filled with NaOCl to account for possible leakage into the culture medium, and the files were placed on the outside of the teeth.</p><p>The present study focused on the ability of a single solution to prevent inoculation of periapical tissues with patency files. Other solutions may be just as effective as NaOCl, using the experimental model outlined above. Also, when the experimental design was chosen, it was assumed that the NaOCl would not be able to prevent inoculation of periapical tissues simply by passing the contaminated file through the NaOCl in the tooth. Therefore, group 2 was added to the design to show the results of prolonged exposure the test organism to NaOCl. Obviously, NaOCl exceeded the expectations of the experiment, and its effectiveness could have been shown without immersing the contaminated files for 10 s.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrated that patency files contaminated with <italic>S. sanguis</italic> can be effectively disinfected by 2.5% NaOCl present in the root canal after irrigation which means instrumentation process is completed in this case. However, further studies are needed to show the ability of test solutions to prevent inoculation of periapical tissues throughout the instrumentation process.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
