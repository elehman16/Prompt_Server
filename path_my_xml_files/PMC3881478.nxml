reaction times (EMG-RT) of hip flexion of younger persons after neuromuscular joint
facilitation (NJF) treatment. [Subjects] The subjects were 39 healthy young people, who
were divided into two groups: a NJF group and a proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation
(PNF) group. The NJF group consisted of 16 subjects (7 males, 9 females), and the PNF
group consisted of 23 subjects (10 males, 13 females). [Methods] Participants in the NJF
group received NJF treatment. We measured the EMG-RT, the premotor time (PMT) and the
motor time (MT) during hip flexion movement before and after the intervention in both
groups. [Results] There were no significant differences among the results of the PNF
group. For the NJF group, there were significant differences in PMT and EMG-RT after NJF
treatment. [Conclusion] These results suggest that there is an immediate effect of NJF
intervention on electromechanical reaction times of hip flexion.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Neuromuscular joint facilitation</kwd><kwd>Hip flexion</kwd><kwd>Premotor time</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Walking is a widely accepted exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>

neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is a technique which is used to improve lower-limb muscle
strength and gait function. Neuromuscular Joint Facilitation (NJF) is used to increase
strength, flexibility, and ROM. NJF is a new therapeutic exercise based on kinesiology. It
integrates the facilitation element of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and the
joint composition movement, aiming to improve the movement of the joint through passive
exercise, active exercise, and resistance exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To evaluate muscle function, strength, reaction time and spatial coordinates are

history questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed whether the subjects had a history of
cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, somatosensory, or neurological disorders. If so, they were
excluded from the study. All subjects gave their informed consent to participation in this
study. All experimental procedures in this study were reviewed and approved by the Ethical
Review Committee of Jilin Dianli hospital.</p><p>We measured the EMG-RT of the rectus femoris (RF), the premotor time (PMT) of the RF, and
the motor time (MT) of the RF in response to an auditory stimulus. The EMG-RT was measured
with a digital storage oscilloscope, DCS-7040 (Kenwood). After cleaning the skin with
alcohol and abrasion paste, Ag/AgCl disposable electrodes (Vitrode F, Nihonn Kohden) were
placed over the muscle bellies of the RF, at a 2-cm inter electrode distance. The signal was
turned on and off by the contact of an electrode attached to the calcaneus with an aluminum
board. At the onset of voluntary hip flexion, the electrode lost contact with the aluminum
board, and the signal was turned off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Schema of the electromyographic reaction time. Upper trace: electromyographic

90&#x000b0; of hip flexion and 90&#x000b0; of knee flexion. The subjects were given an oral warning of
&#x0201c;Set&#x0201d;, 2 to 3 seconds in advance of the stimulus auditory signal (2,500&#x02005;Hz, 50&#x02005;ms). The
subjects were required to respond to the auditory cues by flexing the hip as quickly as
possible.</p><p>The EMG waveform and the on-off signal of the foot switch were synchronized on the display
of the oscilloscope. The latency time between the onset of voluntary EMG activity and the
stimulus auditory signal (PMT), and the latency time between the onset of voluntary EMG
activity and the off signal (MT) were measured by setting the image on the display to a
standstill each time and moving the cursor. Prior to the experiment, the subjects were
informed of what would be done in the experiment and trial exercises were performed several
times until subjects were accustomed to it. We measured the EMG-RT, the PMT and the MT
during hip flexion movement before and after the intervention in both groups. The reaction
time was measured five times at each scheduled measurement.</p><p>Four hip patterns of NJF were used. The patterns were: hip extension-abduction-internal
rotation, the hip flexion-adduction-external rotation, the hip extension-adduction-external
rotation, and the hip flexion-abduction-internal rotation. Each pattern was performed three
times at random as a passive exercise and as a resistance exercise. In the NJF group
intervention, both proximal resistance and distal resistance were performed. In the PNF
group intervention, only distal resistance was performed. The intervention was performed by
the same physical therapist to avoid individual variations in treatment.</p><p>To determine whether there were differences between the NJF group and the PNF group, the
independent t-test was performed on subject characteristics and each measure before the
intervention. Two-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons (Bonferroni test) were used to test for
statistically significant differences, and the factors were intervention and group. If a
significant interaction was found, the paired t-test was performed to compare before and
after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS Ver. 17.0 for Windows. The level of
statistical significance was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences between the NJF group and the PNF group subject

EMG-RT. The shortened PMT means that arousal levels and attentiveness were improved, and the
reaction time became faster as a result of the NJF intervention. This was in agreement with
the results of a previous study, which concluded that NJF shortens the EMG-RT of knee
extension<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The proprioceptive senses were heightened, since the alignment of the hip joint capsule and
the functions of the periarticular muscle of hip joint were improved; therefore, the
reaction time of hip flexion was shortened after NJF treatment. An important difference
between the intervention methods was that, the rotation function of the caput femoris was
emphasized in the NJF group. In the NJF resistance exercise, the caput femoris rotation was
drawn out using proximal resistance on the greater trochanter of the femur. The results
suggest that caput femoris rotation function can be improved by NJF treatment, and that
improvement of caput femoris rotation contributes to shortening the reaction time. Our study
provides new evidence that NJF treatment is a more effective exercise than PNF treatment at
shortening hip reaction time. It may serve as a new form of exercise for the improvement of
the function of hip.</p><p>Further studies are needed to investigate the change in the EMG-RT of hip after a long
period of NJF.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Simonsick</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name><name><surname>Guralnik</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Fried</surname><given-names>LP</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Who walk?
