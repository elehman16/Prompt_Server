This mixed-methods study (Part 1 and 2) evaluated the effects of facilitative (f) versus non-facilitative (nf) tutoring roles on knowledge-gain and group functioning in the field of endodontics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Part 1 was a quantitative assessment of tutor effectiveness within a prospective, experimental, single-blind, stratified, randomized, two-group intervention study. Participants attended PBL in the context of a hybrid curriculum. A validated questionnaire was used and knowledge assessments were conducted before and after the intervention. External observers rated tutor performance. Part 2 was a qualitative assessment of tutor effectiveness and consisted of semi-structured expert interviews with tutors and focus group discussions with students.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Part 1: f tutors obtained significantly higher scores than nf tutors with respect to learning motivation and tutor effectiveness (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05). nf tuition resulted in a slightly larger knowledge gain (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08). External observers documented a significantly higher activity among facilitative tutors compared to non-facilitative tutors.</p><p>Part 2: Tutors found the f role easier although this led to a less autonomous working climate. The students rated f tutoring as positive in all cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>With respect to PBL-group performance, students felt that groups guided in a non-facilitative fashion exhibited a higher level of independence and autonomy, especially with increasing PBL experience. In addition, students reported that more preparation was necessary for sessions guided by a non-facilitative tutor. Tutors were able to modify their role and influence group processes in a controlled manner. Results are useful for future &#x0201c;Train-the-Teacher&#x0201d; sessions.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Assessment</kwd><kwd>Clinical tutor</kwd><kwd>Curriculum</kwd><kwd>Effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Evaluation</kwd><kwd>Faculty development</kwd><kwd>Focus groups</kwd><kwd>Knowledge</kwd><kwd>Mixed methods research</kwd><kwd>Problem-based learning</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>In their 2012 guidelines entitled &#x0201c;Recommendations on higher education qualifications for the healthcare system&#x0201d; for the advancement of dental medicine at German universities, the German Council of Science and Humanities endorses the problem-oriented and patient-centred learning as a great step forward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Since the introduction of problem-based Learning (PBL) in the 1960s, many empirical studies employing various evaluation methods have evaluated the effectiveness of PBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Most authors chose a qualitative approach using interviews of various types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Only approximately 10&#x000a0;% of these studies employed the mixed-methods approach, although such studies are particularly informative because they address the research question on various methodological levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Literature suggests that it can be used as an effective approach, but this is not always the case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Actually it is known, that PBL aims to improve the hypothetico-deductive reasoning (HDR) of students. However, HDR brings with it a high cognitive load, so the full use of PBL is not advocated for medical curricula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In the literature, there is general agreement on the definition of PBL: small groups of students work interactively on the solution of problems while being supported by a tutor. Thereby, distinction is made between sessions necessitating the student&#x02019;s presence in the group and periods of individual learning. The tutor is required to accompany, rather than control, the learning process. The role of the tutor may be described as conducive or facilitative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Facilitation requires understanding of the learning process, primarily involves monitoring of student learning and promotion of effective group function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In order to effect student learning in the small group PBL session, the facilitator must be informed about and be acutely aware of his/her role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Such performance was aptly described by Hamdy as follows: &#x0201c;The key is when, how and how much guidance should be provided&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Nonetheless, clear description of the extent of guidance and precise delineation of tutor performance are rare in the literature as are reports of controlled, clinical studies of PBL. Dolmans et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] alerted to this gap and interpreted it as a guiding principle for future research. However few studies aiming to elucidate open questions on the tutor&#x02019;s role have been published since this paper.</p><p>The present prospective controlled study attempted to evaluate precisely defined tutoring styles. To account for the complexity of the topic, we chose a mixed-methods study design. Part 1 (quantitative part) addressed the following questions:</p><p>RQ1: How do the different tutoring styles (facilitative and non-facilitative) affect learning motivation, tutor effectiveness, group dynamics, and learning success in PBL sessions for dental students attending a hybrid curriculum?</p><p>RQ2: Can external observers distinguish between the different tutoring styles, based on the tutors&#x02018;activities performed?</p><p>Part 2 of the study (qualitative part) attempted to answer the following question:</p><p>RQ3: How do students and tutors rate the different tutoring styles in the PBL sessions?</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample-size calculation</title><p>Sample-size calculation was based on an intermediate effect size (d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5).

None of the participating students had previously worked with PBL, while all tutors had several years of PBL experience and were established experts (i.e., content expert tutors) in both theoretical and practical endodontics.

One week intervened between the two sessions of each group (for example from Tuesday to Tuesday or from Thursday to Thursday). The weekly timetable of the hybrid dental curriculum included few PBL and more plenary lecture sessions. On the respective PBL days (Tuesday and Thursday), two groups were taught in the same location/class room (sufficiently far away from each other). To prevent any detection of the differences in the tutoring style we ensured that both groups were either accompanied in the same style in this joint session. Groups were tutored by just one style (facilitative or non-facilitative) that was determined before the start of the study. However, the tutors acted in both a facilitative or non-facilitative fashion, depending on the group. The group members were unaware to which one of the two tutoring styles they had been allocated. Each PBL case consisted of eight learning objectives that were known to the tutors only. Thus, a total of 64 learning objectives were elaborated for the eight PBL cases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>External observers</title><p>Each PBL group received an external observer who confirmed the allocated tutoring role and its proper application by the tutor.

The tests were to be completed within 20&#x000a0;min in an anonymized fashion, ensuring however that the pre- and post-PBL tests could be matched for each participant. The contents of the tests remained unchanged during the study period (three semesters). Values of Cronbach&#x02018;s alpha amounted to 0.63 and 0.67 for the pre- and post-PBL tests, while the values for the difficulty of the pre- and post-PBL tests were 0.40 and 0.53, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Study questionnaire</title><p>Effectiveness of the tutoring styles was assessed on the basis of a questionnaire completed by the students.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and Dolmans &#x00026; Ginns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and matched the PBL questionnaire used at Charit&#x000e9;, Berlin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The questionnaire consisted of three sections (i.e., group interaction, tutor effectiveness, general comments on PBL), with a section for additional remarks provided (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Questions were answered using a Likert scale ranging from one to five (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;completely disagree, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;disagree, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;neutral, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;agree, 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;completely agree).

Facilitative tutors were more effective in &#x0201c;generating clear learning objectives&#x0201c;encouraging &#x0201c;the search for additional sources of information&#x0201c;, which was reflected in the group members&#x02019; assessment of tutors. To optimize group work, Wood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] suggested allocating specific roles to the group members before sessions (e.g., reader, writer, time keeper, moderator, and summarist). We used these roles also in the present study.</p><p>PBL evaluation consists of assessing the students as well as the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Such evaluations are difficult to conduct, and several differing approaches have been described in the literature. By employing multiple-choice tests, Bud&#x000e9; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] demonstrated a significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.072) between so-called directive and traditional PBL modules, with the directive programs achieving a better result. In our study, knowledge gain in the post-PBL test was significant in both groups, reflecting the newly acquired knowledge after completing the PBL module. There was a trend towards better results in the group tutored non-facilitatively, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>In the expert interviews, tutors expressed clear difficulties with their non-facilitative role. Moreover, tutors documented more problems in implementing a non-facilitative tutoring style with PBL beginners, as apparent by the following comments: &#x0201c;<italic>My personal experience is that the non-facilitative role is not easy for a student who has never participated in a PBL module</italic>&#x0201c;; &#x0201c;<italic>If group members have already undergone a PBL session, I feel comfortable in either role</italic>&#x0201d;; or &#x0201c;<italic>The first session was really difficult when assuming the non-facilitative role</italic>&#x0201d;. The comment &#x0201c;<italic>The differences between the tutor roles and their practical implementation were not entirely clear in the role description</italic>&#x0201c;suggests that there was a need for more extensive tutor training. In line with this observation, the need for more extensive tutor training is emphasized in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>With respect to internal study validity, the aspects to be considered include maturity, selection of study participants, study location, instrumentation, and the special study design used. During the 8-week PBL module &#x0201e;Endodontics&#x0201c;, students attended multiple other lectures and courses that were not directly connected with the topic of the PBL module but may have indirectly affected the monitoring of learning objectives. To minimize this effect, all programs on similar topics organized by the outpatient clinic for restorative dentistry were scheduled to take place after completion of the PBL module. Maturation&#x02019; may possibly also have affected the tutors involved in the study. It cannot be ruled out that the tutors became increasingly accustomed to their specific role during the study. This factor was controlled by the external observers who confirmed the assigned roles. To reduce potential problems associated with the study location, all PBL sessions were conducted in the same room (simulation laboratory) and took place on the same week day (Tuesday) at the same time (2&#x000a0;p.m. to 5&#x000a0;p.m.).</p><p>The issue of instrumentation concerned the two written tests that were conducted before and after completion of the PBL module. Since these had to remain the same throughout the three semesters, the questions and answers were not published or discussed at any time. For each semester, the test documentation contained identical questions, but they were presented in a different order than those of the previous semester. All tests were conducted without announcing them; neither the students nor the tutors knew the exact date of the tests.</p><p>The four tutors taking part in the study were responsible for the implementation of the different roles during the PBL sessions. All of them had many years of experience with PBL. However, it was feared that some of them might leave the university before the end of the study because of an expiring contract, which constituted a substantial complication in the planning of the study. The chosen study design (&#x0201c;nested&#x0201c;design) appeared to provide the best condition for this potential complication in that it allowed for a maximum size of factor variance. For this reason, the tutors had to switch roles each time, and the various PBL cases were exchanged during the module. In this way, replacing a tutor would have been less critical.</p><p>The chosen study design also addressed the potential problem of implementation, i.e., the specific selection of a role for each tutor and free allocation of students to a tutorial. Any interaction between groups (tutored by a facilitative or non-facilitative style) was minimized by the simultaneous scheduling of PBL-sessions with only the same tutoring style. Thus, potential variation in tutor performance was not evident in the parallel sessions. Any confounding by student interaction outside the PBL module was kept to a minimum by blinding the participants with respect to the study variables.</p><p>Our study design consisting of pre- and post-PBL assessments may be associated with certain limitations in connection with the testing condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. There is a danger that students anticipate the tests and will therefore not be unprepared when attending PBL sessions. Moreover, based on their experience with the nature of information and type of questions in the pre-PBL test, participants can prepare more effectively for the post-PBL test than for the pre-PBL test. Nonetheless, Fraenkel &#x00026; Wallen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] also point to the advantages of this study design; it provides information on the group composition with respect to the knowledge level and consequently on the comparability of the two groups. The authors point out that this study design is particularly useful if groups contain no more than 30 participants. With as many as 101 participants in our study, this limit was clearly exceeded. The large group size in our study resulted from the combination of three semesters. Consequently, pre-PBL testing was of critical importance to ensure comparable knowledge levels among the groups. In our study, the groups were, in fact, comparable with respect to their current knowledge on the subject.</p><p>An additional aspect of debate is the number of study participants. Within the study time frame, it was not possible to recruit more students (total number of students per semester&#x02009;=&#x02009;48) and tutors (total number of experienced PBL tutors available at the entire dental school&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) at our institute. Sample-size calculation prior to study start yielded a number of at least 50 participants per group (facilitative versus non-facilitative), but this number could not even have been met by adding students from an additional semester. Nonetheless, it would be desirable to confirm our findings in subsequent studies involving larger study populations.</p><p>With respect to external validity of the study, generalizability of our findings and the special setting of a replication study are of interest. To ensure that our results can be transferred to other persons, situations, conditions, and time frames, we allocated students to one of two groups by stratified randomization. Moreover, the low dropout rate increased the external validity of this study. Further strengthening of the external validity resulted from the nature of our evaluation that can be viewed as a replication study. Because the study ran over a period of three semesters, findings were transferable to other study subjects as different students were involved.</p><p>The &#x0201c;readiness&#x0201d; of tutors and students underwent a certain process. Initially, the facilitative style was favored by both the tutors and students. In the Results section we state that the facilitative tutoring style had resulted in less self-directed learning by the end of the PBL experiments. The tutors mentioned that the non-facilitative tutoring style greatly increased the students&#x02019; ability to learn on their own.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Within the limitations of the study that was based on a hybrid curriculum, we conclude that the tutor style should be modified during PBL training. Initially, the facilitative style may be more suitable, but the non-facilitative tutoring style should be introduced when students have gained sufficient knowledge in PBL. We believe that this approach would be of optimal long-term benefit to both students and tutors participating in PBL programs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>All authors read and approved the manuscript and have made substantive intellectual contributions to the published study.
