Condoms provide effective protection but there are many barriers to use. Face-to-face health promotion interventions are resource-intensive and show mixed results. Interactive digital interventions may provide a suitable alternative, allowing private access to personally tailored behaviour change support. We have developed an interactive digital intervention (the Men's Safer Sex (MenSS) website) which aims to increase condom use in men. We describe the protocol for a pilot trial to assess the feasibility of a full-scale randomised controlled trial of the MenSS website in addition to usual sexual health clinical care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Participants: Men aged 16 or over who report female sexual partners and recent unprotected sex or suspected acute STI. Participants (N=166) will be enrolled using a tablet computer in clinic waiting rooms. All trial procedures will be online, that is, eligibility checks; study consent; trial registration; automated random allocation; and data submission. At baseline and at 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months, an online questionnaire will assess condom use, self-reported STI diagnoses, and mediators of condom use (eg, knowledge, intention). Reminders will be by email and mobile phone. The primary outcome is condom use, measured at 3&#x02005;months. STI rates will be recorded from sexual health clinic medical records at 12&#x02005;months. The feasibility of a cost-effectiveness analysis will be assessed, to calculate incremental cost per STI prevented (Chlamydia or Gonorrhoea), from the NHS perspective.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval: City and East NHS Research Ethics Committee (reference number 13 LO 1801). Findings will be made available through publication in peer-reviewed journals, and to participants and members of the public via Twitter and from the University College London eHealth Unit website. Raw data will be made available on request.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>Current Controlled Trials. ISRCTN18649610.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Condoms are effective for prevention of STI; however, there are many barriers to successful use, for example, decrease in sensation, interruption of sex, incorrect size or fit, use of alcohol/recreational drugs, anxiety affecting sexual performance, and stigma associated with carrying condoms.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The prevention of pregnancy is often a stronger motivation for condom use than prevention of STI.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Condoms may be perceived as a barrier to intimacy and trust,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and use is often lower in established relationships.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Since it is men who primarily experience many of the disadvantages of using male condoms (eg, reduced pleasure), and have the power to influence condom use for penetrative sex (since they wear condoms), prevention efforts are needed to target the obstacles to condom use that men face.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> While there are a variety of health promotion interventions aimed at improving sexual health for men who have sex with men (MSM), there are fewer interventions specifically for adult men who have sex with women (MSW),<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> despite the fact that MSW report much less consistent condom use than MSM.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Men are less likely than women to visit health professionals and generally have shorter clinic appointments,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> so they may be less likely to be offered health promotional advice or risk reduction counselling in the context of routine appointments. Men may be reluctant to discuss their sexual health with health professionals, partners or friends.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> An online intervention therefore offers an alternative avenue to reach men.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Sexual health interventions</title><p>Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that people at high risk of STI are offered one-to-one structured discussions to address risk-taking,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and this is increasingly being offered as part of routine care in genitourinary medicine and other healthcare settings. While interventions such as motivational interviewing can impact on sexual behaviour,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> in practice it is resource-intensive to train and support staff, and difficult to find time for structured discussions in busy clinical services. A potential alternative to such interventions is the use of interactive digital interventions (IDI).</p><p>We define IDI as &#x02018;Computer-based programmes that provide information and one or more of decision support, behaviour change support, or emotional support for health issues&#x02019;.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> IDI require contributions from users to produce personally relevant tailored material and feedback. IDI are highly suitable for sexual health promotion because access can be private, anonymous and self-paced,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> which may be particularly important for men who may be reluctant to disclose a lack of knowledge or skill. Interventions can be targeted for specific groups (eg, by age, gender or sexuality), and content can be tailored for individuals.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> IDI can be expensive to develop but offer the advantages of intervention fidelity<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and the potential to reach large audiences at relatively low dissemination costs.</p><p>IDI can improve sexual behaviour (including condom use),<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> as well as increasing knowledge, self-efficacy and safer sex intention.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> More evidence is needed to establish effects on biological outcomes (STI) and cost-effectiveness. The Men's Safer Sex (MenSS) website is an IDI which aims to increase condom use and reduce STI in men attending sexual health clinics. The present pilot trial aims to determine the optimum parameters of a full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the efficacy of the MenSS website intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives</title><p>To establish the feasibility and optimal design of a full-scale RCT to test the effect on condom use and STI acquisition of the MenSS intervention website for men attending sexual health clinics:

These clinics serve a diverse range of patients in terms of age, socioeconomic status and ethnicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The intervention</title><p>The MenSS website content and design was developed based on evidence from the sexual health research literature and theories of behaviour change, qualitative interviews with men in sexual health clinics, and discussions with clinical and academic experts in sexual health and digital technologies.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The development process was iterative, with a high level of user involvement. The intervention is designed to be delivered initially in clinic, to make use of the time when patients are waiting to be seen, but also providing (and encouraging) online access after patients have left the clinic.</p><p>The MenSS intervention consists of an interactive website. While in clinic, users will be presented with a tailored package of website content which addresses individual men's barriers to condom use. The site targets a number of influences on effective condom use, such as:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Condom knowledge (eg, about sizes and types of condoms);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Condom use skills;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Difficulties in negotiating condom use;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Inaccurate beliefs about STI risk;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Social influences, such as perceived/expected partner response;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sexual pleasure;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Being caught in the &#x02018;heat of the moment&#x02019;;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Alcohol and drug use.</p></list-item></list></p><p>While in clinic, users will be asked to select their own personal barriers to condom use. This task will produce a tailored package of information, offering solutions or counter-arguments to barriers (including interactive activities and quizzes, videos and case vignettes), which will be presented prominently on the homepage. Some content is presented to all users (eg, training in condom use skills), and all content will be available via website navigation tabs. Participants will be led through their tailored content package sequentially, and will be asked to set goals to change their behaviour. If wanted, participants will receive emails to assess achievement of goals, and to encourage them to visit the intervention website again.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participant recruitment is designed to be self-directed, using a touch screen tablet computer, which will be available in the clinic waiting room. Participants will be directed to the tablet computer via brief information leaflets and posters in the waiting room, or by clinic staff. The trial software is set up to allow participants to be led through the steps of screening, consent, automatic randomisation, data collection and intervention viewing, without assistance from clinic staff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014007552F1">figure 1</xref>). A member of the study team or the sexual health clinic research staff will be present if needed to provide technical assistance and to answer questions about the study.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014007552F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Men's Safer Sex trial software framework: online study information, consent, registration, data collection and randomisation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014007552f01"/></fig><sec id="s2d1"><title>Online eligibility, consent, registration, randomisation, data collection</title><p>The tablet computer in the clinic waiting room will present information about the trial and an invitation to participate. Potential participants will then be asked to complete a screening questionnaire to determine their eligibility for the trial. Those who are ineligible at this point will be informed of this, and thanked for their time. Those who are eligible will receive detailed information regarding the study. Participants will be asked to give informed consent by agreeing to a number of statements (see online supplementary appendix 1: online participant information and consent). They will then be asked to give their contact details (email address and telephone number), in order to contact them for follow-up assessments, to send them reminders to view the website, to remind them that they are participating in the trial, and to send an electronic shopping voucher to recompense participants for their time. Participants will also be asked to create a password. The password will give the intervention group access to the intervention website, which will also enable collection of website usage data. It will also be needed to access the follow-up questionnaires. Demographic and baseline sexual health data will then be collected. At this point, the software program will use a computer algorithm to randomly allocate participants to either the intervention or control conditions. This allocation will be unalterable.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Follow-up data collection</title><p>At 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months after their initial clinic visit, participants will receive an automated email asking them to complete a follow-up questionnaire (see Outcome assessment section), by clicking on a weblink to an online questionnaire. If they do not complete the questionnaire, they will receive three further email prompts, at 1-week intervals, as well as two text messages to their mobile phone (again including the weblink) alongside the latter two emails. If participants still do not respond, the researcher will telephone participants a week after the final email to remind them to fill in the study questionnaire. Information about STI diagnoses will be collected at all time points via self-report, and at 12&#x02005;months by recording diagnoses or suspected diagnoses over the past year recorded in the clinical notes at the sexual health clinics participants are recruited from.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Men aged 16&#x02005;years and above (with no upper age limit); able to read English; with access to the internet; and at high risk of future STI (ie, two or more partners in the past year (male or female) and some non-condom use in the past 3&#x02005;months; or symptoms of acute STI; or seeking treatment for an STI); and for whom at least half of their sexual partners are female.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>HIV-positive men and men with hepatitis B or C will be excluded, since patients with these diagnoses are likely to receive risk reduction advice in the course of routine clinical care.

We selected items for inclusion based on a literature search for established measures, and consultation with experts. We conducted interviews with men in sexual health clinics (N=11) to gain feedback on successive versions of the outcome questionnaire. Interviews with men checked their understanding of questions, the clarity of questions, and content suitability for the selected measures of behavioural outcomes and mediators of those outcomes.

A sample size of 166 participants (83 intervention, 83 comparator, randomised 1:1 between experimental and control conditions) is adequate to detect a reduction of 1.35 episodes of unprotected sex with a conventional two-sided &#x003b1; of 0.05 and 90% power (1&#x02212;&#x003b2;). Allowing for potential loss to follow-up at 3&#x02005;months, a sample size of 122 participants (61 intervention, 61 comparator) is adequate to find a reduction of 1.35 episodes of unprotected sex with a conventional two-sided &#x003b1; of 0.05 and 80% power (1&#x02212;&#x003b2;). In addition, this sample size is also sufficient to detect a 1.65 difference in safer sex intention, and a one-point difference in self-efficacy on Likert scales, with a conventional two-sided &#x003b1; of 0.05 and 90% power (1&#x02212;&#x003b2;).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s3b1"><title>Analysis of outcomes</title><p>Analysis of sexual health outcomes will be based on all participants according to their initial experimental allocation (on an intention-to-treat analysis). Analysis for the primary outcome will use a generalised mixed model, with log link and Poisson/mixed error. The response variable will be the number of episodes of unprotected vaginal sex for each subject. Explanatory variables will be the baseline (log<sub>e</sub>(x)) number of episodes of unprotected vaginal sex and the experimental condition. The analysis will include a generalised (random effects) over-dispersion parameter. Comparisons of sexual health between intervention and control groups will include the baseline value of each outcome as subject level explanatory variables, so that analysis is of the difference in end point conditional on the within-subject baseline measure. For sexual health outcomes measured only at follow-up, we will compare effect sizes between intervention and control groups alone using all available data and describe loss to follow-up for each treatment condition. For other outcomes, analyses will be based on generalised linear models with appropriate link functions and error structures. Statistical analyses will be described a priori in a Statistical Analysis Plan, and the principal analyses will be implemented independently by two statisticians.</p></sec><sec id="s3b2"><title>Mediation analyses</title><p>We will conduct a prognostic model in order to determine whether change in any of the mediating variables (eg, beliefs about pleasure, self-efficacy) is associated with any intervention effects. This will help to identify which elements of the website seem to be most influential.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><p>The principal aim of the economic data collection will be to determine the feasibility and validity of collecting cost and outcome data for a cost-effectiveness analysis within a phase III trial. We will conduct an initial cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of incremental cost per gain in outcome, looking at the cost per STI prevented (<italic>Chlamydia</italic> or <italic>Gonorrhoea</italic>), comparing intervention participants with controls from the NHS perspective. This will include one-way, two-way and parametric sensitivity tests.</p><p>The aim of the analysis will primarily be to evaluate whether information collected is fit for the purpose, and to inform information collection in a future trial. We will examine the feasibility of collecting cost data for intervention and control participants including costs associated with STI tests and treatments, and contract tracing, testing and treatment. Trial subjects may access sexual health services from a range of providers, so information from sexual health clinic notes alone may prove unreliable. We will therefore ask participants about sexual health-related health service contacts over the past 12&#x02005;months as part of the self-reported outcomes. Information collected from sexual health clinic notes will be used to assess the reliability of the self-reported information collected. Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) reference costs,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> British National Formulary<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and other national sources of costing information will be used to calculate unit costs. Costs associated with the maintenance of the intervention website and updating the website will also be included.</p><p>STIs prevented will be calculated by taking account of diagnoses recorded from clinical records at 12-month follow-up as well as self-reported episodes for the previous year. We will calculate the cost per episode of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> or <italic>Gonorrhoea</italic> prevented for the intervention group versus controls. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are used as the outcome in CEA, to allow for the comparison of results for different CEA across disease areas. QALYs are calculated by multiplying HRQoL by the amount of time spent in the HRQoL state. The EQ-5D is the questionnaire recommended by NICE to calculate HRQoL;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> it has been recognised, however, that the EQ-5D may not be suitable for economic evaluations of public health interventions as it may not capture the relevant information on the full psychosocial impact of public health interventions or be sufficiently sensitive for that purpose.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> We will therefore also collect data on the performance of the Sexual QoL questionnaire<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> to assess its suitability for use in a future large-scale RCT.</p><p>Acquisition of STI may have cost and QALYs impacts that occur beyond the end of the trial, so it is important that this information is accounted for as part of the model. This is commonly achieved by a decision analytical model that has a time horizon beyond the end of the trial and combines cost and outcome data from a range of published sources in addition to trial information. As a result, we will design a decision analytical model that will take account of costs and QALYs for the lifetime of the service users. The values in the decision analytical model will come from a comprehensive review of the literature including the efficacy of condoms, research to increase condom use and the incidence and prevalence of STIs. The quality of each type of evidence and relevance to the UK context will be assessed to determine the best coefficients to use in the cost-effectiveness model.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> We will also aim to determine utility values for the long-term QALYs outcomes associated with STIs. The final model will compare the incremental cost per QALYs gained and cost per STI prevented of the internet based intervention versus the control group. It will be subject to one-way, two-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve calculated to determine the probability that the internet based intervention is cost-effective for a range of values of willingness to pay for an outcome gained.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Ethical issues</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Potential ethical issues</title><p>This project aims to encourage behaviour change to reduce morbidity and the social and emotional costs of STI acquisition, with the aim of benefiting trial participants as well as wider society. There is a risk that the study may unintentionally exacerbate the stigma of STI and risky behaviour for participants. We strive to be non-judgemental about choices of lifestyle or behaviour, respecting others&#x02019; autonomy. It could be that participants&#x02019; partners or others see the intervention website, texts to participants&#x02019; mobile phones or email messages. Study information makes clear to participants the nature of study-related communications and possible risks. However, there is a danger that this may be accessed by others and that this leads to embarrassment or relationship difficulties in some way. A component of the intervention will focus on communication with partners, so it is hoped that the intervention will improve the quality of relationships rather than cause harm.
