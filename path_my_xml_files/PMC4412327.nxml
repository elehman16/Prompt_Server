calcified or a previously implanted mitral prosthesis is removed. Mitral visualization
may be insufficient due to the small size of the left atrium and markedly hypertrophic
right ventricle. Previous cardiac operations may complicate mitral valve exposure, as
adhesions and loss of mobility in the surrounding tissues may be present. In such cases,
the conventional left atria1 incision may not offer satisfactory visualization in the
surgical site of the valve. Therefore, several alternative approaches have been proposed
for satisfactory visualization of the mitral valve intraoperatively<sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Berreklouw et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> and Guiraudon et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> proposed a combined
superior-transseptal approach to create a larger operation area which was closer to the
mitral valve. Currently, this approach has been adopted by several health care
centers<sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand,
there are possible drawbacks including increased ischemia time, cardiopulmonary bypass
(CPB), cross-clamp time, and increased bleeding related to the procedure based on the
current clinical experiences<sup>[<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Cardiac arrhythmia is one of the main concerns with this procedure. Early atrial
tachycardia has been frequently reported<sup>[<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, while many studies have demonstrated that superior transseptal
approach (STA) is commonly associated with sinus node dysfunction<sup>[<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of STA with the conventional left
atriotomy (LA) in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHOD</title><sec><title>Patient selection</title><p>Between January 2010 and November 2012, a total of 91 consecutive adult patients who
underwent mitral valve surgery in the Division of Cardiovascular Surgery at Ko&#x0015f;uyolu
Training and Research Hospital were included. The patients were randomized at a 1:1
ratio to either STA (Group 1, n=47) and conventional LA (Group 2, n=44). Pacemaker
implantation criteria were predefined according to the American College of Cardiology
/ American Heart Association/the European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC)
guidelines<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. The study
protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee of our institution.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgery</title><sec><title>Superior transseptal approach</title><p>A superior venous cannula was inserted directly from the superior vena cava, while
an inferior venous cannula was inserted from inferior vena cava. Caval cannulas
were inserted more laterally to the right atrium to avoid the appendage of right
atrium. The right atriotomy was performed in parallel to the atrioventricular
groove and the incision was carried superiorly to the appendage to meet the
superior pole of the interatrial septum, leaving a strip of atrial tissue on the
ventricular side to facilitate closure. The retrograde coronary sinus cannulation
was performed under vision for the cardioplegia infusion. The aorta was
cross-clamped and the heart was arrested with cold blood cardioplegia. The fossa
ovalis was incised vertically and the septal incision was carried superiorly to
meet the right atriotomy and extended for 2 to 3 cm to the roof of the left
atrium. The ventricular side of the septal incision was deflected by two pledgeted
sutures which were placed at each pole. After mitral procedure was completed, the
left atrial roof was closed primarily with a 3-0 prolene suture to the septum and
then the septal incision was closed using another 3-0 prolene suture, starting
from the inferior pole of this incision. The air was evacuated from the left side
and the aorta was unclamped. The right-sided procedure was carried out when
required unclamping the aorta in most cases. The right atriotomy, then, was closed
with a 4-0 prolene suture, starting from the two poles to the midpoint of the
right atrial wall.</p></sec><sec><title>Left atrial approach</title><p>A superior venous cannula was inserted from the right atrial appendage, while an
inferior venous cannula was inserted from the inferior vena cava. The procedure
was performed between the confluence of the right pulmonary veins and the
interatrial groove.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data collection and postoperative patient management</title><p>Demographic characteristics of the patients, comorbidities, additional interventions
such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), De Vega's annuloplasty (DVA) for
tricuspid regurgitation and ring annuloplasty, aortic repair, radiofrequency (RF)
ablation, intraoperational data including cross-clamp time, mild hypothermia for
myocardial protection, pre- and postoperative electrocardiographic (ECG) findings,
postoperative complications including pacemaker implantation and increased bleeding
and ischemia time were recorded.</p><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were collected for both
groups at the baseline. During surgery, cross-clamp and CPB time, antegrade
arrest/prevention, inotropic support and duration of inotropic use were recorded. The
amount of bleeding, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), duration of
intubation, the presence of a pacemaker, length of hospital and intensive care unit
(ICU) stay, postoperative ECHO on the postoperative 6<sup>th</sup> day and death
events were also recorded following surgery. Patients with post- extubation dyspnea
received bronchodilators and mechanical or non-invasive mechanical ventilatory
support such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) due to low saturation
level and/or decreased partial oxygen pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v12.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
Illinois, USA). Descriptive statistics were to analyze the demographic
characteristics of the patients. Numerical variables were expressed in mean, median,
standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, whereas categorical variables were
expressed in numbers and percentages. A <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 was
considered significant.</p><p>Either parametric or non-parametric statistical methods were used according to normal
distribution of comparative variables. The Student's t-test was used for numerical
variables. This test was also used to compare normally distributed variables between
the groups, while the Mann Whitney U test was used to compare abnormally distributed
variables. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare pre- and postoperative values.
Cross-tabulation was created for categorical variables (Chi -square, Fisher's exact
and McNemar test).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the patients, 39 were males and 52 were females. The mean age was 54.0&#x000b1;15.4 (range,
16 to 82) years. The mean duration of complaints was 1.5&#x000b1;1.1 (range, 0.5 to 10) years. A

34.1% had diabetes mellitus (DM), 68.1% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), and 11.0% had coronary artery disease (CAD). Demographic and clinical

the incidence of rheumatic mitral disease has been reducing, there is an increasing
demand for the correction of mitral insufficiency associated with or without coronary
artery disease. These patients have usually small left atria and they are usually
scheduled for the operation depending on the coronary artery anatomy, before the left
atria have time to enlarge. Moreover, valve replacement surgery is mainly replaced by
mitral reconstruction which is performed at earlier stages of the disease thanks to the
sophisticated techniques available. Therefore, limited operation area which leads to
poor visibility and prevents achieving a better exposure of the mitral valve and
subvalvular apparatus during surgery has been one of the main considerations of
cardiovascular surgeons.</p><p>The STA has been defined as one of new surgical approaches to overcome these problems
without compromising treatment success. As cardiovasculars surgeons have increased their
experiences in new approaches, they prefer superior transseptal incision for patients
who are not in sinus rhythm or those with sinus rhythm for whom the surgeon thinks that
technical advantages of the incision outweighs the risk of sinus rhythm loss. Similarly,
our study results indicate that STA provides an excellent exposure without significant
complications in mitral apparatus compared to the conventional LA.</p><p>The sinus node (SN) function and atrial vulnerability after surgery still remain as
important considerations with the STA, since the technique involves transecting the SN
artery as well as the anterior internodal conduction pathway. While there are a number
of published studies in favor of STA in the literature<sup>[<xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>, many studies reporting potential concerns regarding
the SN dysfunction and atrial vulnerability during postoperative period are
available<sup>[<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. In a study including 52 patients who
underwent mitral valve surgery through STA, the authors reported that the number of the
patients with sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation were equal preoperatively. Eleven
patients had transient atrial fibrillation or junctional rhythms for approximately 2
weeks postoperatively. After the mean follow-up period of 15&#x000b1;8 months (range, 2-25
months), 25 of 26 patients persisted in sinus rhythm, while 4 patients with preoperative
atrial fibrillation showed sinus rhythm at the postoperative 6<sup>th</sup> month. It
was reported that none of the patients required permanent pacemaker implantation due to
symptomatic or latent bradycardia as assessed by Holter ECG at the median follow-up time
period of 15 months<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In our study, we observed favorable changes in ECG results in Group 1, indicating a very
low incidence of STA-induced permanent or serious damage, despite the conduction
problems and atrial vulnerability in the postoperative period. Depending on our results,
we concluded that undesired postoperative events might be decreased by a better
operative area exposure, which could also decrease postoperative complications, and
increase the success rate of STA. In addition, increasing professional experiences of
surgeons and a better understanding of the conduction system at the sinoatrial node
would improve pre- and postoperative evaluation process to decide the most appropriate
approach considering the clinical presentation of the patient. In the literature, Lukac
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> reported that STA remained
an independent risk factor in their study with a large sample size, in which they
compared STA with the left atrial method. However, our results indicated similar
mortality rates as well as permanent pacemaker implantation between the groups. Thus, it
did not increase fatal or permanent clinical outcomes.</p><p>Despite possible drawbacks including increased ischemia time, length of hospital stay,
CPB, cross-clamp time, and increased bleeding related to the procedure, as previously
mentioned, some authors reported no significant difference between the study
groups<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. In line with the literature, we observed no
significant differences in the amount of bleeding, re-operation, and the length of
hospital and ICU stay between the groups in our study. However, intraoperative data
revealed that cross-clamp time, CPB time, duration of inotropic use, and respiratory
problems were significantly increased in the STA group, compared to the conventional LA
group without leading to any severe or unmanageable complications.</p><p>In our study, the cross-clamp time and CPB time were longer in STA group, as larger
incisions were performed and the closure of the incision was performed in two layers as
superior and septal. In addition, STA has been a newly used operation method in our
clinic, which might also be another reason for prolonged time. When the additional
procedures were reviewed, we concluded that tricuspid ring annuloplasty was most
commonly performed in the STA group, whereas DVA was the leading method in the
conventional LA group. As DVA is more rapidly performed, we believe it might contribute
to significant differences between the procedures.</p><p>The STA group mainly consisted of patients in NYHA Class IV including one of them based
on the preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We believe that
preoperative demography and ECMO might significantly prolong the duration of inotropic
use in STA group, compared to the conventional LA group. Poor baseline characteristics
of the patients in STA group might also lead to increased incidence of postoperative
respiratory problems. A higher amount of bleeding in STA group which was not
statistically significant between the groups resulted in a higher incidence of pleural
effusion. We think that pleural effusion might be another cause of respiratory problems
in STA group.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has also some limitations. Firstly, a multi-center study designed for a
larger sample size may provide more conclusive results for subgroup analyses in
comparison of the two surgical approaches. Secondly, more detailed preoperative
electophysiological studies such as sinus node recovery time (SNRT), sinoatrial
conduction time, intraatrial mapping, and calculation of corrected QT dispersion for
each patient may offer a better approximation of the SN function postoperatively for
each patient and more detailed information regarding the individually-tailored
treatment. This would help us for a better elimination of confounding factors while
comparing different approaches, as well as improved postoperative evaluations of
clinical outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study results suggest that STA does not increase the incidence of arrhythmia and/or
fatal outcomes after mitral valve surgery even in patients with a worse clinical
