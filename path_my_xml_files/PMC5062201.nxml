The study was done on the patients who were planned to undergo lower limb orthopedic surgeries under epidural anesthesia. A total of seventy patients planned to undergo elective lower limb orthopedic surgeries fulfilling the criteria were enrolled in the study.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were those who were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade I and II physical status, scheduled for elective lower limb orthopedic surgery, and age group of between 18 and 60 years. The exclusion criteria were patient refusal for epidural block/study, ASA III, IV, or V, history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drug, local skin sepsis, marked spinal deformities, patients with Cardio-vascular System (CVS), renal or hepatic dysfunction, neuromuscular disorders, morbid obesity, and with marked coagulopathies.</p><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all the patients before the procedure. After this, patients were randomized into two groups using computer-generated tables having 35 patients in each group.</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group I (<italic>n</italic> = 35): Received 15 mL 0.5% levobupivacaine epidurally</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group II (<italic>n</italic> = 35): Received 15 mL 0.75% ropivacaine epidurally.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Parameters studied were duration of sensory block (time of onset, duration, and recovery), duration of motor block (time of onset, duration, and recovery), degree of fall in arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR), pain scores using visual analog scale (VAS), and adverse effects; if any.</p><p>Patients were asked to be nil per oral 6 h for solid foods and 2 h for clear fluids before surgery. All the patients in the study groups were premedicated with tablet diazepam 5 mg and tablet ranitidine 150 mg in the night before surgery. On arrival in the operating theater, an 18-gauge intravenous (i.v.) catheter was placed, and 500 mL of Ringer's lactate solution was infused. The standard monitoring was done throughout the study with noninvasive arterial blood pressure (NIBP), HR, continuous electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry. One milligram of injection midazolam was administered intravenously as premedication. With the patient in the sitting position, under aseptic precautions, the L2&#x02013;L3 or L3&#x02013;L4 interspace was identified using the midline approach and was infiltrated with 2 ml of 2% lidocaine. The epidural space was identified with an 18-gauge Tuohy needle by the loss of resistance technique. A 20-gauge epidural catheter was then inserted 3&#x02013;5 cm into the epidural space. Test dose with 3 ml of 2% injection xylocaine with adrenaline 1:200,000 was given after a negative aspiration test to detect any intravascular or intrathecal placement of the catheter. Using sealed-envelope assignment, patients were randomly allocated to receive 15 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine (Group I; <italic>n</italic> = 35), 15 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine (Group II; <italic>n</italic> = 35). Sterile syringes with the study drug were prepared in a double-blind fashion by one of the doctors who was not involved in further patient management. An independent, blinded observer recorded the evolution of sensory and motor block every 5 min. The sensory level was assessed using the pinprick method, and readiness to surgery was defined as the complete loss of pinprick sensation at T10. The degree of motor block was evaluated with a four-point modified Bromage score. The scale consists of the following four scores:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>0 = No motor block (0% block)</p></list-item><list-item><p>1 = Unable to raise extended legs (33% block)</p></list-item><list-item><p>2 = Unable to flex knees (66% block)</p></list-item><list-item><p>3 = Unable to flex ankle joint (100% block).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>At the same time, NIBP and HR were also recorded every 5 min following the block.</p><p>In the recovery room, the degree of pain was assessed using VAS in which a score of &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; indicated &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and a score of &#x0201c;10&#x0201d; indicated &#x0201c;worst pain&#x0201d; imaginable [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. VAS measurements were obtained at baseline, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min intervals following the block. When VAS &#x0003e;4, epidural top ups were provided for postoperative analgesia. Patients in Group I received incremental boluses of the same drug which was used to induce the block, i.e., levobupivacaine 10 mL in a concentration of 0.125%. Patients in Group II received 10 mL ropivacaine 0.2% for postoperative analgesia.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Visual Analogue Scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-624-g001"/></fig><p>Clinically relevant hypotension (defined as decrease in systolic arterial blood pressure &#x0003e;30% from baseline) was treated with 6 mg of injection mephentermine i.v. boluses. Occurrence of any other undesirable side effect was also recorded. The volume of local anesthetic solution required, time required to achieve readiness to surgery, maximum level of sensory and motor block, time for the regression of sensory level by two segments and up to T12 were recorded in the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size was calculated using the following formula:</p><p><italic>n</italic> = <italic>Z</italic>&#x003b1;<sup>2</sup> (1 &#x02212; <italic>p</italic><sub>1</sub>/<italic>p</italic><sub>1</sub> + 1 &#x02212; <italic>p</italic><sub>2</sub>/<italic>p</italic><sub>2</sub>)/(l<sub>n</sub> [1 &#x02212; <italic>e</italic>])<sup>2</sup>.</p><p><italic>p</italic><sub>1</sub> = 80% =0.80; <italic>p</italic><sub>2</sub> =0.60; Type 1 error &#x003b1; = 5%; Error - RR = 0.30; Power = 90% (approximately).

At 120 min, both the groups had mean HR comparable to baseline and did not show a significant difference from baseline (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] had also found the same result that epidural 0.5% levobupivacaine shows maximum decline in HR at 30 min postadministration interval, with a mean change nearing 20% when used as an adjuvant with dexmedetomidine or fentanyl. In the present study, we witnessed a similar level of reduction in HR using 0.5% levobupivacaine alone. However, with respect to ropivacaine, the results obtained in the present study showed a difference from the observations of Bajwa <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] who showed that epidural administration of 0.75% ropivacaine epidurally shows a declining trend from around 75 min postadministration interval. HR lowering effect of epidural ropivacaine has been proven in animal studies 60 min after administration.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Thus, it can be seen that both the drugs have a similar effect on HR which varied under different conditions. As far as the present study is concerned, both the drugs showed a similar effect and did not differ significantly. For none of the drugs, any side effect in terms of bradycardia was noticed.</p><p>On evaluating MAP, at baseline, both the groups were matched showing mean values of 97.92 &#x000b1; 5.08 in levobupivacaine and 99.10 &#x000b1; 6.59 mmHg in ropivacaine groups. Following administration of drug, a fall in MA<italic>P</italic> values was observed in both the groups. However, fall in MAP was more rapid and of larger magnitude in ropivacaine as compared to levobupivacaine group. Between two groups, significant differences were observed at 10 min and 15 min postadministration intervals. The maximum reduction in MAP was noticed at 30 min in levobupivacaine and 15 min in ropivacaine group, thereafter an inclining trend was observed. At 120 min, both the drugs had mean HR close to baseline.</p><p>In the present study, sensory as well as motor block onset times were significantly lower in ropivacaine group as compared to levobupivacaine (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The sensory onset time in levobupivacaine was 26.14 &#x000b1; 2.45 min as compared to 17.86 &#x000b1; 2.51 min in ropivacaine group while mean motor onset time was 31.43 &#x000b1; 2.59 min in levobupivacaine as compared to 23.14 &#x000b1; 2.73 min in ropivavaine group. These observations are similar to that obtained by Casatiand Baciarello,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] who reported a longer median range of onset time of surgical block was 30 min (5&#x02013;60 min) with levobupivacaine as compared to 15 min (5&#x02013;60 min) with ropivacaine using the same dose of both the drugs.</p><p>With respect to duration of sensory and motor blocks, although the sensory block duration was found to be significantly longer in ropivacaine group as compared to levobupivacaine group, with respect to postoperative analgesic needs too, ropivacaine required the first analgesic dose at a longer duration (6.43 &#x000b1; 2.12 h) as compared to levobupivacaine (4.97 &#x000b1; 0.89 h). The analgesic effect in terms of 24 h postoperative epidural top up dosages was also significantly lower in ropivacaine (2.24 &#x000b1; 0.87) as compared to levobupivacaine group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>Casati and Baciarello[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported that levobupivacaine 0.5% produces an epidural block of similar onset, quality, and duration as by the same volume of 0.5% bupivacaine with a motor block deeper than that produced by 0.5% ropivacaine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The inference drawn from this discussion, in general, indicated that both the drugs are comparable for block onset, quality, and duration along with similar hemodynamic profile when given in same concentration. However, relatively better response of ropivacaine for block onset and duration as obtained in the present study coupled with higher but statistically.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>KC</given-names></name><name><surname>Greengrass</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Steele</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Continuous peripheral nerve block for ambulatory surgery</article-title><source>Reg Anesth Pain Med</source><year>2001</year><volume>26</volume><fpage>209</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11359219</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gramke</surname><given-names>HF</given-names></name><name><surname>de Rijke</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>van Kleef</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Raps</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Kessels</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name><name><surname>Peters</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The prevalence of postoperative pain in a cross-sectional group of patients after day-case surgery in a university hospital</article-title><source>Clin J Pain</source><year>2007</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>543</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17575496</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Strodtbeck</surname><given-names>WM</given-names></name><name><surname>Richman</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A comparison of regional versus general anesthesia for ambulatory anesthesia: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2005</year><volume>101</volume><fpage>1634</fpage><lpage>42</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16301234</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effect of analgesic technique on postoperative patient-reported outcomes including analgesia: A systematic review</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2007</year><volume>105</volume><fpage>789</fpage><lpage>808</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17717242</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ethgen</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruy&#x000e8;re</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Richy</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Dardennes</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Reginster</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Health-related quality of life in total hip and total knee arthroplasty.
