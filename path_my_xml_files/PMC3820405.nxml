muscles that are attached to it adjust their movement. The location of the pelvis is the
most important element that determines the sagittal alignment and posture of the body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and abnormal posture triggers diverse
problems, including flat-back syndrome, cervical kyphosis, local organ ailments such as
uterine prolapse, and gastric herniation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Asymmetry in upright posture is associated with various outcomes, such as the decreased
loading of the affected side in stroke; degenerative changes of the hip, knee, and ankle
joints and spine; or a leg length discrepancy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The lumbosacral joint affects the lumbar vertebra, and the location
of the joint determines the location of the lumbar vertebra on the upper part. The angle of
the joint may change according to the location of the pelvis. The location of the pelvis
also may trigger epidemiological problems in the musculoskeletal system, and forward and
backward tilt exercises of the pelvis may influence the stability of the spine and the
alignment of the body. Therefore, the correct alignment of the pelvis is an important
element of gait, and a incorrectly located pelvis may cause incorrect posture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The pelvis plays a crucial role in posture, and there have been many previous studies of
stability and the posture of the pelvis that improved lumbopelvic stabilization and posture
through bridge exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, mattress
exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the use of a Swiss
ball<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, these methods have
disadvantages, such as requiring a great deal of time, a large amount of space, and the
active participation of subjects. In contrast, pelvic adjustment is a therapeutic method
that may be performed in a short time. There have been many previous studies that examined
the effects of pelvic adjustment on functional leg length inequality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, foot pressure, and balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, but there has been no study that examined the effects of one-time
pelvic adjustment on changes in posture. Therefore, this study intends to examine the
immediate effects of one-time pelvic adjustment on the posture of female university
students.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty university female students were selected, and they were equally and randomly
assigned to a pelvic adjustment group, an experimental group, and a stretching group, a
control group. Those who had problems with muscles, the skeletal system, or the neurological
system, those who felt pain in the waist or the pelvis, those who had incorrect posture due
to scars after a burn or a surgical operation, and those who performed regular exercise were
excluded. A sufficient explanation of the intent of this study and the entire experiment was
given to the subjects, and voluntary consent was obtained from them. The age, height, and
weight of the experimental group were 22.5 &#x000b1; 4.9&#x02005;years old, 159.0 &#x000b1; 6.3&#x02005;cm, and 52.1 &#x000b1;
6.1&#x02005;kg, and the age, height, and weight of the control group were 22.2 &#x000b1; 3.3&#x02005;years old,
158.4 &#x000b1; 5.6&#x02005;cm, and 51.1 &#x000b1; 8.5&#x02005;kg. The c<sup>2</sup> test was used for analysis of their
gender, and an independent t-test was employed the analysis of their age, height, and
weight. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the
above analyses (p&#x0003e;0.05), and they were considered homogeneous.</p><p>For the pelvic adjustment that was applied to the experimental group, a high-velocity
low-amplitude technique in keeping with Gonstead's theory was used with the subjects in a
prone position. The subjects were placed in a prone position, and their pelvic height was
checked. An impact on the posterior inferior innominate bone was made in the anterior
superior direction, and an impact on the anterior superior innominate bone was made in the
posterior inferior direction. The therapist put one hand on top of the other hand and placed
them on the posterior superior iliac spine or the ischial spine, and an impact was made
using their weight, gravity, and acceleration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This adjustment was conducted three to five times, and a skilled
physical therapist with more than 10&#x02005;years of experience performed it. The control group
stretched the muscles around the pelvis, including the erector spinae muscle, rectus
abdominis muscle, iliacus muscle, psoas major muscle, quadriceps femoris muscle, adductor
muscle, and quadratus lumborum muscle in order to remove any imbalance of the muscles that
might affect pelvic imbalance. For each muscle stretching, the therapist helped the subject
conduct more stretching exercises in the maximum stretching position, and the subject
maintained the stretching for 10 to 15 seconds. The subject returned to the starting
position gradually, rested for 5 seconds, and stretched once more. The subject stretched
three times for each position, which took 15 minutes.</p><p>For the measurement of postural changes, BackMapper (ABW, Frickenhausen, Germany), a
three-dimensional spinal diagnostic imaging system, was employed. BackMapper is an apparatus
that precisely measures spinal form, location, and degree of distortion, as if looking at
the spinal form from the backward, forward, downward, and upward directions. It analyzes
trunk inclination (TIN), the inclination of the sagittal plane; trunk imbalance (TIM), the
inclination of the coronal plane; pelvic position (PPO), the left and right inclination of
the pelvis; pelvic torsion (PTO), the degree of declination of the hip bone; pelvic rotation
(PRO), the declination of the pelvis on the horizontal plane; and the position of the
scapulae (PSA), the left and right height of the scapula. It is a device that may analyze
the distribution of body muscles and fat, as well as the location of the skeleton, using
various variables.</p><p>The measured data were analyzed by using the SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA)
statistical program, and the collected data were presented as means and standard deviations.
A paired t-test was used for analyzing the significance of the differences between subjects
prior to and after the experiment, and an independent t-test was employed for analyzing the
significance of the differences between the two groups. The significance level was set at
&#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Comparison of TIN, TIM, PPO, PTO, PRO, and PSA between before and after

Correct posture refers to an ideal arrangement of the musculoskeletal system, with the
pelvis at the center. The pelvis supports the abdominal area and connects the spine to the
lower extremities, and it delivers weight from the spine to the lower extremities in a
standing position, maintains correct posture, and makes the movement of the upper
extremities smooth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The neutral
location of the pelvis is crucial for correct posture and adjusts the upper and lower body
parts during movement, improving the activities of daily living and gait ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. For correct posture, the normal location
and stability of the pelvis are important. Although there have been many studies of the
pelvis and posture concerning exercise, those on changes in posture immediately after pelvic
adjustment have been rare. Accordingly, this study intended to examine whether postural
changes occurred immediately after pelvic adjustment. According to the analysis of the
results of postural changes after pelvic adjustment via the Gonstead Technique, there were
immediate effects in terms of postural changes in female university students in TIM, the
inclination of the coronal plane; PPO, the left and right inclination of the pelvis; PTO,
the degree of declination of the hip bone; PRO, the declination of the pelvis on the
horizontal plane; and PSA, the left and right height of the scapula. It is assumed that
pelvic correction could bring about changes in postures as above because the pelvis is an
important structure that supports the spine and conveys body weight to the lower
extremities. However, the issue of how long pelvic correction will enable maintaining proper
postures should be examined through future studies.</p><p>Previous research related to pelvic adjustment, including that of Alcantara et al. (2004),
reported that a correction of rapid speed and low amplitude applied to patients with
subluxation of the sacroiliac joint reduced pain and allowed the patients to return to
work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>; Park et al. (2012) noted that
pelvic adjustment via the Gonstead Technique enhanced balance in 20 elderly people<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>; and Gong et al. (2011) observed that pelvic
correction via the Gonstead Technique reduced functional leg length inequality, which in
turn decreased differences in foot pressure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the previous studies showing that pelvic adjustment
via the Gonstead Technique reduced leg length differences, improved balance, and decreased
differences in foot pressure are similar to those of the present study: pelvic adjustment
using the Gonstead Technique corrects female university students' posture. Nonetheless,
these previous studies did not observe direct postural changes through pelvic adjustment.
They utilized exercises such as bridge exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, Swiss ball exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and mattress exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup> for postural stability and muscle balance. However, they had
disadvantages in that they required a great deal of time, a large space, cognitive ability,
motor ability, and the active participation of subjects.</p><p>Therefore, correcting the posture of patients who have degraded cognitive abilities or have
difficulty with active participation in exercise due to decreased motor ability via pelvic
adjustment will be helpful for them, and the researcher hopes this method will be actively
used with these patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Vaz</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Roussouly</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Berthonnaud</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal> et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Sagittal morphology and equilibrium of pelvis and
