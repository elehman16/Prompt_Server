Renal colic is known with severe pain and frequently encountered in EDs, with 5&#x02013;15% prevalence in the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Kidney stones cause pain by obstructing the uterus, and may lead to hydronephrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The patient&#x02019;s pain relief places the responsibility on emergency physicians to find safe and effective methods of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Often, pain relief in renal colic patients is a challenge in ED, but the cornerstone of treatment includes narcotics and NSAIDs.</p><p id="Par6">New effective analgesics have been studied for the treatment of pain. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid receptor agonist with opioid receptor antagonist properties. It has a high affinity and low-to-moderate intrinsic activity at the opioid receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Buprenorphine is effective for the treatment of moderate to severe pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It also demonstrates the potential of sublingual opioids for the release of the baseline pain. It is a lipophilic molecule with poor oral bioavailability (approximately 10%) and undergoes first-pass metabolism, but it has good sublingual bioavailability (approximately 50%), with large intersubject variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Following its sublingual administration, there is no considerable rise in its plasma concentrations for 20&#x000a0;min; the time to maximum concentration is variable, ranging from 40&#x000a0;min to 6&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Potency is high and serum concentrations are linearly related to dose (from 1 to 32&#x000a0;mg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Intravenous (IV) administration of either NSAIDs or opioids is the common route for pain relief in renal colic. Sometimes, this route is accompanied by adverse effects, and takes more time than the oral or sublingual route. It may be not suitable in overcrowded emergency wards. Furthermore, there are a few investigations about pain management by buprenorphine, especially for renal colic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the effectiveness of sublingual buprenorphine versus intravenous ketorolac tromethamine for pain relief in renal colic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par8">A clinical trial, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized study was carried out in patients diagnosed with renal colic. The symptoms for inclusion criteria were colic flank pain associated with costo-vertebral angle tenderness and urinary tract irritation symptoms that suggest clinical diagnosis of renal colic based on history and physical examination and pain score greater than 3, as determined by visual pain analogous scale (VPAS), attending emergency departments of Golestan general Hospital at Ahvaz, southwest of Iran, with 73,000 annual visits from August 2015 to April 2016.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Exclusion Criteria</title><p id="Par9">Age&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;18&#x000a0;years and age&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;55&#x000a0;years, any pain killer during the previous 6&#x000a0;h, addiction (self-report or medical record), history of allergic reaction to opioids or NSAIDs, systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;&#x000a0;90&#x000a0;mmHg, abdominal tenderness and rebound, body temperature &#x0003e;&#x000a0;38&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, history or documents suggesting ischemic heart disease, liver disorder, respiratory disease, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, active peptic ulcer, seizure, metabolic disorder, pregnancy, clinical concern for abdominal aortic aneurysm or dissection, inability to speak, and any intervention beyond the study protocol because of intolerable pain or patient disagreement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par10">The subjects were randomly divided into two groups.

Before intervention, and at 20, 40, and 60&#x000a0;min after administration, pain scores were measured and recorded by a fixed emergency medicine attending consultant based on a standard 10-gauge VPAS [0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;no pain, 10&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;the worst pain].</p><p id="Par11">At 40&#x000a0;min after administration, any patient with a pain score &#x0003e;&#x000a0;5 or any patient with a pain score &#x0003e;&#x000a0;2 in minute of 60&#x000a0;min, received 1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg of intravenous fentanyl [Caspian Tamin Pharmaceutical Company; Rasht, Iran; Ampule, 0.5&#x000a0;mg/10&#x000a0;ml] as rescue treatment.</p><p id="Par12">During 1&#x000a0;h of intervention, if we needed to use any medicine apart from the study protocol, we excluded that patient from the study. After 60&#x000a0;min, if renal colic pain continued or recurred, we used additional or other medications and hospitalized the patient in the urology department in order to make more evaluations based on their situation.</p><p id="Par13">Both groups were monitored for adequate pain control and probable adverse effects, including respiratory depression (a respiratory rate below 12 breaths/min), hypotension (a drop of more than 20% in systolic blood pressure), nausea, vomiting, pruritus, headache, lightheadedness, and drowsiness, during study.</p><p id="Par14">Also, just before, and 60&#x000a0;min after medication, vital signs and O<sub>2</sub> saturation were recorded in each patient. Both groups were followed for presumptive complications until 24&#x000a0;h after medication. Baseline demographic characteristics of all patients were gathered, including gender, age, weight, past medical history, and family history. Additional interventions were recorded.</p><p id="Par15">Acute renal colic because of renal stones was confirmed by clinical manifestations associated with urine analysis and ultrasonography or CT scanning.

Jakobs et al. showed that buprenorphine leads to significantly reduced pain scores in comparison to procaine in pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is also used for treating various behavioral and psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but there are few studies regarding pain management of acute renal colic by buprenorphine. In addition, some studies have indicated that ketorolac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] is an effective analgesic for acute renal colic pain relief.</p><p id="Par24">In our study, we found that 2&#x000a0;mg of sublingual buprenorphine was as effective as 30&#x000a0;mg intramuscular ketorolac for renal colic pain relief. Two agents showed a similar decreased trend. However, our results did not show any significant differences among the two groups over time.</p><p id="Par25">Our results are also comparable with the results of Jalili et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], who studied the effectiveness of 0.4&#x000a0;mg sublingual buprenorphine and 5&#x000a0;mg intravenous morphine in patients with acute extremity fractures. The pain scores were compared, and no significant difference was seen between the two groups. Also, they did not find any adverse effects in the buprenorphrine group. Payandemehr et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] evaluated the efficacy of 2&#x000a0;mg sublingual buprenorphine with 1&#x000a0;mg/kg intravenous morphine sulfate for pain management of acute renal colic. They have shown that 86.5% of patients in the buprenorphine group did not require rescue analgesia and sublingual buprenorphine can be used as an effective analgesic with minor side effects for acute pain relief in patients with renal colic, and its effectiveness is comparable to that of IV morphine. They reported that dizziness was the only prominent side effect in the buprenorphine group compared to the morphine group. Although in the present study, in the buprenorphine group, 28.1% of patients did not need rescue analgesia, and some adverse effects including nausea (18%), vomiting (18%), and dizziness (21.9%) were observed. The dose, drug form, and administration route of buprenorphine were similar in both studies, but there was no consistency between percentage pain relief and side effects of buprenorphine in the two trials; thus, the reason for this difference is unknown based on the current study.</p><p id="Par26">There is wide inter-patient variability in the sublingual absorption of buprenorphine, but within subjects the variability is low. Both maximum serum concentration (<italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>) and area under the curve (AUC) of buprenorphine have positive linear relationships with dose of buprenorphine, although the increase is not directly dose-proportional. Maybe this characteristic of buprenorphine can explain the difference of pain relief in various studies.</p><p id="Par27">Common side effects following buprenorphine administration may include sedation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, and respiratory depression. However, as a mu-opioid partial agonist with a demonstrated ceiling on respiratory depression, buprenorphine may have a better safety profile compared to a full mu agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Buprenorphine side effects may be because of the other components inside the buprenorphine tablets (lactose monohydrate, mannitol, povidone, anhydrous citric acid, sodium citrate, butylated hydroxyanisole, corn starch, pregelatinized starch, and magnesium stearate) or higher dose of buprenorphine.</p><p id="Par28">There is a potential limitation of buprenorphine in the setting of severe pain: its purported analgesic ceiling. Preclinical studies of buprenorphine indicated that it exhibits an analgesic ceiling or even a bell-shaped dose&#x02013;response curve, where in doses exceeding the maximal analgesic dose were associated with decreased analgesic efficacy. More recent work has found such dose&#x02013;response curves in some pain models but not in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The limitation of this study was its small sample size. So, to find any real difference in efficacy between two drugs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par30">The limitation of current study is that we would like to compare pain scores over time between responders (subjects who did not require fentanyl) of buprenorphine group (28.1%) and ketorolac group (38.7%). We could not conduct this analysis due to a small number of responders in each group (nine and 12 patients in buprenorphine and ketorolac groups, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par31">The results of this study indicate that although ketorolac was more effective than buprenorphine (ketorolac 38.7% versus buprenorphine 28.1%), there was no significant difference between two analgesic regimens in acute renal colic pain management. Buprenorphine has not been as extensively studied in certain populations (e.g., in individuals suffering from pain of malignant origin) as other opioid analgesics, and additional research is needed to better define the role of buprenorphine in various patient subpopulations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Enhanced content</bold></p><p>To view enhanced content for this article go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/53CCF0604705E1C2">http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/53CCF0604705E1C2</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>No funding or sponsorship was received for this study or publication of this article.
