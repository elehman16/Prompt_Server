Traditionally, the duration of treatment for APN has been 10&#x02013;14 days [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Based on recent trials, current clinical guidelines recommend shorter regimens of fluoroquinolones (FQs) for 5&#x02013;7 days to treat uncomplicated APN in non-pregnant women in the outpatient setting [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, in settings where the prevalence of FQ-resistance exceeds 10%, FQs are not preferred as first choice for treating APN [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Notably, in many settings including the Asia-Pacific region [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], several European and South American countries [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and certain parts of the United States [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], prevalence of FQ-resistance among hospitalized patients with urinary tract infections considerably exceeds this threshold, necessitating treatment with alternative antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and beta-lactam/lactamase inhibitors [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>While several clinical trials in the past had compared the clinical efficacy of these agents with another antibiotic such as FQs in patients with APN [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], none of the trials assessed the optimal duration of treatment regimens using non-FQ antibiotics other than co-trimoxazole; trials on hospitalized APN patients are particularly lacking [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Currently, the recommended treatment duration for non-FQ antibiotics is still 10&#x02013;14 days [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and hence the hospital stay is prolonged in the absence of suitable oral options and outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment (OPAT) services. Notwithstanding, most APN patients treated with such antibiotics show clinical resolution within the first week of treatment [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], making clinicians contemplate whether these antibiotics could be stopped by the end of first week, without entailing an unduly high risk of retreatment for recurrent infection.</p><p>Given the higher chances of collateral ecological damage with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], it is important to know whether shorter treatment duration is good enough in hospitalized APN patients, which may often include men, post-menopausal women, and patients with diabetes mellitus. We therefore conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that, contingent upon clinical improvement, the effective non-FQ antibiotic regimen could be safely stopped at Day 7 while the risk of retreatment remains clinically acceptable in patients with APN requiring hospitalization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We conducted a two-arm, parallel group, open-label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a non-inferiority design. This study was done at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER) hospital, Puducherry, India during the period March 17, 2015&#x02014;August 22, 2016. Patients admitted with a provisional diagnosis of APN were eligible for this trial. The study protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197302.s004">S2 File</xref>) was reviewed and approved by the Institute Ethics Committee (Human studies) at JIPMER on January 6, 2015 (No. JIP/IEC/2014/8/381). We obtained informed written consent from all participants. This trial is registered on the Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI/2016/04/006810, URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/showallp.php?mid1=11429&#x00026;EncHid=&#x00026;userName=acute%20pyelonephritis">http://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/showallp.php?mid1=11429&#x00026;EncHid=&#x00026;userName=acute%20pyelonephritis</ext-link>). The protocol was submitted to the registry in March 2015 before the first patient was enrolled (Acknowledgment No. REF/2015/03/008632). However, due to a lapse in communication, the trial registration number was assigned only on April 8, 2016.

We excluded pregnant and lactating women and patients on immunosuppressant drugs.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Study procedure, treatment allocation, and interventions</title><p>All patients admitted to the medical wards during the study period with a diagnosis of APN were assessed for eligibility. The investigators had no role in the choice of empirical antibiotic(s), which was made by the treating physician. Due to a high prevalence of FQ-resistance in our setting [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], physicians seldom use FQs as the empirical choice for treating APN. A mid-stream urine sample was sent for culture before the first dose of antibiotic was administered. In all patients, an ultrasonographic assessment of kidneys, ureter, and bladder and prostate in men was done to exclude urinary tract obstruction and pus collections. One of the investigators (PR) followed the patients during hospital stay to assess resolution of fever and other symptoms and signs of APN. Pretreatment urine culture and susceptibility reports were available by Day 3. We excluded patients with sterile or contaminated pretreatment cultures. Patients who improved clinically within 72 hours of the empirical antibiotic regimen and whose pretreatment culture grew an organism susceptible to the given therapy continued with their treatment (referred to as the &#x02018;empirical regimen&#x02019; patients); in them, urine culture was repeated on Day 4 of antibiotic treatment. In patients with suboptimal clinical response to empirical antibiotic and/or those with organisms resistant to the empirical choice on pretreatment culture, the antibiotic was revised by the treating physician (referred to as the &#x02018;revised regimen&#x02019; patients). Once they clinically improved following treatment revision, urine culture was repeated on Day 4 of revised treatment. Patients with sustained clinical improvement on Day 7 of the effective antibiotic regimen (either empirical or revised) were eligible for randomization.</p><p>Since stratification of randomization by several variables is not effective in small-sized trials, we used a minimization method for randomization to balance the prognostic variables between the trial arms [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We considered the following factors for minimization&#x02014;female gender, age &#x02265;55 years, diabetes mellitus, peak serum creatinine &#x02265;2 mg/dL, empirical or revised regimen, and aminoglycoside-based or non-aminoglycoside regimen. After obtaining informed written consent, one of the investigators not involved in enrollment (SD or TK) entered the details of consecutive patients into a computer program (MinimPy [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) which assigned patients to either group in a ratio of 1:1. To maintain unpredictability (allocation concealment), we incorporated a biased-coin method with a base probability of 0.80. If the patient was allocated to truncated treatment (intervention arm), then the antibiotic treatment was stopped and he/she was discharged home. In those allocated to continued treatment (control arm), the same antibiotic regimen was continued until Day 14, and then they were discharged. Patients came back for follow-up visits at Week 1 and Week 6 after hospital discharge. All patients requiring retreatment during the follow-up period were to be retreated for 14 days irrespective of the trial arm they were allocated to. During the follow-up visits, they were enquired about any recurrent symptoms, and they provided a mid-stream urine sample for culture. Patients who did not turn up for scheduled visits were contacted over telephone and enquired about recurrence of symptoms, physician visits, and retreatment. The study methods are depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197302.s001">S1 Fig</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was retreatment for recurrent urinary tract infection during follow-up, up to 6 weeks after completion of antibiotic treatment. Treatment with antibiotics for any form of symptomatic urinary tract infection, which is inclusive of but not restricted to the clinical syndrome of APN, during the follow-up period was considered as retreatment. Protocol-specified secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay (including re-admission, if any), antibiotic consumption per patient (expressed as defined daily doses [DDDs] [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], including retreatment if required), treatment-related side effects, and presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria at Week 1 and Week 6 after discharge.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>We chose a non-inferiority design for this study. We assumed that 5% of patients in the continued treatment arm would require retreatment. If there was truly no difference between continued and truncated treatments, then 27 patients were required in each arm to be 80% sure that the upper limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (or equivalently a 90% two-sided confidence interval) would exclude a difference in favor of continued treatment of more than 15% [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Allowing for a 15% loss to follow-up, the sample size was calculated as 31 patients in each arm. While the US Food and Drug Administration suggests a non-inferiority margin of 10% for trials on complicated urinary tract infections, it allows a higher margin in certain cases [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The Infectious Diseases Society of America had commented that a non-inferiority margin of 15% could be justified if there are critically important advantages such as shorter treatment duration and activity against drug-resistant uropathogens [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Hence, we set the non-inferiority margin <italic>a priori</italic> at 15%. This would translate roughly into a 33% reduction in antibiotic consumption (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197302.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), which is a meaningful reduction from a stewardship perspective [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. From a methodologic viewpoint, considering that the conservative estimate of the incremental efficacy of active treatments over placebo in clinical trials on complicated urinary tract infections is about 41% [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], a non-inferiority margin of 15% would still retain about 63% (relative) of active treatment effect, making it safe to conclude that the intervention is superior to putative placebo.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used a statistical software package for analysis (Stata/IC 12.1 for Windows, StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA). We summarized normally distributed continuous variables as mean &#x000b1; SD and tested between-group comparisons by independent <italic>t</italic>-test. We presented continuous variables with a skewed distribution, such as hospital stay, as median (IQR) and used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to test for significance. We summarized categorical variables as frequency with proportion (n [%]) and applied Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for group comparisons. All tests were two-sided, and we considered <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 statistically significant.</p><p>We followed the effect estimation approach to assess non-inferiority for the primary outcome. We calculated confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference in retreatment proportions between the trial arms (Truncated treatment&#x02013;Continued treatment) by Newcombe-Wilson hybrid score without applying a continuity correction [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Limits of the calculated 90% two-sided CIs correspond to respective one-sided 95% CIs (one-sided alpha of 5%). We concluded non-inferiority if the upper limit of the difference in retreatment did not exceed the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 15% in favor of the continued treatment arm. We used the Farrington-Manning exact test to calculate <italic>P</italic> value for non-inferiority (NCSS 11 Statistical Software, NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, USA). The primary analysis was by original assigned groups; however, any patient without primary outcome data was excluded. Since non-adherence to assigned treatment could bias the result toward non-inferiority, we also did a per protocol analysis for the primary outcome. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis by the worst case scenario assuming that any patient lost to follow-up had the outcome of interest. In response to reviewer&#x02019;s comments, we also examined non-inferiority at a one-sided alpha of 2.5% by using two-sided 95% CIs for the difference in retreatment for the primary and sensitivity analyses. We performed 6 <italic>post hoc</italic> subgroup analyses to explore whether the treatment effect differed across clinically meaningful subgroups. We applied a test of interaction (Mantel-Haenszel method) to assess whether the subgroup effects were different from the overall treatment effect.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec014"><title>Results</title><p>Between March 17, 2015 and August 22, 2016, we screened 314 patients admitted with a diagnosis of APN.

Upper bound of the CI for the difference in retreatment in favor of the continued treatment arm (6.15%) was well below the prespecified margin of 15%, establishing non-inferiority of truncated treatment as compared to continued treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197302.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Non-inferiority criterion was met on a per protocol analysis also (difference in retreatment = &#x02212;3.85% [&#x02212;15.53% to 6.04%]).

There was no difference in the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria between the two arms at Week 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197302.t002">Table 2</xref>). Fifty patients completed the second follow-up visit at Week 6, with a median visit time of 50 days (IQR 43&#x02013;66 days). At Week 6 visit, a total of 6 patients had asymptomatic bacteriuria; 1 patient in the continued treatment arm reported mild dysuria, but no fever.

Our findings extend the available evidence base for shorter duration antibiotic treatment for APN to include non-FQ regimens and patient populations such as hospitalized patients. Understandably, this strategy was associated with a significant decrease in antibiotic consumption, length of hospital stay, and probably treatment-related side-effects. This trial was conducted in a setting with a high prevalence of uropathogens resistant to FQs and third-generation cephalosporins. Although we excluded patients with catheter-associated and recurrent urinary tract infections, severe sepsis, men with prostatic involvement, and patients who might require a surgical intervention in addition to antibiotic treatment such as those with emphysematous APN, renal/perinephric abscess, or obstructive uropathy, we tried to maintain a pragmatic approach by including patients with well-recognized risk factors for complicated APN, like male gender, diabetes, acute kidney injury, as well as failure of the empirical regimen. Moreover, this trial was not restricted to a particular organism or an antibiotic.</p><p>If one carefully looks at the reasons for exclusion, of the 260 patients with APN excluded from this trial, the findings of this trial could be reasonably extrapolated to those aged &#x0003c;18 years and those without documented fever or a positive baseline urine culture. Likewise, the trial findings could be cautiously applied to patients on immunosuppressive therapy and those with recurrent urinary infection, septic shock, or renal failure provided they show sustained clinical improvement by Day 7 of treatment. Clinical trials involving these subsets of patients to reliably inform the duration of antibiotic treatment individually in each of these small subsets are unlikely to be carried out in the future. On the other hand, the present findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with urinary obstruction, perinephric collections, emphysematous APN, persistent clinical symptoms by Day 7, or positive Day 4 urine cultures. Further clinical trials would be required to define the optimal duration of treatment in these subsets of patients. The present study had an open-label design. Lack of blinding could influence the decision to treat any recurrent symptoms with antibiotics. However, it would not influence the urine culture results. Moreover, both the patients with recurrent symptoms on follow-up were in the continued treatment arm. Thus, there was no reason to believe that a lack of blinding could have biased the results in favour of truncated treatment.</p><p>Resistance to amikacin was rare in the trial population, and most patients received amikacin-based treatment. Studies conducted in late 1980s and early 1990s had reported that aminoglycosides given for a shorter duration of 5 days resulted in bacteriological cure in more than 90% of patients with APN [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. On the other hand, a systematic review of 26 randomized trials found that aminoglycosides were inferior to beta-lactams and FQs in achieving bacteriological cure at the end of treatment, but not at 30 days post-treatment in patients with urinary tract infections [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that shortening the treatment duration of aminoglycosides could result in an excess of retreatment for recurrent infection as compared to continued treatment for a longer duration. However, to our knowledge, this question has not been addressed by any of the clinical trials in the past.</p><p>Recently, in the face of extensive spread of antimicrobial resistance among pathogenic bacteria, shorter durations of antibiotic therapy have been studied and found to be effective for some common infections such as bacteremia and community-acquired pneumonia [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While there have been previous trials of shortened treatment duration in urinary tract infection, majority of patients included in such trials were otherwise healthy non-pregnant women [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Trials addressing treatment duration for APN in men as well as patients with co-morbidities are scarce [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials comparing efficacy of short (&#x02264;7 days) vs. longer antibiotic courses for treatment of APN concluded that 7 days of treatment is similar to longer treatment duration in terms of clinical and microbiological failure in patients with APN, including bacteremic patients [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, all the 3 trials using non-FQ antibiotics (pivampicillin, pivmecillinam, cefixime) included in this meta-analysis were done before the year 2000. In the contemporary setting, where resistance to third-generation cephalopsorins is an important problem among hospitalized patients [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], ceftolozane/tazobactam and doripenem have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials for the treatment of APN [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, the current evidence available for the use of non-FQs other than these drugs is largely from observational case series only [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The median treatment duration in these observational studies was 6&#x02013;8 days, indicating that substantial number of patients were treated for more than 7 days duration. The present study provides evidence from a randomized controlled trial that the effective non-FQ antibiotic could be stopped at Day 7 once these patients have clinically improved.</p><p>One of the most significant studies on treatment duration in patients with febrile urinary tract infection has been recently reported from the Netherlands [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This study randomized patients to 7-days or 14-days of FQ-based treatment. Notably, men, post-menopausal women, patients with urogenital abnormalities, and co-morbidities were included in this trial. Overall, the clinical cure at Day 74&#x02013;80 in the 7-days arm was non-inferior to the 14-days arm. However, short-term efficacy of the 7-days regimen in men at Day 10&#x02013;18 days post-treatment was found to be inferior to the 14-days arm. The authors attributed this to clinically unapparent infection of prostatic tissue in men. Notwithstanding this finding, they proposed that shorter regimens for men might still be adequate since the need for additional antibiotic during follow-up was similar with both regimens, applying principles of antimicrobial stewardship. However, we did not did not find any difference between men and women during 6 weeks post-treatment with regard to retreatment or microbiological cure rates. Although the present study was not powered to address non-inferiority in individual subgroups such as men, it needs to be pointed out that &#x0201c;When evaluating a subgroup, the question is not whether the subgroup shows a statistically significant result but whether the subgroup treatment effects are significantly different from each other&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. While the only patient that required retreatment in our trial was female, asymptomatic bacteriuria during follow-up was equally seen among men and women. In our study, only 4 of the 24 men were treated with single agent amikacin, while the rest were treated with a cephalosporin (n = 17), piperacillin-tazobactam (n = 2), or meropenem (n = 1). While amikacin may not be effective in the acidic milieu of prostatic tissue, the latter drugs have been found to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the prostatic tissue [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The event rates in the present trial were quite low. Apart from the fact that as such recurrence following treatment for APN is uncommon [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], our trial eligibility criteria probably excluded patients at a higher risk for recurrent urinary tract infection. Another reason for the low event rates in our trial could be that we randomized only those patients with a sustained clinical improvement. For the same reason, we did not use &#x02018;clinical cure&#x02019; as an outcome measure, which has been used in previous trials [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. One notable difference between the present and previous trials is that we randomized patients on Day 7, for the reason that a clinician is at crossroads on Day 7, not at treatment initiation. Despite the fact that no events were observed in the 7-days arm, using a statistical rule-of-thumb [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the upper limit of the 95% CI for retreatment in the truncated treatment arm would turn out to be 11.5% which is still under the prespecified non-inferiority limit.</p><p>One of the key measures adopted in any antibiotic stewardship program is intravenous to oral conversion of antibiotics [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In this study, all patients were given antibiotics intravenously throughout. Rates of resistance to FQs and third-generation cephalosporins in this trial were quite high and were similar to earlier published reports [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Many parts of world with widespread antimicrobial resistance are facing this challenge of scarcity of oral agents for treating community-acquired infections. In the absence of suitable oral options, availability of dedicated OPAT services could shorten the hospital stay in these patients. However, OPAT services are not widely available in most Asian countries including India [<xref rid="pone.0197302.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. At least in some of our trial participants who had infections caused by ciprofloxacin-susceptible organisms, the treatment could have been switched to oral FQs. However, for unclear reasons, the treating clinicians preferred to continue with the non-FQ regimens. Definitely, this highlights the need for a good stewardship program. Nonetheless, failure to switch to oral FQs in such patients would not affect our conclusion about the comparative efficacy of truncated treatment.</p><p>The strength of the present trial is its pragmatic outlook. This trial was conducted in real-life clinical settings, and the antibiotic choices were not controlled for the purpose of the study. Hence, the results are relevant to similar clinical settings where agents like third-generation cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides as well as carbapenems are being used as first-line agents for the treatment of APN. The possible limitations of the present trial are&#x02014;i) our findings may not be directly applicable to patients with severe complicated pyelonephritis, especially those with obstructive uropathy and other structural complications; ii) we did not perform strain typing of <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> isolates to see whether the presence of bacteriuria after treatment in some patients indicates persistence of same strain or re-colonization by newer ones; and iii) this trial cannot inform the management of patients that remain urine culture positive on Day 4 of treatment despite clinical improvement. Further research is warranted to answer these pertinent clinical questions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found that truncating the effective non-FQ antibiotic treatment at Day 7 is good enough in hospitalized APN patients without features of severe urosepsis and underlying urogenital tract abnormalities.
