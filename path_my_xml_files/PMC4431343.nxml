Many benefits of RCTs have been seen in the specialty of rheumatology, and particularly in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;10</xref> While the aim of RCTs is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an experimental agent, their observation period typically spans a relatively short time frame. However, the use of therapies in chronic diseases necessitates more long-term evaluation. The introduction of new disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapies for the treatment of RA has been associated with a significant number of post-RCT extension studies,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;17</xref> henceforth termed &#x02018;trial extension studies&#x02019; (TES), to report the longer-term outcomes of an experimental agent.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Role of TES</title><p>TES can evaluate in particular, the effects of cumulative exposure to a drug, capturing events through systematic reporting, monitoring of source data, and consistent coding, thus enabling further assessment of the long-term safety profile observed during the RCT.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>An additional benefit of TES that is cited is continued access to an effective but otherwise unlicensed treatment by RCT participants. However, since a favourable effect of the treatment may not have been clearly determined at the time of TES participation (with results from the preceding RCT and/or indeterminate prior studies not available), this raises legitimate ethical issues about the appropriateness of exposing patients to potentially ineffective or only partially effective treatments for additional periods of time.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Challenges of TES</title><p>While TES play a valid role, there are clear limitations that should be considered and potential weaknesses in the design and method of analysis that should be addressed.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> TES benefit from the systematic reporting on cumulative drug exposure but have clear limitations in the detection of rare and unexpected events. In addition, selection bias associated with TES populations and lack of generalisability are key factors. These issues are discussed in more detail in the online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ard.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204948/-/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link>.</p><p>This makes interpretation challenging and sometimes unreliable. While guidance for reporting of RCTs<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and safety data from biological DMARD registers<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> are available, no recommendations for TES in rheumatology have been published to date.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> With this in mind, a task force was created with the principal aim of developing practical recommendations on key aspects of TES on the basis of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) standard operating procedures,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and thereby a recommended standardised format for future TES data reporting to achieve greater transparency. This manuscript reports the final recommendations as agreed by the task force.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The task force agreed that a systematic literature review was not indicated for this initiative, as it would merely serve to further establish the lack of consistency in TES and emphasise the need for the development of a standard for future application.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>The target population for these recommendations was chosen to be rheumatologists, trialists and researchers working in the field of rheumatology, patient organisations and policymakers. The general approach to this project followed the EULAR standardised operating procedures for the elaboration and implementation of evidence-based recommendations.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>The two task force conveners (MHB and MB) set up a multidisciplinary task force with participants selected based on their field of expertise, knowledge and experience as well as appropriate geographical distribution, primarily across Europe but also North America.</p><p>A first meeting of all task force members was convened in January 2011 to primarily define the domains for evaluation. This comprised two breakout sessions, with the task force split into two groups. Each group had a rapporteur who reported the outcome to the whole task force. After a final round of discussion, the task force agreed on the individual items for inclusion in a Delphi exercise. The Delphi method offers a consensus method that is widely used in health service research.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The two-step Delphi exercise for this initiative was web based, which permitted opinions to be provided and votes on the level of agreement to be cast independently and anonymously. Geographical limitations were also avoided by this approach. It was designed by LS-F and reviewed and modified as indicated by MHB, LC and MB. Details on how the Delphi exercise was formulated, responses were scored and the approach for informing final recommendations was devised can be found in the online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ard.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204948/-/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Task force composition</title><p>The multidisciplinary task force comprised 22 participants consisting of 17 rheumatologists, of whom six were clinical epidemiologists and 11 clinical trialists/expert clinicians, two biostatisticians, one fellow and two patient representatives. Participants represented 10 European countries, the USA and Canada.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Response rate</title><p>Of the 22 invited experts, three could not attend the first meeting (January 2011) but were subsequently apprised of the discussion and participated in the Delphi exercise. One of the patient representatives could not continue participation after the first meeting. Twenty of the 21 participants responded to the first and all 21 responded to the second Delphi exercise.</p><p>The two-step Delphi exercise was completed by January 2012, with subsequent analysis and dissemination of draft recommendations in March 2012. Final voting took place in May 2012. However, subsequent steps of involving additional stakeholders (see &#x02018;Results&#x02019; section) and a meeting to discuss the recommendations (June 2013) led to a delay in establishing the recommendations for the purposes of submission. The task force approved this final document that included some modifications following the last step.

Our EULAR task force comprised a group of experts encompassing a range of expertise including clinical trialists, clinicians experienced in RA treatment, and clinical epidemiologists as well as patient representatives. A wide range of countries and health systems were represented, albeit with some omissions (eg, absence of individuals from Asia), although the opportunity to evaluate these recommendations in the wider community in the future should highlight any differing perspectives. With a generally accepted methodology for prospective observational studies, we felt an additional systematic review was not necessary and decided to use our expert opinion to formulate guidance for TES. These recommendations complement those established for clinical trials<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and registries.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Central to the recommendations was the principle that a TES report should focus on cumulative outcome analysis, maintaining the original trial groups to avoid reporting of only the sub-selected patient group that proceeds to the TES, and thereby achieve better generalisability of results. Furthermore, the task force was clear that absolute numbers and not just percentage response rates should be reported. To facilitate this, we recommend a flow diagram detailing absolute numbers of subjects at each relevant time point, with clear illustration of drop-outs and the reason for cessation and/or exclusion at each relevant stage. While it was agreed that a TES might elaborate on the incidence and nature of adverse events over time, they are not designed to capture rare safety signals. TES reports may also have the potential to inform on the durability of response and the dynamics of achieving pre-determined targets of treatment (low disease activity and remission). It was agreed that any analysis should be pre-specified in the protocol but should always include an intention -to-treat in addition to a completer approach. We acknowledge there are elements that may in particular be the subject of further discussion in the wider community, for example, the issue of split reporting. While the task force discouraged this, each case should be considered individually as there may be instances when there is utility in this approach to ensure relevant data that is of interest is disseminated within the public domain.</p><p>The recommendations were actively commented on by several industry companies (see the &#x02018;Consultation of recommendations and stakeholder involvement&#x02019; section) and include their specific feedback (which has been indicated directly in the results where appropriate in the online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ard.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204948/-/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link>) and as such, gained the approval of the participating stakeholders. While EMA representation did not suggest changes to the recommendations, it acknowledged the importance of standardisation. The interaction also highlighted how regulatory expectations may drive the industry approach on whether and how TES should be undertaken.</p><p>While we acknowledge that the working group was perhaps relatively small for a consensus exercise, following dissemination of these recommendations, we would anticipate a subsequent exercise to capture how they have been received in the wider rheumatology, trial and industry communities. In future, it will be important for journal reviewers and editors to measure future TES reports against the standard set by these recommendations. The future research agenda will include a systematic review of forthcoming TES to evaluate how well this document is utilised, with further refinement based on the nature of outcomes observed. In addition, regulatory agencies may wish to consider the recommendations and associated issues and how these may influence their expectations from industry. This initiative and the interactive session at EULAR, Madrid 2013 with relevant stakeholders will hopefully be a springboard for further action (the outcome of the EULAR meeting is summarised in the online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ard.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204948/-/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link>).</p><p>In summary, there is a clear unmet need for a reliable approach to the reporting of TES to maximise our understanding of drug effects in chronic conditions. This initiative, its principles and resulting recommendations apply to TES for any drug in RA as well as for drugs used to treat other chronic rheumatological conditions. This document provides much needed first recommendations to ensure a transparent and standardised approach to the reporting of future TES.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-204948-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1165" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web appendix A</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-204948-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1170" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><caption><title>Web appendix B</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-204948-s3.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1175" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) for supporting and providing the funds for this task force initiative.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MHB, LS-F, LC and MB contributed substantially to the design, implementation and data collection of the Delphi exercises.
