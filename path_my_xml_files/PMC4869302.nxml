The triple combination cyclophosphamide, bortezomib (Velcade&#x000ae;) and dexamethasone (CVD) is an effective regimen at relapse and has emerged in recent years as the standard therapy at first relapse in the UK.

In addition, the study also aims to assess the utility of a maintenance schedule of carfilzomib in these participants. The primary objective of the trial is to assess whether CCD provides non-inferior activity in terms of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;VGPR rates at 24&#x000a0;weeks, and whether the addition of maintenance treatment with carfilzomib to CCD provides superior activity in terms of progression-free survival, as compared to CCD with no maintenance.

For younger fitter patients the current standard of care is induction therapy typically using a novel agent-based regimen consolidated with high-dose melphalan and peripheral blood stem cell rescue (termed autologous stem cell transplantation, ASCT). For older less fit patients, frontline regimens include a novel agent along with steroids and an alkylating agent, but without consolidation with ASCT. With these regimens, the majority of patients will enter a plateau phase lasting some 3&#x02013;5 years, however patients will relapse and require further anti-myeloma therapy.</p><p>Current standard treatment at first relapse in the UK is the use of bortezomib (Velcade&#x000ae;), commonly with dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Increasingly, a third agent is added, either an alkylating agent such as cyclophosphamide (CVD), an anthracycline, doxorubicin (PAD) or thalidomide. The triple combination CVD is an effective regimen at relapse, producing response rates of up to 70&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and has emerged in recent years as the standard therapy at first relapse in the UK, with dose adjustments tailored to age and performance status. Up to 8&#x000a0;cycles are administered, although many patients have their treatment withdrawn before completing 8&#x000a0;cycles as a consequence of neurotoxicity, more frequently seen with the intravenous (IV) mode of delivery of bortezomib. Recently, a phase 3 study comparing intravenous (IV) with subcutaneous (SC) mode of delivery has reported equivalent efficacy with significantly reduced neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The publication of these results has led to widespread changeover from the IV to the SC use of bortezomib.</p><p>The development of carfilzomib, an irreversible epoxyketone inhibitor of the proteasome, offers the opportunity to further explore the anti-tumour efficacy of proteasome inhibition, particularly as some patients have disease that does not respond to bortezomib, or develop resistance after initial response. Phase I and II studies have shown carfilzomib monotherapy can be safely administered and produces encouraging response rates. Similarly, when given in combination with lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone, carfilzomib is well tolerated, and there are no significant overlapping toxicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The Myeloma UK (MUK) study, MUK five, has been developed to further explore carfilzomib combination therapy in the relapsed or primary refractory setting. Experience with bortezomib confirms improved efficacy with good tolerability when used in combination with dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide (CVD). Carfilzomib has good activity as a single agent in the relapsed setting, and it is expected that efficacy will be improved when used in combination with dexamethasone and a third agent. Hence it is important and timely to obtain data on the activity, toxicity and tolerability of Carfilzomib in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (CCD) in the first relapse setting. This triplet regimen has recently been reported to be a well tolerated and active regimen in the frontline setting in older patients not suitable for ASCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The study has been developed through the Myeloma UK (MUK) Early Phase Clinical Trials Network, an innovative collaboration which brings together clinical specialists and researchers, the pharmaceutical industry and NHS regulatory bodies to conduct a prioritised and strategic portfolio of myeloma clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study aims</title><p>This study will compare the activity of CCD with that of the current standard therapy at relapse, CVD, given over an equivalent treatment period (24&#x000a0;weeks), in participants with multiple myeloma at first relapse, or refractory to no more than 1 line of treatment.

The trial has received national research ethics approval from the NHS National Research Ethics Service London, Fulham (REC Number: 12/LO/1078). A total of 300 participants will be randomised on a 2:1 basis to either 6&#x000a0;cycles of CCD or 8&#x000a0;cycles of CVD (both equivalent to 24&#x000a0;weeks of therapy), with follow-up to disease progression. Participants in the CCD arm who, at the end of the initial 6&#x000a0;cycles of CCD do not have evidence of disease progression, will be randomised to receive maintenance therapy with Carfilzomib or to receive no further treatment. Participants in the CVD arm will not receive maintenance therapy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In order to compare the regimens with regard to activity, the trial has been designed to incorporate two co-primary endpoints: response and progression-free survival. This allows the trial to assess the activity of the two regimens within a fixed period of 24&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, i.e. not incorporating the maintenance phase in the CCD arm, and to compare the activity of the whole CCD regimen with and without maintenance therapy, and the whole CCD regimen without maintenance with the CVD regimen by evaluating the longer term endpoint of PFS.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trial flow diagram. *All participants who are eligible and provide informed consent will be randomised. A minimum of 140 participants are required</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12878_2016_53_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was calculated according to each of the co-primary endpoints<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x02265; Very good partial response (VGPR)</p></list-item></list></p><p>The primary endpoint analysis is based on a non-inferiority comparison of CCD vs. CVD. Clinical discussion taking into account recent data anticipates a&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;VGPR rate of approximately 30&#x02013;40&#x000a0;% with CVD at first relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Considerable discussion was given to whether this comparison should be performed as a superiority or non-inferiority comparison, since CCD is expected to improve&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;VGPR rates by up to 10&#x000a0;%. In this setting, however, a phase II superiority trial to detect this small improvement would likely be unfeasible. A non-inferiority design is therefore used, assuming a&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;VGPR rate of 35&#x000a0;% with CVD, and a&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;VGPR rate of 45&#x000a0;% with CCD, with a non-inferiority margin of &#x02212;5&#x000a0;%. Randomising participants on a 2:1 basis in favour of CCD, a total of 291 participants (CCD&#x02009;=&#x02009;194, CVD&#x02009;=&#x02009;97) are required to exclude a difference of &#x02212;5&#x000a0;% from the 90&#x000a0;% confidence interval with 80&#x000a0;% power (1-sided 5&#x000a0;% significance level).<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Progression-free survival</p></list-item></list></p><p>The primary PFS comparison will be focused on those participants undergoing maintenance randomisation in the CCD arm, to compare maintenance with carfilzomib vs. no maintenance. It is assumed that median PFS with CVD with no maintenance will be approximately 14&#x000a0;months from the time of initial treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is hypothesised that a similar median PFS will be observed with CCD therapy with no maintenance. It is also anticipated that approximately 80&#x000a0;% of participants randomised to receive CCD therapy will be progression-free at the end of 24&#x000a0;weeks of initial treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. With 80&#x000a0;% power, a 2-sided alpha of 0.2, and assuming follow-up of at least 18&#x000a0;months for all participants from the time of maintenance randomisation, 70 participants per arm (109 events) are required to detect a hazard ratio of 0.67, corresponding to an increase in median PFS of 6&#x000a0;months with Carfilzomib maintenance therapy, from the time of maintenance randomisation. Taking the required sample size for the response rate endpoint it is therefore expected that approximately 160 participants will be eligible for maintenance randomisation, providing a sufficient sample size to assess the maintenance therapy comparison, allowing approximately 10&#x000a0;% dropout.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Recruitment Process</title><p>The trial is expected to take up to 36&#x000a0;months to complete recruitment. Participants will be recruited from NHS hospitals throughout the UK which are approved research sites within the Myeloma UK Early Phase Clinical Trial Network. Participants will be approached during standard clinic visits for management of their disease and will be provided with verbal and written details, in the form of a participant information sheet. Following information provision, participants will have as long as they need to consider participation (normally a minimum of 24&#x000a0;h) and will be given the opportunity to discuss the study with their family and other healthcare professionals before they are asked whether they would be willing to take part in the study.</p><p>Participants who satisfy all the study inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> will be invited to provide written informed consent.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>MUK five study inclusion and exclusion criteria</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Inclusion criteria for initial randomisation</td></tr><tr><td>DISEASE RELATED</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;- Diagnosed with symptomatic MM (according to IMWG 2003 criteria) and requiring therapy for first relapse or primary refractory disease.

Myeloma incidence rates have increased overall in Great Britain since mid-1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The majority of patients will enter a plateau phase lasting some 3&#x02013;5 years, with therapies based on thalidomide or alkylating agents. Patients will relapse and require further anti-myeloma therapy. The use of bortezomib and lenalidomide has revolutionised the treatment of relapsed disease with both drugs being shown to improve response rates, progression-free and overall survival, when compared to dexamethasone in randomised clinical trials in relapsed participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The triple combination of bortezomib, dexamethasone and an alkylating agent, such as cyclophosphamide (CVD), is an effective regimen at relapse. The development of carfilzomib offers the opportunity to further explore the anti-tumour efficacy of proteasome inhibition. In phase I and phase II clinical studies, carfilzomib demonstrated robust and durable efficacy and acceptable safety and tolerability profile in participants with relapse and/or refractory multiple myeloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Based on the available evidence, it is important and timely to obtain data on the activity, toxicity and tolerability of this drug. In contrast to ongoing phase III trials such as ASPIRE, FOCUS, ENDEAVOR and CLARION [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], this phase II trial has a unique subset of participants diagnosed with multiple myeloma at first relapse or refractory to no more than 1 line of treatment.
