We here studied in a non-randomized follow-up trial the persistence of pneumococcal immunity in these children at 3&#x02013;5 years of age (n = 132), and in 121 community controls of a similar age with no prior pneumococcal vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Circulating IgG antibody titers to all PCV7 and PPV23-only serotypes 2, 5 and 7F were measured before and after challenge with 1/5<sup>th</sup> of a normal PPV23 dose. Serotype-specific memory B-cells were enumerated at 10 months and 3&#x02013;5 years of age for a subgroup of study children.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Serotype-specific IgG antibody titers before and after challenge were similar for children who received PCV7/PPV23, PPV23 only, or no pneumococcal vaccines. Before challenge, at least 89% and 59% of children in all groups had serotype-specific titers <bold>&#x02265;</bold> 0.35&#x003bc;g/ml and <bold>&#x02265;</bold> 1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively. Post-challenge antibody titers were higher or similar to pre-challenge titers for most children independent of pneumococcal vaccination history. The rise in antibody titers was significantly lower when pre-challenge titers were higher. Overall the relative number of serotype-specific memory B-cells remained the same or increased between 10 months and 3&#x02013;5 years of age, and there were no differences in serotype-specific memory B-cell numbers at 3&#x02013;5 years of age between the three groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Immunity induced by PCV7 and/or PPV23 immunization in infancy does not exceed that of naturally acquired immunity in 3-5-year-old children living in a highly endemic area. Also, there was no evidence that PPV23 immunization in the first year of life following PCV7 priming induces longer-term hypo-responsiveness.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01414504">NCT01414504</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00219401">NCT00219401</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>071613/Z/03/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehmann</surname><given-names>Deborah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>303123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehmann</surname><given-names>Deborah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>458780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3323-7261</contrib-id><name><surname>van den Biggelaar</surname><given-names>Anita H.

Most cases occur in low-income countries in children younger than 6 months of age [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185877.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In high-risk settings, infants are subject to pneumococcal colonization and disease at a younger age than children in low-risk settings [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and the spectrum of pneumococcal serotypes carried and causing invasive disease is much broader [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185877.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Preventing pneumococcal disease in children in high-risk settings therefore requires strategies that induce the earliest possible protection against the broadest spectrum of invasive pneumococcal serotypes possible.</p><p>More than 90 pneumococcal serotypes have been defined on the basis of the composition of the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule. The capsular polysaccharide is the main virulence factor of the bacterium and immune responses to the capsule are serotype-specific. A licensed pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine including 23 different pneumococcal serotypes (PPV23) is known to be effective in adults; however, PPV23 does not induce immunologic memory and its immunogenicity in young infants in general is believed to be limited [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] although PPV was shown to be efficacious against death due to pneumonia in young children in a high-risk setting, namely the Papua New Guinea (PNG) highlands. A 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was licensed in 2000. PCVs are highly immunogenic in infants, induce immunological memory and serum antibodies with a strong opsonophagocytic (bacterial killing) capacity [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185877.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although the spectrum of serotypes against which PCVs can protect has improved with the licensure of higher valency vaccines (PCV10 and PCV13) in 2010, overall coverage is still limited in high-risk settings. For example, in a longitudinal cohort of newborns in a highly endemic setting in PNG we identified no less than 63 different pneumococcal serotypes in 1761 nasopharyngeal swabs, and only 43% of the pneumococcal isolates were of serotypes present in PCV13 [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>This neonatal cohort study was part of a randomized controlled vaccination trial to determine the safety and immunogenicity of a neonatal (0-1-2 months) versus infant (1-2-3 months) immunization schedule of PCV7 [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The trial included a control arm not receiving PCV7. All children in the trial received a single dose of PPV23 at 9 months of age. In an earlier trial, a 45% protective effect of PPV against moderate/severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) was found in young children in PNG at the time of an epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; a 50&#x02013;59% efficacy against ALRI mortality [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; and an age-related induction of antibody responses against some serotypes frequently causing invasive disease consistent with efficacy trial results [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We have reported that PCV7 was safe in our neonatal cohort and that pneumococcal serotype-specific IgG antibody titers and T-cell responses measured shortly after completion of the 3 priming doses were similar for the neonatal and infant schedules [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185877.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In PCV7-vaccinated infants, PPV23 induced significantly higher PCV7 serotype-specific antibody responses than in PCV7-unvaccinated infants, with no differences between neonatal and infant groups [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. At completion of the trial when infants were 18 months of age, antibody concentrations had returned to pre-PPV23 levels in the PCV7-vaccinated groups and were comparable to those vaccinated with PPV23 only [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>We now aimed to study the longer term immune protection induced by vaccination with PCV7 followed by PPV23 in these Papua New Guinean children. Since the circulation of pneumococci, including PCV7 and non-PCV7 serotypes, in this endemic setting is high [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], children are expected to develop naturally acquired immunity to a broad spectrum of serotypes. We therefore recruited a group of community controls of a similar age who had not received any pneumococcal vaccination and lived in the same area as the vaccinated study children in order to assess and compare levels of pneumococcal immunity. Since long-term individual protection against <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> may depend on persisting antibody as well as B-cell memory recall responses, we measured serotype-specific antibody responses before and after a challenge with a low dose of PPV23, and assessed the number of serotype-specific memory B-cells when children were 10 months and 3&#x02013;5 years old. Based on the capacity of PCVs to induce memory immune responses, we hypothesized that responses would be higher in children previously vaccinated with PCV7.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study participants and previous vaccination trial</title><p>Recruitment for this study (NCT01414504) was conducted between May 25, 2010 and June 9, 2011, with follow-up of study participants taking place between June 23, 2010 and July 8, 2011.

Eligibility criteria for community controls were: age between 3 and 5 years at the time of interview; children from same communities as PCV7 trial participants; had not received any pneumococcal vaccines; and informed consent obtained. Children were excluded if they were known to be HIV positive or had other immunosuppressive conditions or treatments. Where possible, local village reporters re-established contact with families of eligible children who had previously participated in the PCV7 study, identified new places of residence if families had relocated, and provided initial information and pamphlets about the study. With the help of study families and other community members, local reports identified children aged 3&#x02013;5 years in the community who would be eligible for recruitment as community controls.

How long-term production of antibodies is maintained in humans is not clear, but one suggestion is a continuous turn-over of memory B-cells to replace plasma cells. We found that, regardless of prior pneumococcal vaccination, levels of circulating IgG antibodies against PCV7 and selected PPV23 serotypes were high in all studied 3-5-year-old Papua New Guinean children, with nearly all children having titers &#x02265;0.35 &#x003bc;g/ml and the majority having titers of &#x02265;1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml. Accordingly, numbers of circulating serotype-specific memory B-cells were similar in prior pneumococcal vaccine recipients and control children. At the time of our study, no PCVs had yet been introduced in PNG. We have previously reported that PCV7 vaccination in early infancy has limited impact on overall and PCV7-specific pneumococcal carriage [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Pneumococcal carriage in the vaccinated and unvaccinated population is therefore expected to be high. Indeed, we found that 80% of the 3-5-year-old children carried pneumococci at the time of the challenge, 18&#x02013;35% of which were PCV7 serotypes, with no differences between groups [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. High natural pneumococcal exposure is likely to have induced and maintained pneumococcal immune responses in our study population, with no evidence that prior pneumococcal vaccination contributed to higher antibody responses at 3&#x02013;5 years of age. This is in line with findings of a study in Native American children reporting that PCV7 immunization in infancy did not result in persisting immune memory 4 years post-vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; in contrast to our study, in this community PCV7 introduction had resulted in a significant reduction of circulating PCV7 serotypes and antibody titers were consequently low in both PCV7-vaccinated and unvaccinated children.</p><p>It is important to note that most pneumococcal disease and deaths occur in the first two years of life. In line with other studies, in our neonatal PCV7 trial we have shown that three doses of PCV7 administered in early infancy followed by PPV23 at 9 months of age induce protective antibody responses against vaccine serotypes in most children for at least the first 18 months of life [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While our current study indicates that these pneumococcal vaccinations do not result in higher levels of protection at 3&#x02013;5 years of age compared to children who have acquired natural immunity, vaccinated children will have been better protected against pneumococcal infections than unvaccinated children at least during the first two years of life when the burden of pneumococcal disease is the highest and protection is most critical.</p><p>In this study, we measured anamnestic responses by challenging study subjects with a low dose of PPV23. While this may not induce a similar immune response as a pneumococcal infection, its advantage is that immune responses to 23 different pneumococcal serotypes can be measured. In line with our conclusion that PCVs do not induce long-lasting immune memory, we found that responses to challenge with PPV23 were similar in PCV7-vaccinated and unvaccinated children, with the majority showing similar or higher antibody titers post-challenge to all tested serotypes compared to pre-challenge titers. Since pre-challenge antibody titers were high in most children, increases in antibody responses were modest, and were inversely related to pre-challenge titers. This phenomenon that the relative increase in antibody titers in response to a booster (or challenge) is lower when pre-existing titers are high, has been reported for other vaccines, including meningococcal conjugate vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], a candidate <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> conjugate vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and tetanus and diphtheria vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185877.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although the underlying mechanism is unclear, a feedback mechanism appears to be in place that prevents unlimited activation of B cells above a certain antibody level, which is consistent with other regulatory mechanisms built into the immune system. What this means from a clinical perspective is unclear, and for our study children we can only hypothesize that their high circulating antibody titers will protect them against invasive pneumococcal disease.</p><p>PCVs are effective in preventing the most serious forms of vaccine serotype pneumococcal disease in young children [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; however, the number of serotypes covered by current PCVs is limited, leaving young infants in highly endemic settings at risk of infections by non-PCV serotypes [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185877.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Administration of one dose of PPV23 after priming with three doses of one of the currently available PCVs in early infancy, may provide young children in high-risk settings with additional protection against infections due to serotypes not included in the used PCV, as has been demonstrated in earlier studies in PNG [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This would be particularly important in the first 2 years of life when the burden of severe pneumococcal infections is highest. However, there are concerns that polysaccharide vaccines may lead to immune hypo-responsiveness by triggering the activation and recruitment of memory B-cells to differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells and hence resulting in depletion of the memory B-cell compartment [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185877.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>A study in Fiji reported that children who received 0 to 3 doses of PCV7 and were randomized to receive PPV23 at 12 months, failed to further boost their antibody responses when challenged 5 months later with a low dose of PPV23 [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While responses after the challenge were not lower but similar to responses 1 month after PPV23 immunization, children who had not received PPV23 showed higher antibody levels to PCV7 and additional serotypes in response to the challenge. While this may indicate that PPV23 immunization following PCV priming may affect anamnestic responses in the short term, it should be noted that children maintained high protective antibody titers that often exceeded 1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml after the challenge. Moreover, when these children were followed five years later and given a booster vaccination with PCV13, there was no immunologic evidence of hypo-responsiveness [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A study conducted in Iceland reported that children primed with 2 or 3 doses of PCV9 before the age of 1 year, followed by a dose of PCV9 or PPV23 at 12 months of age, produced lower antibody responses to PCV13 booster vaccination at 7.5 years of age if they had received PPV23 than if they had received PCV9 at 12 months of age [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Whereas the investigators concluded that PPV23 after priming with PCVs had a detrimental impact on the ability of children to respond to subsequent vaccination with PCV13, the observed difference in the immune responses to PCV13 at 7.5 years of age could also be the result of the additional dose of PCV9 at 12 months enhancing immune memory in the non-PPV23 group. Of note, PCV13 booster vaccination was immunogenic in all children, regardless of prior vaccination with PCV-only or PCV followed by PPV23, and most children had antibody titers &#x02265; 0.35 &#x003bc;g/ml against all tested serotypes at 7.5 years of age.</p><p>In our study we found that most children vaccinated with PPV23-only produced higher antibody titers in response to the low dose PPV23 challenge at 3&#x02013;5 years of age than to PPV23 vaccination at 9 months of age. This indicates firstly the development of immune memory in the intermediate period as a result of natural exposure; and secondly that PPV23 vaccination without prior PCV priming did not result in long-term hypo-responsiveness. In contrast, in most children vaccinated with PCV7 and PPV23, antibody titers for five PCV7 serotypes were lower after the low-dose PPV23 challenge than after PPV23 immunization at 9 months of age. However, antibody responses against all PCV7 serotypes were significantly higher following the 9-month PPV23 vaccination in the PCV7-primed group than in the non-PCV7 (PPV23 only) group [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Questioning as to whether it is biologically plausible to find similarly high antibody responses 2&#x02013;4 years later in response to 1/5<sup>th</sup> of the vaccine dose, we believe that the relatively lower response to a low dose PPV23 challenge at 3&#x02013;5 years of age in the PCV7-primed group does not signify hypo-responsiveness, but relates to the high antibody responses that these children produce in response to PPV23 vaccination at 9 months of age that is unlikely to be matched by a similar or higher response to 1/5<sup>th</sup> of the normal dose.</p><p>Use of pneumococcal vaccines in high-risk settings has rightfully focused on early infant immunization protecting the most susceptible age group against severe infections. Yet, boosting of the immune response with PCVs in later infancy may improve long-term persistence of immune memory as shown by a study in France where children vaccinated with 3 doses of PCV7 or PCV13 in infancy followed by a toddler booster dose produced increased antibody titers to a subsequent dose of PCV13 administered at least 2 years after the toddler dose [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, introduction of an extra dose of PCV may not be achievable in low-income settings. Alternatively, a study in Nepal demonstrated that a two-dose prime with a booster at age 9 months (2+1) compared with a three-dose primary PCV10 schedule (3+0) improved antibody persistence through early childhood without compromising antibody responses in early infancy [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While this could be a promising approach that would need further evidence from highly endemic settings, higher valency PCVs or species-wide pneumococcal vaccines are needed to provide broader protection to children in highly endemic settings like PNG [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. PPV23 in later infancy could provide a certain level of additional protection that children in high-risk settings currently lack. The Fijian and our study show that antibody titers remain high following PPV23 immunization and that there is no evidence for lasting hypo-responsiveness.</p><p>A limitation of our study is that our initial neonatal PCV7 trial did not include a study group that did not receive PPV23 at 9 months of age, i.e. was vaccinated with PCV7 only. We are currently analysing data from a second, recently completed open randomised controlled trial in PNG comparing the immunogenicity of 3 doses of PCV10 or PCV13 at 1, 2 and 3 months of age, followed by PPV23 or no PPV23 at 9 months of age (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01619462). Children were then challenged with a low dose of PPV23 at 2 years of age to assess potential intermediate-term effects of PPV23 on the immune response. This will provide additional information on the immunological effect of PPV23 in children primed with PCVs in a high-risk setting. Another limitation of our study is the lower number of children in the PPV23-only group that could be recruited for the low-dose PPV23 challenge follow-up study; while we cannot identify a reason for the lower recruitment, the relatively low number of children in this group has meant low statistical power for certain analyses such as comparing antibody responses at the different time points.</p><p>In summary, we found that in a highly endemic setting like PNG natural pneumococcal exposure leads to the induction of naturally acquired immunity that is as high at age 3&#x02013;5 years as in children vaccinated in infancy with pneumococcal vaccines. Finally, we found no evidence that immunization with PPV23 after PCV priming in the first year of life results in hypo-responsiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185877.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Generalised estimating equation model coefficient estimates of the association of pre-challenge serotype-specific antibody concentrations with PPV23 vaccination status, gender and age prior to challenge.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185877.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185877.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Generalised estimating equation model coefficient estimates of the association between pre-challenge serotype-specific antibody concentrations and PCV7 vaccination status, gender and age prior to challenge for those children vaccinated with PPV23 at 9 months of age.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185877.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185877.s003"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185877.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185877.s004"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185877.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185877.s005"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>ELISA data.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185877.s005.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge the Neonatal Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Trial Study Team [<xref rid="pone.0185877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and especially the study participants and their families.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0185877.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>O'Brien</surname><given-names>KL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wolfson</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Henkle</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Deloria-Knoll</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>McCall</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
