This problem poses an enormous burden on health care systems and has lowered the quality of life of affected individuals substantially. World Health Organization's latest projections indicate that by 2015 approximately 2.3 billion adults will be overweight and 700 million will be obese.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Overweight individuals represent approximately 20% of the adult world population. Postmenopausal (PM) status is associated with higher prevalence of obesity, as 44% of postmenopausal women (PMW) are overweight, among whom 23% are obese.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] PMW has an increased tendency for gaining weight. It is as yet unclear whether the menopausal transition itself leads to weight gain, but is known that the physiological withdrawal of estrogen brings about changes in fat distribution, together with physical inactivity, are probably the major causes of this phenomenon.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Obesity is an independent risk factor for more severe menopausal symptoms. Women with abdominal obesity compared with other women have, high vasomotor scores, personal life dissatisfaction, nervousness, memory loss, depression, flatulence, muscle and joint pains, sleeping disorders lack of energy.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] A sustained weight loss in obese patients has been shown to confer marked health benefits (metabolic and vascular) by various studies existing from western population.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] There is irrefutable evidence of the effectiveness of life-style management by regular physical activity and dietary management, in the primary and secondary prevention of several chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease [CVS], diabetes, cancer, hypertension, depression and osteoporosis) and premature death.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Sibutramine and rimonabant were withdrawn from the market recently. Moreover, no convincing data exist recommending the use orlistat in PM obesity as such. Hence, presently life-style modification at the transition and during of menopause will go a long way in preventing weight gain and related complications during this metabolically vulnerable period.</p><p>There are only few studies[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] available from the western countries but no study is available from India to the best of our knowledge confirming the benefits of life-style management on weight reduction among PM Indian women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in the Postgraduate Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, in a tertiary care teaching Medical College of India over a period of 1 year.

Weight gain <italic>per se</italic> does not appear to be affected by the hormonal changes of the menopause. The fall in estrogen at menopause favors central abdominal fat accumulation. Other factors that may contribute to obesity in women include a low level of activity, parity, lower level of education, a family history of obesity, use of psychotropic drugs and chemotherapy. In addition to the adverse physical consequences of obesity, weight excess is a major risk factor for psychological distress, low self-esteem, depression and sexual dysfunction.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Successful maintenance of weight loss during menopause involves life-style change. The result of the current study is in full accordance with these recommendations. As on comparison life-style modification produced significantly more reduction in weight, WC and BMI.</p><p>Reductions in weight, BMI and abdominal circumference have been associated with a reduction in vasomotor symptoms in overweight and obese women.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The combination of dietary modification and exercise also has positive effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychological health, which may be greater than that from exercise or diet alone.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Improvements in weight, aerobic fitness and psychosocial factors may mediate some of the effects of these interventions on HRQoL.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Weight loss in overweight and obese women improves psychological well-being, HRQoL, self-esteem and health practices.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In addition, dietary weight loss and exercise exert a positive effect over insulin resistance in PMW, which together with a decrease in menopausal symptoms may potentially decrease cardiovascular risk.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The results of these studies[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] are in accordance with our study as per beneficial effects of life- style modification is concerned on weight management of PMW, however the current study did not study the beneficial effects on various other parameters such as quality of life, symptom score and cardiovascular parameters.</p><p>Some of the recent studies[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] are also in accordance with the current study. Dietary weight loss and exercise has been shown to improve body measures and biomarkers of glucose metabolism and inflammation independent of antidepressant use in overweight or obese, PMW in a 12-month randomized controlled trial.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Similarly, caloric restriction, weight loss diet with or without exercise has been shown to reduce biomarkers of inflammation in PMW, with potential clinical significance for cancer risk reduction.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Positive changes in depression, stress and social support have been shown to independently associated with increased HRQoL, after adjusting for changes in weight and aerobic fitness exercise group among overweight/obese PMW.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Dietary weight loss, with or without exercise, significantly improved insulin resistance and older women have been shown to derive as much benefit as did the younger PMW in one of the recent study.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The results of the present study are in accordance to our study, however our study was only planned to see the benefits on weight, BMI and WC among PM obese/overweight Indian women.</p><p>Thus, physical exercise and dietary changes are absolutely essential in the treatment of obesity particularly when existing literature fails to recommends the use of drugs for the effective and safe management of PM obesity.</p><p>There are few limitations of the study. First, it is a short-term study with less number of patients and effect of small sample size cannot be ruled out on results of the study as power of the study was not calculated before resuming the current study. Thus, the highly encouraging results noticed in the current study need to be validated in larger Indian population. No biochemical markers, effects on menopausal symptoms, CVS parameters and impact on quality of life as a result of weight reduction were studied. Furthermore, highly motivated population included in the study retained these effects on long-term or not remains to be seen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"
