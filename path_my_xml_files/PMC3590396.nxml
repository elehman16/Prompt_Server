Biochemistry needs to be taught and learned effectively in the context of the disease or a medical problem to facilitate the transfer of this knowledge in terms of diagnosis and treatment of the patients once they graduate and practice in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>).</p><p>Saveetha Medical College and Hospital was established in 2008, with an aim to provide quality medical education by adopting and implementing the active and self &#x02013; directed learning strategies in its curriculum. The first batch of medical students was admitted during the academic year 2008&#x02013;2009, and like in other medical schools in India, biochemistry is taught through didactic lectures. Since the institution was determined to change the teaching from passive to active learning, during the academic year 2008&#x02013;2009, a study was conducted among the first-year MBBS students to see the effect of integrated teaching with case-based learning (CBL) in biochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>). It was evident from the results of this study that the CBL improved learning gains as compared to the traditional curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>). It was also observed that the students were able to formulate the learning objectives, were able to take responsibility for their own learning, and were able to gain knowledge by virtue of case scenarios used in the CBL strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>). Despite the CBL, students were unable to organize and integrate information and relate and link the basics of clinical biochemistry to medical problems. This is the most important lacuna that we have identified, and we strongly felt the need for the introduction of another innovative tool in combination with the clinical cases to fill this gap.</p><p>In this context, we conducted the literature review to find a solution for the problem identified and found that a few studies in physiology education have emphasized the use of concept mapping as an important tool to facilitate active, self-directed, and deep learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>). Schmidt describes the conceptual framework that promotes deep learning in a study about the Foundations of PBL (1993), where he describes six principles of cognitive learning, one of which deals with &#x02018;elaboration&#x02019; of a content area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>). In concept-mapping sessions with clinical cases, elaboration of the clinical cases promotes the understanding and better retention of a content area. During the past decade, the use of concept mapping in medical education provided a chance for the medical students to improve their meaningful and deep learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>). However, the relevance and the use of concept mapping in medical biochemistry education were not studied and this is the rationale for developing this innovative curriculum.</p><p>Specific objectives of this study are to: 1) design and implement the innovative curriculum consisting of concept mapping with clinical cases, 2) compare the knowledge of the undergraduate medical students in the traditional curriculum with that of the students in the innovative curriculum, and 3) know the perceptions of the undergraduate medical students on the usefulness of the concept mapping with clinical cases in learning biochemistry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The clinical case units consisted of a series of three common medical problems and symptoms, each followed by a set of case-related questions. These clinical case units were prepared as described in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>) with few modifications (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B0001">Box 1</xref>). All current first-year MBBS students (<italic>n</italic>=150) admitted during the academic year 2011&#x02013;2012 attending the biochemistry course were randomly divided into two groups: the ones in the traditional, lecture-based program (<italic>n</italic>=75), and the ones in the new innovative, clinical cases with concept-mapping program (<italic>n</italic>=75). This study was conducted from December, 2011, to May, 2012. Due permission was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee before the start of the study. The 75 students in the innovative group were further randomly divided into groups of five, for a total of 15 small groups. Three units for concept mapping with clinical cases were used for this study. The clinical cases were given to the students for discussion in the small groups, including the preparation of concept maps, all under the supervision of a faculty member. The following steps were adopted for concept mapping as described by Novak and Canas with little modifications: 1) brainstorming stage, 2) organizing stage, 3) layout stage, 4) linking stage, 5) revising and finalizing stage, and 6) gallery walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>). During this study, the same faculty member taught both groups of students, and the students of both groups had the same amount of teaching and learning time. Care has been taken so that both groups have the opportunity to clarify understanding by asking for help from the faculty member. Also, the time lag between the teaching and learning sessions and the assessment for each group was similar.</p><boxed-text id="B0001" position="float"><p>Box 1.
