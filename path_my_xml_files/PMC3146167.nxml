Patients at risk of aspiration, anatomical abnormalities of the airway, anticipated difficult airway, upper respiratory tract infection, history of asthma, allergy to propofol, fentanyl or ketamine, seizure disorder and neuromuscular diseases were excluded from the study.</p><p>After a thorough systemic examination, an informed consent was taken from the parents or guardians of the patients. After fasting as per the American Association of Anaesthesiologists pre-procedure fasting guidelines,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> patients were premedicated with oral midazolam (0.5mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) 30 minutes prior to injecting the test drug. Midazolam (5mg per ml) was mixed with a teaspoon of honey and administered to the patients. On arrival in the operation theatre, standard anaesthesia monitors were attached, which included non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram and pulse oximetry and an intravenous access was secured. Baseline heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were monitored and recorded. Inj. glycopyrrolate (0.005mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) was administered intravenously 5 minutes prior to injecting the test drug. Patients were randomly allocated by a computer generated random table into 2 groups, i.e., Group F- Fentanyl group (n=50) and Group K-Ketamine group (n=50)</p><p>Propofol was prepared in a 10ml syringe with 1ml of 1% preservative free lidocaine. Both fentanyl and ketamine were taken as per the calculated doses based on body weight and that volume was subsequently diluted in normal saline to make a volume of 10ml by an anaesthesiology resident not involved in the study. Inj. fentanyl in a dose of 2&#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> was then given intravenously over 10 seconds to group F<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> and inj. ketamine in a dose of 0.5mg kg<sup>-1</sup> was given intravenously over 10 seconds to group K.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> Each patient was preoxygenated with 100% oxygen for 3 minutes. General anaesthesia was induced with inj. propofol (premixed with preservative free lidocaine) in the dose of 3.5mg kg<sup>-1</sup> given over 15 seconds,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> 3 minutes after the test drug, and the i.v line was flushed with 3ml normal saline.</p><p>Insertion of LMA (whose size was selected on basis of body weight) was performed 90 seconds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> after the start of propofol injection by a blinded investigator. All LMA insertions were performed by the same blinded investigator who also assessed the LMA insertion conditions using a six-variable, three point score which included resistance to mouth opening, ease of LMA insertion and patient response, i.e., swallowing, coughing/gagging, limb &#x00026; head movements &#x00026; laryngospasm.</p><p>Following insertion, the positioning of LMA and airway patency was checked by observing the patient's respiratory movement and the capnography or in apneic patients, by observing chest expansion and capnograph. Any malpositioned or non-functioning LMA was removed, the patient was given a further dose of propofol (1mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and 60 seconds later a reinsertion was attempted. After 3 failed attempts at LMA insertion and lung ventilation, patient's trachea was intubated. The total number of attempts at LMA insertion were recorded.</p><p>Once the LMA was successfully inserted, patients were allowed to breathe spontaneously, if spontaneous respiration was present and adequate. Whenever apnea occurred (defined as absence of respiration for more than 30 seconds), ventilation was manually assisted via the LMA to maintain the arterial oxygen saturation above 95% until regular spontaneous respiration resumed. The presence of apnoea (absence of spontaneous respiration for more than 30 seconds) and its duration was noted. Prolonged apnoea was defined as the absence of spontaneous respiration for more than 5 minutes. Anaesthesia was maintained with 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen and 1% sevoflurane and no further data was collected.</p><p>The parameters observed were: heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>). ECG and SpO<sub>2</sub> were monitored continuously. These parameters were recorded at the following time intervals: baseline value, immediately before induction, immediately before LMA insertion, 1 minute after LMA insertion and thereafter at 3 minutes and 5 minutes. LMA insertion conditions were assessed using six variables on a 3 point scale as follows<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>:</p><p>

However when propofol is used alone it provides less than satisfactory LMA insertion conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> We have shown that with a combination of fentanyl 2&#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> with propofol 3.5mg kg<sup>-1</sup> we were able to achieve satisfactory conditions for LMA insertion, significantly better than with a combination of ketamine of 0.5mg kg<sup>-1</sup> with propofol 3.5mg kg<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p>In our study, the LMA insertion conditions were recorded using an unvalidated methodology based on a 6 variable, 3 grade score proposed by Sivalingham et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> and Cheam EWS et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> We were able to use this score to assess both the ease of placement and the patient's response. We graded 4 fundamental patient responses to LMA insertion, swallowing, coughing/gagging, head and limb movements and laryngospasm. Along with this, resistance to mouth opening and LMA insertion was also graded.</p><p>Limb and head movements were the most frequent of the patient's response that we encountered in our study. Although a large number of patients in both groups showed limb and head movements, the difference in incidence between the two groups was statistically highly significant (p=0.007). The higher incidence of limb movements is probably related to the use of propofol and ketamine as both the drugs are known to cause involuntary movements.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> Previous studies have shown that for the smooth insertion and tolerance of LMA in the hypopharynx the swallowing reflex along with coughing and gagging must be suppressed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> The difference in the incidence of swallowing (p=0.024) and coughing / gagging (p=0.027) between the two groups in our study was statistically significant. This high incidence of swallowing, coughing and gagging seen in the ketamine group is probably due to the fact that pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are usually preserved with ketamine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> We observed no difference in the incidence of resistance to LMA insertion (p=0.0341) and resistance to mouth opening (p=1.0) in both the groups. In our study, the least frequent patient response observed was laryngospasm (none of the patients had any laryngospasm), though it is not uncommon for LMA insertion to cause some transient cord closure. This may be due to high initial boluses of propofol (3.5mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) given in our patients. We found that since the incidence of limb and head movements, swallowing and coughing/gagging was significantly higher in the ketamine group as compared to the fentanyl group the summed score which describes the overall LMA insertion conditions was significantly better in the fentanyl group (50) as compared to the ketamine group (94).</p><p>Although LMA insertion conditions in children have been studied previously by a few authors, we found no study comparing intravenous ketamine with fentanyl. Many different agents have been used to improve insertion conditions but with differing results. In a study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> comparing ketamine and lidocaine spray with propofol for the insertion of LMA in children, the authors observed that overall satisfactory and acceptable results in every patient were achieved only in ketamine 3.0 or 3.5 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> subgroups and that no propofol dose was completely satisfactory; involving either apnoea or airway obstruction. The authors did not use any opioid at the time of induction. Opioids do improve the insertion conditions but have been associated with a prolonged duration of apnoea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> Recently, the effects of ketamine or alfentanil administration prior to propofol anaesthesia on the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) insertion conditions and haemodynamic changes in children were studied.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> It was found that, compared with alfentanil 20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup>, the administration of ketamine 0.5 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> with propofol 4 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> preserved haemodynamic stability and reduced the time to the return of spontaneous ventilation; the conditions for insertion of the PLMA with ketamine were however similar to those found with alfentanil. Another recent study on the efficacy of ketamine and midazolam as co-induction agents with propofol for laryngeal mask insertion in children showed that, the combination of propofol with ketamine or midazolam produced stable hemodynamics and improved LMA insertion conditions but was associated with delayed recovery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> Propofol and sevoflurane were compared for laryngeal mask anaesthesia for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in paediatric patients and it was found that sevoflurane, provided shorter induction and faster recovery times than IV propofol for LMA anaesthesia in children undergoing MRI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></p><p>As in our study Goh PK et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> also compared LMA insertion conditions using fentanyl and ketamine with propofol but in adults and reported a much higher incidence of cases requiring additional propofol for successful insertion. Twenty three percent of patients in the fentanyl group and 10% patients in the ketamine group required an additional bolus of propofol. This may have been due to a lower dose of fentanyl (1&#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup>) used in their study. They also reported a higher incidence of head and limb movements with the use of ketamine (40%) as compared to fentanyl (16%) although the incidence was less than what we observed. In contrast to our study the authors have reported an incidence of 10% of coughing/gagging in both fentanyl and ketamine group. Similar to our results, other authors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> have also reported lower incidence of coughing/ gagging with the use of fentanyl. Goh PK et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> have reported a higher resistance than ours to LMA insertion and mouth opening in the fentanyl group and a lower incidence in ketamine group (16.7% vs 3.3% and 50% vs 36.6%, respectively). This difference probably has resulted because we used a higher dose of both propofol and fentanyl as compared to them. Various other authors have also similarly reported a much higher incidence of resistance to mouth opening with the use of fentanyl.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> Further more Goh PK et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> reported a 6.6% incidence of laryngospasm in the fentanyl group, but none in the ketamine group and their summed insertion score was similar in both the fentanyl and ketamine groups.</p><p>In a study by Sayyid SMS et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> a combination of sevoflurane-propofol for induction was associated with a higher incidence of successful LMA insertion at the first attempt (93.5%) than with either sevoflurane (46%) or propofol alone (61.5%) (p &#x0003c; 0.001). Cheam EWS et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> have reported a lower incidence of limb and head movements with the use of fentanyl (42%) as compared to mivacurium (56%) and demonstrated that the summed score was only slightly better in the mivacurium group, as compared to fentanyl group.</p><p>Statistically, a highly significant difference was seen in the incidence of apnoea (lasting &#x0003e;30 seconds) between the 2 groups (p=0.002) in our study. This is to be expected because fentanyl given as an intravenous bolus is known to cause apnoea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> However, in our study the incidence of prolonged apnoea (&#x0003e;5 minutes) was slightly higher in the ketamine group as compared to the fentanyl group (14% vs 12% patients). The incidence of apnoea in our study is comparable to that reported by Goh PK et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, although the dose of fentanyl used in our study was 2&#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> as compared to 1&#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup>used by them. They have reported a higher incidence of prolonged apnoea in the fentanyl group (23.3%) as compared to the ketamine group (6.3%).</p><p>In the present study the baseline measurements of heart rate (p=0.264), systolic blood pressure (p=0.219), diastolic blood pressure (p=0.95) and mean arterial pressure (p=0.394) were similar in both the groups. The patients in the ketamine group showed an elevation of heart rate from the baseline value, whereas decreased heart rate was a feature of the fentanyl group. The indirect sympathomimetic effect of ketamine on the sinus node may be the possible mechanism for an increase in heart rate. We also observed consistently higher systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean blood pressure in the ketamine group as compared to the fentanyl group. Our results are similar to those of Goh PK et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> who found higher HR and higher systolic and mean blood pressures in the ketamine group-propofol group than the fentanyl-propofol or propofol alone group. In a recent study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> the authors showed a significantly greater decrease in SBP when propofol was used alone for induction than when a combination of propofol and ketamine was used for LMA insertion in children.</p><p>To conclude our study has shown that the summed score describing the overall LMA insertion conditions was better in the fentanyl group as compared to the ketamine group. Although resistance to mouth opening and resistance to LMA insertion was comparable in both the groups, swallowing, coughing/gagging and limb/head movements were significantly more in the ketamine group as compared to fentanyl group. Incidence of apnoea was higher in the fentanyl group; however the duration of apnoea was slightly prolonged in the ketamine group. The HR, SBP, DBP, and MAP were consistently higher in the ketamine group as compared to the fentanyl group. Therefore the combination of fentanyl (2&#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup>) and propofol (3.5mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) provides better conditions for LMA insertion in children than a combination of ketamine (0.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and propofol (3.5mg kg<sup>-1</sup>).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brain</surname><given-names>AIJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Mc Ghee</surname><given-names>TD</given-names></name><name><surname>Mc Ateer</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Abu-Saad</surname><given-names>MAW</given-names></name><name><surname>Bushman</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The laryngeal mask airway.
