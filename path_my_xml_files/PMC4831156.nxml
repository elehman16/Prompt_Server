However, the developmental benefits of chemoprevention in early childhood are unknown. Early child development was evaluated as a major outcome in an open-label, randomized, clinical trial of anti-malarial chemoprevention in an area of intense, year-round transmission in Uganda.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Infants were randomized to one of four treatment arms: no chemoprevention, daily trimethoprim&#x02013;sulfamethoxazole, monthly sulfadoxine&#x02013;pyrimethamine, or monthly dihydroartemisinin&#x02013;piperaquine (DP), to be given between enrollment (4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;mos) and 24&#x000a0;months of age. Number of malaria episodes, anaemia (Hb&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;10) and neurodevelopment [Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL)] were assessed at 2&#x000a0;years (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;469) and at 3&#x000a0;years of age (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;453); at enrollment 70&#x000a0;% were HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) and 30&#x000a0;% were HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>DP was highly protective against malaria and anaemia, although trial arm was not associated with MSEL outcomes. Across all treatment arms, episodes of malarial illness were negatively predictive of MSEL cognitive performance both at 2 and 3&#x000a0;years of age (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02). This relationship was mediated by episodes of anaemia. This regression model was stronger for the HEU than for the HUU cohort.

Children who had been hospitalized with severe malaria were excluded from the present study because of previous findings documenting the relationship between severe malaria and MSEL performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. As can be seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 143 out of 186 HEU children were co-enrolled from the malaria chemoprevention RCT for MSEL testing at 2&#x000a0;years of age.

This assessment is intended for use in assessing children from birth to 68&#x000a0;months and provides assessment scores for the neurodevelopmental domains of gross motor (up to 33&#x000a0;months), and a composite score for the cognitive scales of visual reception, fine motor, receptive language, and expressive language. This test was designed to be more easily adaptable to resource-limited and cross-cultural settings than the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, considered to be the gold standard of such assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. At the same time, the MSEL has excellent correspondence validity with the Bayley scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The MSEL has been previously administered in local languages to evaluate the neurodevelopmental benefits of a caregiver training intervention with mothers of HEU children in Tororo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The MSEL has also proven sensitive to the neurodevelopmental effects of severe malaria anaemia and cerebral malaria in Ugandan children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Research assistants administering the MSEL in the present study were all psychology Bachelor&#x02019;s degree graduates of Makerere University fluent in the local languages who underwent 1&#x000a0;week of training on the test followed by a month of daily practice testing observation and participation. Following this training and practice period, the head of the assessment team at the study site observed the MSEL administration by the apprentice research assistant and approved the assistant for the assessment of study children contingent on good testing skills and satisfactory completion of an evaluation of MSEL testing skills as observed thereafter on a monthly basis (quality assurance program).</p><p>Socio-economic status (SES) was evaluated in the present study using a questionnaire read to the mother in the local language which asked a series of questions about the physical quality of the dwelling (materials and construction of floor, roof, walls, doors, windows, cooking facilities, toilet facilities), availability of water and plumbing, availability of electricity and sources of fuel for cooking/heating, material possessions such as common appliances, radio/TV, bicycle, dishes, furniture, and books. The mother was also asked a series of questions about the types of employment for pay for her and the father/husband or other adult household members, as well as domestic animals available to the household. The SES questionnaire asked about food security in the way of sources of meat, fish, poultry, agriculture and garden produce. Finally, the SES questionnaire for the present study included a set of questions about daily caregiving practices in the home for the study child (e.g., do you play with the child or read to the child most days? Does the child have toys to play with in the home? Are you with the child most of the day and who is with the child when you are not there?).</p><p>Measures from the SES questionnaire (Caregiving, Food Security and Nutrition) along with clinic-based measures of anemia and malaria illness were included along with maternal HIV status in a conceptual model of child neurodevelopment depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. This conceptual model for the present study guided the statistical analyses described below for the principal study measures and MSEL outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Although in the published findings of the RCT study, the principal outcome was malaria illness incidence per person year at risk (PYAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], counts of malaria episodes were used as the primary exposure variable in the present analyses. This is because the PYAR measure was possibly compromised due to the aggressive treatment course in response to all bouts of malaria, as reported in the RCT study. This included the inclusion of a mandatory 6-week period of parasite clearance verification for each treatment episode for each child. However, substituting the PYAR measure for simple number of malaria episodes did not change any of the principal findings from the analyses described below.</p><p>The principal predictor in the present analyses was incidence of malaria, defined as the number of episodes during the period the chemoprevention was given, and between 2 and 3&#x000a0;years of age after chemoprevention was stopped. The other exposure variable was incidence of anaemia during the study period: the number of incidents of moderate-severe anaemia (haemoglobin &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;gm/dL) during monthly clinic visits during the chemoprevention period (up to 2&#x000a0;years) and during the year following cessation of chemoprevention (between 2 and 3&#x000a0;years of age).</p><p>Primary analyses for the first research question about the relation of malaria illness and anaemia with cognitive development was addressed using linear mixed effects (LME) models. The numbers of malaria and anaemia episodes before 2&#x000a0;years, and between 2 and 3&#x000a0;years of age were used as time varying covariates. Other time-varying covariates included age, weight for age z-score (WAZ) and number of breastfeeding days in a time period. Fixed (not time-varying) covariates included trial arm, HIV exposure, sex, socio-economic status (SES), and number of observation days prior to randomization. Height-for-age z scores (HAZ) was also added to the regression models (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>) but was not included in the final analyses because of collinearity issues with WAZ. Substituting HAZ for WAZ did not change any of our principal findings with respect to the relationship between malaria and MSEL outcomes with or without anemia.</p><p>The assumption of linearity of the relationship between the Mullen scores and principal exposure variables (number of malaria and anemia episodes) was evaluated using scatterplots. To assess the robustness of findings, sensitivity analyses were performed using several cut-offs in the number of episodes. The results obtained from models with categorical exposure variables were not appreciably different from the results from the models with linear effects.</p><p>To assess the effect of exposures and the extent to which the effects of the number of malaria episodes were mediated by the anaemia, three LME models were fit.</p><p>Model 1 related the MSEL scores (one at a time) to time period (enrolment to 2&#x000a0;years, or 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;years), number of malaria episodes and other covariates described above. The number of anaemia episodes was not included in this model to assess the main effect of the malaria episodes.</p><p>Model 2 related the MSEL scores (one at a time) to time period (enrolment to 2&#x000a0;years, or 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;years), number of malaria episodes and other covariates. The number of malaria episodes was not included in this model to assess the main effect of the anaemia episodes.</p><p>Model 3 related the MSEL scores (one at a time) to time period (enrolment to 2&#x000a0;years, or 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;years), number of malaria episodes, number of anaemia episodes, and other covariates. This model assessed the effects of malaria and anaemia episodes over and above each other. To establish mediation, the effect of the number of malaria episodes had to be significant in Model 1. If in Model 3 the effect of the number of malaria episodes was no longer significant, then complete mediation was deemed to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. If the magnitude of the effect of the number of malaria episodes was diminished, but was still significant after the inclusion of anaemia, then partial mediation had occurred. To gauge any effects that may differ according to the HIV status, Models 1&#x02013;3 were run again separately for the HEU and HUU children. All analyses were performed in SAS 9.4.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The subgroup of children from the RCT cohorts (HUU or HEU) who were not co-enrolled in the neurodevelopmental observational MSEL study did not differ statistically from the present study samples on any of the descriptive measures in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

In the present findings, malaria chemoprevention during early childhood is not directly related to child neurodevelopment. However, malaria episodes during and after chemoprevention are significantly predictive of both cognitive and motor development at 2 and 3&#x000a0;years of age. This study is the first to document within the rigorous context of an RCT study that early uncomplicated malaria illness before 2 and 3&#x000a0;years of age can diminish cognitive development in very young African children. Furthermore, this relationship is at least partially mediated by anaemia. However, another form of analysis that might have been used to better understand the mediating effects of anemia is structural equation modeling. Future work could employ this statistical method as well.</p><p>HIV exposure resulted in lower MSEL scores on composite cognitive performance at 3&#x000a0;years of age, especially receptive and expressive language. MSEL differences were observed at 2&#x000a0;years of age only at the 0.05 significance level on Expressive Language (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). These differences may have been due to differing levels of sensitivity of these scales to the developmental effects of HIV-exposure in this setting, depending on which developmental domains blossom most at a given year of age. For example, MSEL language development differences for HEU children compared to HUU children in rural Uganda has been previously observed in the pre-school age years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>It should also be noted that the relationship between episodes of malaria illness and MSEL composite cognitive and receptive language performance for the HEU cohort was more robust than for the HUU cohort in the present study (comparing Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>), when the MSEL outcomes were considered at 3&#x000a0;years of age. Cognitive development risk from malaria and anaemia seems to be greater in HEU children, especially as they enter into the critical preschool-age years at 3&#x000a0;years of age. However, the clinical significance of the statistically significant relationships observed in the present study between malaria illness and MSEL developmental outcomes is uncertain. This is because true Uganda-based norms are missing for the MSEL, and only American-based norms are available for standardizing performance on the basis of age and gender.</p><p>Despite this more robust relationship, the overall number of episodes of malaria illness and anaemia during and after chemoprevention was lower for the HEU than for the HUU cohorts (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This is likely due to the fact that in the RCT study within which this observational study was embedded, the HEU children were maintained on TS while nursing, rather than being weaned and randomized to the chemoprevention treatment arms at 6&#x000a0;months of age as were the HUU children. Both TS and DP chemoprevention significantly reduced the number of malaria episodes compared to the SP and placebo treatment arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Although a significant relationship was observed between episodes of malaria illness and neurodevelopmental outcomes in the present study findings, significant neurodevelopmental differences were not observed among chemoprevention treatment arms, either during or after the treatment phase. This might be partly due to questionable adherence to the treatment arm regimens on the part of the mothers of the children, as witnessed by the results of monitoring of DP blood levels in the RCT trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Chemoprevention treatment adherence was mostly monitored by self-report on the part of the mothers during their monthly clinic visits. Such adherence issues would also pertain to the use of prophylactic antibiotics and micronutrient supplements provided for participants during the study period.</p><p>Finally, socio-economic and educational status can impact on both the reliable use of malaria chemoprevention medications and quality of housing in terms of night-time exposure of study children to mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the previous study of HEU children in Tororo, SES, maternal educational level, nutritional quality, housing quality, and maternal depression were all related to child neurodevelopment independent of malaria episodes per se [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Duration of breast feeding is related to morbidity for both the HEU and HUU children in the study cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These important factors related to child development may not have been equally distributed across chemoprevention treatment arms in this observational study within the larger RCT study.</p><p>The present study findings support other studies with school-age children that conclude that repeated episodes of malaria are associated with poor cognitive scores and low academic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Even asymptomatic positive malaria parasitaemia led to poorer cognitive performance among school-age children at the Tororo study site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Unfortunately, the relationship between asymptomatic positive parasitaemia and MSEL measures of neurodevelopment could not be evaluated in the present study. Whenever children developed a fever and had a positive blood smear the day before or at their monthly clinic visit, they were treated with AL and monitored for parasite clearance following treatment.</p><p>Because convenience sampling was used to enroll the original HEU cohort of 200 and the HUU cohort of 400 infants at 4&#x02013;5 mo of age from the Tororo District Hospital Maternal and Child Health Clinic their birth records were incomplete. Therefore, premature and low-birth weight children could not be excluded and this may have led to developmental delays that could compromise the sensitivity of the MSEL outcomes to the effects of malaria illness frequency and anaemia in the present samples. HEU children in this study area are at significantly greater risk for premature birth and complications, and shorter duration of breast feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These risk factors can lead to developmental delays at measured by the MSEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Maternal depression for mothers with HIV can also affect MSEL outcomes for HEU children, and this was not measured for mothers in the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This could also obscure the relationship between malaria or anaemia and MSEL outcomes in the present analyses and serve as a study limitation.</p><p>Beyond LLIN distribution programmes, little has been done for very young children in Africa to protect them against malaria. In rural households in Tororo District which have been provided with LLINs, children can still have as high as 310 infectious bites per year with a malaria-positive parasite prevalence rate of 28.7&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the present study cohorts, where LLINs and prompt effective treatment were provided, the risk of complicated malaria and anaemia was extremely low. However, incidence of malaria illness was still high with the present standard of care (SP) (malaria illnesses&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;seven times/year) and increased as soon as more effective chemoprevention (DP and TS) was discontinued. This suggests that more is needed in early malaria prevention than simply improved LLIN distribution. This includes preventing malaria exposure for mothers during pregnancy, especially mothers with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>In the longer term, malaria vaccines may have an important role in protecting this important section of the community from malaria. Regardless of the control approach selected, it is important that a comprehensive and aggressive community-wide approach to controlling malaria be incorporated into every public health programme in malaria-endemic regions, as part of the ongoing effort to enhance the health of African school-age children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Early bouts of malaria illness can diminish cognitive development in very young children. These effects of malaria illness on cognition are partly mediated by anaemia, and cognitive development risk from malaria and anaemia seems to be greater in HEU children. This is the case even with children and caregivers who are provided with free and effective medical care and nutritional support in the first years of life. The high level of malaria transmission and the host of other risk factors in such low-resource environments can still overwhelm such medical and nutritional support, even when provided in a conscientious manner in such settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>We will be able to download our de-identified datasets and data definition dictionary from our university data management archive to make them available to other research groups upon request.
