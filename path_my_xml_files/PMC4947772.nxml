Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are a novel management approach allowing ambulatory fluid drainage and are increasingly used as an alternative to pleurodesis. IPC drainage approaches vary greatly between centres. Some advocate aggressive (usually daily) removal of fluid to provide best symptom control and chance of spontaneous pleurodesis. Daily drainages however demand considerably more resources and may increase risks of complications. Others believe that MPE care is palliative and drainage should be performed only when patients become symptomatic (often weekly to monthly). Identifying the best drainage approach will optimise patient care and healthcare resource utilisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A multicentre, open-label randomised trial. Patients with MPE will be randomised 1:1 to daily or symptom-guided drainage regimes after IPC insertion. Patient allocation to groups will be stratified for the cancer type (mesothelioma vs others), performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 0&#x02013;1 vs &#x02265;2), presence of trapped lung (vs not) and prior pleurodesis (vs not). The primary outcome is the mean daily dyspnoea score, measured by a 100&#x02005;mm visual analogue scale (VAS) over the first 60&#x02005;days. Secondary outcomes include benefits on physical activity levels, rate of spontaneous pleurodesis, complications, hospital admission days, healthcare costs and QoL measures.

MPE can complicate most cancers, including 30% of lung and breast carcinomas and over 90% of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Breathlessness is the most common symptom of MPE and is often disabling and significantly impairs daily activities and quality of life (QoL). The development of an MPE generally heralds an incurable cancer with a median survival of 4&#x02013;12&#x02005;months for metastatic pleural carcinomas and mesotheliomas, respectively.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Conventional therapies are suboptimal and patients often have to undergo multiple pleural interventional procedures for fluid drainage. These procedures are painful, costly, can be associated with major complications and require medical visits or hospitalisations, depriving patients of precious time in their limited lifespan.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Talc pleurodesis, a therapy first described in 1935,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> remains the most commonly used definitive therapy worldwide; however, data in recent years have shown that this approach has high failure rates,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> involves more time in hospital<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and is associated with significant side effects.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) is a novel treatment for MPE that has considerable advantages over talc pleurodesis, providing equal benefits, as first-line treatment, in the relief of breathlessness and chest pain,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and offers at least as good improvements in QoL. IPC can be applied to most patients with MPE, whereas pleurodesis is only suitable in those with fully expanded lungs. Significantly fewer patients treated with an IPC require subsequent pleural drainages in their remaining lifespan than those pleurodesed.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> In two randomised trials, patients in the IPC group spent significantly shorter time in hospital than those receiving pleurodesis for the initial procedure;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> reduction of inpatient stay can represent significant savings on healthcare costs. Spontaneous pleurodesis can develop in patients fitted with an IPC, thus allowing removal of the IPC and reducing further drainage costs and adverse events. Recent studies have shown that serious IPC complications are uncommon, with a 4.7% incidence of pleural infection<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and 10% incidence of catheter tract metastases.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Despite the reported benefits of IPC, its use is relatively new and significant heterogeneity exists on practical aspects of IPC management around the world. Opinions are polarised even among world experts in the optimal approach to fluid drainage regimes because of lack of quality data on the subject. The variations in drainage approaches have direct impact on patient care and major implications on healthcare resources and costs.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Aggressive versus symptom-guided drainages</title><p>One school advocates aggressive removal of fluid, usually by daily or alternate-day drainage via the IPC. This approach is the standard practice in many medical centres in the USA and Canada. On the other hand, many centres in the UK believe that MPE care should be palliative and symptom based. Hence, fluid drainage should only be performed if and when patients become symptomatic from MPE accumulation. Drainage is typically performed from weekly to monthly according to individual needs.</p><p>Those who advocate &#x02018;aggressive drainage&#x02019; argue that daily fluid evacuation allows the best control of symptoms and thus maximal exercise and physical activities. It is believed that keeping the pleural cavity dry permits approximation of the visceral and parietal pleura and promotes their symphysis. The resultant spontaneous pleurodesis will allow removal of the IPC and reduce long-term costs and complication rates. Reported rates of spontaneous pleurodesis have varied;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Tremblay <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> reported that up to 70% of those who did not have trapped lungs will develop a spontaneous pleurodesis, whereas in another study of all MPE patients treated with an IPC, a spontaneous pleurodesis rate of 45% (range: 26&#x02013;57%) with a mean time to pleurodesis of 52&#x02005;days<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> was reported. Once spontaneous pleurodesis is achieved, few (&#x0003c;7.9%) required further pleural intervention.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Those who advocate &#x02018;symptom-guided drainage&#x02019; argue that fluid drainage in the absence of breathlessness is unlikely to improve well-being or QoL. Daily drainages involve considerably more time, effort on the part of the patient and their caregivers and consumable costs. For instance, daily drainage will cost 14 times more in time and consumable costs compared with those who drain fortnightly. Frequent access of the IPC may theoretically increase the risks of complication&#x02014;for example, infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The <italic>A</italic>ustralian <italic>M</italic>alignant <italic>PL</italic>eural <italic>E</italic>ffusion (AMPLE) trial-2 is a multicentre, open-label randomised (trial entry) study designed to define if either of the two common drainage regimes (aggressive or symptom-guided drainage) is superior to the other in improving patient-relevant clinical outcomes, especially breathlessness, and their safety.
