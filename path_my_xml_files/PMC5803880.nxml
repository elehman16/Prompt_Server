Obesity is excessive body fat in proportion to lean body mass, to such an extent that health is impaired. Obesity, a serious public health problem, relates to a chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and is involved in the development of obesity-linked disorders including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome.

Chronic periodontal infection is an inflammatory state that is described by a deviation in the microbial environment and composition of subgingival plaque biofilms and accelerated destruction of tooth-supporting architecture that is host mediated.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It has been considered as one of the extremely prevalent worldwide conditions and that it is represented as a leading public health dilemma for both developing and developed society. It abstracts among the ten biggest prevalent chronic infections. Periodontitis is a disease of multifactorial origin. Numerous systemic or local risk factors play a major role in its clinical sequences. Periodontal diseases are also influenced by various risk factors including aging, smoking, oral hygiene, socioeconomic status, genetics, race, gender, psychosocial stress, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and various other systemic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease which signifies that periodontitis does not occur merely as a consequence of plaque deposition but is also coupled with various host factors which could alter the consequence of the plaque on a particular individual.</p><p>Obesity is defined as excessive body fat in proportion to lean body mass, to such an extent that health is impaired.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Obesity, which is considered as a large-scale public health dilemma, is linked to a chronic low-grade systemic inflammation that affords to the evolution of obesity-related disorders including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In the past few decades, obesity has increased substantially among the population worldwide. It is now considered the sixth biggest crucial dangerous factor contributing to diseases worldwide, and it has been suggested that decreased life expectancy in the future may be the result of increased levels of obesity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Obesity, as recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), has been known to be one of the predisposing components to majority of chronic diseases which ranges from cardiovascular disease to cancer.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] A superabundance of energy-dense food and reduced opportunities and encouragements for physical activity have drastically changed the lifestyle pattern of an individual.</p><p>As advocated by the WHO, body mass index (BMI) can be used to measure obesity and categorize it for all adult age groups. The full classification for overweight and obesity, developed by the National Institutes of Health through an expert panel that reviewed data from approximately 394 studies, is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Classifications for body mass index</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-21-229-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Several researches from around the world have repeatedly shown a positive affiliation among prevalent periodontal disease and obesity. Linden <italic>et al</italic>. did not observe an affiliation among obesity in early adulthood and severity of periodontitis at the age of 60&#x02013;70 years, whereas 6 years earlier in a study done by Morita <italic>et al</italic>., it was described that periodontal disease and BMI were positively associated.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Till date, most of the studies which have been carried out related to obesity were among adults and elderly people. An analytical review of Suvan <italic>et al</italic>. noticed a heterogeneity among various studies, where higher odds of periodontitis was noted among obese individual but, no studies where identified among young adults that have evaluated whether obesity directly causes periodontitis.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Hence, it is of great relevance to figure out this affiliation to effectively interpret the early systemic outcomes of obesity among young adults.</p><p>Hence, the need of the present research is to assess the affiliation between obesity (using BMI and waist circumference [WC]) and periodontal health and disease using various periodontal parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A descriptive cross-sectional research was carried out at the Department of Periodontology.

The data obtained were evaluated applying Kappa statistics. The coefficient of 0.86 was constructed, reflecting a high degree of agreement in the observations.</p><p>For each participant, freshly sterilized instruments were used. A total of 100 participants were enrolled in the research. Before enrollment of any participant in the study, all the participants were briefed verbally about the objective of the research. Written information regarding the study was given, and participants willing to take part in the study were enlisted and written informed consent was procured from entire study participants.</p><p>Anthropometric parameters used to assess obesity were recorded that includes measuring of the BMI and WC. BMI was measured as a person's weight, in kilograms, and divided by the square of his/her height in meters. The participants with BMI &#x0003e;30 were considered as obese and participants with BMI &#x0003c;30 were considered nonobese. WC was measured (in centimeter) at the midpoint between lower border of ribs and upper border of pelvis and is divided into two categories using the cutoff points 102 cm for men and 88 cm for women.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] To record the measurements, weighing machine and measuring tape were used. Periodontal parameters including gingival index (GI) (Loe and Sillness, 1963), pocket probing depth (PPD), gingival recession (REC), and clinical attachment loss (CAL) were recorded. PPD was measured from marginal gingiva to the base of the pocket, gingival recession measured from cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the marginal gingiva, clinical attachment loss (CAL) from the CEJ to the base of the pocket, on the mesiobuccal, mid-buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual, and distolingual sites of all the teeth.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The data obtained were coded and fed into the SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, SPSS software by IBM, USA) version 16 for analysis.

With the emergence of periodontal medicine, it has shed light on the association between oral and systemic health and disease. In today's world, obesity has become one of the biggest significant health risks, which is chronic in nature with multifactorial etiology.</p><p>Periodontitis is caused by certain organisms resulting in a progressive destruction of the supporting structures of periodontium. The diseased periodontal tissues yield a lot of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 &#x003b2;, IL-6, prostaglandin E2, and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), which further continues periodontal destruction.</p><p>The exact mechanism(s) through which obesity may influence the periodontal health is still unclear. An affiliation among obesity and periodontitis could be explained by an array of possible likely mechanisms. Overweight participants, especially young participants, have an unhealthy dietary pattern which includes the excessive content of sugar and fat, with insufficient micronutrients. Dietary patterns of such type may increase the risk for developing periodontal disease. Excess gain of fat in early life, that is often associated with increased stress levels, may also play a role in promoting periodontal disease. Diversification in oral surroundings or small grade of chronic inflammation may be due to excess of adipose tissue. As many as fifty bioactive molecules known as adipokines are secreted by adipose cells in obese participants. The adipokines comprise hormone-like proteins (adipocytokines, adiponectin, and leptin) and classical cytokines (TNF &#x003b1; and IL-6).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The increased adipocytes and macrophages lead to the creation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1 &#x003b2;, and IL-6. As the release of inflammatory cytokines is linked closely to a higher vulnerability to bacterial infection, increased production of these pro-inflammatory cytokines increases the host susceptibility heading for the evolution and advancement of periodontal disease.</p><p>Another probable mechanism associating obesity and periodontal disease is insulin resistance. Dietary-free fatty acids accord not alone to obesity but as well as to insulin resistance, by acceptable abolition of beta cells of the pancreas. In turn, insulin resistance also contributes to a hyperinflammatory state which is generalized, including periodontal tissue.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In the present research, the occurrence of periodontitis was greater in obese participants as compared to nonobese participants. These findings are in concurrence with results obtained in a study done by Al-Zahrani <italic>et al</italic>. where it was noted that individuals with a BMI &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> had remarkably greater risk of periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Mean GI score among obese and nonobese participants was 1.95 &#x000b1; 0.64 and 1.29 &#x000b1; 0.36, respectively. The mean GI was found to be greater among obese participants, and the difference was statistically significant with <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005. In a study done by Singh <italic>et al</italic>., he had divided 45 patients into three groups and noted that the mean of GI in Group 1 (nonobese participants without systemic disease), Group 2 (obese participants without systemic disease), and Group 3 (obese participants with systemic disease [hypertension]) were 1.44, 1.78, and 1.86, respectively. There was statistically significant difference between Group 1 and Group 2 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Mean probing depth values among obese and nonobese participants were 5.07 &#x000b1; 0.88 and 3.62 &#x000b1; 0.79, respectively, which was found to be greater among obese participants and was statistically significant with <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005. In the study done by de Castilhos <italic>et al</italic>. involving examination of 720 participants, the author found that existence of periodontal pocket was not affiliated with obesity or WC.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Mean clinical attachment level values among obese and nonobese participants were 5.75 &#x000b1; 1.09 and 4.53 &#x000b1; 1.41, respectively.

Johanne Kongstad <italic>et al</italic>. (2008) found that obese participants had a lower odds ratio (OR) for CAL in comparison to participants with normal weight (OR: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36&#x02013;0.99).
