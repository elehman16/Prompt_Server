This investigator-initiated randomised trial tested whether mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was superior to azathioprine (AZA) as maintenance treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 105 patients with lupus with proliferative LN were included. All received three daily intravenous pulses of 750 mg methylprednisolone, followed by oral glucocorticoids and six fortnightly cyclophosphamide intravenous pulses of 500 mg. Based on randomisation performed at baseline, AZA (target dose: 2 mg/kg/day) or MMF (target dose: 2 g/day) was given at week 12. Analyses were by intent to treat. Time to renal flare was the primary end point. Mean (SD) follow-up of the intent-to-treat population was 48 (14) months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The baseline clinical, biological and pathological characteristics of patients allocated to AZA or MMF did not differ. Renal flares were observed in 13 (25%) AZA-treated and 10 (19%) MMF-treated patients. Time to renal flare, to severe systemic flare, to benign flare and to renal remission did not statistically differ. Over a 3-year period, 24 h proteinuria, serum creatinine, serum albumin, serum C3, haemoglobin and global disease activity scores improved similarly in both groups. Doubling of serum creatinine occurred in four AZA-treated and three MMF-treated patients. Adverse events did not differ between the groups except for haematological cytopenias, which were statistically more frequent in the AZA group (p=0.03) but led only one patient to drop out.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Fewer renal flares were observed in patients receiving MMF but the difference did not reach statistical significance.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>editors-choice</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lupus nephritis (LN) occurs in up to 60% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> and significantly impacts their survival.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Randomised trials performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) indicated that long-term use of a combination of steroids and high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (CY) pulses was superior to steroids alone to prevent renal impairment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Based on these studies, the so-called &#x02018;NIH regimen&#x02019; became the standard of care for LN for three decades, despite its many side effects such as a high rate of severe infection and premature ovarian failure.</p><p>Two different therapeutic approaches have been recently proposed. First, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was shown to be at least as efficacious as oral/intravenous CY to induce a good renal response at 6 months in several pivotal randomised studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Although long-term data are still unavailable, MMF is now widely used to treat LN. A second approach, the &#x02018;Euro-Lupus regimen&#x02019;, consists of prescribing lower doses of intravenous CY for a short period of time followed by long-term immunosuppression with azathioprine (AZA). In a randomised trial, this regimen was shown to achieve results comparable to a high-dose intravenous CY treatment protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> with a very low rate of end-stage renal disease at 10 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Nevertheless, even on long-term AZA many renal relapses were observed, as in other series from the literature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> We therefore designed a randomised superiority trial (the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trial) comparing AZA and MMF as long-term immunosuppressive treatment of LN, after a short course of low-dose intravenous CY, in order to test the hypothesis that MMF would reduce renal relapses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p>Between July 2002 and March 2006, 105 patients were included in the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trial by 27 European centres.

The following variables were taken into account: centre, age (&#x0003c;20 years; &#x02265;20 and &#x0003c;30 years; &#x02265;30 years), gender, previous SLE-related renal disease (defined as a 24 h proteinuria &#x02265;500 mg), previous GC treatment, WHO class (III; IV, Vc; Vd), cellular crescent(s), glomerular necrotising lesion(s), glomerular and/or interstitial fibrosis, serum creatinine (&#x0003c;1.3 mg/dl; &#x02265;1.3 and &#x0003c;2.0; &#x02265;2.0), serum albumin (&#x02265;3.5 g/dl; &#x0003e;2.5 and &#x0003c;3.5; &#x02264;2.5), 24 h proteinuria (&#x02265;0.5 and &#x0003c;3 g; &#x02265;3), European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement (ECLAM) score<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> (&#x0003c;5; &#x02265;5) and diastolic blood pressure (&#x0003c;90 mm&#x02005;Hg; &#x02265;90 and &#x0003c;110; &#x02265;110).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Treatment</title><p>A detailed treatment protocol is provided in the supplementary material. Briefly, all patients received three daily 750 mg intravenous methylprednisolone pulses (days 1&#x02013;3), followed by oral GC treatment given on day 4 at an initial dose of 0.5 mg equivalent prednisolone/kg/day for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, GCs were tapered by 2.5 mg prednisolone/day every 2 weeks, down to 7.5 mg/day at week 24 and to 5 mg/day at week 52. From week 76 onwards, it was strongly advised to taper the steroids further and to stop them if possible. All patients received six fortnightly intravenous CY pulses of 500 mg (fixed dose) within a 10-week period and were then given, from week 12 onwards, AZA (target dose: 2 mg/kg/day) or MMF (target dose 2 g/day), according to randomisation performed at baseline and irrespectively of the magnitude of their renal response at 3 months. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were prescribed in all patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria (&#x02265;3 g/day). ACEI were prescribed as the first choice treatment in all patients with hypertension (diastolic blood pressure &#x02265;90 mm&#x02005;Hg).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary end point of the trial was time to renal flare, analysed by survival curves computed, after the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method, on the intent-to-treat population. A renal flare was defined as (i) the recurrence or the development of nephrotic syndrome (serum albumin &#x02264;3.5 g/dl and 24 h proteinuria &#x02265;3 g; this type of renal flare is further referred to as &#x02018;nephrotic syndrome&#x02019;), (ii) renal impairment (&#x02265;33% increase of serum creatinine within a 1-month period directly attributed to lupus and confirmed 1 week later; flare referred to as &#x02018;renal impairment&#x02019;) or (iii) a threefold increase of 24 h proteinuria within a 3-month period accompanied by microscopic haematuria (defined as a number of red blood cells (RBC) per high power field superior to upper normal limit for the local laboratory) and &#x02265;33% reduction of serum C3 level within a 3-month period (this definition of renal flare was only applicable to those patients with low-grade baseline 24 h proteinuria (&#x02265;0.5 g and &#x0003c;1 g); this type of renal flare is further referred to as &#x02018;proteinuria increase&#x02019;).</p><p>The secondary end points of the trial were the number of severe systemic and benign flares (both defined as described in the supplementary material), the number of patients withdrawing GCs and achieving renal remission. Renal remission was defined as a serum creatinine &#x02264;1.4 mg/dl and a 24 h proteinuria &#x0003c;1 g and a urinary RBC count &#x0003c;10/high power field, according to clinical practice in 2001, when this trial was designed. Of note, renal remission was not a prerequisite to receive maintenance treatment with AZA or MMF and could therefore be reached at any time during follow-up. Disease activity was measured by the validated ECLAM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> scoring systems. Patients could be dropped from the trial for any of the following reasons: death, drug toxicity, pregnancy or pregnancy wish, doctor decision, patient decision (consent withdrawn).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Power calculation</title><p>The trial was designed as a superiority trial of MMF over AZA. The primary end point (time to renal flare) was used for power calculation. We anticipated a renal flare rate of 35% at 5 years in the AZA group. We defined the clinically meaningful difference as a 10% renal flare rate in the MMF group. To detect such a difference, 51 patients needed to be randomised in each arm to obtain a power of 0.80 with an &#x003b1; level of 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Survival curves were computed using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method and were statistically tested with the log rank test. We calculated the HR and their 95% CIs using the univariate Cox proportional hazards model. Unpaired t tests, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests and Fisher's exact tests were used as appropriate. Serial data were compared within and between groups by repeated measures analysis of variance, with a &#x02018;between groups&#x02019; and a &#x02018;repeated measures&#x02019; comparison. All analyses were by intent to treat.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s9"><title>Results</title><sec id="s10"><title>Patient disposition, follow-up and drug exposure</title><p>A total of 105 patients with biopsy-proven proliferative LN were randomised into the trial (intent-to-treat population).

Time to severe systemic flare, benign flare, GC withdrawal and renal remission did not differ between the two groups. Drug-related toxicities were similar except for cytopenias, which were more common in the AZA group but were readily controlled by dose adjustments and led to only one patient dropping out.</p><p>Several caveats can be raised. First, MAINTAIN is a relatively small size European-based investigator-led clinical trial with mainly Caucasian patients rather than a large international multiethnic study. Second, it was an open label and not a double-blinded trial. It should be stressed, however, that the primary outcome (that is, renal relapse) was strictly defined on biological grounds and therefore unlikely to have been influenced by knowledge of patient allocation. Third, the trial design can be criticised as we did not request patients to have a significant renal response before starting maintenance treatment with AZA or MMF. This was a deliberate choice as we felt that such a design more closely paralleled clinical practice, including patients even if they did not satisfactorily respond after 3 months of induction treatment. Strictly speaking, MAINTAIN is a comparison of a &#x02018;GC/intravenous CY/AZA protocol&#x02019; versus a &#x02018;GC/intravenous CY/MMF protocol&#x02019;. Importantly, a subset analysis performed on patients who, at any time during follow-up, achieved a significant renal response defined as a &#x02265;50% reduction of 24 h proteinuria, showed similar renal flare rates in the two groups, thereby ruling out a major design bias. Fourth, serum measures of the active metabolites of AZA (ie, 6-thioaguanines (6-TGN)) or of MMF (ie, mycophenolic acid (MPA)) were not routinely performed, leaving open the possibility that patients who failed on one or the other drug were actually underdosed or non-adherent to the medication. This hypothesis might not be too far fetched based on the recent finding that patients who have undergone kidney transplant had a lower rejection rate if MMF doses were titrated according to serum MPA titres instead of fixed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Finally, the decision to design a superiority instead of an equivalence trial placed MMF in a more challenging position.</p><p>MMF and AZA were also compared for maintenance treatment of LN after induction treatment with pulse intravenous CY by Contreras <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Patients included in this trial were almost entirely non-Caucasians and had severe LN. Six AZA-treated and three MMF-treated patients had a renal relapse, but this difference was not statistically significant due to the small number of patients in each group. During the review process of this manuscript, we became aware that the maintenance phase of the Aspreva Lupus Management Study (ALMS), also comparing AZA and MMF for maintenance immunosupression of LN, met its primary end point: MMF was found to be superior to AZA in delaying the time to treatment failure, a composite index comprising death, serious renal damage and relapse of LN.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> Although more data are eagerly awaited before conclusions can be drawn, several reasons for the discrepancy between the results of MAINTAIN and ALMS can already be hypothesised, such as inclusion of patients from different ethnic groups in ALMS, a different trial design (only patients having achieved a renal response at 6 months were included in the maintenance phase of ALMS) or a different primary outcome measure (a composite end point in ALMS). However, the major reason for the difference may well stem from the numbers of patients randomised in the 2 trials (105 and 227 in MAINTAIN and ALMS, respectively).</p><p>At the bedside, other arguments than primary renal efficacy will be balanced to choose between MMF and AZA. First, MMF has distinct effects in vitro suggesting that the drug might be cardioprotective in vivo, a potential advantage in LN given the high rate of cardiovascular disease associated with SLE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Thus, MMF inhibits the proliferation of fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> and its use was shown to be associated with less cardiac allograft vasculopathy compared to AZA in patients who have undergone heart transplant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> Data indicating a cardioprotective effect of MMF in SLE are, however, inconclusive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> Second, the mode of action of MMF, that is, inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, does not theoretically lead to mutagenic events. Conversely, at least part of the pharmacological effect of AZA involves incorporation of 6-TGNs into DNA, thereby raising concerns regarding mutagenesis. In this respect, an increased frequency of somatic mutations at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosiltransferase locus, related to total dose and treatment duration, was recently found in peripheral T lymphocytes of patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with AZA, thereby stressing the potential carcinogenicity of the drug.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></p><p>However, two arguments can be advocated in favour of AZA. First, AZA can be safely used during pregnancy whereas MMF is absolutely contraindicated. MMF is likely a human teratogen based on the unusual distribution of malformations observed among reported exposed offspring (microtia or anotia, external auditory canal atresia, orofacial clefts, hypertelorism, coloboma, microganthia and cardiovascular malformations).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> When long-term immunosuppression is being considered in young women planning pregnancy, this issue needs to be appreciated, as indeed suggested by the trial reported here where patients dropping out for pregnancy or pregnancy planning were more frequently observed in the MMF arm compared to the AZA arm. Second, the cost of MMF is currently 10 times higher than that of AZA. Although the next availability of MMF generics might reduce these costs, it could be part of the decision at the bedside.</p><p>In conclusion, there were fewer renal flares seen in the MMF-treated patients but this did not reach statistical significance and we were not able to demonstrate the superiority of MMF over AZA. However, the data from the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trial suggest that at least two drugs are available for long-term use in patients with LN, with a reasonable efficacy and an excellent toxicity profile. The possibility that some patients who fail on one immunosuppressant could be successfully rescued by switching to the other was not addressed in this study, but is in a very reasonable consideration. A welcome step forward would consist of a priori identification of those patients who will respond to one or to the other drug, as well as the search for even more effective maintenance therapies. In this respect, the place of targeted treatment with biologicals clearly needs further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are most grateful to Jean-Pierre Cosyns, for contributing to the renal pathology analyses, to Yves Pirson and Michel Jadoul, for many interesting discussions and to Jacques Jamart for help in the randomisation procedure.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p>The members of the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trial group are the coauthors and: Daniel Abramowicz, Nephrology Department, H&#x000f4;pital Erasme, Universit&#x000e9; Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; Fabiola Atzeni, Unita Operativa di Reumatologia, Ospedale Luigi Sacco, Milan, Italy; Maria Giovanna Danieli, Istituto di Clinica Medica Generale, Universia Degli Study di Ancona, Torrette di Ancona, Italy; Luc De Clercq, Rheumatology Department, Sint-Augustinus Ziekenhuis, Wilrijk, Belgium; Filip de Keyser, Rheumatology Department, UZ Gent, University of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; Michel Delahousse, Service de Nephrologie, H&#x000f4;pital Foch, Paris, France; Gerard Espinosa, Department of Autoimmune Diseases, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; Marc Golstein, Service de Rheumatologie, Cliniques Saint-Jean, Brussels, Belgium; Marco Hirsch, Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg; Alexandre Karras, Service de N&#x000e9;phrologie, H&#x000f4;pital Europ&#x000e9;en Georges Pompidou, Paris, France; Philippe Lang, Nephrology Department, H&#x000f4;pital Henri Mondor, Cr&#x000e9;teil, France; Martine Marchal, Service de N&#x000e9;phrologie, H&#x000f4;pital de Tivoli, La Louvi&#x000e8;re, Belgium; Antonio Marinho, Clinical Immunology Unit, Hospital Santo Antonio, ICBAS, Porto, Portugal; Regina Max, Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; Patrick Peeters, Nephrology Department, UZ Gent, University of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; Peter Petera, Zentrum f&#x000fc;r Diagnostik und Therapie rheumatischer Erkrankungen, Krankenhaus Lainz, Wien, Austria; Thomas Qu&#x000e9;meneur; Centre Hospitalier R&#x000e9;gional Universitaire de Lille, Lille, France; Frank Raeman, Rheumatology Department, Jan Palfijn Hospital, Merksem, Belgium; Piercarlo Sarzi-Puttini, Unita Operativa di Reumatologia, Ospedale Luigi Sacco, Milan, Italy; Lucia Valiente de Santis, General Internal Medicine, Hospital Regional Universitario Carlos Haya, Malaga, Spain; Luc Verresen, Nephrology Department, Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Genk, Belgium; Laurence Weiss, D&#x000e9;partement d'Immunologie, H&#x000f4;pital Europ&#x000e9;en Georges Pompidou, Paris, France; Ren&#x000e9; Westhovens, Rheumatology Department, UZ Gasthuisberg, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Patient consent</bold> Obtained.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethics approval</bold> This study was conducted with the approval of the Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universit&#x000e9; Catholique de Louvain, Belgium.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests</bold> None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Provenance and peer review</bold> Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cameron</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name></person-group> <article-title>Lupus nephritis.</article-title><source>J Am Soc Nephrol</source><year>1999</year>;<volume>10</volume>:<fpage>413</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>24</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10215343</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cervera</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Khamashta</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Font</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group> <article-title>Morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus during a 10-year period: a comparison of early and late manifestations in a cohort of 1,000 patients.</article-title><source>Medicine (Baltimore)</source><year>2003</year>;<volume>82</volume>:<fpage>299</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>308</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14530779</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="R3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Austin</surname><given-names>HA</given-names><suffix>3rd</suffix></name><name><surname>Klippel</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Balow</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><etal/></person-group> <article-title>Therapy of lupus nephritis.
