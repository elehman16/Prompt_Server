Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is a standard of care therapy for UBC in both the palliative first-line setting of advanced/metastatic disease and for radical neoadjuvant treatment of localised muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Globally, the most common regimen is either a doublet combination with gemcitabine (GC) or in combination with methotrexate, vinblastine and doxorubicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Attempts to replace cisplatin as a component of chemotherapy regimens, for example, with carboplatin, have been unsuccessful in terms of reduced efficacy in UBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For metastatic disease, GC results in a median survival and time to progressive disease of approximately 14 and 7 months, respectively. Cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, prior to either radical cystectomy or radical radiotherapy for MIBC, adds an absolute survival advantage of 5&#x02013;6% to overall cure rates, averaged across T stages at approximately 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Cisplatin resistance remains a critical barrier to therapeutic advance in UBC. For example, in a key randomised trial comparing cisplatin-based regimens for advanced disease, 17% of patients had primary refractory disease and, by 3 years, only 13% were alive and free from progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Progression or relapse of UBC following cisplatin-based chemotherapy is associated with a dismal prognosis. For patients receiving second-line palliative chemotherapy or immunotherapy, after a prior platinum-based regimen, the median survival is consistently under 1 year with a median progression-free survival in the range of 2 to 5 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recent data for second line use of palliative immunotherapy with the programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor pembrolizumab has established a modest improvement in median overall survival of 10.3 months for the pembrolizumab group compared to 7.4 months in the chemotherapy arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To date, no biomarker-directed stratified treatment strategy has been established for use in UBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Taken as a whole, the data available for MIBC and metastatic UBC outcomes imply a pressing unmet need for improvements to what is currently achieved with systemic therapy.</p><p id="Par24">Altered gene expression in cancer may arise through structural genomic changes, such as gene mutation or loss/gain of chromosomal content, or through reversible changes in the regulation and expression of genes. The latter, known as epigenetic control, includes biochemical modifications to the histone proteins adjacent to chromatin, and to DNA itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. To date, DNA methylation at CpG di-nucleotides is the best studied epigenetic change in cancer. In general, there is a dysregulation of CpG methylation in cancerous cells that can lead to genomic instability and activation of previously silent oncogenes or silencing of tumour suppressor genes. In UBC, many genes are affected by promoter hypermethylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Reversal of this hypermethylation through DNA methyltransferase inhibition, or siRNA approaches, allows tumour suppressor gene re-expression and therefore holds promise as a potential anti-cancer therapy. Pre-clinical data from a variety of sources has shown that a strategy to combine a DNA demethylating agent with platinum-based chemotherapy might improve on current outcomes for UBC. These data indicate that, in addition to single agent activity, demethylating agents synergise with cisplatin and are able to circumvent cisplatin resistance in experimental models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Data also exist to support investigation of a DNA hypomethylating agent with gemcitabine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">SGI-110 (guadecitabine, Astex Pharmaceuticals) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor composed of a dinucleotide of decitabine and deoxyguanosine formulated for subcutaneous injection. SGI-110 is in clinical development for a range of haematological and solid malignancies and is currently under investigation in phase I to III clinical trials. In a first in human phase I study, a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily &#x000d7; 5 in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome but was not reached in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. DNA demethylation was found to reach a plateau at 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and this was designated as the biologically effective dose and recommended for phase II development. The most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and sepsis. Clinical responses to treatment were seen in some patients and confirmed in a subsequent phase II trial leading to an ongoing phase III study in acute myeloid leukaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Decitabine and guadecitabine have been successfully combined with carboplatin with acceptable toxicity, epigenetic re-sensitisation and suggestion of a clinical benefit in heavily pre-treated ovarian cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] (Matulonis UA, Oza A, Alvarez-Secord A, et al., unpublished observations).
