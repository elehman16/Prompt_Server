Nevertheless, for the most common dental diseases, caries, and periodontitis there is a widespread demand for the preventive strategies aimed at the individual or the population.</p><p>At the core of this preventive foundation is oral hygiene and plaque control. The area of oral hygiene has undergone recent developments that have turned a mundane participant into a field of surprising growth and research. Oral care regimens have included the cleansing of the teeth and gingiva with various implements and ingredients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Mechanical methods of plaque control are the most widely accepted techniques for plaque removal. Chemotherapeutics is a broad term encompassing agents that may affect microorganisms, hard and soft tissues in the oral cavity. Mouthrinsing is one of the routes of administration of antiplaque and antimicrobial agents. Beginning in the 1960's, the preventive and therapeutic studies of oral antimicrobials began to shift toward fluorides and chlorhexidine digluconate compounds for prevention and control of dental diseases.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>A natural, noncaloric sweetener stevia has recently received much interest for use in oral hygiene products as it is proved to be potent antimicrobial without local side effects. However, there is less literature regarding the usage of Stevia. The probable reason may be lack of economical interest in finding a healthy substitute for sugar. In this perspective, the present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of Stevia as a daily mouthrinse among 12&#x02013;15-year-old schoolchildren in Nellore District, Andhra Pradesh.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>A randomized, controlled, triple blind, parallel repeated measure study was carried out between January 2014 and August 2014, among female children aged 12&#x02013;15 years selected from secondary school of Nellore city, Andhra Pradesh.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Source of data</title><p>The source of data was primary in nature, and it was obtained through clinical examination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study was carried out in the government school which was selected from the nearby locality of the Nellore city. Since this study was a clinical trial spread over a period of 6 months (January 2014 to August 2014) maintaining the interest of proximity and feasibility B. V.

Permission was obtained from the headmistress of the school to conduct the study in school premises. Purpose of the study was explained to the headmistress and parents/guardians of the children. The informed consent was obtained from their parents/guardians and the headmistress of the respective school.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Training and calibration exercises</title><p>Before starting the trial, multiple sessions of training for the assessment of clinical parameters were performed with a calibrated professional in the Department of Public Health Dentistry, Narayana Dental College and Hospital. After the examiner was trained according to the calibrated professional's criteria, the intraexaminer reproducibility was assessed using kappa statistics for plaque index (PlI), GI, International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS). The kappa value for PlI, GI, and ICDAS was 0.78 which was stated as acceptable.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Pilot study</title><p>A pilot study was conducted before the main study among 27 participants to standardize the methodology with diagnostic instruments and criteria, data recording, mouthrinsing procedure.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Sampling procedure</title><p>The sample size was estimated based on the previous reported literature of stevia and chlorhexidine conducted by Zanela <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and Slavutzky [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] which revealed the percentage plaque score reduction between the stevia and chlorhexidine as 82% and 41.2%, respectively.

Narayana Pharmacy College was approached with a request to prepare daily the required quantity of mouthrinses containing 0.2% chlorhexidine, 0.05% sodium fluoride, and 10% stevia and placebo, in a precoded assignment, namely Group A, Group B, Group C, and Group D. The participants assigned with the particular group code were provided with a mouthrinse of same group.</p><p>The investigator did not know the composition of the mouthrinse received by participants of the respective group. The same was true for the participants and the biostatistician who analyzed the data; hence this, study is triple blinded. Once the study was completed the pharmacist of Narayana Pharmacy College did the decoding of four mouthrinse groups.</p><p>The students were instructed to immediately report any spells of sickness, change in taste perception, soreness of tongue, edema/redness, or burning sensation of the oral mucosa, visible staining during the study to the class teacher or the investigator. Such a finding was duly recorded in the pro forma.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Data collection instrument</title><p>At the baseline examination, a custom-made pro forma was used to record basic demography details.

Further studies for investigation of the effect of stevia use on dental caries are needed.</p><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-18" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements:</title><p>I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Nusrath Fareed, Professor of Public Health Dentistry for guiding me to select this topic and Bhoopathi srinivasan for helping me to in statistical analysis.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mandel</surname><given-names>ID</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chemotherapeutic agents for controlling plaque and gingivitis</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>1988</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>488</fpage><lpage>98</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3053790</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zanela</surname><given-names>NL</given-names></name><name><surname>Bijella</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosa</surname><given-names>OP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The influence of mouthrinses with antimicrobial solutions on the inhibition of dental plaque and on the levels of mutans streptococci in children</article-title><source>Pesqui Odontol Bras</source><year>2002</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>101</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12131981</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Slavutzky</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Stevia and sucrose effect on plaque formation</article-title><source>J Verbr Lebensm</source><year>2010</year><volume>5</volume><fpage>213</fpage><lpage>6</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Silness</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Loe</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal disease in pregnancy.
