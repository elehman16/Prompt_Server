Important risk factors for CVD in women include dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and low fitness <xref rid="pone.0088250-SchenckGustafsson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Childbearing is also associated with risk of CVD <xref rid="pone.0088250-KoskiRahikkala1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088250-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and the metabolic syndrome <xref rid="pone.0088250-Gunderson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> in epidemiological studies. Weight retention from childbearing is one important contributor to this risk <xref rid="pone.0088250-Lawlor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> although changes in body composition <xref rid="pone.0088250-Gunderson2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, lipid metabolism <xref rid="pone.0088250-Gunderson3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and lifestyle <xref rid="pone.0088250-Lawlor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> have been suggested as additional pathways. Overweight and obese women who have born children are a group at risk for future development of obesity-related metabolic disease. Interventions that promote weight loss can potentially mitigate this risk.</p><p>The possibility of implementing lifestyle changes during the postpartum period has gained interest because many women are motivated to lose the extra weight gained during pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0088250-Bastian1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and the responsibility of being a parent may stimulate interest in a healthy living <xref rid="pone.0088250-Bertz1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In short-term studies performed in the US, physical exercise and dietary restrictions alone or combined did not have negative effects on the quantity or quality of breast milk or on infant growth <xref rid="pone.0088250-Dewey1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088250-McCrory1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>The effect of lifestyle intervention postpartum on plasma lipids and other metabolic variables has only been investigated in few studies. Lovelady et al. <xref rid="pone.0088250-Lovelady2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> concluded that there was no effect of exercise alone on blood lipids or resting metabolic rate in normal-weight women during lactation although VO<sub>2</sub> max increased by 25%. However, weight loss was small and did not differ between the exercise group and controls. Stendell-Hollis et al. <xref rid="pone.0088250-StendellHollis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> found a significant decrease in TNF&#x003b1; when comparing Mediterranean-style and MyPyramid diets for weight loss postpartum although no significant between-group difference was found. Thus, the effects of diet intervention alone or in combination with exercise on cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight and obese women undergoing significant weight reduction are not known. These lifestyle interventions would be the obvious therapeutic options to counteract cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight and obese women if supported by controlled clinical trials.</p><p>In a randomized clinical factorial trial in Sweden, we have shown that 12 wk of dietary behavior modification produced a safe and clinically significant weight loss of 9.0% in overweight and obese lactating women that was sustained at 10.0% at the 1-year follow-up <xref rid="pone.0088250-Bertz2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. There was no significant main effect of exercise behavior modification on body weight. Weight loss among women not receiving the dietary treatment was 1.8% and 2.0% after 12 wk and 1 y, respectively. Metabolic changes from this sustained weight loss could be important for women&#x02019;s long term health considering the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and the metabolic syndrome in childbearing women <xref rid="pone.0088250-KoskiRahikkala1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088250-Gunderson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

Interventions resulting in exercise of higher intensity, if tolerated at this time postpartum, are likely needed to achieve beneficial effects on cardiovascular fitness among relatively active women like those in LEVA.</p><p>Blood lipids are elevated during pregnancy and decrease postpartum <xref rid="pone.0088250-Fahraeus1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> depending on the intensity of breastfeeding <xref rid="pone.0088250-Darmady1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Our participants were likely close to their pre-pregnant concentrations of these lipids when our intervention began at 12 wk postpartum <xref rid="pone.0088250-Fahraeus1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A reduction in total- and LDL-cholesterol of 4&#x02013;6% occurred in the LEVA control group during the 12-wk intervention. Therefore, the observed reductions of 11&#x02013;18% in total- and LDL-cholesterol values in the D groups are greater than could be expected from partial lactation alone. Interestingly, the difference in LDL-cholesterol reduction between the D group and controls is about twice that predicted from the difference in weight loss between the groups <xref rid="pone.0088250-Dattilo1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>HDL-cholesterol is known to decrease during active weight loss and increase when subjects stabilize at a lower weight <xref rid="pone.0088250-Dattilo1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This may explain the observed long-term increase in HDL-cholesterol (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) of about 15% (0.2 mmol/l or 4.3 mg/dL) in the D treatment groups relative to the non-diet groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088250-g002">figure 2B</xref>). The positive effect of our intervention on HDL-cholesterol is of special interest because childbearing is associated with a decrease in HDL-cholesterol values of about 3&#x02013;4 mg/dL, with the effect persisting 10 y later <xref rid="pone.0088250-Gunderson3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. A difference in HDL-cholesterol of 1 mg/dL corresponds to a difference in cardiovascular disease risk of about 3% in women <xref rid="pone.0088250-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This suggests that the diet intervention in LEVA has the potential to reduce the risk of CVD in women by 12%. It is also noteworthy that although breastfeeding is known to have an &#x0201c;HDL-maintaining&#x0201d; effect compared to non-breastfeeding, <xref rid="pone.0088250-Knopp1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> our groups not receiving dietary treatment (C+E) but still breastfeeding had a steep downward trajectory for their HDL-cholesterol. Their breastfeeding behavior was not affected by treatment <xref rid="pone.0088250-Bertz2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>When the study started, fasting serum insulin concentrations in our participants were within normal range for healthy adults, although the values were higher in women with a BMI of &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> than those with a BMI of 25&#x02013;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0088250-Winkvist1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, the dietary behavior modification significantly reduced these concentrations both at the 12-wk and at the 1-y follow-up. The effect is likely a direct consequence of the 10% loss in body weight, <xref rid="pone.0088250-Tiikkainen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> which is an indication that the dietary changes made by the women in response to our intervention, if further sustained, could potentially reduce future risk for type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Reductions in inflammation markers have been observed in other studies with weight reductions &#x02265;10% <xref rid="pone.0088250-Forsythe1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Although the obese women in LEVA had significantly higher CRP concentrations than overweight women at baseline <xref rid="pone.0088250-Winkvist1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, neither CRP values nor other markers of inflammation were significantly affected by our interventions. This may be explained by the relatively low concentrations of these biomarkers at baseline, the postpartum activation of the immune system <xref rid="pone.0088250-Groer1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and possibly a low precision in the measurements relative to the sample size.</p><p>Substantial effects of exercise intervention on maximal oxygen uptake in normal-weight and overweight lactating women have previously been reported <xref rid="pone.0088250-Dewey1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088250-Lovelady1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In LEVA, participants reported good compliance with the exercise protocol, but the doubly labeled water method did not show effects of the E treatment on total energy expenditure <xref rid="pone.0088250-Bertz2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. As observed by others, a possible explanation is that the women reduced other daily activities <xref rid="pone.0088250-Lovelady2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Also, our exercise intervention may not have been sufficiently intense to increase aerobic capacity when performed unsupervised. Finally, as our participants were already quite active (8000 steps/d at baseline), increased energy expenditure may not have been feasible.</p><p>This study has several strengths; the most important were the randomized design and the use of state-of-the-art methods for all measurements. The drop-out rate was very low and all 5 women excluded at the 1-y follow-up resulted from new pregnancies. A limitation of this study was the lack of treatment effect from physical activity on total energy expenditure, which limited our ability to draw conclusions regarding effects of increased physical activity level. On the other hand, it is of clinical importance to note that we in line with other studies demonstrate this low feasibility of efforts to increase TEE with exercise treatment. We also observed a trend towards reduced systolic blood pressure from the D treatment that may be of clinical relevance, although our relatively small sample size may have limited our ability to achieve statistical significance. Further, the relatively small sample size may have limited our ability to detect significant interaction effects between the two treatments on several of the outcomes. Finally, our conclusions are restricted to a group of highly educated women with BMI &#x0003c;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>The women who entered this study were overweight or obese before becoming pregnant. This implies that they were already exposed to increased risk for metabolic disease. Their weight status was also important for their risk profile at 12 wk postpartum <xref rid="pone.0088250-Winkvist1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In addition, childbearing per se may increase the risk for cardiovascular disease in women <xref rid="pone.0088250-KoskiRahikkala1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088250-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Here we have shown that this treatment, which led to a 10% sustained weight loss, was also successful in modifying risk markers associated with cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes by reducing waist-circumference and fasting insulin as well as increasing HDL-cholesterol concentrations. The postpartum period thus appears to be a window of opportunity for therapeutic dietary interventions among overweight and obese women that may not only reduce weight-related risks in future pregnancies but also their long-term risk for metabolic disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0088250.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
