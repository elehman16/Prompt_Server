So, for the present study no fixed standards for quantity of menstrual blood loss has been taken, only on the basis of the history of the patients, cases had been selected. Blood loss during menstruation was assessed by usages of vaginal pads.</p><p><italic>Vaginal pads:</italic> A standard vaginal pads (Stayfree Johnson &#x00026; Johnson) weighing (one Pad) 12.200 gms was used during the menstrual period, starting the first day of the menstruation. After the use of each pad its weight was measured on an electrical balance. Thus the total weight of all the pads used in that period was measured. The mean score of the total weight of the vaginal pads was calculated.</p><p><italic>Criteria for diagnosis:</italic> Patients who were having symptoms of &#x02018;<italic>Artavakshaya</italic>&#x02019; i.e. <italic>yathochitkale adarshanam, alpta, yonivedna</italic> has selected.

In <italic>Group U, Arkapushpa taila uttarbasti</italic> 5ml intrauterine administered after completion of the menstruation for 3 consecutive days for 2 cycle.

For Moderate pain 1 score was given in which daily activity affected, analgesic drugs or therapies were needed but not as routine. In severe pain, activity clearly inhibited, Poor effect of analgesics, she can not do even her normal routine work and was to be absent from class or office during menses.

These results show that both the therapies were effective in increasing the duration of menstruation but Group-U was comparatively more effective than others.

Group-O, <italic>Krishna Tila Kwatha</italic> is also very effective in curing <italic>Artavakshaya</italic> because <italic>Krishna Tila </italic> is <italic>Artavajanana</italic>, Group-O gets highly significant result in duration of menstruation and amount of menstrual blood.
