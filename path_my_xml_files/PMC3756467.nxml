Patients completing either of two replicate randomised placebo-controlled 6-month trials received pegloticase 8&#x02005;mg every 2&#x02005;weeks (biweekly) or every 4&#x02005;weeks (monthly). Safety was evaluated as the primary outcome, with special interest in gout flares and infusion-related reactions (IRs). Secondary outcomes included urate-lowering and clinical efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients (n=149) received a mean&#x000b1;SD of 28&#x000b1;18 pegloticase infusions and were followed for a mean of 25&#x000b1;11&#x02005;months. Gout flares and IRs were the most frequently reported adverse events; these were least common in patients with a sustained urate-lowering response to treatment and those receiving biweekly treatment. In 10 of the 11 patients with a serious IR, the event occurred when uric acid exceeded 6&#x02005;mg/dl. Plasma and serum uric acid levels remained &#x0003c;6&#x02005;mg/dl in most randomised controlled trial (RCT)-defined pegloticase responders throughout the OLE study and were accompanied by sustained and progressive improvements in tophus resolution and flare incidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The safety profile of long-term pegloticase treatment was consistent with that observed during 6&#x02005;months of RCT treatment; no new safety signals were identified.

Until recently these patients had few or no effective urate-lowering options to prevent or reverse gout progression. Pegloticase, a mammalian recombinant uricase conjugated to monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG), was developed as an enzymatic alternative for the treatment of patients with gout refractory to conventional oral therapies and was approved in the USA in 2010.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14 R15 R16">14&#x02013;16</xref> When administered intravenously, pegloticase reduces the urate concentration in the intravascular space to below the limit of solubility (6.8&#x02005;mg/dl). The resulting reduction in extracellular soluble urate concentration is hypothesised to favour dissolution of deposited urate crystals, resulting in progressive normalisation of body urate pools and improvements in clinical signs and symptoms of gout.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>

Eleven patients (7%) discontinued pegloticase due to AEs, including seven patients with IRs; six of these seven patients were RCT pegloticase non-responders or RCT placebo-treated patients.

Of note, no RCT pegloticase responder had a severe treatment-related IR or a severe gout flare. The highest rates of severe IRs and flares (26% for both; 6/23) were reported in patients treated with biweekly pegloticase during the OLE study who had received placebo in the RCTs.

The rate of IRs was lower in RCT responders (17%, 10/60) than in non-responders (52%, 26/50) and highest among patients who received placebo in the RCT (62%, 24/39). IRs were rated mild in 27% (16/60) of patients, moderate in 55% (33/60) and severe in 18% (11/60).

The most common signs and symptoms associated with IRs were musculoskeletal pain/discomfort, flushing, erythema, nausea/vomiting, dyspnoea, sweating, headache, blood pressure changes, urticaria and pruritus. All IRs resolved with supportive measures and no patient required intubation, mechanical ventilatory support, pressors or hospitalisation.

Among patients randomised to placebo in the RCTs, biweekly pegloticase administration in the OLE study produced greater reductions in mean SUA and a greater proportion of patients maintaining SUA&#x0003c;6&#x02005;mg/dl than monthly pegloticase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201795F3">figure 3</xref>B).</p><fig id="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201795F3" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Percentage of patients with serum uric acid (SUA) &#x0003c;6&#x02005;mg/dl by study week, uric acid responder status in the randomised controlled trial (RCT) and pegloticase dose regimen.

At the end of the RCTs, a complete response in at least one tophus was reported for 40% (21/52) of patients with tophi treated with biweekly pegloticase, 21% (11/52) of those treated with monthly pegloticase and 7% (2/27) of those treated with placebo. By OLE week 13 a complete response in at least one tophus was reported for 45% (36/80) of patients with tophi at RCT inception. At the final OLE visit (week 125), 60% (56/94) of patients with evaluable tophi had a complete response. Patients with a sustained urate-lowering response to treatment were more likely to experience complete tophus resolution. A complete response was seen in 87% (32/37) of patients in the responder group and in 31% (11/36) designated non-responders on the basis of SUA measurements in the RCTs.</p><p>As prespecified in the protocol, each patient could have up to five measurable (and two additional) target or index tophi. Responses based on the total number of tophi were assessed to complement information on the proportion of patients with tophus complete response. After 1&#x02005;year of pegloticase treatment in the OLE study, 61% (185/302) of all target tophi had completely resolved. Among patients who qualified as responders in the RCTs, a complete response of 70% (102/145) of all target tophi was achieved after 1&#x02005;year of open-label treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s3e3"><title>Gout flares</title><p>Gout flares occurred in 71% of patients (106/149) during the OLE study; the mean number of flares per patient per 3-month period was 0.5 over the duration of the trial. The highest flare rates occurred in 52% of patients (78/149; 1.1 flares/patient) during the first 3-month period. Flare rates diminished with continued treatment in the OLE among patients who were urate-lowering responders during the RCT compared with patients who were RCT non-responders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201795F4">figure 4</xref>A,B). For example, in the cohort of patients sustaining goal urate-lowering on the biweekly pegloticase OLE dose schedule, flares diminished substantially (occurring in 26% (9/35) during months 1&#x02013;3 of the OLE study, 9% (3/32) during months 10&#x02013;12 and 3% (1/29) during months 22&#x02013;24).</p><fig id="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201795F4" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Proportions of patients who received (A) biweekly pegloticase or (B) monthly pegloticase throughout the randomised controlled trial (RCT) and open-label extension periods and reported gout flares (per 3-month interval).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="annrheumdis-2012-201795f04"/></fig></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Pegloticase is a PEGylated mammalian recombinant uricase that was developed to control hyperuricaemia and its clinical manifestations in patients with refractory chronic gout and no other urate-lowering options. In the present OLE of two RCTs,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> long-term treatment with pegloticase was safe and generally well tolerated, especially in patients who had experienced sustained goal range urate-lowering responses during blinded treatment. In addition to maintaining markedly sub-saturating urate levels, these patients showed progressive clinical benefit in gout flares and tophus reduction during pegloticase treatment for an average of 2&#x02005;years in the OLE study.</p><p>Target range SUA was achieved for 55% of all patients at week 25 of the OLE study. This is consistent with findings from the RCTs in which 42% of patients treated with biweekly pegloticase showed sustained urate lowering for 6&#x02005;months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Conversely, patients losing urate-lowering efficacy did so within the first few months of treatment in the RCTs, and urate levels for this cohort remained above target for the duration of the OLE study. About one-third of patients who did not sustain SUA&#x0003c;6&#x02005;mg/dl in the RCTs retained clinical benefit during the OLE study with at least one tophus remaining resolved. However, this finding could be explained by an initial response followed by a protracted period needed for sufficient reaccumulation of crystal deposits to become clinically detectable.</p><p>A post hoc analysis of the RCTs revealed relationships between loss of urate-lowering efficacy, risk of IRs and development of high-titre pegloticase antibodies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Because of blinding of urate levels during the RCTs, the relationship between loss of urate-lowering efficacy and the risk of pegloticase infusion reactions was not appreciated until several months after initiation of the OLE study. As a result, some patients who were RCT pegloticase non-responders continued receiving pegloticase during the OLE study, providing additional information with regard to these relationships. Among patients entering the OLE study, 71 had at least one IR during the randomised trials or the OLE study; 85% of these patients (60/71) experienced their first IR when SUA was &#x0003e;6&#x02005;mg/dl. Overall, these data support the view that the great majority of IRs can be avoided if patients discontinue treatment when, with routine preinfusion monitoring of SUA, levels in excess of 6&#x02005;mg/dl indicate a sustained loss of pegloticase urate-lowering efficacy.</p><p>There are limitations to this study. First, the open-label study design carries both well-documented value and some bias as a result of being uncontrolled.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Second, the RCT protocol called for stratification of patients based on treatment response and dosing schedule. Although this provided the opportunity to follow safety and efficacy outcomes during the OLE study for patients with specific treatment histories, it also resulted in six distinct cohorts, each containing small numbers of patients. Nevertheless, the analyses of OLE study data indicate that patients who achieve treatment success throughout the first 6&#x02005;months of treatment are likely to benefit from sustained long-term urate-lowering by pegloticase with favourable clinical responses. Conversely, patients not sustaining urate-lowering treatment responses to pegloticase infusions should not be expected to have treatment benefits (extending substantially beyond the period of urate-lowering initially achieved) and incur an increased risk of IRs. We recommend discontinuation of pegloticase therapy in such patients.</p><p>A final limitation is that patients were identified by their initial allocation to biweekly or monthly treatment in the RCTs but were allowed to change dosing frequency at two time points upon entering the OLE study. A higher proportion of patients switched from monthly to biweekly treatment than vice versa, however, indicating that most patients were receiving the US FDA-approved pegloticase biweekly regimen<bold>.</bold></p><p>In summary, the safety profile of pegloticase in the OLE study was consistent with that observed in the RCTs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> with no evidence of new safety concerns related to long-term exposure. Efficacy findings further demonstrated that clinical improvements were durable and probably progressive during long-term therapy in patients with persistent goal range urate-lowering responses to pegloticase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="loca-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media xlink:href="annrheumdis-2012-201795-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e589" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all the investigators and patients who participated in the pegloticase trials.
