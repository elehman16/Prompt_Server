Despite evidence of reduced rates of CVD with progressively lower blood pressure (BP) <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and a broad range of antihypertensive therapies <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> to achieve treatment targets, poorly controlled BP remains common <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">[5,6]</xref>. Overcoming resistance to uptitrate therapy <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> to achieve earlier and greater BP lowering appears critical to reducing the risk of hypertension-related CVD events. In order to achieve this in the primary care setting in which hypertension is predominantly managed <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, there is evidence for the benefits of applying a framework, preferably multidisciplinary <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, of increased surveillance and guided stepped-care <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In addition, practice nurses are increasingly becoming an important component of primary healthcare in Australia <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> in terms of supporting family physicians to provide greater continuity of care for those with chronic conditions.</p><p>The Valsartan Intensified Primary carE Reduction of Blood Pressure (VIPER-BP) study <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, a large multicenter trial of a structured and intensive approach to BP management in primary care, reaffirmed the potential to achieve better BP control in a high-risk cohort of individuals with hypertension. The strategy was associated with an adjusted 28% increased likelihood of achieving individualized BP control at 26 weeks. However, despite a standardized protocol for incremental antihypertensive therapy, supported by a user-friendly, computer-based treatment algorithm tool, close examination of treatment patterns from the VIPER-BP study revealed that failure to uptitrate antihypertensive therapy was still common. Given the meticulous nature of data collected, this study provides a unique opportunity to better understand potential barriers to optimal BP control in primary care.</p><sec><title>Study objective and hypothesis</title><p>We studied the extent and determinants of per protocol adherence, from both a participant and clinician perspective, during the VIPER-BP trial. <italic>A priori</italic> and as determined by prespecified criteria, we postulated that optimal adherence to the VIPER-BP protocol would significantly improve the primary endpoint of individualized BP control during 26-week follow-up and result in a greater decrease in BP levels compared to baseline, both within the intervention group and relative to usual care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>As described in greater detail previously <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, individuals routinely managed by family physicians partaking in the VIPER-BP study were eligible to participate if they were aged at least 18 years; diagnosed with hypertension requiring active pharmacological treatment according to guidelines and; consented to participate. Exclusion criteria were as follows: mean initial sitting SBP at least 180&#x0200a;mmHg; prescription of at least three antihypertensive agents; severe renal disease (clinical diagnosis and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate &#x0003c;60&#x0200a;ml/min per 1.73&#x0200a;m<sup>2</sup>); and/or contraindications to an angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or a thiazide diuretic.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>The VIPER-BP study was a multicenter randomized controlled trial that recruited 2337 hypertensive individuals via 119 primary care clinics and over 250 family physicians Australia-wide <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Participating clinics comprised a representative combination of small, independent (one to two physicians), and larger clinics with shared protocols and governance structures (an increasing feature of primary care in Australia). The primary endpoint reflected contemporary Australian guidelines <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> that recommended three different levels of BP control, comprising a lower BP target of 125/75&#x0200a;mmHg or less for those with proteinuria, an intermediate target of 130/80&#x0200a;mmHg or less for those with diabetes or other forms of end-organ damage, and the higher traditional target of 140/90&#x0200a;mmHg or less for all others. Participants were managed within the Australian universal health insurance scheme (Medicare) that provides reimbursed access (the majority of services without copayment) to primary care clinics and subsidized pharmacotherapy. The study was approved by relevant ethics committees (including the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners) and conducted in accordance with CONSORT guidelines for pragmatic trials <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Recruitment commenced in June 2010 with final study follow-up completed in July 2011.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><p><xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> outlines the key features of the VIPER-BP study. Overall, 2185 consenting participants entered a standardized run-in period of valsartan 80&#x0200a;mg/day for 14&#x02013;28 days and were subject to comprehensive clinical profiling. Of these, 416 (19%) achieved their individual BP target and 1562 were subsequently randomized (stratified according to three BP targets) into the study.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the Valsartan Intensified Primary carE Reduction of Blood Pressure (VIPER-BP) study design and treatment pathways.

Participating physicians were asked to manage these participants as they normally would during 26-week follow-up according to national guidelines for BP management <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Notably, 367 participants (70%) in the usual care group continued to be prescribed the run-in dose of valsartan 80&#x0200a;mg/day at 6 weeks despite not achieving their individual BP target, with less than half (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;228, 44%) subsequently prescribed combination or triple therapy by 26 weeks.</p><p>Those randomized to the study intervention group (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1038) were further randomized at a ratio of 1&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;2 to commence valsartan monotherapy (160&#x0200a;mg/day) or valsartan combination therapy as a single pill. Once randomized to combination therapy, physicians chose between valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine. Supported by a computerized treatment algorithm tool, the study protocol called for intervention participants to be reviewed at a series of mandatory visits at weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, and 26 postrandomization, with the instruction to uptitrate pharmacotherapy, as shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, if a participant's BP remained above their individual target. According to <italic>a priori</italic> criteria, adherence to the study protocol within the treatment arms of the study was examined according to prescription of valsartan therapy as per group randomization and then uptitration of therapy if a participant remained above their individual BP target; and completion of prescheduled study BP monitoring and follow-up visits at weeks 6, 10, 14, and 18, with tolerance for &#x000b1;7-day variance. Each visit was individually assessed on this basis with consideration of the reason for a clinical decision not to follow the study protocol (based on Study Investigator notes). For example, off-protocol treatment following an adverse event was still considered &#x02018;per protocol&#x02019; if it was uptitrated in response to an elevated BP. A per protocol score of 0&#x02013;5 was generated for each participant. One point was allocated for correct treatment at randomization and an additional point was given for each of the four visits up to 18 weeks according to correct treatment (e.g., uptitration if clinically indicated) and a visit within the allowed timeframe. A score of 4 or 5, allowing one deviation from the study protocol to account for potential treatment deviation due to an adverse event, was considered as ideal per protocol management.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Continuous data are presented as a mean [&#x000b1;standard deviation and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), wherever appropriate] and categorical data as proportions. Consistent with the primary study outcome <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, between group comparisons of BP control at week 26 were performed using a log binomial generalized linear model with stratification status at randomization as a covariate. Stratification status was fit as a categorical variable with the three BP target groups (&#x02264;125/75, &#x02264;130/80, and &#x02264;140/90&#x0200a;mmHg) based on the participant's clinical profile. Change from baseline to 26 weeks in SBP and DBP was each subject to analysis of covariance with treatment group and stratification status as factors and centered baseline BP as a covariate. Study data were also analyzed using log binomial generalized linear models to determine the independent predictors of protocol adherence (score of 4/5) and achievement of the primary endpoint of individualized BP control during 26-week follow-up (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;988 with an endpoint BP). In the latter model, per protocol adherence was included as a covariate along with a broad range of individual profiling data (including age, sex, and ethnicity) and key characteristics of the primary care clinic (e.g. location, size, and presence of a practice nurse). Where this would not converge, a robust Poisson regression model was used instead. Univariate models were first conducted, followed by a multivariate model. Variables entered into the multivariate analysis were those that were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x02264;0.05) in the univariate analysis. Data were independently verified and analyzed by the study statistician (adverse event) using the Stata 11 statistical package (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Study cohort</title><p>Of the 1562 randomized study participants, 1038 (66.5%) were allocated to the intervention group with 360 (35%) and 678 participants allocated to the valsartan monotherapy and either of the combination therapy arms, respectively.

Using comprehensive data from a large multicenter randomized controlled trial of intensive BP management <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, we prospectively examined the predictors and consequences of greater adherence to the study protocol on subsequent BP control. As expected <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, we found some resistance to uptitrating antihypertensive therapy when clinically indicated, but not typically when participants were close to their BP target. As also expected <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, although adverse events appeared to initially influence prescribing patterns and BP control, they did not unduly affect BP goal attainment at 6 months. Ultimately, it was the level of BP control being sought and level of adherence to the study protocol that most influenced individual BP control. Compared with those who were least managed according to the study protocol, participants in the intervention group subject to optimal protocol adherence recorded a 26-week BP that was around 9/5&#x0200a;mmHg less. Moreover, they were two-fold more likely to attain their individual BP target (even if at the lower target of 125/75&#x0200a;mmHg).</p><p>Significantly, the presence of a practice nurse independently predicted the successful application of the study intervention (including timing and attendance at clinic visits and likelihood of treatment uptitration) and subsequent attainment of BP control. In Australia, as in many other healthcare systems, practice nurses typically assume a combination of clinical and administrative duties <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Despite data supporting a more proactive role for practice nurses to optimize BP management <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, this represents an underdeveloped component of primary care, particularly when considering the evidence in favor of other nurse-coordinated models of care in chronic disease <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">[21,22]</xref>. Successful, algorithm-based interventions <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">[9,10]</xref> to improve BP management have increased potential if there is someone like a practice nurse to implement them. Our observations that larger clinics with shared protocols/governance were less likely to achieve individualized BP control reinforce the need to maintain high standards of care across larger organizations with typically higher volume caseloads per physician <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>At the individual level, three factors independently influenced successful BP control. First, men were approximately one-third more likely than women to achieve the primary endpoint. Although this finding appears to contrast with earlier study findings <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, it probably reflects the randomization of female participants with more persistent forms of hypertension and well described, sex-based differences in treatment response <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Reinforcing the links between a high population prevalence of both obesity and hypertension <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, increasing BMI was also negatively correlated with BP response to treatment. It is known that more obese individuals have increased sympathetic drive <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> that would not necessarily respond to the antihypertensive agents used in this study. We also found that participants with depressive symptoms were also less likely to attain their individual BP target. Given that this condition is also not uncommon in hypertensive individuals, these data reinforce the need to proactively routinely screen for depression in order to optimize adherence and treatment response to antihypertensive therapy. Overall, these data reinforce the therapeutic benefits of individualizing treatment pathways within a structured care approach.</p><p>There are a number of limitations that influence interpretation of these data and their applicability to other healthcare systems and wider clinical practice. As originally described <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, study physicians are likely to represent those most interested in hypertension management and they recruited participants by invitation. The application of the study protocol was facilitated by the Australian healthcare system with health subsidies and copayments for participants. As highlighted by potential variances in the size and nature of practices, there is a degree of heterogeneity in Australian primary care that is difficult to describe and control for; this is one of the reasons for not applying a cluster design. It is also possible that lower socioeconomic or some ethnic groups may be underrepresented in the study cohort. Similar results from an equivalent trial undertaken in Canada <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and a systematic review of the overall impact of structured BP management programs <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> support the validity of our findings beyond Australia. Finally, given the significant findings in relation to practice nurses, it is important to note we did not document their specific role in study management and their precise impact remains unknown.</p><p>In summary, one in three participants randomized to the VIPER-BP intervention was exposed to the optimal level of protocol adherence and this was associated with markedly better BP control. Predictors of greater per protocol adherence and achievement of individualized BP control depended on a range of clinical, treatment, practice, and individual patient factors. These data reinforce the potential to better tailor management to individual needs in order to optimize BP management in primary care. A potentially key role for practice nurses was identified in this regard and further research is required to best translate the evidence from trials such as this into clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge all primary care investigators and Study Nurse Coordinators for participating in the VIPER-BP study.</p><p>S.S., G.L.J., and M.C. are supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.
