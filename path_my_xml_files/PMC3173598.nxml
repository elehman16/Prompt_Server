The study enrolled 50 healthy men who were randomized to receive sequences of single doses of dapagliflozin 150 mg, dapagliflozin 20 mg, moxifloxacin 400 mg, and placebo. The sequences were randomized based on the Williams design for a cross-over study to reduce the &#x0201c;carryover&#x0201d; effects from drug-to-drug even with sufficient washout periods. Digital 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded at nine time points over 24 hours in each period.

Given the potential for extensive exposure and continued therapy, investigational drugs for T2DM demand rigorous evaluation for potential long-term safety concerns, including potential effects on cardiac repolarization. Delayed ventricular repolarization, as measured by a prolonged QT interval, has been associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></p><p>Dapagliflozin is a first-in-class oral, oncedaily, potent, and highly selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor being developed for the treatment of T2DM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref> Treatment with dapagliflozin promotes urinary glucose excretion by preventing up to 50% of the filtered glucose from being reabsorbed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref> Thus, by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, SGLT2 inhibition provides a mechanism for improving glycemic control in patients with T2DM that is independent of insulin secretion or insulin action.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin have been assessed in both healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref> Dapagliflozin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, has a terminal elimination half-life (t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) of approximately 16 hours, and is primarily metabolized by UGT1A9 to an inactive O-glucuronide that is eliminated renally.

Treatment sequences were randomized based on the Williams design for a cross-over study to reduce the potential &#x0201c;carryover&#x0201d; effects from drug to drug even with sufficient washout periods.</p><p>Subjects were screened within 21 days of randomization. Each subject received the following four treatments, administered in the order prescribed by the sequence to which the subject had been randomly assigned: Treatment A, dapagliflozin 150 mg; Treatment B, dapagliflozin 20 mg; Treatment C, over encapsulated moxifloxacin 400 mg; and Treatment D, placebo. Subjects underwent a 10-hour fast before dosing, and no food was allowed until 4 hours afterward. Each dose was administered with 240 mL of water.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Safety</title><p>Subjects were confined to the clinical research unit for 72 hours after dosing. Vital signs, 12-lead safety ECG, physical examinations, and safety laboratory analyses involving routine hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis were obtained throughout the study and at a follow-up examination 5&#x02013;7 days after the last treatment period.

From the 0&#x02013;3 hour recording, 5 minute recordings were selected at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 hours. Thereafter, 5 minute recordings were taken at 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing. All dECG measurements were obtained just before blood draws for pharmacokinetic assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Determination of Digital Electrocardiogram Parameters</title><p>The following dECG variables were reported: RR interval, PR interval, QRS interval, QT<sub>tang</sub> interval, and QT interval corrected for heart rate using a study-specific factor (QTcX), QTcF, and Bazett&#x02019;s correction (QTcB). Ten-second dECGs were extracted every 30 seconds from the predefined 5-minute continuous recording. The extracted data were averaged to arrive at a mean for each time point. The QT<sub>tang</sub> interval is the QT interval measured by Eclysis&#x000ae; from the beginning of the Q wave to the intercept between the isoelectric line and the regression line, derived on the T-wave downstroke for values between 80% and 20% of the T-top amplitude.</p><p>The primary variable was QTcX, which was derived from the dECG using a study-specific correction factor. QTcX was calculated by the equation QTcX=QT<sub>tang</sub>/RR<sup><italic>b</italic></sup>, with the QT<sub>tang</sub> interval expressed in milliseconds and the RR interval in seconds.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref> The correction factor <italic>b</italic> was estimated using a linear mixed-effect model with volunteer as a random effect. The dependency between the QT<sub>tang</sub> interval and the RR interval was assumed to be described by:

AUC was determined using the linear trapezoidal rule, while C<sub>max</sub> and tmax were determined by visual inspection of the plasma concentration versus time curve. The t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> was calculated as 0.693/&#x003bb;z, where &#x003bb;z was the terminal elimination rate constant derived from the log-linear regression of the terminal portion of the plasma concentration versus time curve.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Bioanalytical Methods</title><p>Assays for plasma concentrations of dapagliflozin and BMS-801576 were performed by ATLANBIO (Saint-Nazarine, France) using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry detection. The between-run variability and within-run variability for the analytical quality controls of dapagliflozin were 0.0% and &#x02264;8.7%, respectively, for the coefficient of variation, with deviations from the nominal concentrations of &#x000b1;3.6%.

All one-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) needed to be &#x0003c;10 ms at each of the nine time points examined. Assuming a drug effect of 2 ms and a standard deviation of within-subject changes from baseline (&#x00394;QTc) of 8.5 ms, 36 subjects were required for 90% power for each of the nine time points to be &#x0003c;10 ms. The QTcX analysis set consisted of all volunteers who had data available for all four periods, including the baseline.</p><p>Three different contrasts (dapagliflozin 150 mg vs. placebo; dapagliflozin 20 mg vs. placebo; and moxifloxacin 400 mg vs. placebo) were estimated in the same model. The QTcX at time points 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours was analyzed by repeated measures analysis of covariance. The treatment effect of dapagliflozin with its upper bound of a two-sided 90% CI was evaluated against the margin of 10 ms at each of the nine time points.</p><p>To test for assay sensitivity, a linear contrast comparing moxifloxacin versus placebo from the primary analysis model on mean QTcX over 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after dosing was analyzed. A two-sided 90% CI was constructed for this mean time period. The lower bound of the two-sided 90% CI was evaluated against the threshold of 5 ms.</p><p>The QT versus dapagliflozin concentration analysis used a linear mixed-effect model. The null hypothesis of zero-slope was tested with a two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test at the 5% significance level. If the slope was significant, the predicted &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcX and its corresponding upper 90% two-sided CI bound were to be computed at the C<sub>max</sub> of the therapeutic dose of dapagliflozin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 50 healthy men were randomized and received study drug.

One subject experienced a serious AE, a transient ischemic attack, approximately 8 days after receiving moxifloxacin in the final period. This AE was not considered by the investigator to be drug related.</p><p>Nineteen subjects had AEs during the study, including nine subjects after dapagliflozin administration. Headache was the only AE reported by more than one subject after dapagliflozin administration, occurring in three and two subjects who received the 150 mg and 20 mg dose, respectively. Other AEs reported after administration of dapagliflozin 150 mg were conjunctivitis, diarrhea, myalgia, pharyngeal pain, and tinea versicolor; those after the 20 mg administration were nausea, palpitations, paresthesia, pruritus, and urticaria. All AEs were of mild intensity. Overall, 11.4%, 12.2%, 12.2%, and 10.9% of subjects experienced an AE after administration of dapagliflozin 150 mg, dapagliflozin 20 mg, moxifloxacin 400 mg, and placebo, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p>The assessment of a drug to delay cardiac repolarization, as assessed by the QT/QTc interval, is now required for compounds in development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref> The objective of this study was to provide a rigorous assessment of the potential for dapagliflozin to prolong ventricular repolarization in human subjects at both presumed therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses. The primary endpoint compared the change in QTc interval from predose baseline values between active and placebo treatment.</p><p>The mean QTc intervals were not prolonged using a study-specific correction method (QTcX) or the standard heart rate correction method (Fridericia&#x02019;s). With both methods, all upper bounds of the 90% CI for the difference in mean QTc interval between either dose of dapagliflozin and placebo were &#x0003c;10 ms. Therefore, either correction method resulted in a negative TQT study, defined as one in which the upper bound of the 95% one-sided CI for the largest time-matched mean effect of the drug on the QTc interval excludes 10 ms. This definition is meant to imply that the mean effect of a study drug on the QTc interval is not &#x0003e;5 ms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref> Both doses of dapagliflozin, using either heart rate correction method, met this requirement, as the largest placebo-subtracted, baseline-adjusted mean QTc interval for any dose or method of heart rate correction was only 2.8 ms. No subject treated with dapagliflozin had outlier values, namely an increase in QTcX or QTcF from baseline &#x0003e;30 ms or a QTcX or QTcF value &#x0003e;450 ms. The lack of outliers provides further confidence that dapagliflozin does not prolong the QTc interval.</p><p>In addition to the standard analysis of a TQT study, this study also incorporated concentration-QT modeling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref> The QTc versus concentration plot for dapagliflozin was essentially flat, with a slope that was not significantly different from zero. As &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcX was independent of dapagliflozin plasma concentration, no further concentration/QT modeling was explored. However, the concentration-QT modeling was consistent with the earlier phase 1 studies, which incorporated greater doses of dapagliflozin than the supratherapeutic dose used in this study. As some have noted,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref> if the concentration-QT modeling in early clinical studies suggests that the TQT will be negative, the standard therapeutic dose can be omitted, allowing one arm of the study to be dropped. Although the anticipated maximum therapeutic dose was included, it could have been omitted without altering the conclusions on cardiac repolarization by dapagliflozin.</p><p>The sensitivity of the assay to detect small increases in QTc interval was established with the active control, moxifloxacin. Although assay sensitivity was originally defined as a significant increase in QTc interval by the positive control that was consistent with its known effect on the QT interval,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref> more recent requirements have proposed a prospective, more quantitative assessment that takes into account what is known about the response and time course of the positive control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref> For moxifloxacin, the lower bound of the 90% CI for one time point for &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcX should be &#x0003e;5 ms. The time course for the QTc effect of moxifloxacin is known, and the peak effect occurs around the time of C<sub>max</sub> (ie, no hysteresis).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref> Because moxifloxacin pharmacokinetic samples were not analyzed in this study, an average approach for C<sub>max</sub> was chosen because the mean t<sub>max</sub> was unknown. It was prospectively decided to average the &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcX for moxifloxacin over the 1&#x02013;4-hour time points that encompass the tmax range for moxifloxacin. The &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcX for the 1&#x02013;4-hour average was 7.7 ms, with a lower bound of the 90% CI of 6.2 ms. The maximum baseline-adjusted, placebo-subtracted QTcX for moxifloxacin was 9.7 ms, and the shape of the &#x00394;&#x00394;QTcX versus time curve for moxifloxacin was consistent with previously published data.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref> Therefore, assay sensitivity was confirmed in a rigorous way, validating the interpretability of the results for dapagliflozin.</p><p>Although the discontinuation rate of subjects in this study was greater than expected, it did not impact the results. A four-period crossover trial with a relatively long washout contributed to the dropout rate, as half of the discontinued subjects were dropouts and three additional subjects failed to comply with the protocol requirements. Both the dapagliflozin pharmacokinetic parameters and safety profile are consistent with previous results in healthy volunteers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref> The supratherapeutic dose of dapagliflozin appeared to be well tolerated. The percentage of subjects who experienced an AE was similar across the four groups, and all AEs were mild.</p><p>The inclusion of only healthy subjects is a limitation of this study. The typical TQT study is conducted in healthy volunteers, hence the results may not equate to potential proarrhythmic liabilities when a drug is used chronically in a high-risk cardiovascular population. This is pointed out in ICH-E14, as the TQT study is not intended to identify drugs as being proarrhythmic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dapagliflozin at doses up to 150 mg was not associated with QT interval prolongation in healthy male subjects. There were no QTc thresholds above 450 ms or QTc interval increases &#x0003e;30 ms, and the QTc interval changes were independent of dapagliflozin concentrations. Based on these data, dapagliflozin at the proposed therapeutic dose of 10 mg/day is not expected to affect cardiac repolarization in patients with diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial services and graphics support were provided by W.
