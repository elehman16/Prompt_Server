However, the survival of patients with early stage cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy depends on the presence or absence of several poor prognostic clinicopathologic risk factors. Positive or close resection margin, lymph node involvement, and parametrial invasion were recognized as high-risk factors while large tumor size, deep stromal invasion, and lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) were regarded as intermediate-risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Radiation has been used as a postoperative adjuvant therapy to reduce recurrences in cervical cancer patients with both these intermediate and high risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since Peters et al. showed a significant survival advantage with the use of concurrent chemoradiation rather than radiation in patients with high-risk cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Concurrent chemoradiation rapidly replaced radiation in the treatment of high-risk cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Although radiotherapy has been used as postoperative adjuvant therapy to reduce recurrence and improve survival in patients with intermediate risk tumors and the effectiveness of radiotherapy has been widely accepted, based on the results of a randomized study reported by Sedlis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recent retrospective studies insisted that adjuvant radiotherapy may have local effects only, which are not effective in distant recurrence and have suggested the promising improvements of adding chemotherapy to radiation in patients with intermediate-risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Thus, two practical debates still remain regarding for the adjuvant treatment of the intermediate-risk group. First, is whether concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), which has been established as a standard adjuvant treatment of high-risk cervical cancer, is more beneficial than radiotherapy only for an intermediate-risk group. Second, cisplatin-based chemotherapy usually has been accepted as effective adjuvant therapy against cervical cancer. However, the optimal platinum-based combination treatments in adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) is still under investigation. Topotecan is an agent with antineoplastic activity on recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and has been shown acceptable toxicity and good response rates in previous studies as a combined regimen with cisplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Consequently, topotecan/cisplatin was chosen as concurrent chemotherapy regimen in our study.</p><p>The aim of the present study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01418859) was to investigate the efficacy and safety of CCRT with topotecan/cisplatin as adjuvant therapy after radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer patients with intermediate-risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Eligibility</title><p>Patients from First Affiliated Hospital of Xi&#x02019;an Jiaotong University who had undergone radical surgery for clinical stage IB- IIA carcinoma of the cervix were enrolled in the study from September 2011 to August 2013.

However, in a Gynecologic Oncology Group study(GOG 92) that attempted to investigate the role of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in the intermediate-risk group, 277 cervical cancer patients with intermediate risk factors were randomized to the no further treatment (NFT) or RT group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In those who met the GOG criteria, which defined the intermediate-risk group using a three-factor model of a combination of intermediate risk factors (capillary lymphatic space involvement, stromal invasion depth, and tumor size), a statistically significant reduction of risk of recurrence and an increase in recurrence free survival was found in the RT group compared with the NFT group. Since the efficacy of adjuvant radiation for patients with intermediate-risk factors were demonstrated in the previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], radiation is the standard adjuvant therapy in patients with intermediate-risk factors. However, as shown in the GOG 92 trial, the recurrence rate of the intermediate-risk group was 27.9% in the NFT group, comparable to that of patients with high-risk factors. Furthermore, even though the recurrence rate was reduced with the use of adjuvant RT, the rate of recurrence was still significant (15%, 21 of 137 cases) in the RT group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Some retrospective studies in recent years also have showed the benefit of adding chemotherapy to radiation in patients with intermediate-risk factors and the levels of all toxicities were acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Okazawa M et al. reviewed the medical records of 316 patients with stage IB1-IIB cervical cancer who had been treated with adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;124, RT group) or adjuvant CCRT (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;192, CCRT group) after radical hysterectomy and found that CCRT was superior to RT with regard to recurrence rate and PFS in patents with 2 or more intermediate risk factors, while the patients with only 1 intermediate risk factor showed no survival benefit of CCRT over RT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, due to the lack of randomized trials, the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation over radiation in cervical cancer patients with intermediate-risk factors remains unclear.</p><p>Furthermore, adjuvant CCRT modalities for intermediate risk tumors have been debating. Weekly cisplatin or cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (5- FU) every 3&#x000a0;weeks has been widely used as the preferred treatment with CCRT in previous studies. Nevertheless, these standard regimens had some disadvantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For instance, the weekly cisplatin frequently caused a treatment delay due to hematologic toxicities and the requirement of a weekly visit to the hospital was inconvenient. In addition, 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin, a five-day regimen, caused more discomfort to patients and sometimes caused intractable nausea and vomiting. While previous studies using topotecan/cisplatin for patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer have shown acceptable toxicity and good response rates. Thus, topotecan with cisplatin was chosen as concurrent chemotherapy regimen in our study.</p><p>Recently, cisplatin-based consolidation chemotherapy after CCRT has been reported to enhance local control and promote eradication of possible distant micro-metastases in locally advanced cervical cancer by phase II studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These promsing results suggested that consolidation chemotherapy after primary CCRT may play a role independent of the radiotherapy in locally advanced cervical carcinoma. Furthermore, for high-risk patients after radical surgery, the continuation of chemotherapy (cisplatin 70&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1 and 5-FU 1000&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d for 5&#x000a0;days) for three to four cycles resulted in improved patient survival compared with the survival of patients who receive only one or two courses of chemotherapy(<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.03) in the study of Peters 3rd WA et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It was not determined from their study whether the effect of the chemotherapy was as a radiation sensitiser or as a systemic chemotherapy with elimination of possible micrometastasis, or both. In contrast, Kim HS et al. found that consolidation chemotherapy after CCRT using paclitaxel and carboplatin failed to improve PFS and OS as compared to CCRT-only in patients with high-risk early-stage cervical cancer who underwent surgical treatment (3-year PFS, 62.7% vs. 88.2%, respectively; 3-year OS, 90.9% vs. 97.3%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, is there any role for consolidation chemotherapy following CCRT in intermediate-risk cervical cancer patients? We designed arm C(CCRT&#x02009;+&#x02009;CT) to examine whether the addition of consolidation chemotherapy to CCRT could improve the progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with intermediate-risk factors after radical surgery.</p><p>On account of a median follow-up of only 16&#x000a0;months, RFS (recurrence-free survival) and OS (overall survival) of each group were not analyzed in the present study. Another issue that must be discussed is complications of these adjuvant therapies following radical surgery. Although cisplatin-based chemotherapy concurrent with RT is a standard treatment modality for advanced-stage cervical cancer, many physicians are still reluctant to treat the intermediate-risk group with CCRT. Because combined modalities are more likely to result in serious complications. As is known, radiotherapy after radical hysterectomy has been reported to be associated with high incidence of complications and many of these conditions are very tragic and irreversible and result in poor quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Barter et al. observed that 30% of patients treated with radiation after radical hysterectomy had serious complications, such as gastrointestinal and genitourinary complications and leg lymphedema et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Meanwhile, the major toxicities of combined chemotherapy were bone marrow depression, mild to moderate gastrointestinal troubles, mild to moderate nephrotoxicities, total alopecia (in etoposide-cisplatin group), relatively low incidence of neurotoxicities and hepatotoxicities, rare incidence of pulmonary and cardiac toxicities and some reported secondary malignancies (acute leukemia and some solid tumors). In previous studies the levels of all these toxicities of combined chemotherapy were acceptable and most are reversible and transient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, the results of the present study found that hematologic toxicity was significantly more frequent and more severe in the CCRT and CCRT&#x02009;+&#x02009;CT arms compared with the RT arm. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia occurred in 46.7% (7/15) of patients who received CCRT and 100.0% (5/5) of patients who received CCRT&#x02009;+&#x02009;CT but in only 15.4% (2/13) of those who received RT only (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002). Especially, three patients discontinued planned therapy in arm C because of persistent grade 4 neutropenia toxicity. Although topotecan with cisplatin has been shown acceptable toxicity and good response rates in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, similar to the study of Long HJ 3rd et al., which reported that the combination of topotecan-cisplatin resulted in substantial neutropenia (70% <italic>vs</italic> 1.4%) compared with single cisplatin agent, and nearly 18% of patients in the topotecan-cisplatin arm experienced febrile neutropenia in patients with advanced (stage IVB), recurrent or persistent carcinoma of the uterine cervix, topotecan plus cisplatin chemotherapy concurrent with RT in our study also showed severe hematologic toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, we closed the clinical trial ahead of schedule.</p><p>Although our study showed severe hematologic toxicity of concurrent chemoradiation with topotecan and cisplatin in safe dose to radiation in patients with intermediate-risk factors, the efficacy and toxicity are still unclear. As we mentioned in the results, the number of patients in the different group is small (14 in group A, 15 in group B and 10 in group C) because the study closed ahead of schedule and the media follow-up time is only 16&#x000a0;months. In spite of these limitations, due to topotecan has been identificated as an antineoplastic agent with cisplatin in cervival cancer, a trial with optimal dose, sufficient size and long term follow-up would be necessary to demonstrate the advantage of concurrent chemoradiation in patients with intermediate-risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To conclude that chemoradiotherapy maybe the better adjuvant therapy than radiation in patients with intermediate-risk factors, but the benefit of chemoradiotherapy should overweigh the cost of adverse effects. The present study showed severe hematologic toxicity in the chemoradiotherapy with topotecan and cisplatin groups and was closed ahead of schedule. Therefore, the optimal platinum-based adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in cervical cancer patients with intermediate risk factors is still under investigation especially and the final conclusion regarding the role of chemoradiotherapy should be withheld.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>RT</term><def><p>Radiotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCRT</term><def><p>Concurrent chemoradiotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCRT&#x02009;+&#x02009;CT</term><def><p>Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with following Consolidation chemotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMRT</term><def><p>Intensity modulated radiation therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>3D-CRT</term><def><p>3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LTS</term><def><p>Large tumor size</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSI</term><def><p>Deep stromal invasion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LVSI</term><def><p>Lymphovascular space invasion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GOG</term><def><p>Gynecologic Oncology Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p>Computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p>Magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NFT</term><def><p>No further treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RFS</term><def><p>Recurrence-free survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OS</term><def><p>Overall survival</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>WS guarantees the integrity of the entire study and drafted the manuscript.
