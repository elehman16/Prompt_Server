However, knowledge about injury etiology and prevention is needed. Training errors in running are modifiable risk factors and people engaged in recreational running need evidence-based running schedules to minimize the risk of injury. The existing literature on running volume and running intensity and the development of injuries show conflicting results. This may be related to previously applied study designs, methods used to quantify the performed running and the statistical analysis of the collected data. The aim of the Run Clever trial is to investigate if a focus on running intensity compared with a focus on running volume in a running schedule influences the overall injury risk differently.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The Run Clever trial is a randomized trial with a 24-week follow-up. Healthy recreational runners between 18 and 65&#x000a0;years and with an average of 1&#x02013;3 running sessions per week the past 6&#x000a0;months are included. Participants are randomized into two intervention groups: Running schedule-I and Schedule-V. Schedule-I emphasizes a progression in running intensity by increasing the weekly volume of running at a hard pace, while Schedule-V emphasizes a progression in running volume, by increasing the weekly overall volume. Data on the running performed is collected by GPS. Participants who sustain running-related injuries are diagnosed by a diagnostic team of physiotherapists using standardized diagnostic criteria. The members of the diagnostic team are blinded. The study design, procedures and informed consent were approved by the Ethics Committee Northern Denmark Region (N-20140069).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The Run Clever trial will provide insight into possible differences in injury risk between running schedules emphasizing either running intensity or running volume. The risk of sustaining volume- and intensity-related injuries will be compared in the two intervention groups using a competing risks approach.

In surveys of participation in leisure time physical activity, running is reported to be one of the most popular forms of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and a national report from the Danish Institute for Sports Studies, estimates that 31&#x000a0;% of the adult population in Denmark participate in recreational running [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Running is a cheap and easily accessible form of exercise, and the positive effects of running on health outcomes such as weight loss, cardio respiratory function and mortality are well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Unfortunately, running is also associated with the risk of sustaining a running-related injury. A recently published systematic review and meta-analysis by Videb&#x000e6;k et al. report, that the incidence of running-related injuries per 1000&#x000a0;h of running varies between 2.5 and 33.0 and estimates a weighted injury incidence among recreational runners of 7.7 (95&#x000a0;% CI 6.9 &#x02013; 8.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The knee, lower leg and ankle/foot are the most common sites of injury and a recent study revealed the median time to recovery from injury to be 72&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, the proportion of injured runners receiving conservative treatment was 10.7&#x000a0;%, while 4.7&#x000a0;% underwent surgical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">People engaged in recreational running or choosing running as a new and active lifestyle, should be offered evidence-based advice on running schedules with minimal injury risk. Running with a minimized risk of injury would aid the choice of an active lifestyle by decreasing discontinuation from running and, possibly, further reduce the proportion of people at risk of chronic diseases.</p><p id="Par16">Training errors are recognized as a risk factor for running-related injuries and in order to develop running schedules with a minimized risk of injury, a better understanding of the different training variables&#x02019; influence on injury risk is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Trials investigating differences in injury risk in relation to the progression in running volume, the frequency and duration of running and participation in a preconditioning programme, have been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The GRONORUN 1 and 2 trials both mentions the application of an subjective measure of running intensity as a limitation in the trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The study by Pollock et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] used maximal oxygen uptake as a relative measure of running intensity, comparing different durations of running and different weekly running frequencies. However, the sample consisted of male prison inmates between 20 and 35&#x000a0;years of age, which makes it difficult to generalize the results to recreational or novice runners. A review by Nielsen et al. concluded that there are moderate evidence suggesting that volume is associated with injury risk, but that this association possibly is influenced by the weekly progression in volume and the maturation of the runners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The existing literature on running intensity and the development of injuries show conflicting results, possibly related to the subjective measure used in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A possible association between the focus of a running schedule and the risk of sustaining specific injuries has also been hypothesized. Specifically, patellofemoral pain, illiotibial band syndrome and patellar tendinopathy were hypothesized to be distance-related, while achilles tendinopathy, gastrocnemius injury and plantar fasciitis were hypothesized to be pace-related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Findings from both experimental and cohort studies support this hypothesized association. In an experimental study by Petersen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], an increase in running speed resulted in an increase in the peak plantar flexion moment, which was significantly higher than the increase in the peak knee extensor moment (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). In another experimental study by Petersen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], a decreased running speed resulted in a cumulative load at the knee joint which was significantly higher, compared with the cumulative knee joint load at higher running speeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. An observational study by Nielsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], with a 1-year follow-up and 847 novice runners included, investigated the progression in volume and found that greater progression in running volume increased the risk of the above mentioned distance-related injuries, but not the overall risk of injury. The aim of the Run Clever trial is therefore to conduct a training schedule intervention trial, comparing a running schedule which focus on running intensity with a running schedule which focus on running volume, with the purpose of extending the above mentioned studies, by investigating the difference in risk between the two training variables and the risk of sustaining specific injuries associated with a specific training variable. The following hypotheses are tested (H).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par17">Runners with a focus on running intensity have a 15&#x000a0;% increased risk of injury compared with runners with a focus on running volume.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18">A running schedule focusing on intensity, increase the risk of sustaining achilles tendinopathy, gastrocnemius injuries and plantar fasciitis compared with hypothesized distance-related injuries.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">A running schedule focusing on running volume, increase the risk of sustaining patellofemoral pain syndrome, illiotibial band syndrome and patellar tendinopathy compared vwith hypothesized pace-related injuries.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">A positive excess risk due to interaction exists between running intensity and running volume, and the effect is more pronounced for pace-related injuries with greater changes in speed than volume, while the effect is more pronounced for distance-related injuries with greater changes in volume than in speed.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par21">Furthermore, complementary risk factor analysis on BMI, age, gender, previous injury, running experience and general activity level will be performed.

Explorative analyzes will be performed on data collected using the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The focus of the explorative analyzes is the reported physical complaints progressing to time loss injuries and the relationship with the running performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par22">The Run Clever trial is a randomized trial with a 24 - week follow-up.

Recreational runners as a group are characterized by a large heterogeneity, especially concerning running experience and training habits. Consensus regarding the definition of a recreational runner is not established and the term is used inconsistently in relation to a wide variety of running populations. In three studies all describing the included runners as recreational, running experience in years ranged from 5.0 to 8.6 and the weekly volume in kilometers ranged from 28 to 38. However, the weekly running frequency only ranged from 3.0 to 3.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The present trial defines the population as recreational runners, using the inclusion criteria of an average weekly frequency between 1 and 3 running sessions the past 6&#x000a0;months. The choice of weekly frequency was primarily based on a descriptive study by the Danish Institute for Sports Studies, which showed that the largest proportion of recreational runners in Denmark averaged 1 &#x02013; 3 weekly running sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">The ideal percentage of weekly progression is unclear and a trial by Buist et al. comparing a weekly progression of 10.5 and 23.7&#x000a0;% found no difference in risk of RRI.

A predetermined inclusion period of 6&#x000a0;months has been determined. The challenge of including 713 participants over a 6&#x000a0;month period is acknowledged. However, the estimated 31&#x000a0;% of the adult population in Denmark who participates in recreational running, provides an approximate background population of 904.685 persons, from which recruitment of participants can take place (Based on numbers from Statistics Denmark) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Information regarding the possibility of participation in the trial is announced through the two largest Danish recreational running organizations. Possible participants can easily access and fill out the inclusion/exclusion questionnaire and indicate their interest in participation. The baseline information is collected through the online training diary, making data collection less time consuming for both participants and investigators. This gives us reason to assume that such a large scale inclusion is possible. However, a sample size of 357 participants, based on a minimum risk difference between groups of 1&#x000a0;%, with a power of 80&#x000a0;% and taking the hypothesized loss to follow-up of 15&#x000a0;% into account, is the minimal acceptable number of included participants and also the minimal acceptable clinical relevant difference. At the end of the 6&#x000a0;month inclusion period, no additional inclusions will be made.</p><p id="Par58">The use of GPS to collect data on running exposure is not new and the applicability of this method has been investigated both in runners and in field-based sports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In the current trial, GPS is used to quantify volume (kilometers) and intensity (minutes per kilometer). Nielsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] investigated the feasibility of using GPS to quantify training volume in kilometers. The study concluded that the use of GPS caused no clinically relevant measurement errors. Townshend et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] investigated the accuracy of GPS in the measurement of running speed. The study concluded that the use of GPS can provide accurate data on running speed. Further, unpublished data found a Root Mean Square (RMS) of the average pace in minutes per kilometer&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;s per kilometer, when collected over approx. 300 m. If the distance was increased to 1000 m, the RMS of the average pace in minutes per kilometer was 3 &#x02013; 5&#x000a0;s per kilometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Based on this information, it seems feasible to use GPS to quantify running exposure data on running volume (kilometers) and running intensity (minutes per kilometers). Running intensity will, however, not be averaged using distances&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;500&#x000a0;m in the current trial.</p><p id="Par59">A modification of the fourth and last question in the OSTRC questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], used to collect data on the secondary outcome is applied. The original severity score ranging from 0 to 100 is not changed. In order to accomplish this, the added fifth answering possibility is given the same response value as the fourth answering possibility. The modified version was employed based on experiences from an ongoing study in our lab on handball injuries, providing previously injured respondents with a possibility of reporting &#x0201c;no participation due to pain&#x0201d;.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Ethics and consent to participate</title><p id="Par60">The study design, procedures and informed consent were approved by the Ethics Committee Northern Denmark Region (N-20140069) and the Danish Data Protection Agency.
