Prevention of infection in LBW babies would directly decrease neonatal morbidity and mortality. Management of neonatal sepsis with antibiotics faces the problem of drug resistance, attributed to availability over the counter, indiscriminate use and incomplete courses in India. Researchers are evaluating immunotherapy (with immune globulin, myeloid colony stimulating factors, probiotics, glutamine supplementation, recombinant human protein C and lactoferrin) as adjuvants for the prevention of neonatal sepsis.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Probiotics have attracted much interest and debate in the neonatal literature during the past decade.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The FAO/WHO defines probiotics as live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Probiotic microorganisms have particular characteristics: human origin, safety in human use, bile acid resistance, survival in the intestine, temporary colonisation of the gut, adhesion to the mucosa and bacteriocine production.

Following on from the evidence on very LBW (VLBW) and premature infants, we hypothesised that the probiotic preparationVSL#3 might reduce morbidity due to sepsis in LBW infants. We aimed to estimate reduction in the incidence of suspected sepsis in 0&#x02013;2-month-old low birthweight infants in the intervention arm with a daily supplementation of probiotic VSL#3, 10 billion colony-forming units (cfu) over a period of 30&#x02005;days. If proven to be efficacious, it could be an important public health intervention for prevention of neonatal infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>We undertook a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled (1:1) trial from January 2009 to November 2011 at two tertiary care hospitals and the adjoining community areas (Safdarjung hospital in New Delhi and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences Wardha, India). We screened newborn infants aged 3&#x02005;days, born in the hospitals weighing 1500&#x02013;2500&#x02005;g, residing within 20&#x02013;25&#x02005;km of the hospital, and not planning to shift residence for at least the next 2&#x02005;months. We excluded extremely premature infants (&#x0003c;34&#x02005;weeks), sick infants, those with congenital malformations incompatible with life, and those with guardians not giving consent and belonging to out of study areas. Eligible babies, for whom parents/guardians gave informed consent, were enrolled on days 3&#x02013;7 of life. Participants were enrolled by a physician in the hospital and followed up in the community for 2&#x02005;months for occurrence of neonatal sepsis and other morbidities. Baseline information on demographic characteristics was obtained for assessment of Standard of Living Index.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Ethical clearance was obtained from the two participating institutes. A Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) met every 6&#x02005;months and reviewed severe adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study medication</title><p>Infants were randomly assigned to receive probiotic or placebo by the study physician. The intervention consisted of administration of the probiotic preparation VSL#3 (a mix of eight strains: <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</italic> spp <italic>bulgaricus</italic>, at a dose of 10 billion cfu for 30&#x02005;days, starting on the third day of life. The content of the probiotic sachet was mixed in expressed breast milk in a plastic cup and fed to the infant. A sterilised plastic cup and stirrer were provided along with the sachets. A similar-looking maltodextrin preparation in the same outer packing was administered to the control group. The supplement was prepared by CD Pharma India Pvt. Ltd. The preparations withstood a temperature up to 28&#x000b0; C and were therefore kept in a cold chain (refrigerators/vaccine carriers) at the homes of enrolled infants.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>A computer generated stratified block randomisation with a permuted block size of four was used. We stratified infants by birth weight (1500&#x02013;2000&#x02005;g, 2001&#x02013;2500&#x02005;g) and sex. A team of scientists at INCLEN Trust, New Delhi, used a computer-generated table for subject allocation. Allocation concealment was ensured by sequentially numbering the sachet packets containing VSL#3 or placebo after block randomisation. Identical packaging of VSL#3 and a placebo with similar consistency and colour was provided. Parents of enrolled infants, investigators and fieldworkers were masked to treatment allocation. Data analysis was performed in a blinded manner. The codes remained with the INCLEN Trust, and were disclosed to the DSMB and ICMR on completion of data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Follow-up and assessment</title><p>Follow-up visits were carried out by the fieldworker for supervising supplementation over 30&#x02005;days, and detection of morbidities over 2&#x02005;months. Visitation was daily during the first week, biweekly in weeks 2&#x02013;4 of life, and weekly in the second month. Detection of neonatal sepsis was performed during visits, using the Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unicef.org/india/Training_Module_1&#x02013;9">http://www.unicef.org/india/Training_Module_1&#x02013;9</ext-link>) for detection of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) suggested by the presence of any of the following signs of infection: convulsions or fast breathing (60 breaths per minute or more); severe chest in-drawing or nasal flaring or grunting; 10 or more skin pustules or a large boil; axillary temperature 37.5&#x000b0;C or above (or feels hot to touch); temperature less than 35.4&#x000b0;C (or feels cold to touch); lethargic or unconscious or less than normal movements. Fieldworkers referred and accompanied sick infants to the study hospital for treatment. At the hospital, the infants were examined by a physician, blood cultures were obtained, and treatment was carried out as per the protocol of the hospital.</p><p>Information on compliance and morbidities was recorded. An enrolment card was provided which parents were asked to carry whenever they sought treatment for the infant in between study visits. Efforts were made to contact local practitioners visited independently by parents of infants and to collect the details of treatments prescribed. Study staff were trained in the IMNCI algorithm and given practice on eliciting signs of neonatal sepsis. Study procedures were standardised and regular exercises were conducted so as to reduce interobserver and intraobserver variability. Quality assurance measures included supervisory checks in the fieldwork, data collection and data cleaning. All case record forms were cross-checked by supervisors and medical officers before being sent for double data entry (in EPI Info V.6.0) with built-in range and consistency checks. (Details on quality assurance mechanism for the study implementation is given as web appendix).</p><p>The primary outcome was risk of PSBI as per the IMNCI algorithm, as diagnosed by fieldworkers or physicians. Secondary outcomes were estimation of the effect of VSL#3 on overall morbidity pattern in 0&#x02013;2-month-old LBW infants; stool colonisation patterns in 10% of subjects; and assessment of side effects due to the probiotic VSL#3, if any. On the recommendation of the DSMC, data on diagnosis of sepsis by a physician was also recorded as an amendment to the protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Gut colonisation substudy</title><p>Data on gut colonisation was important to substantiate the clinical findings.

However, in the un-prespecified subgroup of infants weighing 1.5&#x02013;1.99&#x02005;kg, the reduction in risk of PSBI was statistically significant (reduction of 71%; p=0.014). The primary analysis in this study was based on the PSBI classification by the fieldworker as per the IMNCI algorithm as an indicator of neonatal sepsis.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The classification PSBI under IMNCI is described as sensitive but not specific for detection of neonatal sepsis.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Prior to closure of the study, the DSMC recommended conducting post hoc analyses using the physician's diagnosis of sepsis as the outcome measure. In this analysis, there is a 29% overall reduction in risk of sepsis. However, in the un prespecified subgroup of infants weighing 1.5&#x02013;1.99&#x02005;kg, there is a 100% reduction, with no cases observed in the group receiving probiotic supplementation. Our findings of probiotics efficacy among infants 1.5&#x02013;1.99&#x02005;kg may be a chance finding, generating a hypothesis that this intervention may be useful for the most vulnerable of the LBW babies. Our power calculations did not consider this a priori, and hence these findings need to be confirmed in future studies. Probiotic intervention significantly reduced the mean number of hospitalisation days. The Kaplan Meier survival analysis shows a 15-day delay in the onset of sepsis in the intervention arm; this translates to a disease-free window during the 28-day period, which is crucial for neonatal survival. Moreover, considering a higher case fatality in sepsis at early ages, this becomes even more important. Our results may not be definitive or robust enough; however, there is a consistency in them, and we do not consider this as a &#x02018;negative trial&#x02019;. Although our study is not large enough, it may be misleading to interpret it as proving that there is no effect of the probiotic intervention or no difference between the study groups. More evidence needs to be generated, since an interpretation of no effect might discourage further studies.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>In the current study, a consistent difference between the intervention and control groups A and B in all the tables as well as the Kaplan Meier survival analysis curves was observed. The difference between the groups was marked in most of the tables when the physician's diagnosis of sepsis was considered. After evaluating the coded results, the DSMB even considered amendment of the original protocol to change the primary outcome variable to sepsis as diagnosed by the physician so that the study conclusively finds out the role of VSL#3 in preventing neonatal sepsis. The opinion of the DSMB members was that physicians' diagnosis of sepsis would be widely acceptable owing to its accuracy as compared to diagnosis by field workers. Committee advised extending the study to enrol more infants for the revised primary outcome. However, a &#x02018;Technical Advisory Group&#x02019; (including clinical trialists, biostatisticians, public health experts), formed on recommendations of the DSMB, suggested that this study should be closed and another study planned. In view of the fact that the trial was registered and the statistical analytical plan specified the primary outcome as PSBI, it was suggested that the findings on Physician's diagnosis be presented post hoc.</p><p>The physician's diagnosis of sepsis is more meaningful than PSBI, owing to its specificity. The reported post hoc analyses increase our confidence in the results. However, physicians used their clinical judgement for diagnosing sepsis; there was no standardised definition used, and this is a limitation of the study. Future trials should evaluate the role of VSL#3 on incidence of sepsis with a precise definition of the outcome measure. The incidence of sepsis observed in the study was lower than the expected effect size used in determining the sample size of the study. Home visits,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> health education messages about exclusive breastfeeding and hygiene, and referral by fieldworkers could improve care and care-seeking, resulting in lower morbidity and mortality and a type II error for the overall result of our study. Our study has several other limitations. It was not powered to assess the role of probiotics on neonatal mortality. The enrolments were made during 3&#x02013;7&#x02005;day of life, so we cannot comment on the role of probiotics on early onset sepsis. We followed infants for a period of 2&#x02005;months and therefore cannot comment on the long-term effects of probiotic supplementation. There are concerns regarding heterogeneity in probiotic products. The literature suggests greater protection with double or triple probiotic strains.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Probiotic VSL#3 is a mix of eight strains, namely <italic>S. thermophilus, B. breve, B. longum, B. infantis, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. paracasei</italic> and <italic>L. Delbrueckii</italic> spp <italic>bulgaricus.</italic> In a randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial in India, VSL#3 resulted in early recovery and reduced need for oral rehydration salts in rotavirus-affected children aged 6&#x02005;months to 2&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>In previous studies, probiotics have been found to prevent necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) by preventing colonisation of the gut by pathogens, promoting colonisation with beneficial organisms, improving maturity and function of the gut mucosal barrier and modulating the immune system to the advantage of the host.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A Cochrane review showed moderate to low quality evidence that oral lactoferrin with or without probiotics decreases sepsis and NEC in preterm infants.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The mechanism for efficacy of probiotics in reducing the incidence of sepsis in VLBW infants is probably similar to that for NEC.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, in a further study by Lin <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> the effect of reduction in the incidence of sepsis was not confirmed. This study was conducted among severely ill, hospitalised VLBW infants with central line, total parenteral nutrition and prolonged use of mechanical ventilation. Probiotics exert their effects by positively influencing normal microbe&#x02013;microbe and host&#x02013;microbe interactions and may augment the protection afforded by commensal flora through competitive interactions, direct antagonism of pathogens and/or production of antimicrobial factors. The preventive mechanisms could fail in the face of severe conditions as in case of the study by Lin <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Probiotics alone would not overcome the infection induced by invasive procedures. However, in the community setting such as in our study, among LBW predominantly breastfed infants, probiotics could be effective in preventing sepsis, since the primary effect of orally administered probiotics is in the gastrointestinal tract with prevention of bacterial translocation.</p><p>Neonatal infection is a high priority area of research. Research on immunotherapy<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> has provided very few leads. To the best of our knowledge, at present there are no proven interventions beneficial in preventing sepsis in LBW infants,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> apart from exclusive breastfeeding and practice of hygiene. This study provides an indication that microbial interference by beneficial bacteria is helpful in decreasing neonatal morbidity. Considering a 30% prevalence of LBW in India<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and 30% mortality due to sepsis in newborns,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> even a modest decline in the incidence of sepsis due to preventive intervention with probiotics could avert thousands of neonatal deaths. When produced on a large scale, it would be a cost-effective intervention for a major public health problem.</p><p>We observed a significant positive treatment effect in the subgroup of infants weighing 1.5&#x02013;2.0&#x02005;kg. This mandates the conduct of a larger study with sufficient power to conclusively evaluate the role of probiotics among LBW infants in a population at high risk of mortality from sepsis. There is also a need to conduct this kind of study for all neonates to assess if probiotics could be beneficial even for children who are not LBW.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the contribution of Mr N C Saxena and the Project Review Group, ICMR for approving the protocol.
