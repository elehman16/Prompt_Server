Significant talar shift was defined as medial clear space being at least 2&#x02005;mm wider than the superior clear space on a mortise X-ray view of the ankle. Further inclusion criteria were patients aged between 18 and 65&#x02005;years inclusive with no other concomitant fractures/dislocations; mobilising unaided/independently preinjury; and willing to be followed up for 12&#x02005;months. Exclusion criteria were participants who were medically unfit for anaesthesia/surgery; skeletally immature; previous trauma or surgery to the fractured ankle; inability to consent; pregnancy; the presence of comorbidities that impede mobilisation; and non-English speaking. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients willing to participate.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Eligible participants willing to be randomised were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either the surgical or non-surgical intervention. The National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Centre (not otherwise involved in the study) generated the randomisation schedule using a permuted block approach with variable block size and stratified by site. Randomisation was administered using an automated telephone-based system that provided allocation concealment. Owing to the nature of the interventions, neither the investigators nor the participants were blinded. Outcome assessors were independent of the treating teams, and collected data using a standardised telephone interview. As part of the opening conversation, patients were advised not to disclose their treatment so that the assessor could remain blind to treatment. After randomisation, the surgical group received surgery within 10&#x02005;days of injury. Eligible participants who declined randomisation were invited to enter the observational cohort. Treatment for the observational cohort was determined by participant and surgeon preference.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Procedures</title><p>During protocol development, members of the Australian Orthopaedic Trauma Society were consulted regarding the best practice for the surgical and non-surgical management of 44-B1 ankle fractures as well as the primary and secondary outcomes. Patient eligibility centred on the presence of the fracture of interest. An external rotation stress test to assess the stability of the ankle was not performed as it was not routine practice in Australia owing to uncertainty about its validity and clinical utility.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The focus for the effectiveness of the interventions was patient-reported outcomes. Radiological measures beyond 6&#x02005;weeks were not required as they were unlikely to demonstrate any osteoarthritic changes and because late malalignment was considered rare (with both methods of treatment) and unlikely to influence management without clinical symptoms. One recruiting site declined to randomise participants due to lack of equipoise within the orthopaedic department and contributed to the observational cohort only.</p><p>The technique for surgical management was surgical fixation using a plate and screws. Surgeries were performed by orthopaedic surgeons or by orthopaedic trainees under the supervision of consultant orthopaedic surgeons following the AO principles of fracture fixation. Plate placement and reduction techniques were left to the discretion of the surgeon. Adverse intraoperative or postoperative events were recorded. Postoperatively, all participants were non-weight bearing and placed in a below-knee plaster cast or walking boot. Discharge from hospital was determined by the participant's ability to walk 25&#x02005;m unaided with standby assistance as determined by a physiotherapist (usual discharge criteria). The treating surgeon reviewed the participant after 10&#x02013;14&#x02005;days for wound assessment and change of cast to a walking cast or a walking boot (cam walker). The participant was then allowed full weight bearing. The treating surgeon reviewed the participant 6&#x02005;weeks postinjury with ankle radiographs and removed the cast or walking boot.</p><p>Participants who were treated non-surgically were managed with a walking boot and allowed full weight bearing. Discharge from hospital was determined as for the surgical group. All participants were examined within 10&#x02013;14&#x02005;days postinjury by the treating surgeon who assessed the patient with new ankle radiographs. The treating surgeon reviewed the participant 6&#x02005;weeks postinjury with repeat ankle radiographs and removed the cast or walking boot.</p><p>Referral to physiotherapy for all participants was at the discretion of the treating surgeon.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome measures were patient-reported ankle function using the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Foot and Ankle Outcomes Questionnaire (FAOQ) and the health-related quality of life using the physical component score (PCS) of the SF-12v2 General Health Survey at 12&#x02005;months postinjury. The FAOQ is a validated, patient-reported outcome measure that assesses ankle function with a higher value indicating better function.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Normative FAOQ scores were used, with a score of 50 representing the mean in the general population and an SD of 10.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Similarly, the SF-12v2 is a validated patient-reported outcome measure that has been used for the assessment of people with ankle fractures, with a higher value indicating better health.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> Both the SF-12v2 and the FAOQ have been used previously for patients with ankle fractures.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Secondary end points included any adverse events in the 12&#x02005;months postinjury; return to work at 6&#x02005;weeks and 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months postinjury; the PCS and FAOQ at 3 and 6&#x02005;months postinjury; and the mental component score of the SF-12v2 at 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months postinjury. Adverse events were classified as major (unplanned/repeat surgery; infection requiring admission to hospital; pulmonary embolus or death) or minor (neurological injury not requiring further intervention; infections not requiring hospital admission; deep vein thrombosis or other adverse events not requiring hospital admission or surgery).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The adverse events were collected at 6&#x02005;weeks and 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months postinjury.

There was no sample size target for the observational cohort as this cohort was to provide online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary information</xref> for the randomised cohort. The randomised and observational cohorts were analysed separately. The primary analysis, conducted using intention-to-treat principles, was performed on the randomised cohort; an as-treated analysis was also performed on the randomised cohort for sensitivity testing. Normality was assessed and Student's t-test was used to compare continuous variables between groups. Missing data were not imputed.

Furthermore, surgical management was not superior to non-surgical management for any secondary outcomes and it was associated with a longer length of hospital stay and a higher rate of adverse events.</p><p>CROSSBAT was a randomised controlled trial with a parallel observational cohort. The randomised cohort provides a robust comparison of effectiveness between the two treatment groups while the observational cohort provides a concurrent cohort subjected to routine clinical practice. The two cohorts had largely similar baseline characteristics indicating that the results of the randomised trial are generalisable to similar patients who decline randomisation. Further details of baseline comparisons are provided in the appendix. For these reasons, we believe that dissemination of the results of CROSSBAT will help address the practice variation that exists in this area.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

This is because the prevailing RCTs identified by the review included patients with either different patterns of ankle fractures and/or with significant talar shift that potentially confounds the need for surgery.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;32</xref> A recent study consented 81 patients to either surgical or non-surgical management for potentially unstable type B ankle fractures (type B ankle fractures that had a positive external rotation stress test indicating a significant lateral talar shift).<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Despite the presence of slight talar misalignment in 20% of the non-surgical group at 1&#x02005;year, patients managed surgically did not have superior functional outcomes to those managed non-surgically.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> It is possible that a minority of patients in the non-surgical group studied within CROSSBAT also had some misalignment at 1&#x02005;year, but it was likely to have been subclinical given the good clinical scores. To assess the longer term implications of surgical and non-surgical management of these ankle fractures, we plan to conduct longer term follow-up of the participants using both radiographic and functional measures.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of CROSSBAT include allocation concealment, which was assured through employment of a third party overseeing randomisation and allocation. In the randomised cohort, loss to follow-up and cross-over rates were low, and the as-treated analysis supported the findings of the intention-to-treat analysis. Outcome tools were validated and relevant, and assessors were blinded. The addition of the observational arm added to generalisability of the findings and addressed selection bias.</p><p>Limitations include the lack of blinding of the surgeons and participants which is unavoidable with this trial design. It is also possible that some eligible participants were missed, as recruitment fluctuated over time and between sites, given that dedicated research officers were not present at the sites due to funding constraints. However, all participants who were approached were willing to be recruited to either the randomised or observational cohort. The physiotherapy practices postinjury were not controlled, as participants were free to access physiotherapy services as desired. It was noted that a higher proportion of participants managed surgically sought physiotherapy. This, however, did not result in improved patient-reported outcomes for the surgical group. Further, a recent review by Lin Chung-Wei <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> showed no evidence of improved outcomes with physiotherapy-based rehabilitation following ankle fractures. Some may consider the use of subjective scoring to be a limitation; however, both the SF-12v2 and the FAOQ have been validated and used previously for patients with ankle fractures.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It can also be argued that clinical decisions about treating patients should be based on symptoms rather than radiographs. Although this study presents 1-year results, future research would include further follow-up of this cohort to assess the longer term effect of surgical and non-surgical management of these 44-B1 ankle fractures.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study demonstrate that surgical management is not superior to non-surgical management in type B ankle (fibula) fractures with minimal talar shift in the short term and is associated with increased adverse events.
