These daily tasks are difficult to comply with particularly in children and adolescents who are going through major physical, cognitive and psychological changes and have a risk-taking behavior.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2050312117694938" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> There is considerable evidence that children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) experience poorer health-related quality of life than their healthy peers.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2050312117694938" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> It is shown that increased flexibility in daily life is one of the most important benefits for improving quality of life for children with T1DM and their parents.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2050312117694938" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Quality of life for young people with T1DM centers on two major domains: treatment satisfaction and health perception. These two domains are directly related to various issues in diabetes management including lifestyle flexibility, anxiety over hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, feasibility of correcting abnormal glucose readings and covering extra meals and snacks with insulin.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2050312117694938" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The observation of improved treatment satisfaction can be seen with or without improved quality of life and the overall treatment satisfaction in diabetes management appears to be related to the method used for treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2050312117694938" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2050312117694938" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>In the recent decades, success of particular diabetes treatment method has been linked not only to diabetes metabolic outcome but also to its impact on patient&#x02019;s satisfaction and quality of life. Various instruments have been used to measure treatment satisfaction. Quality of life is often measured by Bradley Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (BDTSQ).<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2050312117694938" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Other customized questionnaires have also been used.</p><p>Health perception is defined as perception of physical, mental and social well-being. It can be assessed by rating of personal health status. Good health perception is shown to be strongly related to better metabolic control in children and adolescents with T1DM.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2050312117694938" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Diabetes management requires a great patient engagement and participation. Accordingly, more comprehensive understanding and appreciation of children&#x02019;s and parents&#x02019; treatment satisfaction are required. Better understanding of patients&#x02019; needs and attitude are critical for both the medical and psychological care of T1DM. We aim to examine the relationship between treatment satisfaction and health perception with the method used for treatment of T1DM in children and adolescents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods" id="section6-2050312117694938"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>A questionnaire was designed to assess treatment satisfaction and health perception with three different methods of insulin treatment: multiple daily injection (MDI), insulin pump therapy and sensor-augmented pump therapy. The questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first part contained eight items related to treatment satisfaction over various aspects of diabetes impact and management and the second part showing a scale for assessing health perception.</p><p>The eight items assessing treatment satisfaction analyzed four subscales: perceived general management (Q1&#x02013;3), feeling toward hypo and hyperglycemia (Q4&#x02013;5), perceived frequency of use of the treatment method to correct high blood glucose or give extra insulin for snacks (Q6&#x02013;7) and perceived compatibility of the treatment method with the lifestyle related to dietary habits (Q8). The response to each question was assessed by a scale ranging from 1 to 5. The higher the score, the higher the satisfaction. Each scale is indicated in three forms. First is a drawn symbol explained by text (two thumbs up for strongly agree, one thumb up for agree, a balance for neutral, one thumb down for disagree and two thumbs down for strongly disagree). The scale is also indicated arithmetically by numbers from 1 to 5 with 1 is the lowest and 5 the highest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2050312117694938">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1-2050312117694938" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Questionnaire used to assess treatment satisfaction.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2050312117694938-table1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Statement<hr/></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strongly agree<hr/></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Agree<hr/></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Neutral<hr/></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Disagree<hr/></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strongly disagree<hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Symbols<break/>Numerical scale</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/><inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2050312117694938-img1.jpg"/>5</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/><inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2050312117694938-img2.jpg"/>4</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/><inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2050312117694938-img3.jpg"/>3</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/><inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2050312117694938-img4.jpg"/>2</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/><inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2050312117694938-img5.jpg"/>1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">I feel generally good with my diabetes treatment</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">My treatment modality is easy and convenient</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">I feel confident with dealing with my diabetes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">I am not worried about hypoglycemia</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">I am not worried about hyperglycemia</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">I use correction doses when my blood sugar is high</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">I inject/bolus with snacks</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">My treatment does not restrict my dietary habits</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn1-2050312117694938"><p>Each symbol corresponds to the arithmetic scale indicated with the number underneath.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Health perception was assessed by a scale of 0&#x02013;100 with 0 indicating worst imaginable health and 100 as an indicator of best health possible.
