to 85% at sixth visit. The common morbidities during the follow-up period included
cough (28%), fever (17%), diarrhoea (9%) and rapid breathing (7%). During the
follow-up period, significantly more day care children (n=22 (OR 12.2 (95%
CI 8.2&#x02013;17.8))) required re-hospitalisation after completion of initial day
care compared with initial hospital care group (n=11 (OR 6.1 (95% CI

(85%) even at the end of 3&#x02005;months. Moreover, this impressive rate of
follow-up was spontaneous, around 95% of the children were brought by their
parents and no incentives were given. The identification of predictors for
failure including the presence of tachycardia, tachypnoea and hypoxaemia on
admission and prolonged duration of clinic/hospital stay are very important
strengths of the study. The number of minor illnesses developed during the
follow-up period was low (only 14%) and the requirement for medication
following recovery was also low (19%).</p></list-item><list-item><p>There were some important limitations in this study. First, we could not assess
sustainability of 3-month follow-up visits at the respective healthcare

not assess the feasibility of community follow-up, which can be done in future
studies.</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in under-5 children
causing about 1.6 million deaths every year globally.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> According to a recent report published in 2010, 18% of the total 8.8
million global deaths among under-5 children in 2008 were due to pneumonia.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> There is an estimated incidence of 151 million new
cases of childhood pneumonia each year globally, including 61 million cases in southeast
Asia, and 11&#x02013;20 million (7%&#x02013;13%) are severe enough to require
hospitalisation in developing countries.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref> An estimated 1.9 million children died from acute respiratory
infection globally in 2000 and 70% of these deaths occurred in Africa and Southeast
Asia.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In Bangladesh, acute lower respiratory infection
accounts for 25% of &#x0003c;5-year-old child deaths and 40% of infantile deaths.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Recent reports have shown that pneumonia accounts
for about 14% and 12% deaths from community-based<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
and hospital-based studies<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> of &#x0003c;5-year-old
child in Bangladesh, respectively. Although community case management of non-severe
pneumonia<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> as well as severe pneumonia by lady
health worker with oral antibiotics<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and
ambulatory home treatment with high-dose oral amoxicillin<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> has been reported from Pakistan, the WHO's guidelines for case
management of pneumonia still recommend that children with severe pneumonia require
facility-based management with parenteral antibiotics<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> but an inadequate number of paediatric beds limits hospital care in
Bangladesh. This inadequate capacity assuredly results in excess and unnecessary death
of children, who, with proper care, would otherwise survive. We, therefore, developed
the concept of a &#x02018;day care&#x02019; model<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref> through establishment of facilities at
&#x02018;outpatient clinics&#x02019; for management of common childhood illnesses, such as
severe acute malnutrition<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and severe
pneumonia,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> hoping to provide greater curative or case
management benefits to Bangladeshi children and thus reducing morbidity and deaths, the
results of which demonstrated that it is possible to successfully manage childhood
pneumonia with antibiotics, feeding and supportive care for a week.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, there is little information about
what happens after recovery from pneumonia and whether this recovery is sustained in
their homes over a longer period. Short-term successes, if not sustained, and/or if
associated with higher rates of relapse or recurrence or death would not be acceptable
as a public health intervention. The reasons for death, or relapse or other morbidities
need to be understood, and deaths are likely when medical care and treatment are
inaccessible. Therefore, we described the novelty of the current observational study by
comparing 3&#x02005;months outcomes post-discharge and also by providing some limited
data on the morbidity and mortality for severe pneumonia post-discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives of the study were (1) to describe the features of relapse, morbidity,
mortality and re-hospitalisation following successful discharge after severe pneumonia
in &#x0003c;5-year-old children in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh; (2) to compare the
compliance, relapse, morbidity, mortality and re-hospitalisation rates between an
outpatient-managed day care group and a hospital-managed group over 3&#x02005;months and
(3) to explore the predictors of treatment failures for 3&#x02005;months of
follow-up.</p><sec><title>Study design</title><p>An observational study following two cohorts of children with severe pneumonia who
were discharged either from the outpatient day care clinic or from the hospital after
recovery from their primary illness during the long-term post-management follow-up of
children enrolled in another randomised controlled trial.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</p></sec><sec><title>Settings</title><p>The day care was provided at the Radda Clinic and the hospital care was provided at
the Institute of Child Health and Shishu Sasthya Foundation Hospital (ICHSH), both
located at Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh. For the follow-up study, the Radda Clinic
remained open from 08:00 to 17:00&#x02005;h on each day including the weekends and
holidays, but the hospital remained open for 24&#x02005;h. Mothers usually came for
follow-up visits during the morning hours between 09:00 and 12:00, but only few came
in the afternoon. All the project staff including study physicians, nurses and
healthcare workers remained available at the clinic and hospital during the above
opening hours for conducting other ongoing projects during that period, and they were
also routinely performing the follow-up visits.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>In the above-mentioned original reference study,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> we compared the outpatient day care management with inpatient
hospitalised management of children of either sex, aged 2&#x02013;59&#x02005;months,
with severe pneumonia according to the WHO criteria.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> From September 2006 through November 2008, they were randomised to
receive day care management at a clinic or hospitalised management and then followed
up for 3&#x02005;months after discharge. The original study<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> including the follow-up was approved by the Research and
Ethical Review Committees of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease
Research, Bangladesh. A written informed consent including the 3-month follow-up
after discharge was obtained from the parents of each child before enrolment into the
study.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up study</title><p>After successful day care/hospital care management at the Radda Clinic/ICHSH with
antibiotics, food and supportive care, children were discharged,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> while the study physicians mentioned all the dates for
scheduled follow-up visits for the next 3&#x02005;months in the discharge certificate
and parents were advised to visit the respective clinic or hospital for follow-up
assessment every 2&#x02005;weeks for 3&#x02005;months. At each follow-up visit, the
study physician enquired the attending mothers/care givers about the signs and
symptoms of specific morbidities since the previous visit. Morbidity data like
respiratory (eg, cough, fever, running nose, difficulty in breathing, chest
indrawing, rales on auscultation), diarrhoeal or others (eg, eye, ear, nose and skin
infection, thrush, passage of worms) were recorded on a case report form. The vital
signs (pulse, respiration, temperature, body weight, length/height and oxygen
saturation) were recorded at each follow-up visit. The Z-scores for weight-for-age
and weight-for-height were calculated during each follow-up visit to assess changes
in nutritional status. We also recorded events such as relapses, deaths, unscheduled
extra-visits and re-hospitalisations. Any child developing pneumonia, diarrhoea or
other complications requiring re-hospitalisation during the follow-up period was
referred to the Dhaka Hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease
Research, Bangladesh/ICHSH for appropriate management. We also recorded the events
related to hospitalisation of each child during the 3-month follow-up period. Other
minor illnesses were treated by the study physician. Children who failed to attend
the clinic/hospital on scheduled follow-up dates were visited in their homes by a
healthcare worker next morning, who encouraged the parents to comply with follow-up
visits and accompanied them back to the clinic/hospital on the same day for recording
of all the above information by the study physician.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis including primary outcome measures</title><p>Success of day care/hospital care management at follow-up visits is defined as
compliance with each of the scheduled follow-up visits for 3&#x02005;months either
spontaneously or brought by the healthcare workers, without the need for
re-hospitalisation, or development of hypoxaemia and not dying during the whole
follow-up period. However, the failure of day care/hospital care management at
follow-up visits actually means re-hospitalisation, or development of hypoxaemia or
death at any time during the 3&#x02005;months of follow-up period. All data were
collected on pre-designed case report forms, edited, entered onto a personal computer
and analysed using statistical software, for example, Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS V.11.5; SPSS Inc), EPI Info V.6.0 and CIA. The primary outcome
measures were expressed as the proportion of successes and failures of day care
management at follow-up visits as determined by estimating ORs with their 95% CIs in
comparison with hospital care results. The study groups were compared at the time of
discharge from the clinic/hospital and during the follow-up period. The continuous
variables were compared between the groups using Student t test and non-parametric
tests. Dichotomous variables were compared using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or
Fisher' exact test, as appropriate. A probability of &#x0003c;0.05 was
considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In total, 360 children living in the Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh, with severe pneumonia
were enrolled into the original randomised controlled trial study<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and were equally (180 in each) assigned randomly to the
outpatient day care or inpatient hospital care (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure
1</xref>). The children were then followed up for 3&#x02005;months after discharge
from their primary treatment sites. The health status of the study children at the time
of discharge from the clinic/hospital is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref>. The mean age (SD) of the children was 8 (7)&#x02005;months, 291 (81%)
were infants (2&#x02013;11&#x02005;months), 220 (61%) were men and 330 (92%) were breast
fed with significantly more infants receiving the hospital care (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref>). Most of the children were well nourished without any
wasting, but only with a mild degree of under-nutrition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref>). About half of the children belonged to poor families
(48%) with a monthly income of about US$70, while 72% of the fathers were day
labourers or rickshaw-pullers, and 87% of the mothers were housewives.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile of children with severe pneumonia. RCT, randomised controlled

clinic/hospital as some children relapsed or developed morbidities, and others needed
unscheduled extra-clinic/hospital visits or re-hospitalisation, and a small number died
during this period. Results from our study suggest the need to establish routine
follow-up of children following successful management of severe pneumonia at healthcare
facilities in order to detect medical problems early and to enable appropriate
management and to prevent death. Such follow-up should be ideally done at the same
healthcare facilities where the children had received their initial treatment, but a
community follow-up system may be possible if trained and motivated community health
workers and adequate resources are available.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</p><p>In our study, the follow-up compliance reduced over time. However, it was still
impressive (85%) even at the end of 3&#x02005;months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">table 2</xref>)&#x02014;a finding of considerable importance. Moreover, this
impressive rate of follow-up was spontaneous&#x02014;around 95% children were brought by
their parents and the remaining 5% came after healthcare workers made home visits
encouraging them to come. In general, incentives were not given but the study did
support the conveyance costs of very poor families (4%) with a monthly income of about
US$30 only. The finding that significantly more day care children suffered from
rapid breathing and chest indrawing might be explained by the relatively more severe
illness defined by hypoxaemia among them compared with the hospital care group. But, the
hospital care group had significantly more feeding difficulty and diarrhoeal illness
leading to consumption of more medications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">table
3</xref>). The predictors for failure were the presence of tachycardia, tachypnoea
and hypoxaemia on admission and prolonged duration of stay. Therefore, children
presenting with tachycardia, tachypnoea and hypoxaemia on admission should be carefully
monitored and aggressively treated, as they are unlikely to improve with routine therapy
leading to prolonged stay. Similarly, the presence of tachycardia, tachypnoea and
hypoxaemia on admission are also indicators for severe illness leading to failure of
routine treatment.</p><p>Previous studies in Pakistan of community management of pneumonia by lady health worker
with oral antibiotics<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and ambulatory home
treatment with high-dose oral amoxicillin,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
without any necessity for referral to hospitals and without any injectable antibiotics,
as well as without needing any oxygen therapy for hypoxaemia, have been reported. Our
patient population probably had more severe disease judged by hypoxaemia, as 53% of our
children were hypoxaemic on admission.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</p><p>There were some important limitations to our study. We could not assess the
sustainability of a programme of 3-month follow-up visits at respective healthcare
facilities where children had received their initial treatment. The feasibility as well
as the sustainability of community follow-up should be assessed in future studies.</p><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Successful follow-up visits for 3&#x02005;months were possible in 81% of the day care
children, while it was possible in 90% of the hospital care children. However, the
remaining children failed to day care/hospital care management for
re-hospitalisation, or development of hypoxaemia or death during the follow-up
period. Children receiving apparently effective treatment of severe pneumonia
experienced considerable morbidity due to cough, fever, rapid breathing and diarrhoea
following discharge. The predictors for failure include the presence of tachycardia,
tachypnoea and hypoxaemia on admission and prolonged duration of stay. These findings
indicate the importance of follow-up of children with severe pneumonia irrespective
of their primary site of management (day care clinic or hospital) for early detection
and efficient management of subsequent medical problems and to reduce the risk of
death. Establishment of an effective community follow-up of non-compliant children,
whenever possible, would be ideal to address the problem of &#x02018;non-compliance
with follow-up&#x02019;.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The original randomised controlled trial comparing the day care management with hospital
