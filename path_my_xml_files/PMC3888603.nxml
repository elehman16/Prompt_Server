The study protocol and informed consent forms were approved by each centre's independent ethics committee or institutional review board.</p><p>After a 14-day screening, patients were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups: placebo or epratuzumab 200&#x02005;mg cumulative dose (cd) (100&#x02005;mg every other week (EOW)), 800&#x02005;mg cd (400&#x02005;mg EOW), 2400&#x02005;mg cd (600&#x02005;mg weekly), 2400&#x02005;mg cd (1200&#x02005;mg EOW), or 3600&#x02005;mg cd (1800&#x02005;mg EOW). These regimens were selected based on results of the prior ALLEVIATE studies with the aim of identifying effective and ineffective doses. Randomisation was via an interactive voice response system and was stratified according to disease activity (presence/absence of BILAG level A disease) and use of concomitant immunosuppressives (yes/no). All patients, investigators and study staff were blinded to treatment with the exception of an independent data safety monitoring board.</p><p>Epratuzumab (10&#x02005;mg/ml) was prepared in glass vials for slow intravenous infusion with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Placebo was 0.04 M PBS, and was provided in vials identical in number and appearance to the epratuzumab vials. Patients were premedicated with 25&#x02013;50&#x02005;mg diphenhydramine and 500&#x02013;1000&#x02005;mg acetaminophen 30&#x02013;60&#x02005;min before each infusion. Infusions occurred at weeks 0, 1, 2 and 3; those randomised to epratuzumab EOW received placebo on weeks 1 and 3. The main time-points for postbaseline efficacy evaluations were weeks 4, 8 and 12. At study completion, patients were offered entry into a long-term, open-label study, or had a safety visit 12&#x02005;weeks later.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint was the responder rate at week 12 according to a composite endpoint, BICLA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> that includes BILAG-2004,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>

The BILAG-2004 index was selected as the central score on the basis of its comprehensiveness, ability to capture partial improvement, and the clinical relevance of its scoring system. BILAG assessments were performed by the investigators, and grades were determined by an independent central reader group. Requirements for BICLA response were: (1) BILAG-2004 improvement (all A scores at baseline improved to B/C/D, and all B scores improved to C or D); (2) no worsening in disease activity (no new BILAG-2004 A scores and &#x02264;1 new B score); (3) no worsening of total SLEDAI-2K score from baseline; (4) no significant deterioration (&#x0003c;10% worsening) in 100&#x02005;mm visual analogue PGA and (5) no treatment failure (defined as non-protocol treatment, ie, new or increased immunosuppressives or antimalarials; or increased or parenteral corticosteroids; or premature discontinuation from study treatment). Following week 4, corticosteroid doses could be tapered off at the investigator's discretion, based on disease activity. Once tapered, corticosteroid doses could only be increased again to the dose preceding the last taper step; any larger increase was deemed a treatment failure. In addition, at no time was an increase of the corticosteroids dose above the baseline value allowed without meeting the definition of treatment failure.</p><p>Secondary efficacy endpoints included BICLA response at week 8, BILAG improvement and enhanced BILAG improvement at week 12, and changes in mean total SLEDAI-2K scores and corticosteroid doses at week 12 versus baseline. BILAG improvement was defined as for the primary endpoint. Enhanced BILAG improvement, representative of quiescent disease, was defined as all BILAG A or B scores at study entry improved to C or D, with no new BILAG A score and &#x02264;1 new B score in other organ systems.</p><p>Adverse events (AEs) were coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), V.8.0. Laboratory tests included haematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis, as well as SLE-associated parameters (eg, complement components 3 and 4 (C3 and C4) levels, human antihuman antibody (HAHA) levels, B-cell (CD20+) and T-cell (CD3+) numbers, and IgG, IgM, IgA and total immunoglobulin levels). B-cell surface levels of CD22 were assessed by flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The trial was not powered to detect statistically significant differences between arms, but to detect clinical improvement and support pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses. To achieve this, 30&#x02013;35 patients per arm were required. The primary efficacy analysis comprised a logistic regression model of treatment response status (yes/no), which controlled for baseline disease activity (BILAG A presence/absence) and use of concomitant immunosuppressive agents at baseline (yes/no), and allowed estimation of the overall treatment effect of epratuzumab. Exploratory pairwise comparisons between individual epratuzumab dose arms and placebo were also defined, including OR, 95% CI and p values. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis included all randomised patients.

Exploratory pairwise analysis using the BICLA endpoint found a higher proportion of responders in all arms than with placebo (23.7&#x02013;45.9%, vs 21.1% placebo), but most notably there were clinical improvements in the 600&#x02005;mg weekly (OR 3.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 8.8), nominal p=0.03) and 1200&#x02005;mg EOW arms (OR 2.6 (95% CI 0.9 to 7.1), nominal p=0.07) and in a combined analysis of the two 2400&#x02005;mg cd arms vs placebo (OR=2.9 (1.2 to 7.1), nominal p=0.02). The beneficial effects of 2400&#x02005;mg cd epratuzumab could be observed as early as week 8. Epratuzumab was well tolerated, with similar incidences of AEs, SAEs and infusion reactions as placebo and decreases in immunoglobulin levels outside normal ranges or changes in laboratory parameters.</p><p>These data build on the results of the ALLEVIATE trials, which provided preliminary evidence of the efficacy and safety of epratuzumab in patients with SLE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20 R21 R22">20&#x02013;22</xref> The BICLA composite endpoint used in EMBLEM was developed following an expert panel review of disease activity indices (DAIs) commonly used in SLE trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> BICLA is a robust, sensitive, composite, endpoint incorporating multiple DAIs, each of which emphasises different aspects of SLE activity. Composite endpoints have greater power than individual tools to identify differences between treatment groups, which is particularly useful in SLE, where patient populations are heterogeneous and disease progression is unpredictable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> The BILAG-2004 index, used as the key component of BICLA in EMBLEM, is a comprehensive validated tool for assessing disease activity in all organ systems, and is capable of measuring incremental improvement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> For a patient to be classified as a BICLA responder, improvements were required in all BILAG 2004 index organ systems affected by the disease at baseline, a relatively stringent response criterion. Notably, a low number of responders was observed in the placebo arm using the BICLA endpoint.</p><p>Rules on background medication use were stringent, with any increase from baseline dose of immunosuppressives, corticosteroids or antimalarial medication at any time during the study classified as a treatment failure. Following week 4, corticosteroid doses could be tapered off gradually according to the investigator's assessment of disease activity. However, at week 12, changes from baseline in corticosteroid use were minimal across all arms, which may be because of the relatively low mean dose at baseline (13.7&#x02005;mg) and/or the short duration of the study. Exploratory analyses showed that 600&#x02005;mg weekly epratuzumab was associated with greater resolution of disease activity in BILAG 2004 systems than placebo in all six body systems that could be evaluated, including the cardiorespiratory and neuropsychiatric systems. The study was not of sufficient duration to assess the effects of epratuzumab on SLE-associated damage.</p><p>Epratuzumab is one of a number of biological agents in development for the treatment of SLE. Major targets of these agents include B cells, T cells and cytokines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> To date, however, success has been limited by the challenges associated with measurement of disease activity, the need for active background therapy in clinical trials, and the importance of avoiding changes or increases in background immunosuppressives and corticosteroids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> Epratuzumab is the first CD22-specific treatment to be tested in clinical trials of SLE. In the EMBLEM trial, surface levels of CD22 on peripheral B cells were reduced in patients treated with epratuzumab, but not in those receiving placebo. In vitro studies have shown that epratuzumab induces CD22 phosphorylation and internalisation, which in turn leads to modulation of B-cell activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Indeed, a decrease in the phosphorylation of Syk and phospholipase &#x003b3;2a downstream signalling events following activation of the B-cell receptor, as well as inhibition of calcium flux, have been observed following epratuzumab treatment of B cells in vitro.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> Unlike rituximab, epratuzumab only partially reduces B-cell numbers and, therefore, it is possible to speculate that this agent may not be associated with decreases in immunoglobulin levels or an increased risk of infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Indeed, no decreases in immunoglobulin levels outside normal ranges were observed during EMBLEM. Of note, some modulatory effects of epratuzumab on B-cell activity are specific to SLE patients, such that the in vitro proliferation of B cells is reduced by epratuzumab in SLE patients but not in normal subjects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Other studies have shown that epratuzumab modulates expression of the adhesion molecules CD62L, &#x003b2;7 and &#x003b2;1 integrin, and enhances the migration of CD27-negative naive B cells towards the chemokine CXCL12.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> Median B-cell counts decreased only moderately from baseline in the active-treatment arms of EMBLEM. Additional work is needed to fully define the mechanism of action of epratuzumab. The mechanisms responsible for the low response rate seen with the highest tested dose (3600&#x02005;mg cd), although consistent with the results of the earlier ALLEVIATE studies, also require further investigation. High doses of epratuzumab may affect a specific function of B cells, a particular subset of B cells, the trafficking of B cells into different anatomical compartments and/or induce alternative signalling events not seen at lower doses.</p><p>The results of the EMBLEM trial suggest that epratuzumab can improve SLE disease activity, and support continued development of this treatment. Phase III studies of epratuzumab have been initiated (NCT01261793; NCT01262365). These placebo-controlled studies will assess the efficacy and safety of both 2400&#x02005;mg cd regimens in patients with moderately to severely active SLE over four 12-week treatment cycles. Such studies will also provide insights into factors such as the sustainability of treatment responses over time and the effects of epratuzumab on steroid use and quality of life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2012-202760-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1271" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank all the investigators, their staff and the patients that were involved with the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> DJW contributed to the design and execution of the study, interpretation of data and preparation of manuscript.
