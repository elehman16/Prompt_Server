Calves may have greater Se requirements during periods of stress, such as during the transitional period between weaning and movement to a feedlot. Previously, we showed that feeding Se-fertilized forage increases whole-blood (WB) Se concentrations in mature beef cows. Our current objective was to test whether feeding Se-fertilized forage increases WB-Se concentrations and performance in weaned beef calves. Recently weaned beef calves (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;60) were blocked by body weight, randomly assigned to 4 groups, and fed an alfalfa hay based diet for 7 wk, which was harvested from fields fertilized with sodium-selenate at a rate of 0, 22.5, 45.0, or 89.9 g Se/ha. Blood samples were collected weekly and analyzed for WB-Se concentrations. Body weight and health status of calves were monitored during the 7-wk feeding trial. Increasing application rates of Se fertilizer resulted in increased alfalfa hay Se content for that cutting of alfalfa (0.07, 0.95, 1.55, 3.26 mg Se/kg dry matter for Se application rates of 0, 22.5, 45.0, or 89.9 g Se/ha, respectively). Feeding Se-fertilized alfalfa hay during the 7-wk preconditioning period increased WB-Se concentrations (<italic>P</italic>

Provision of adequate Se is important to prevent Se-responsive diseases in growing cattle such as nutritional myodegeneration and Se-responsive unthriftiness <xref rid="pone.0058188-Koller1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Many parts of the world, including Oregon, USA, are known to have soil conditions conducive to deficient forage-Se content, potentially leading to clinical signs of Se deficiency in livestock grazing or fed crops raised on them <xref rid="pone.0058188-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Soils are the major source of Se for plants and soil-Se exits in various forms including selenides, elemental Se, selenites, selenates and organic Se compounds <xref rid="pone.0058188-Surai1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Soil-Se content varies considerably depending upon geographic location. Low soil pH and high concentrations of sulfur and phosphorus from fertilization decrease Se availability for plants. Leaching from the topsoil in areas of high rainfall or irrigation also lowers forage-Se content. Plant species also differ in their ability to incorporate Se from soil. Most forage plants are categorized as non-Se accumulator plants.</p><p>The bioavailability of Se is not straightforward because of wide variation in Se content of foods (determined by a combination of geographical and environmental factors) and chemical forms in which Se may be absorbed and metabolized <xref rid="pone.0058188-FairweatherTait1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In general, organic forms are absorbed and retained more efficiently than inorganic forms <xref rid="pone.0058188-Qin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058188-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Selenium is normally present in the diet in organic forms, e.g., as selenomethionine (SeMet) or selenocysteine (SeCys) <xref rid="pone.0058188-Whanger1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Inorganic Na-selenite and Na-selenate are present in the diet in very small amounts.</p><p>Although the essentiality of Se has been known for five decades, the most effective method of Se delivery to cattle for optimum performance is still being investigated. Several means of administering Se to deficient ruminants are available <xref rid="pone.0058188-Surai2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. For example, there are a number of injectable preparations, which often include vitamin E. Selenium can also be added to feed, mineral, and protein supplements. Sustained-release boluses with a life of several months may be used. Because of their weight, these boluses stay in the rumen whereby they gradually release Se. Selenium supplemented by these methods is usually inorganic Na-selenite or Na-selenate. One limitation of supplementing with inorganic Se in salt or feed is the apparent short duration of Se storage in the animal <xref rid="pone.0058188-Surai2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058188-Surai3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Other limitations to these methods of Se delivery include individual variation or sporadic intake, extra labor requirements, added expenses, and seasonal grazing practices that result in limited access to Se for extended periods of time. Therefore, animals may be Se deficient by the end of the grazing season.</p><p>Agronomic biofortification is defined as increasing the bioavailable concentrations of essential elements in edible portions of crop plants through the use of fertilizers. The potential for using Se-containing fertilizers to increase forage Se concentrations and, thus, dietary Se intake has been demonstrated in Finland, New Zealand, and Australia where it has proven to be both effective and safe <xref rid="pone.0058188-Broadley1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0058188-Whelan3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The predominant chemical form of Se in Se-fortified grains and hays is SeMet <xref rid="pone.0058188-Whanger1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We previously reported that Se-replete beef cows fed Se-fertilized forage for 6 wk had elevated WB-Se concentrations for 20 wk, which ensured adequate WB-Se while grazing forage on Se-deficient soils <xref rid="pone.0058188-Hall2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We have also shown that the FDA-approved supplementation rate for sheep (0.3 mg of Se/kg of diet as fed, which is equivalent to 0.7 mg of Se/d or 4.9 mg of Se/wk per sheep) for organic Se supplementation was equally effective as supranutritional rates of Na-selenite supplementation (14.7 and 24.5 mg of Se/wk) in increasing whole-blood (WB) Se concentrations, demonstrating the greater oral bioavailability of organic Se in sheep. In addition, short-term exposure to Se-fertilized forage results in whole-body Se status sufficient to maintain adequate WB-Se concentrations throughout grazing periods when there is limited access to Se supplements <xref rid="pone.0058188-Hall3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In another study Stewart et al. <xref rid="pone.0058188-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> showed that growth and survival was better in lambs from ewes receiving Se-yeast at 5 times the FDA-allowed supplementation rate compared to lambs from ewes receiving the FDA-allowed supplementation rate or no Se.</p><p>The transition period between weaning and movement to a feedlot is one of the most stressful times for beef calves. Because Se plays an important role in the immune response in cattle <xref rid="pone.0058188-Finch1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, calves may have greater Se requirements during the transitional period. Performance in weaned beef calves is enhanced if a preconditioning program is utilized before calves enter the feedlot. Several weeks in a preconditioning program are recommended to reduce the stress associated with weaning, dehorning, castration, and vaccination with the goal of reducing morbidity and mortality after arrival at the feedlot. Preconditioning also reduces the number of calves pulled to sick pens, and improves weight gain and feed efficiency of calves after arrival at a feedlot <xref rid="pone.0058188-Cole1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0058188-Duff1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate WB-Se status and performance in weaned beef calves fed alfalfa hay fertilized with Se at increasing rates for 7 wk in a preconditioning program prior to entering the feedlot. We hypothesized that feeding weaned beef calves forage fertilized with increasing amounts of Na-selenate would improve both WB-Se status and growth rate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animal Ethics Statement and Study Design</title><p>The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the Oregon State University Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUP Number: 4051). This was a prospective clinical trial of 7-wk duration (August 29 through October 14, 2010) involving 60 weaned beef calves, primarily of Angus breeding. The calves ranged in age from 4.5 to 6 mo (166&#x000b1;2 d; mean &#x000b1; SEM) and originated from the Oregon State University Beef Ranch, Corvallis, OR, USA. Body weights at weaning ranged from 181 to 310 kg (239&#x000b1;3.6 kg, mean &#x000b1; SEM), and body condition scores ranged from 6 to 7 (1 to 9 scale). There were 27 heifers and 33 steer calves in the study.</p><p>Corvallis is located at an elevation of 72 m, midway in the Willamette Valley, 74 km east of the Oregon Coast, and 137 km south of Portland. Like the rest of the Willamette Valley, Corvallis falls within the Marine West Coast climate zone with some Mediterranean characteristics. Temperatures are mild year round, with warm, dry, sunny summers and mild, wet winters with persistent overcast skies. Spring and fall are also moist seasons with persistent cloudiness, and light rain falling for extended periods. Winter snow is rare, but occasionally does fall, usually in the form of heavy wet snow, ranging between a dusting to several cm that does not persist on the ground for more than a day. During the mid-winter months after extended periods of rain, thick persistent fogs can form, sometimes lasting the entire day. Rainfall total is surprisingly variable, ranging from an average of 168.7 cm per year in the far northwest hills to 110.9 cm per year at Oregon State University, which is located in the center of Corvallis. Typical distribution of precipitation includes about 50 percent of the annual total from December through February, lesser amounts in the spring and fall, and very little during summer. Rainfall tends to vary inversely with temperatures, with the cooler months being the wettest, and the warmer summer months being the driest. Because of its close proximity to the coast range, Corvallis can experience slightly cooler temperatures, particularly in the hills, compared with the rest of the Willamette Valley. Despite this, temperatures dropping below freezing are a rare event. Average monthly temperatures for September are 25.1&#x000b0;C (high) and 9.0&#x000b0;C (low).</p><p>Using a randomized complete block design, calves were blocked at the time of weaning by body weight (BW) and then assigned to one of 4 treatment groups of 15 calves each. Ear tags were used to identify the calves. All calves were put together in a large dry field and fed non Se-fortified grass hay for 4 d. Calves were then placed by treatment group into dry barn lots (11&#x02013;15 m<sup>2</sup>/calf; concrete flooring in open lots that were strip cleaned once weekly; dirt flooring in loafing sheds with 5&#x02013;6 m<sup>2</sup>/calf; concrete bunks with 64&#x02013;97 cm of feeder space/calf; all measurements exceeded requirements <xref rid="pone.0058188-MWPS61" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>) with continuous access to water, feed bunks, and shelter. Calves were fed alfalfa hay once daily. The alfalfa hay was grown in fields fertilized with sodium-selenate at an application rate of 0, 22.5, 45.0, or 89.9 g Se/ha. Calves were transitioned to their respective alfalfa hay sources over a 10-d period. Alfalfa hay was fed as follows: 0.64 kg/head/d 1; 0.79 kg/head/d 2; 1.59 kg/head/d 3; 3.2 kg/head/d 4 to 7; 4.77 kg/head/d 8 to 11; and 6.4 kg/head/d 12. In addition, grass hay was offered for the first 10 d, and then discontinued. By the beginning of the third wk, calves were consuming on average 6.4 kg (as fed) of alfalfa hay per head, which was approximately 2.6% of their BW. A specified quantity of hay was offered each day and intake was uniform among groups. Hay was available all day, but by the next morning bunkers were empty and less than 5% of hay (visual estimate) was wasted on the ground.</p><p>In addition, calves were fed grain-based concentrate (0.23 kg as fed/head/d for 5 wk and then 0.46 kg as fed/head/d for 2 wk; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058188-t001">

Grain concentrate was offered once a day beginning the day calves were placed into the barn lots; grain was placed into the bunkers and consumed before hay was fed. The grain concentrate consisted of 34% steam flaked corn, USDA grade 2; 28% rolled barley; 19% wheat middlings; 10% dried distiller&#x02019;s grains with solubles from an ethanol plant; and 4% dried distiller&#x02019;s grains containing mainly wheat. The ration was formulated for growing beef calves in the 200 to 300 kg weight range to achieve a target average daily gain of 0.5 kg/d.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0058188-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0058188.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Alfalfa hay and grain concentrate nutrient composition (dry matter basis).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0058188-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0058188.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nutrient</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alfalfa Hay</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GrainConcentrate</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dry matter, g/kg</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">906</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">944</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Crude protein, g/kg</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">183</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">158</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Acid detergent fiber, g/kg</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">351</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">84</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Neutral detergent fiber, g/kg</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">406</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">148</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nonfiber carbohydrates, g/kg<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">1</xref>

During the first 10 d of the feeding trial, calculated Se intake from the bloat block was 1.55 mg Se/head/d.

The non-Se fortified alfalfa hay (0.07 mg Se/kg dry matter) was below this level. We were able to provide additional dietary Se using Se-fortified alfalfa hay. Our results for WB-Se concentrations in weaned beef calves fed Se-biofortified hay are similar to what we reported <xref rid="pone.0058188-Hall2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> when grazing adult beef cattle on Se-fertilized forage.

There results were not confounded by morbidly because none of the calves were sick during the 7-wk preconditioning period. None experienced bloating, went off feed, or showed any clinical signs of illness. These results are consistent with our previous results for lambs <xref rid="pone.0058188-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> whereby ewes raising multiples that received the highest Se-yeast dose (24.5 mg Se/wk) had heavier lambs at weaning (120 d of age) in yr 1 of supplementation and at 60 d of age in yr 2 of supplementation than ewes receiving Se-yeast at the maximum FDA-allowed level (4.9 mg Se/wk).</p><p>Selenium&#x02019;s role in animal performance is based upon the functions of selenoproteins, many of which have antioxidant activities <xref rid="pone.0058188-FairweatherTait1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although reactive oxygen species and free radicals are a natural result of the body&#x02019;s normal metabolic activity, excessive stress as a result of weaning, dietary and environmental changes, comingling with other animals, and disease can lead to the over production of free radicals or accumulation of free radicals because of a lack of antioxidants. Therefore, it is important that micronutrients involved in antioxidant functions be present in tissues to provide oxidant-antioxidant balance. Although the level of Se supplementation needed for adequate performance may be less under optimum conditions, in periods of transition such as weaning, preconditioning, and shipping, where stress is a confounding factor for optimum performance, Se requirements may be increased.</p><p>Because all calves were visually healthy, it is unlikely that the observed BW response to Se supplementation is explained solely by the antioxidant activity of selenoproteins. Two selenoprotein families, the iodothyronine deiodinases, responsible for metabolism of thyroid hormones, and the thioredoxin reductases, responsible for reducing thioredoxin, are directly or indirectly through regulation of transcription factors, involved in cell growth and control of apoptosis, as well as maintenance of cellular redox status <xref rid="pone.0058188-Rooke1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Our results suggest that supranutritional Se supplementation may have growth-promoting properties in beef cattle. Future studies are warranted to examine the effects of supranutritional Se supplementation on gene and protein expression of the iodothyronine deiodinases, thioredoxin reductases, and transcription factors regulating cell growth.</p><p>In summary, Se fertilization of alfalfa fields in a region with Se deficient soils increased in a dose-dependent manner the Se content of alfalfa hay. Supranutritional Se supplementation of recently weaned beef calves with Se-fortified alfalfa hay resulted in increased WB-Se concentrations and improved growth rates. Our results suggest that building Se-body reserves by feeding supranutritional Se levels from sodium-selenate fertilized alfalfa hay during the preconditioning program is an effective management strategy to optimize growth and health in weaned beef calves.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Appreciation is expressed to KC Bare and Opal Springs Farms, LLC, Culver, OR for precise Se application rates to alfalfa fields and growing the alfalfa hay for the conduct of these experiments.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0058188-Koller1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
