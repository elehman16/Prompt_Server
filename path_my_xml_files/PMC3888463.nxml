Ethnic groups compared were African Americans, non-U.S. blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and Caucasians. EVR groups received either 1.5 or 3 mg per day, with either standard-dose cyclosporine or reduced-dose cyclosporine. Control groups received mycophenolic acid (MPA) with standard-dose cyclosporine. Composite efficacy failure endpoint was graft loss, death, biopsy-proven acute rejection, or lost to follow-up.

This pooled data analysis, including more than 2000 renal transplant recipients administered EVR or MPA, demonstrated that EVR is associated with similar efficacy as MPA regardless of recipient ethnicity. Of note, EVR and MPA did not significantly differ in efficacy specifically in African Americans, a renal transplant population at increased risk for poorer clinical outcomes. These results also suggest that non-U.S. black renal transplant recipients have similar clinical outcomes as Caucasian recipients, whereas Asian and Hispanic recipients have improved clinical outcomes.</p><p>Consistent with these results, United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data show that Asian and Hispanic kidney transplant recipients have the highest short-term and long-term graft and patient survival rates (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). UNOS data also demonstrate that African-American transplant recipients of deceased donors had lower rates of graft survival compared with other races and ethnicities at 1, 5, and 10 years after transplantation, whereas African Americans of living donor recipients had lower rates of long-term graft survival (i.e., 5 and 10 years after transplantation) compared with other races and ethnicities (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). In this study, the overall odds for experiencing a composite endpoint was significantly increased for African-American renal transplant recipients compared with Caucasians, corroborating previous reports that African Americans have an increased risk for poorer clinical outcomes, irrespective of treatment. Although this analysis did not explore the relationship of EVR and long-term outcomes in African Americans, results from a recently published analysis suggested that EVR may be associated with improved kidney graft survival particularly in patients of deceased donor transplants, despite a numerically greater number of rejection episodes (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>).</p><p>We found that renal transplant recipients outside of the United States who self-identified themselves as black had similar outcomes as Caucasian recipients. The analysis of non-U.S. blacks was limited due to a small sample size. However, the results were consistent with those from a study from Canada of black Canadians (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>) and from a study from France of black Europeans (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). Both the Canadian and French studies found similar clinical outcomes between the blacks and whites in the respective studies. In the present study, the non-U.S. black recipients had a mixture of high-risk and low-risk characteristics. Non-U.S. black recipients had an incidence of DGF that was similar to African Americans; they also had the highest proportion of recipients with three or more HLA mismatches. Conversely, the non-U.S. black group had a greater proportion of living donors. Interestingly, the CsA dosing of non-U.S. black recipients appeared to be more similar to the dosing employed in non-black recipients than African-American recipients. There are likely a myriad of factors that contribute to the discrepancy in outcomes between African Americans and other ethnic groups (e.g., access to care, biological differences, and comorbidities). The underlying reasons for differences in clinical outcomes are beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>The MPA group was found to have significantly higher mean creatinine clearance compared with the EVR groups. Those results are confounded by the fact that of the three trials included in the pooled analysis, only one (study 2309) used the current approved immunosuppression regimen of low-dose CsA throughout the duration of the study with therapeutic dose monitoring of EVR. Analysis of creatinine clearance (CKD-EPI; mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) among African Americans in the 2309 study showed no significant differences between the MPA (52.3), EVR 1.5 mg (51.8), and EVR 3.0 mg (55.6) groups (<italic>data on file</italic>). Overall, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) results in the EVR group suggest that if African-American renal transplant recipients have comparable renal function at 1 year after transplantation, they may continue to have good renal function longer-term after transplantation.</p><p>Clinical outcomes after kidney transplantation are currently characterized by low acute rejection rates and high 1-year graft and patient survival (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>); however, long-term graft and patient survival is not optimal (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19&#x02013;22</italic></xref>). Identifying immunosuppression drug regimens that are associated with decreasing the leading causes of long-term graft failure and patient death is a key focus of current transplant research efforts. In addition, employing immunosuppressants that are associated with efficacy particularly in populations at increased risk for poorer clinical outcomes may help to improve overall graft and patient survival rates. These data demonstrate good efficacy in a high-risk group of recipients. Previously reported data show that EVR has particular promise as an immunosuppressive drug that may attenuate causes of long-term graft loss and death (based on its efficacy in the face of low-dose CNIs as well as on its demonstrated cardioprotective and antitumor effects) (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23, 24</italic></xref>). The results from the present analysis add to the growing body of literature affirming the role of EVR as an important immunosuppressive in the cache of drugs available for immunosuppression therapy after kidney transplantation.</p><p>The proportion of African Americans in this study was lower than that of the general U.S. kidney transplant population. From the most recently available UNOS data, 31% of renal transplant recipients of deceased donors and 13% of renal transplant recipients of living donors transplanted in 2008 were African Americans (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Based on the proportion of deceased versus living donors in the current study, 24% of the overall sample would be expected to be African American to mirror the ethnic breakdown of the U.S. transplantation trends; in this study, approximately 9% were African American. Due to the relatively small numbers of African Americans, we may have been underpowered to detect some important differences.</p><p>Basiliximab was permitted in one of the three trials (A2309) pooled in this analysis; there is the potential that differences in basiliximab use by ethnicity may have impacted the efficacy results. The small number of patients after stratification by basiliximab use and ethnicity, and the use of basiliximab in only one of the three included trials precluded a meaningful analysis to examine this potential confounder.</p><p>Generalizing the results from this analysis to the general U.S. population of kidney transplant recipients may be limited by the fact that participants in clinical trials may differ from nonparticipants and that the clinician&#x02019;s treating behavior may also differ from that of a nontrial setting. Overall, these results showed that EVR was associated with similar efficacy as MPA in the African-American population. Further study is warranted to determine if EVR is associated with similar or improved, or inferior, long-term outcomes compared with MPA across ethnic groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Data Sources and Endpoints</title><p>Data from three randomized clinical trials were pooled for the present analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Incidence of and the adjusted odds of meeting a composite endpoint defined as graft loss, death, treated BPAR, or lost to follow-up after renal transplantation were compared between renal transplant recipients who received 1.5 mg per day EVR, 3.0 mg per day EVR, and MPA, separately for African-American recipients, non-U.S. black recipients, Asians, Hispanics, and Caucasians. All patient follow-up data were included; thus, outcomes were assessed for up to 5 years follow-up. Creatinine clearance at 1 and 2 years after transplantation and at end of study was also compared between the EVR and MPA groups among the ethnic groups. Creatinine was measure centrally (Jaffe method). The CKD-EPI equation (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>) was used to estimated GFR. The CKD-EPI formulation has been shown to be a more accurate estimation of GFR than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formulation (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25, 26</italic></xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Description of the study designs of the three trials from which data were pooled for the present analysis.

In brief, studies B201 (n=588) and B251 (n=583) were both 12-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group equivalence trials of two oral fixed doses of EVR (1.5 mg/day, B201 [n=194] and B251 [n=193] or 3 mg/day, B201 [n=198] and B251 [n=194]) versus mycophenolate mofetil (B201 [n=196] and B251 [n=196]); all three groups also received standard dosing of CsA microemulsion (Neoral) and corticosteroids. The original protocols for both studies were finalized in April 1998; in January 2001, both protocols were amended to reduced-dose CsA. EVR blood levels were recorded prospectively within these studies. Study A2309 (n=833) was a 24-month, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group noninferiority trial of two oral concentration-controlled doses of EVR (1.5 mg/day, targeted to trough levels of 3&#x02013;8 ng/mL [n=277] and 3.0 mg/day, targeted to 6&#x02013;12 ng/mL [n=279]) versus enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (n=277). EVR was administered with reduced-dose CsA, whereas enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium was with standard-dose CsA. All three groups received basiliximab induction, and steroids were used according to local center practice.</p><p>Key exclusion criteria for all three studies included kidneys donated after cardiac death or with a cold ischemia time more than 40 hr; donor age more than 65 years; or recipients of multiorgan, ABO-incompatible, positive T-cell crossmatch, or HLA-identical living-related donor transplants. In A2309, an additional exclusion criteria was most recent anti-HLA class I panel-reactive antibodies more than 20% by a complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)&#x02013;based assay or more than 50% by flow cytometry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, in study A2309, patients were excluded if they did not have graft function within 24 hr after transplantation.</p><p>All studies were approved by the Ethics Committee at all participating institutions and conducted according to the recommendations of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the original studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel generalized association test controlled for study was used to compare categorical data between groups; analysis of variance with treatment and study as factors was used to compare continuous data.
