Provision of nutritional support usually requires tube feeding, which is typically achieved by pump-assisted continuous feeding into the stomach at low rate (50&#x02013;100&#x0200a;mL/h) spread out over 12 to 24&#x0200a;hours per day using a fine-bore nasogastric tube.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Although tube feeding has been shown to reduce mortality in undernourished hospitalized patients,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> it can be associated with a number of gastrointestinal complications. The most common tube feeding-associated gastrointestinal symptom is diarrhea, occurring in up to 30% of enterally fed patients on hospital wards and over 60% of patients on intensive care units.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Although tube feeding-related diarrhea can result from a number of factors, the mode of feed delivery may be a major contributor to the etiology. Some studies suggest that bolus feeding causes more abdominal bloating, nausea, and diarrhea<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> than continuous feeding, but others have reported the converse.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Bolus feeding, in contrast to continuous feeding, is considered a more physiological mode of delivery. In replicating normal patterns of feeding, bolus delivery allows the phased supply of hypertonic nutrient loads into the jejunum reducing the metabolic demand on the small intestine and possibly preventing excessive accumulation of jejunal fluid.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>The mode of delivery of feeds is also known to affect water absorption and motor responses in the colon via neurohumoral mechanisms involving peptide YY as well as affecting gastric emptying via the gastric hormone ghrelin. In human studies, polymeric diets infused either intragastrically or intraduodenally at low or high loads resulted in differing colonic responses with no change observed in small bowel motility or colonic in-flow, suggesting a predominant effect on the colon. Additional studies demonstrate that intragastric fluid loads increase fluid secretion in the ascending colon, indicating that intragastric bolus feeds may increase fluid delivery to the distal colon and possibly lead to diarrhea.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>It is possible that these changes and small bowel fluid flux may lead to excessive fluid loads reaching the colon. Although previous studies have indicated that small bowel motility remains unchanged in response to intragastric or intraduodenal feeding,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> small bowel water content in the context of bolus or continuous feeding remains poorly defined.</p><p>We hypothesized that small bowel water content is influenced by the mode of feed delivery and could contribute to the etiology of gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by tube fed patients. The aim of this study was, therefore, to establish the different effects of continuous and bolus nasogastric feeding on gastric emptying, small bowel water content, and splanchnic blood flow as measured by serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the context of changes in plasma gastrointestinal hormone secretion.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design and Setting</title><p>This was a randomized, unblinded 2-way crossover study on healthy human volunteers.

Other nutrients that stimulate cholecystokinin release are likely to play a part in gastric emptying but probably to a lesser extent than glucose as many complex proteins and fats require enzymatic hydrolysis in the small bowel facilitated by pancreatic exocrine secretion. More important perhaps is the rate of delivery with bolus feeding causing gastric distension. Animal studies using isotonic saline indicate that elevations in gastric pressure increase the rate of gastric emptying of fluids<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and this may have contributed to faster gastric emptying seen with the bolus strategy in this study. It has also been reported previously that increased gastric filling increases intragastric pressure as well as gastric emptying rate.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>The rate of gastric emptying is known to affect subsequent plasma glucose concentrations, although hyperglycemia is tightly controlled by regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1, and gastric inhibitory polypeptide. In this study, insulin responses corresponded closely with gastric liquid volumes. By the time gastric emptying was complete in the bolus group at 180 minutes, the insulin concentrations had returned toward fasted values. In contrast, elevated plasma insulin concentration was observed beyond 180 minutes with the continuous strategy, probably as a result of sustained duodenal glucose delivery. The maximal capacity of glucose absorption from the small intestine into the systemic circulation is reported to be in the region of 2 kcal/min (8.37&#x0200a;kJ/min) per 30&#x0200a;cm.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Thus delivery of carbohydrate at rates of 1.9 kcal/min (7.95&#x0200a;kJ/min) in the bolus and 1.4 kcal/min (5.86&#x0200a;kJ/min) in the continuous group are adequate to facilitate complete absorption within the small bowel and avoid excessive fluid efflux due to high osmotic loads.</p><p>Previous studies have indicated that tube feeding-related diarrhea is likely to be a disorder of colonic function rather than small intestinal motility<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> although the small bowel response to different feeds and strategies remains ill-defined.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Both feeding strategies were characterized by a fall in small bowel water content, an effect which has been demonstrated previously and is likely due to net intestinal absorption.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Small molecule carbohydrates are hydrolyzed by enzymes in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which increases their solubility and hence their rate of delivery to the duodenum where they are absorbed rapidly along with water. Complex molecules, on the other hand, such as fat, protein, and undigested polysaccharides, have delayed entry into the small bowel where their osmotic potential results in the efflux of water into the lumen.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> This may account for the increase in small bowel water content after 90 minutes with bolus feeding, mediated by a combination of gastric emptying and small bowel fluid secretion.</p><p>Postprandial gastric emptying and the absorption of fluid in the small bowel and colon have been shown to be under the influence of a number of gastrointestinal hormones released in response to nutrient intake.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> In particular, the relationship between cholecystokinin and peptide YY has been highlighted as providing humoral enterogastric feedback to slow gastric emptying and small intestinal transit in what has been termed the &#x0201c;ileal brake.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Disturbances of gastric emptying and small bowel motility are often a feature of patients receiving tube feeding particularly in the setting of critical care, and it is possible that aberrant release of these regulatory hormones could contribute to tube feeding-related diarrhea. Postprandial peptide YY concentrations are known to increase, but there is a calorie threshold of at least 530 kcal (2.22 MJ) below which no rise is observed.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> This is consistent with the results of this study with elevations in postprandial peptide YY concentrations seen with bolus feeding [total 606 kcal (2.54 MJ)] but a slower response obtained with continuous feeding [total 151 kcal/h (632&#x0200a;kJ/h)] requiring 3.5&#x0200a;hours to exceed the caloric threshold. It follows, therefore, that maximal peptide YY concentrations using the continuous strategy would only be obtained after 3&#x0200a;hours of feeding have elapsed. Complete gastric emptying and transit of nutrients to the distal small bowel to facilitate nutrient stimulated release of peptide YY probably occurs only after 180 minutes. The primary effect of peptide YY is to increase absorption in the small bowel, and although this could account for the reduction in small bowel water content seen initially with bolus feeding, the same cannot be said for continuous feeding where peptide YY concentrations remain modest until much later. This discrepancy is not simple to explain, although it is possible that the relative contribution to fluid absorption of regulatory hormones in different areas of the gut could differ. In human surgical specimens, peptide YY concentrations are found to be highest in the sigmoid colon, suggesting that this may be the site of maximal activity.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> It is also possible that drip feeding failed to switch on the complete fed response, which, in the absence of ileal brakes, could lead to malabsorbed fat entering the colon, triggering diarrhea and other symptoms.</p><p>Another hormone implicated in regulation of gastric emptying and the intake of nutrients is ghrelin, produced by endocrine cells located within gastric mucosa. In this study, plasma ghrelin concentrations demonstrated a typical decrease after ingestion of carbohydrate and fat. It has previously been reported that nutrient-stimulated effects on ghrelin secretion reaches maximal suppression by 1 hour,<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> although in this study, concentrations continued to fall after 2&#x0200a;hours. Previous studies have indicated that gastric distension does not play a significant role in the control of ghrelin secretion and this would be consistent with the results in this study. Although suppression of ghrelin after both feeding strategies was of a similar magnitude, ghrelin concentrations were lower after bolus feeding and is likely to be due to the greater nutrient delivery encountered by the small bowel. Very little is known regarding the action of ghrelin on small intestinal fluid flux, although studies have indicated that ghrelin increases pancreatic exocrine secretion and may increase small bowel water content in this way. In the critical care setting, plasma concentrations of ghrelin are suppressed with return to normal plasma levels on recovery. It may be that the influence of ghrelin on intestinal fluid flux is different in patients receiving tube feeding although this is yet to be studied in detail.</p><p>Both splanchnic blood volume and flow is known to increase in response to feeding and may be due to the vasoactive properties of carbohydrate, fat, and protein.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> In addition, studies in both animals and humans have suggested that gastric distension can be a stimulus for changes in superior mesenteric artery flow although the mechanisms underlying this effect are unclear.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> In this study, both superior mesenteric artery velocity and flow were seen to increase significantly, mainly in response to bolus feeding. It is not clear whether the differences in superior mesenteric artery blood flow are the result of variations in nutrient load, gastric distension, or the vasoactive properties of insulin, although the responses of gastric fluid volume and insulin concentration seem to follow a similar temporal pattern. Physiological parameters such as systemic blood pressure, heart rate, and vasoactive sympathetic mediators are known to influence superior mesenteric artery flow although the relative contributions of these parameters in response to bolus or continuous feeding have not previously been studied. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions about tube feeding&#x02013;induced changes in splanchnic blood flow that might occur in the clinical setting, it is clear at least in healthy individuals, the primary effect of bolus feeding is to increase superior mesenteric artery flow.</p><p>Some limitations of this study should be clarified. It was not possible to determine the relative contributions to gastric liquid volume of gastric secretions or saliva and it may be possible that production of both differed between the 2 groups. In addition, this study was conducted in healthy younger subjects and the findings may not be directly applicable to those in whom tube feeding is most widely employed. By including a noncaloric-fed control group, it may have been possible to distinguish the effects that were directly attributable to the nutrients of the feed rather than those of volume. The choice of the polymeric feed containing protein, carbohydrate, and fat was based on what is used commonly in the clinical situation, and it is possible that the other feeds such as elemental, monomeric, or fiber-containing ones may have yielded different results because of the way in which they modify the digestive and absorptive process. However, testing of several different types of feed would have necessitated a much larger sample size or multiple visits from the same participants, thereby increasing the complexity of the study.</p><p>The results of this study indicate that there are distinct physiological differences between continuous and bolus intragastric tube feeding in gastrointestinal emptying, small intestinal fluid flux, splanchnic blood flow, and gastrointestinal hormone secretion. Continuously infused feeds, the most widely used approach of tube feeding, does not increase small bowel water content above volumes observed during fasting.</p><p>The extrapolation of these findings from healthy young volunteers to older sick patients is always open to challenge. Study design to investigate the gastrointestinal responses to tube feeding in ill patients is fraught with challenge and difficult to justify both ethically and financially. The findings described in this study provide further evidence that continuous intragastric feeding is unphysiological as it does not stimulate the gastrointestinal tract into a fed response and that the main source of enteral feeding&#x02013;related diarrhea is colonic rather than small intestinal. This knowledge will allow researchers and clinicians more confidence to target studies and therapy at the colon.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank the Nottingham Digestive Diseases Centre Biomedical Research Unit, National Institute for Health Research, for help with this study.
