reduction in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The physiological response to a dose
of Ca in milk and to a Ca salt may be different. The present study investigated Ca
absorption patterns with increasing levels of fortification in milk, and the response to
one dose of a Ca salt. A group of twenty-eight Asian women aged 20&#x02013;45 years volunteered to
attend the laboratory over several weeks. The fasted volunteers were randomised to one of
three experimental drinks: 200&#x000a0;ml skimmed milk containing 250, 500 or 1000&#x000a0;mg Ca. A
subgroup of seven volunteers also received a calcium gluconate/carbonate salt containing
1000&#x000a0;mg Ca in 200&#x000a0;ml water. Serial blood samples and urine were collected for 5&#x000a0;h from
baseline. Different doses of Ca in milk resulted in a graded response in serum corrected
Ca, PTH and C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx) but not ionised Ca. Serum Ca increased
in response to all milk drinks and from 2 to 5&#x000a0;h the blood Ca levels were significantly
different for the 250 and 1000&#x000a0;mg doses, as was the integrated response between the loads.
The PTH response to the two higher doses was significantly more than following the 250&#x000a0;mg
dose. The integrated response for CTx and urinary Ca between all three doses of Ca in milk
was significantly different. A dose of Ca salt elicited a more immediate response reaching
a plateau faster, and declining faster to baseline. Fortified milk is a safe matrix for
delivering larger doses of Ca.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Calcium absorption</kwd><kwd>Milk</kwd><kwd>Asian women</kwd><kwd>Parathyroid hormone</kwd><kwd>Urinary calcium</kwd><kwd>C-telopeptide of type I collagen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbreviations"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>CTx, C-telopeptide of type I collagen</kwd><kwd>PTH, parathyroid hormone</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="32"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Adequate Ca intake is important to achieve optimal peak bone mass and prevent or reduce bone
loss with ageing. Obtaining the recommended daily Ca allowance from foods is recommended, as
other bioactives could be present that may enhance the health benefits of the food. Milk can
be fortified with a Ca salt to increase the amount of Ca delivered per dose of milk and Ca
from milk is usually well absorbed.</p><p>An acute oral dose of a Ca salt rapidly increases serum corrected, i.e. Ca corrected for
albumin, as well as ionised Ca and reduces bone resorption (serum C-telopeptide of type I
collagen; CTx) with a concomitant reduction in parathyroid hormone (PTH)
levels<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">

serum Ca concentrations, indicated that there is a plateau in the postprandial response at a
dose of 500&#x000a0;mg with a slight increase in the response to a dose of 1000&#x000a0;mg<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">

carbonate <italic>v.</italic> divided doses over several hours were similar up to
approximately 5&#x000a0;h and that absorption was capacity limited even when the doses were divided.

induced by a dose of 250&#x000a0;mg compared with 1000&#x000a0;mg Ca.</p><p>An acute dose of Ca in milk, however, results in a slower change in serum ionised Ca in
comparison with a similar dose of a Ca salt<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">

</xref><sup>)</sup> compared the postprandial Ca response from four different foods including
milk, and showed that ingestion of 400&#x000a0;mg Ca in milk caused a significantly smaller increase
in serum ionised Ca compared with the control Ca salt. Other studies report similar findings
when a Ca salt was compared with milk or Ca-fortified milk<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, confirming that the matrix in which the Ca is delivered could therefore
affect the rate of appearance and the rise in serum Ca.</p><p>More recent studies using milk as the vehicle showed that an acute dose of Ca (1200&#x000a0;mg per
dose) in milk also suppresses both PTH levels and bone resorption in adult men and
women<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">

calcium carbonate at a single dose of 1200&#x000a0;mg Ca, the calcium carbonate-fortified milk
suppressed PTH and bone resorption significantly more than the milk fortified with milk

and postmenopausal women with 1200&#x000a0;mg Ca per d as fortified milk was maintained over the 12&#x02013;16
weeks of the interventions.</p><p>The objectives of the present study were to assess the acute postprandial physiological
response to a series of different Ca loads in a milk-based drink, by measuring serum PTH,
serum CTx, serum corrected and ionised Ca and urinary Ca excretion over a 5&#x000a0;h period. A
secondary objective was to compare the postprandial response to a similar load of Ca as a salt
in water or as a salt in milk.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><p>The present study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of
Helsinki and all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Massey University

trial.</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Experimental subjects</title><p>A total of twenty-eight Asian female volunteers aged 20&#x02013;45 years, living in Auckland or
Palmerston North, New Zealand, were recruited from the community through the local
newspapers and Massey University Campus advertising. Inclusion criteria were aged 20&#x02013;45
years, the ability to tolerate a glass of milk, and not taking Ca supplements or vitamin D
supplements, or, if so, agreeing to stop these for 4 weeks before entering the trial.
Other exclusion criteria were more than three units of alcohol per d, smoking, endocrine
disease, diagnosis of any form of cancer, vascular disease or diabetes mellitus. The trial
was preceded by a health screen of liver and kidney function and haematology.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Anthropometry</title><p>Body weight was measured using a digital balance (model BWB-627-A; Tanita Corporation) to

Palmerston North or Albany on three occasions at least 1 week apart, for 7&#x000a0;h at each
occasion. They were randomised by the study nurse (computer-generated random numbers) to
ingest one of three milk drinks at each occasion. The volunteers arrived in the laboratory
at approximately 08.30 hours after fasting since 21.00 hours the previous night. The
volunteers were asked to empty their bladders. An indwelling intravenous cannula was
placed in an antecubital vein and kept patent using normal saline. Baseline blood samples
were taken shortly after the cannula was sited. The volunteers were then given one of the
three test drinks, which they consumed within 15&#x000a0;min. In order to avoid any effect of
circadian rhythm in the measurements, the volunteers were asked to begin consuming the
drinks between 09.00 and 09.30 hours; the actual time was recorded and referred to as time
zero. The blood sampling times were staggered so that the time from taking the test drink
to the time that the first blood sample was taken was exactly the same for each
participant.</p><p>The milk drinks contained either 250&#x000a0;mg Ca (20&#x000b7;1&#x000a0;g skimmed milk powder; NZMP&#x02122; Fonterra

200&#x000a0;ml of deionised water followed by another 50&#x000a0;ml to wash out the container of any
residual milk drink. Blood samples (20&#x000a0;ml) were collected every 1&#x000a0;h, and urine was
collected every 2&#x000a0;h period for 6&#x000a0;h.

analysis. Urine was collected after the first morning void until time zero, and was then
collected from baseline every 2&#x000a0;h for 6&#x000a0;h from the start of consuming the drink. The urine
volumes were measured, and a representative sample was then stored frozen until analysis.</p><p>The volunteers were given two plain biscuits after 2&#x000a0;h and a light lunch after 4&#x000a0;h,

delivered in milk, as well as comparing the response to a Ca salt in water. The data
presented show that there is a graded physiological response in total blood Ca concentration
depending on the dose of Ca taken. A similar dose of Ca as the salt compared with the dose
in milk resulted in a faster rise in ionised Ca in the blood. The peak concentration was
reached earlier and the blood levels decreased earlier compared with a Ca dose in milk. As
serum Ca increased, PTH responded in an inverse manner, reaching the lowest level after 3&#x000a0;h
and then beginning to increase again. The largest response was to the dose of 1000&#x000a0;mg Ca in
milk, with a lower response to 500&#x000a0;mg and a significantly lower response to 250&#x000a0;mg. Serum

however, elicit a different response, with calcium carbonate raising blood Ca significantly

milk were compared with each other in the same study. In addition, the present study also
showed that the response to a load of Ca from a salt is faster, increasing serum and ionised
Ca more rapidly but reaching a plateau quicker, compared with the same dose in milk, in
accordance with Green <italic>et al</italic>.<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">

responses to the 500 and the 1000&#x000a0;mg Ca doses were not significantly different. The
suppression of PTH by Ca is a response to maintain Ca homeostasis, and is mediated by the
Ca-sensing receptor in the parathyroid gland. This receptor responds to the transient
increase in plasma ionised Ca within seconds. Several authors have reported the Ca-dependent
postprandial decrease in PTH<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">

</xref><sup>)</sup> using a variety of foods depending on the bioavailability of Ca from the
foods. No reports could be found where the response to various doses of Ca in the same food,
or from milk, was compared. In the present study the serum PTH concentration decreased in
parallel with the increase in serum and ionised Ca concentrations, the latter affected by
the dose-dependent absorption of Ca in the intestine. We did not show a significant
difference in the ionised Ca concentration between the various doses but there was a trend
for the response after the 250&#x000a0;mg dose to be lower than the response to the 500 and 1000&#x000a0;mg
dose. Accordingly, the response by serum PTH was significantly higher for the 500 and
1000&#x000a0;mg doses of Ca compared with the 250&#x000a0;mg dose.</p><p>Serum CTx levels decreased from baseline over the 5&#x000a0;h of sampling, and did not reach a
plateau by 5&#x000a0;h. The response to the 250&#x000a0;mg dose was significantly less than the response to
the 500 and 1000&#x000a0;mg doses between time points 4 and 5&#x000a0;h but all three doses significantly
decreased CTx. The reduction in PTH over time suggested that bone remodelling was being
suppressed by the various doses of Ca and this was confirmed by the reduction in CTx. PTH
decreased rapidly after the dose of Ca, reaching a minimum value by 3&#x000a0;h. In contrast, the
response by CTx was slower, and more continuous, and was still strongly suppressed at 5&#x000a0;h
after the Ca dose. The delay in response by CTx to a Ca load was also reported by Zik&#x000e1;n
<italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>26</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> in postmenopausal women. The immediate response of PTH to a Ca load may
therefore lead to the reduction in CTx as well, albeit slower, suggesting that the
suppression of bone resorption may last longer than the actual decrease in serum PTH levels.
The osteoclast has also been shown to have Ca-sensing receptors<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Ca ions may therefore directly regulate bone resorption. The
response of the osteoclast may, however, only occur at higher extracellular Ca
concentrations<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. The osteocyte is able to regulate small changes in serum Ca by the
process of osteocytic osteolysis. This process does not involve bone resorption but only
movement of Ca controlled by the osteocyte. This process, however, is short; response is
within 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h after a change in serum Ca and does not affect bone resorption and would not
elicit a response by PTH or CTx<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a controlled situation there is a strong correlation between acute intake of Ca and
urinary Ca excretion. The excretion of Ca increased as the dose of Ca in milk increased, but
the change in excretion was not significantly different between the 500&#x000a0;mg and the 1000&#x000a0;mg
dose, while both of these were significantly higher than the excretion after the 250&#x000a0;mg
dose. There was, however, a significant difference in the integrated response between the
three doses from milk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3(B)</xref>). Urinary Ca
usually changes according to the amount and bioavailability of the Ca load, whether from
food or a salt. When we compared the urinary excretion of Ca after the 1000&#x000a0;mg load from
milk or the salt, there was no significant difference, which indicates that Ca was absorbed
equally well from both forms of Ca. K&#x000e4;rkk&#x000e4;inen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> reported increased urinary Ca excretion after a 400&#x000a0;mg dose of Ca as the
salt compared with the same dose in milk. Green <italic>et al</italic>.<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> reported no significant difference in urinary Ca excretion between milk
fortified with milk Ca or calcium carbonate, and Martini &#x00026; Wood<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> reported no significant effect of Ca source on urinary Ca excretion
using a similar load of Ca in orange juice, milk or as a salt in water. The above data
therefore suggest that urinary Ca excretion is a function of Ca load and not sensitive to
whether the Ca is provided as a salt or in a food. The kind of salt, however, may affect
absorption and excretion with the lactate gluconate salt of Ca being more soluble, more
absorbable and resulting in higher excretion compared with calcium carbonate or Ca from
fortified milk<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">

postmenopausal women. However, some concern has been raised about the safety of using Ca
supplements, as trials in healthy older women and in patients with renal impairment suggest
that Ca supplementation may increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and overall
CVD<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">

been strongly criticised, it has been hypothesised that a potential mechanism may involve
the significant rise in serum ionised Ca (to the upper part &#x02013; or over the normal range) that
has been shown after a 1&#x000a0;g dose of Ca by Karp <italic>et al</italic>.<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">

concentrations may affect vascular calcification, the function of the vascular cells and
blood coagulation<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">

between Ca consumed in milk and that consumed as a Ca salt. The change in serum ionised Ca
after a dose of a Ca salt was shown to be markedly higher (0&#x000b7;09 <italic>v.</italic>
0&#x000b7;075&#x000a0;mmol/l) and faster (peak at 2&#x000a0;h <italic>v.</italic> at 3&#x000b7;5&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h) than the response to a
similar dose of Ca in milk. In the present study we therefore have confirmed that the
response in ionised Ca to a 1&#x000a0;g dose of Ca salt and 1&#x000a0;g Ca in milk is different.</p><p>In conclusion, the present data support the notion that the postprandial response to Ca
from foods is different from that from a Ca salt, and that fortified milk can deliver
relatively large doses of Ca without perturbing Ca homeostasis. This trial was done in young
Asian women and the response to a load of Ca in this population may differ from that of
older or postmenopausal women in other populations. The results should therefore be
extrapolated with caution.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of Regina Wypych for trial coordination and
