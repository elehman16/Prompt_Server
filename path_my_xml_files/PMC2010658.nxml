Additional phlebotomies were indicated in both groups, to keep the haematocrit at 42-47%. 285 patients were evaluable after the study was completed, of whom 50% have an 8-year follow-up. Both groups were comparable with respect to age, clinical symptoms and haematological parameters immediately before randomization. The duration of the first remission and the overall survival were significantly better in the busulphan group. This difference remains significant after correction for differences between the two groups with respect to sex-ratio and phlebotomy before and the start of therapy. Busulphan induced a longer first remission (P less than 0.001) and a longer overall survival (P less than 0.02).</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00442-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="75" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00442-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="76" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00442-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="77" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00442-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="78" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00442-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="79" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00442-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="80" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
