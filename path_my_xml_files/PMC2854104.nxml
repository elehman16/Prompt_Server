The active supplement (Game Time<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Corr-Jensen Laboratories Inc., Aurora, CO) was 18 g of powder, 40 kcals, and consisted of a proprietary blend including whey protein, cordyceps sinensis, creatine, citrulline, ginseng, and caffeine. The PL was also 18 g of powder, 40 kcals, and consisted of only maltodextrin, natural and artificial flavors and colors. Thirty minutes prior to all testing and training sessions, participants consumed their respective supplements mixed with 8-10 oz of water. Both groups participated in a three-week HIIT program three days per week, and testing was conducted before and after the training. Cardiovascular fitness (VO<sub>2</sub>max) was assessed using open circuit spirometry (Parvo-Medics TrueOne<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>2400 Metabolic Measurement System, Sandy, UT) during graded exercise tests on a treadmill (Woodway, Pro Series, Waukesha, WI). Also, four high-speed runs to exhaustion were conducted at 110, 105, 100, and 90% of the treadmill velocity recorded during VO<sub>2</sub>max, and the distances achieved were plotted over the times-to-exhaustion. Linear regression was used to determine the slopes (critical velocity, CV) and y-intercepts (anaerobic running capacity, ARC) of these relationships to assess aerobic and anaerobic performances, respectively. Training volumes were tracked by summing the distances achieved during each training session for each subject.

The idea of nutrient timing was initiated by post-workout supplementation and has further spread to research on the timing of pre-exercise nutritional strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Traditional nutritional interventions prior to training have focused on carbohydrate administration, while more current literature has supported a combination of amino acids, protein, creatine and caffeine as effective supplements for improving performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. While the ergogenic effects from these individual ingredients are generally supported, the practical importance of product-specific research has become an area of increasing demand. Paradoxically, product-specific research often tests a blend of ingredients that provides a direct application of the research findings for consumers, but is unable to pinpoint the effects of individual ingredients. Furthermore, integrating nutritional supplements into research designs that use realistic exercise training protocols allows for impactful sport-specific practical applications. Since many team sports, such as football, basketball, hockey and soccer utilize repeated bouts of short sprints separated by active recovery periods, interval running may be applicable to many sports and sensitive to nutritional supplements that are designed to delay high-intensity, exercise-induced fatigue. In fact, evidence exists to support the use of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) strategies to improve performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], however, only a few studies have examined HIIT combined with nutritional supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The physiological demand of HIIT elicits rapid metabolic and cardiovascular adaptations, including increased exercise performance, muscle buffering capacity, aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2</sub>peak) and fat oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, HIIT results in diminished stores of adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr) and glycogenic substrates as well as the accumulation of metabolites adenosine di-phosphate (ADP), inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>), and hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, HIIT may cause several physiological adaptations within a relatively brief training period, making it a practical time-efficient tool to examine training- and supplement-induced changes in performance. Although the work to rest ratio of HIIT protocols vary, the current study and others utilizing a 2:1 work:rest strategy have been effective for improving VO<sub>2</sub>max, time to exhaustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], muscle buffering capacity, and lactate threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Additionally, the same HIIT strategy that is used in the present study has been employed to evaluate the effects of creatine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], beta-alanine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and sodium bicarbonate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] supplementation on measures of performance. Therefore, it is possible that the training outcomes measured after a period of HIIT may be sensitive to nutritional supplements that are designed to prolong the acute factors associated with fatigue. More so, the active ingredients in the current pre-workout supplement have potential to improve performance. Caffeine or caffeine containing supplements acting as a central nervous system stimulant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] have been suggested to augment catecholamine concentrations promoting fat utilization sparing intramuscular glycogen resulting in an improvement in performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. PCr, a major component of biological buffering has been reported to be significantly increased with Cr supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Increasing total Cr stores can result in greater pre-exercise PCr availability, improved muscle buffer capacity and an acceleration of PCr resynthesis during recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Additionally, branched chain amino acids (BCAA's; leucine, isoleucine, and valine) are suggested to be the primary amino acids oxidized during intense exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. When supplementing with BCAAs prior to exercise, research suggests an improvement in protein synthesis, reduction in protein degradation, ultimately improving recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Interval training is generally used to elicit both anaerobic and aerobic training adaptations due to the large physiological spectrum of demands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The critical power test (CP), originally proposed by Monod and Scherrer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], characterizes both anaerobic work capacity (AWC) and aerobic parameters (CP). The CP test has been shown to be reliable in measuring aerobic and anaerobic parameters as well as changes with high-intensity training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Hughson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] applied the concept of CP to running, which characterized the term critical velocity (CV) as the running-based analogue of CP. Thus, CV is defined as the maximal running velocity that can be maintained for an extended period of time using only aerobic energy stores. In contrast, the anaerobic running capacity (ARC) is the distance that can be run at a maximal velocity using only anaerobic energy sources. As described by Housh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], the CV test involves a series of runs to exhaustion at various supramaximal running velocities to determine the relationship between time to exhaustion and velocity. The hyperbolic relationship between velocity and time to exhaustion can then be used to calculate total distance (total distance = velocity &#x000d7; time). Plotting total distance as a function of time for each velocity results in a mathematical model to quantify CV (slope of the line) and ARC (y-intercept), which defines the indirect method of evaluating both aerobic and anaerobic capabilities, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Recent evidence has shown that interval training with two-minute work bouts, similar to the HIIT in the present study, exerts a significant influence on aerobic abilities (CV), rather than the anaerobic improvements (AWC) demonstrated by the CP test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Training at intensities of 100% and 105% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak on a cycle ergometer elicited a 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and 13% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] increase in aerobic capacity, respectively. Training at higher intensities for shorter durations (i.e. 60 sec) may be more advantageous for anaerobic improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], although this hypothesis has not been evaluated using the CV test. Likewise, the efficacy of single-ingredient supplements has been assessed using the CP model. For example, creatine supplementation has been shown to improve AWC, which is primarily limited by the amount of energy available from stored ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However, less conclusive evidence is available on the effects of creatine on CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It is possible that combining the use of a multi-ingredient, pre-workout supplement with HIIT may further delineate the anaerobic and aerobic demands of training as measured by CV and ARC using the running-based CV test. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of a pre-workout supplement combined with three weeks of HIIT on aerobic and anaerobic running performance, training volume, and body composition. To date, no one has examined the combined effects of high-intensity interval running with a pre-workout nutritional supplement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-four moderately-trained men (mean &#x000b1; SD age = 20.8 &#x000b1; 2.0 yrs; stature = 175.7 &#x000b1; 8.3 cm; body mass = 70.9 &#x000b1; 13.5 kg, VO<sub>2</sub>max = 3.71 &#x000b1; 0.73 l&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>, percent body fat = 14.0 &#x000b1; 4.6%) and women (mean &#x000b1; SD age = 21.5 &#x000b1; 1.8 yrs; stature = 168.0 &#x000b1; 7.5 cm; body mass = 60.7 &#x000b1; 6.5 kg, VO<sub>2</sub>max = 2.57 &#x000b1; 0.48 l&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>, percent body fat = 24.9 &#x000b1; 4.4%) volunteered for this study.

When combined with HIIT, GT ingestion improved CV, VO<sub>2</sub>max, lean body mass, and total training volume when compared to the PL and HIIT group. In addition, although not significant, the fact that LBM changes were positive for the GT group and negative for the PL group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2-E</xref>) suggests that GT may aid in maintaining LBM during the course of HIIT for three weeks.</p><p>While this may be the first study to examine a pre-workout supplement in combination with HIIT, previous research has examined the efficacy of similar, separate ingredients on exercise training and performance. However, since most previous studies examine blended supplements that often include various ingredients and dose combinations, it is difficult to directly compare many previous studies. One primary ingredient in the GT supplement, caffeine, has been used as an effective ergogenic aid by acting as a stimulant, reducing feelings of fatigue, and increasing times to exhaustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Caffeine has been shown to primarily influence longer-duration endurance exercise by 20-50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and resting metabolic rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The benefits of caffeine supplementation for higher-intensity exercise, similar to those in the current study (90%-115% VO<sub>2</sub>max), are less conclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. For example, assessing anaerobic power using a Wingate test after a range of caffeine doses (3.2-7 mg/lb) resulted in no improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] while Anselme et al. demonstrated a 7% increase in anaerobic power after 6 mg/kg of caffeine consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In addition, a recent report by Wiles et al. demonstrated improvements in performance during a bout of short-duration, high-intensity cycling and mean power output following 5 mg/kg of caffeine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. The results of the present study indicated that the pre-exercise GT drink improved aerobic performance (CV) and training volume, but did not alter the ARC. It is possible that the caffeine in GT may be partly responsible for the increases in CV and training volume. However, the independent effects of caffeine cannot be directly assessed in the present study.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that the ergogenic effects of caffeine may be proportional to the amount of caffeine administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Most studies have utilized 3-9 mg/kg of caffeine when demonstrating improvements in performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], while one study showed that as little 2 mg/kg increased cycling performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Yet another study demonstrated that 201 mg of caffeine was not sufficient for increasing run time to exhaustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. In the present study, the pre-exercise GT supplement contained only 100 mg of caffeine in one serving. Since the range of body mass values for the participants in the present study was 46.1 kg to 108.9 kg, the relative caffeine doses were 1.0 - 2.2 mg/kg, which is lower than the previously suggested ergogenic doses. Therefore, although caffeine may have contributed to improvements in aerobic performance and training volume in the present study, it is possible that there were synergistic effects from other GT ingredients.</p><p>One concern about the ergogenic doses of caffeine is that relatively high levels of urinary caffeine concentrations are banned by both the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The NCAA and IOC limits for urinary caffeine concentrations are 15 &#x003bc;g/ml and 12 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively. In a well-controlled study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] the average urinary concentration of caffeine was 14 &#x003bc;g/ml after the ingestion of 9 mg/kg. In an earlier study, Pasman et al. (1995) demonstrated that 9 and 13 mg/kg of caffeine consumption resulted in urinary caffeine concentrations that exceeded the International Olympic Committee's (IOC's) limit of 12 &#x003bc;g/ml in some subjects. However, 5 mg/kg of caffeine did not exceed or even approach 12 &#x003bc;g/ml in any subject [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Since the relative caffeine dose range for the GT supplement in the present study was 1.0 - 2.2 mg/kg for an absolute dose of 100 mg of caffeine per serving, it is highly unlikely that the caffeine in GT would cause urinary concentrations anywhere near the limits set forth by the NCAA or IOC. Therefore, although not tested specifically in this study, the GT supplement may be safe for consumption by NCAA and IOC athletes as it pertains to caffeine concentrations.</p><p>A large amount of literature exists demonstrating that short-term high-dose (20 g/day for 5-7 days) creatine supplementation is effective for increasing total muscle phosphocreatine stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and improving maximal intermittent exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] and lean body mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. However, the data on short-term low-dose creatine supplementation is less supported, with a minimum of 3 g/day for at least 28 days necessary to elicit increases in muscle creatine stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. The current pre-workout GT drink provided 1.5 g/day of creatine on testing and training days only for a total of 15 days, which was below the minimum recommended dose. A similar study by Thompson and colleagues used a comparable combination of training (swimming) and 2 g of creatine daily for six weeks and demonstrated no effects of the creatine supplementation or training on muscle creatine concentration, anaerobic performance, or aerobic indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Thus, although the creatine content of the GT supplement may not fully explain the improvements in CV and training volume, the combination with the other GT ingredients may have been influential for intermittent recovery between sprint bouts as well as helping to maintain LBM.</p><p>The BCAAs in GT may have also played a role in improving CV and training volume as well as maintaining LBM. BCAAs may be the primary amino acids oxidized during intense exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and have been suggested as fundamental for protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that the ingestion of BCAA supplements prior to exercise has augmented protein synthesis and reduced protein degradation, which may ultimately enhance recovery time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, BCAAs may conceivably enhance performance in all-out running, similar to the current study by improving mental focus allowing participants to run harder and longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Again, however, the GT supplement contained approximately 1 g of BCAAs which is lower than other effective dosing protocols (7.5-12 g). There was also approximately 9 g of whey protein concentrate in the GT supplement. Although whey protein has not been directly shown to improve running performance when consumed a priori, the fact that whey protein also contains relatively high concentrations of the BCAAs may indirectly suggest that the BCAAs in combination with whey protein may influence performance by enhancing recovery between training bouts and maintaining LBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>].</p><p>Cordyceps sinensis (or simply <italic>cordyceps</italic>) is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, and it is derived from a fungus that grows on several species of caterpillars at relatively high altitudes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. It has been suggested that cordyceps may be an anti-oxidant during intense exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>] and may also improve VO<sub>2</sub>max [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. In two reviews by Zhu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>], it was suggested that cordyceps sinensis may act through the autonomic nervous system to improve respiration, blood flow, and tissue oxygenation. One study has demonstrated improvements in VO<sub>2</sub>max in sedentary men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>] with relatively high doses (4.5 g/d for 6 weeks) of cordyceps. However, with lower doses (2.5 g) similar to what is found in GT in the present study, there were no ergogenic effects of cordyceps reported in previous studies on VO<sub>2</sub>max [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>] in healthy, active men. Thus, given the conflicting evidence, cordyceps may be another ingredient in GT that acted synergistically to improve CV and training volume in the present study.</p><p>The role that the remaining ingredients in the GT supplement (ex. Citrulline and rhodiola) may play is not completely evident. Citrulline is a non-essential amino acid that may increase lactate absorption, enhance ATP resynthesis, and delay fatigue during intense exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. While evidence is limited in humans, citrulline may have influenced ATP/PCr resynthesis during HIIT bouts thereby enhancing the training volume. Furthermore, rhodiola may act as a stimulant to optimize serotonin and dopamine levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>]. Acute supplementation (i.e., 2 days) has been shown to increase time to exhaustion and VO<sub>2</sub>peak by acting as an antioxidant and reducing the perception of fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>]. Together these ingredients may have positively influenced CV and training volume, however, this speculation cannot be proven in the current study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the acute ingestion of the pre-exercise GT supplement containing 100 mg of caffeine, 1.5 g creatine, 1 g BCAAs, 9 g whey protein, 2.5 g of cordyceps sinensis and a combined 0.75 g of citrulline and rhodiola, taken prior to HIIT for three weeks can significantly improve CV and total training volume when compared to HIIT and PL. Furthermore, the maintenance of and trend toward an improvement in LBM suggests that GT may be helpful in maintaining lean mass during intense training periods. Although there was not a single ingredient in GT that could solely account for the improvements, it is likely that the combination of relatively low doses of several ingredients (caffeine, creatine, BCAAs, whey protein, and cordyceps) may be responsible for the increases in aerobic performance, training volume, and the maintenance of lean mass.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AES was the primary author of the manuscript and played an important role in study design, data collection and assessment.
