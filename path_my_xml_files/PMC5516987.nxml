It is a derivative of ShK, which was originally isolated from the venom of the sea anemone <italic>Stichodactyla helianthus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Human T cells rely on two potassium channels, Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 to maintain the calcium signaling required for their activation and differentiation, by maintaining a balance between calcium influx and potassium efflux. Chronically activated memory T cells that rely on upregulation of Kv1.3 expression for their effector function are sensitive to blockade by Kv1.3 inhibitors. These chronically activated memory T cells are key mediators of numerous autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Other T cell subsets that upregulate the calcium-activated KCa3.1 channel upon activation are insensitive to blockade by Kv1.3 inhibitors [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that in the effector memory T (T<sub>EM</sub>) cell population, the degree of Kv1.3 expression is a measure of cell activation, with greater Kv1.3 numbers/cell following repeated stimulation and that the channel is required for the maintenance of the T<sub>EM</sub> cell phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These properties make Kv1.3 channels on T lymphocytes an attractive therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases (reviewed recently in [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Recent data suggest that the degree of Kv1.3 dependence is mediated by antigen exposure history, that chronically activated autoreactive T cells are primarily dependent on Kv1.3, and that conversion to Kv1.3 dependency is stable [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Other lymphocytes, including class-switched memory B cells also depend upon Kv1.3 for activation, however their sensitivity to blockade by Kv1.3 inhibitors is still being explored [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While various other cells of the immune system also express Kv1.3 channels, those cells express numerous K<sup>+</sup> channels and are not sensitive to blockade by Kv1.3 inhibitors due to channel redundancy [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In vivo studies with dalazatide in a delayed-type hypersensitivity model have shown that drug treatment inhibited the DTH response by suppressing T<sub>EM</sub> cells, but had no effect on na&#x000ef;ve or central memory T cells [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, animals chronically treated with dalazatide are able to clear viral and bacterial infections similar to vehicle treated animals, while those treated with dexamethasone, which broadly suppresses the immune response have a significantly delayed clearance rate, further supporting the specific and immune sparing role of dalazatide [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes raised, scaly patches on the skin. It is one of the most frequent human skin diseases, affecting about 3% of the United States population [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Plaque psoriasis is the most common variant of the disease, affecting about 90% of patients. Treatment of mild-to-moderate disease, which affects about 80% of patients, consists of topical medications typically containing corticosteroids or vitamin D analogs [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Phototherapy, involving exposure to UVA or UVB light alone or in combination with a photosensitizer, is recommended for moderate-to-severe psoriasis [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Systemic medications, including methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin, azathioprine, and sulfasalazine, are used to treat psoriasis that is too extensive for, or refractory to, topical or UV therapy [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180762.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, these medications have significant dose-limiting toxicities. Several biologic drugs, particularly TNF, IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors, have been approved or are in development for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180762.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180762.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite the variety of treatments available, in a study of over 5,000 psoriasis patients, over 50% were dissatisfied with their treatment [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Dendritic cells and T<sub>EM</sub> cells are central players in the development of psoriatic skin lesions. These cells produce cytokines that increase the migration of inflammatory cells into the skin and that stimulate keratinocytes to proliferate, resulting in epidermal hyperplasia [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Psoriatic plaques are enriched with T<sub>EM</sub> cells that express the Kv1.3 channel [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] as well as cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA), which guides T cells to the skin [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Inhibition of the Kv1.3 channel suppresses the activation and proliferation of T<sub>EM</sub> cells, and there is considerable interest in evaluating Kv1.3 channel blockers, such as dalazatide, for the treatment of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180762.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>This Phase 1B study evaluated two dose levels of dalazatide given subcutaneously to patients with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis. The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of repeat doses of the drug. Secondary objectives were to evaluate clinical proof of concept and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, including the effects of dalazatide treatment on plasma protein analyte levels and T cell populations. It is reported here that dalazatide treatment was well tolerated, without serious adverse events, and reduced mediators of inflammation in the blood and decreased the expression of T cell activation markers. This is the first Kv1.3 inhibitor to be tested in clinical trials for autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02435342">NCT02435342</ext-link></p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were adult men and women (age 18 to 65 years; weight 50 to 100 kg) with active plaque psoriasis (&#x02265; 3% body-surface area affected).

Patients were screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 30 days of the Day 1 (first-dose) visit. Dose administration and evaluation were on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, and 29. Additional follow-up evaluations were on Days 32, 43, and 57. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. As such, except for the specifically designated unblinded study site clinical and ancillary staff, the Investigators and remaining study site clinical staff were blinded as to treatment. The unblended staff members were not involved in any on-study data collection. Patients were enrolled in the study beginning October 2014 and the last patient last visit was in March 2015.</p><fig id="pone.0180762.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0180762.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Consort flow diagram.</title><p>Graphical outline of the design and conduct of the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0180762.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Safety was assessed on the basis of vital signs (weight, blood pressure, pulse, oral temperature, and respiratory rate) and physical examination on all dose administration and evaluation days.

Optical densities for each well were obtained using a spectrophotometer set at 450 nm wavelength. Samples with readings above the ELISA cutoff point were analyzed by using an immune-depletion assay to assess antibody specificity.

To examine the effects of dalazatide on plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and other inflammation markers, a combination of multiplex and single-molecule-counting immunoassays were used. Values were analyzed by comparing plasma samples taken at Day 32 to baseline (Day 1 pre first dose) and by grouping samples from dalazatide-treated (60 mcg/dose group) target-lesion responders or non-responders and placebo-treated patients. The plasma levels of the decoy IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), soluble TNF-a receptor 2 (TNFR2), IL-8, IL-17A and IL-18 decreased in dalazatide-treated target-lesion responder patients when compared with their plasma baseline on Day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180762.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In contrast, the levels of these inflammatory markers were not decreased in the plasma of placebo group patients at the end of treatment relative to baseline levels on Day 1.

TNFR2, IL-1ra, and IL-18 are inflammatory markers that are present at increased levels in a variety of autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis. The reduction of TNFR2 and IL-18 plasma concentrations in dalazatide-treated target-responder patients almost reach statistical significance when compared to the plasma levels patients in the placebo group (TNFR2 <italic>p</italic> = 0.052; IL-18 <italic>p</italic> = 0.087).

No serious adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, or deaths occurred during this study and none have occurred during the clinical development program for dalazatide. Likewise, no drug-related trends in serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, or electrocardiography were noted in any clinical studies. The most common treatment-related adverse events for dalazatide were instances of paresthesia and hypoesthesia that were somewhat dose dependent. In a previous multiple-ascending-dose study (ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02446340">NCT02446340</ext-link>), only a portion of patients in the 5 and 15 mcg/dose cohorts experienced paresthesia or hypoesthesia. Although highly variable within and between individuals, the median duration of paresthesia generally increased with increasing dose up to the 30 mcg/dose group, but not between the 30 and 60 mcg/dose groups. An evaluation of the number of individuals in each cohort that experienced paresthesia each week demonstrated that, in all but the 60 mcg/dose group, the fraction of individuals experiencing paresthesia and the maximum duration of paresthesia decreased over time within a group. Full neurological evaluations from the NCT02446340 trial, including mental status assessment, assessment of cranial nerves II&#x02010;XII (field of vision, extraocular movements, pupil function, facial sensation, masseter strength, facial movements, hearing, gag reflex, shoulder shrug, head turn against resistance and tongue movement), sensory examination including distal vibratory sensation, pronator drift, tendon reflexes, gait and coordination, were considered normal both in the presence of ongoing sensory&#x02010;related adverse events as well as once these events resolved.</p><p>The relationship between potassium channel blockers and paresthesia is well known. Specifically, the transient blockade of potassium channels present in dorsal root ganglia and cutaneous sensory nerve fibers results in functional disturbances that are experienced as paresthesia. Potassium channel blockade is also the mechanism underlying the tingling sensation that results from eating Szechuan peppercorns. The active molecule in the peppercorns, hydroxyl-alpha-sanshool, excites sensory neurons by inhibiting two-pore potassium channels (KCNK3, KCNK9, and KCNK18) [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180762.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Interestingly, these K2P channels also play a role in autoimmune disease and may represent another potential drug target for disorders involving the central nervous system (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Potassium channel blockade can also result in nerve fiber action potential bursting, which is likewise associated with tingling paresthesia [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180762.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>One potassium channel blocking drug that has been tested in humans is the nonselective potassium channel inhibitor, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, fampridine, dalfampridine). Various formulations of 4-AP have been evaluated for their potential to increase nerve conduction and improve function in spinal cord injury, autoimmune diseases involving the nervous system, and diseases of nerve conduction [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The most commonly reported adverse events are paresthesia (perioral and digital), nausea, dizziness, headache, and insomnia. Although infrequent, the most serious toxicity reported in patients treated with 4-AP is seizure [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. 4-AP and related compounds readily cross the blood-brain barrier [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In contrast, dalazatide, like other peptide drugs, is not readily distributed across the intact blood-brain barrier [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180762.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</p><p>Several factors in this study impacted the assessment of clinical responsiveness, primarily low baseline BSA and patient bodyweight. Although 9 of 10 patients in the 60 mcg/dose group showed a significant reduction in PASI score, a reduction in PASI is more difficult to achieve in patients with low BSA (&#x0003c; 10%). The PASI is calculated using the BSA and lesion characteristic scores, so when the BSA score is low, changes in the PASI depend almost entirely upon improvement in lesion score. Low baseline BSA therefore results in an underestimation of the degree of improvement [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The median baseline BSA for patients in this study was 4 (range: 3 to 7). It was also observed that target-lesion response appeared to be sensitive to body weight; in this study, the body weight of non-responders was significantly higher than that of responders. Improved clinical responsiveness may therefore be achieved with optimized (e.g., weight-based) dosing, a baseline BSA &#x0003e;10%, and a longer duration of treatment.</p><p>The mechanism of action of dalazatide is well differentiated from traditional T-cell-directed therapies that block the activation or migration of all T cell populations. Such therapies are broadly immunosuppressive, which can lead to serious adverse effects. Dalazatide is unique in blocking just a subset of the chronically activated T cell population involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Dalazatide treatment may inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines and therefore may have a broader potential effect than therapies directed at a single cytokine. Furthermore, there is evidence that chronic blockade of the Kv1.3 channel can lead to a dedifferentiation of the T<sub>EM</sub> cell phenotype into an IL-10 producing immuno-regulatory T cell phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Other psoriasis therapies directed against T<sub>EM</sub> cells include drugs that prevent co-stimulatory signals needed for T cell activation. These include alefacept, a recombinant human fusion protein consisting of leukocyte-function-associated antigen (LFA) type 3 and IgG1 (approved for the treatment of psoriasis in 2003); and abatacept, a CTLA4-IgG fusion protein approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Efalizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD11A that also prevents T cell co-stimulatory signaling, was withdrawn in 2009 due to an increased risk of progressive multifocal leukoencepalopathy. Alefacept is considered one of the safest treatments for psoriasis, but it is effective in only a small proportion of patients [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180762.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The efficacy of abatacept against psoriasis is still being evaluated in clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Following subcutaneous administration of 9 doses of 60 mcg dalazatide over 4 weeks to patients with active mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> homing to the skin, were found to express lower levels of the T cell activation marker HLA-DR. In addition, <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment with dalazatide had a pharmacodynamic effect on inhibiting the PMA/ionomycin-induced expression of CD40L by the memory T cell population. The modulation of T cell activation marker expression by dalazatide treatment suggests that dalazatide engaged the Kv1.3 target on memory T cells homing to the skin of psoriasis patients. Despite being a skin disease, systemic inflammation is observed in psoriasis patients and modulation of inflammation markers by dalazatide suggests that dalazatide may have systemic effects. Dalazatide, owing to its specific blockade of the Kv1.3 channel on a subset of T cells, is a first-in-class drug for the treatment of psoriasis. Thus, clinical studies are warranted to further evaluate this therapeutic strategy against psoriasis as well as other autoimmune diseases.</p><p>This trial was primarily designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of dalazatide. Due to the small patient sample size, short duration of treatment (4 weeks), and mild-to-moderate baseline disease (3% BSA with PASI scores &#x0003c;10), positive clinical responses were not expected. The improvements in target lesion score, PASI, IGA, PGA, and DLQI scores, as well as the decrease in inflammatory cytokines and decrease in T cell activation markers suggest that treatment for longer duration, more frequent dosing, or weight-based dosing may lead to further clinical benefit. This study supports the initiation of mechanism of action studies to evaluate dalazatide in autoimmune disease with T cell immunopathologies mediated by T cells, such as lupus, myositis, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, and psoriatic arthritis[<xref rid="pone.0180762.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180762.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180762.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180762.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Redacted study protocol approved by IRB.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180762.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to acknowledge Dan Burge, MD, for his role as Medical Director during the conduct of the trial.
