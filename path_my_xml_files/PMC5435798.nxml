Cognitive, affective, and social aspects can be assessed through play, considered as a &#x0201c;window&#x0201d; to observe a child&#x02019;s functioning. According to Russ&#x02019;s model, cognitive and affective components and their reciprocal connections can be assessed through the Affect in Play Scale (APS). The aim of the present study was to investigate children&#x02019;s representations of the three main models of disability (medical, social, and biopsychosocial) and how these models affected cognitive and affective components of children&#x02019;s play. Sixty-three children, aged 6&#x02013;10 years, were assessed by means of the APS. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two APS task orders: the standard APS task followed by the modified APS task (including a wheelchair toy), or vice versa. The standard and modified APS sessions were coded according to the APS system. The modified APS sessions were also coded for the model of disability expressed by children. A one-way ANOVA conducted on the APS affective and cognitive indexes revealed an effect of condition on the affective components of play and no effect on cognitive components and variety of affect as assessed by the APS. In addition, when children are involved in pretend play from which concepts of disability emerge, these concepts are almost exclusively related to the medical model of disability. Results suggested implications for intervention with children in educational contexts that aim to teach children about disability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>models of disability</kwd><kwd>play of children</kwd><kwd>pretend play</kwd><kwd>affect in play scale</kwd><kwd>medical model</kwd><kwd>social model</kwd><kwd>ICF</kwd><kwd>causal origins of disability</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Play is a natural mode of expression of children and constitutes a fundamental aspect of children&#x02019;s life (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Nicolopoulou, 1993</xref>). Play can be considered a window through which one can observe a child&#x02019;s cognitive, affective, and social functioning (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Stagnitti, 2004</xref>). In particular, pretend play is a complex behavior involving symbolic expression of thoughts and feelings (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cherney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Russ, 2004</xref>). Recent evidence indicates that pretend play has important connections to the development of cognitive, affective, and social skills (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Pellegrini and Smith, 2005</xref>). These connections make pretend play an important phenomenon to study, due to its capacity to provide insight into children&#x02019;s abilities and internal representations (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Niec and Russ, 2002</xref>) and its appropriateness for investigating the &#x0201c;architecture&#x0201d; of the child&#x02019;s mind (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Weisberg, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In order to grasp the complexity of play, it seems necessary to evaluate it in terms of the dimensions of pleasure expressed, contents/themes, and linguistic and structural aspects, through a meaningful theoretical and methodological model founded on evidence-based procedures (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Lewis J. M., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Mash and Hunsley, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Russ developed a model of pretend play and a scale to measure the play of children from 6 to 10 years old, the Affect in Play Scale (APS) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Russ, 1993</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The APS qualitatively and quantitatively assesses affective and cognitive components of symbolic play, through the use of a standardized coding system that allows for measuring affective dimensions in fantasy and cognitive dimensions of play.</p><p>In the present study, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Russ&#x02019;s (2004</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) model, and its related APS, were used to evaluate the implicit component of the child&#x02019;s internal representations of disability in the context of symbolic play. The APS had never before been used to evaluate fantasy and expression of affect in symbolic play involving characters with a disability. A modified version of the APS play task was used by introducing a toy wheelchair among the standard play task materials which could be worn by a puppet to represent a character with a disability.</p><p>To date, the scientific literature has identified three main models of disability: individual (including the medical model), social, and biopsychosocial (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bickenbach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization [WHO], 2001</xref>). The individual model posits that disability is a direct consequence of disease, trauma, or other health conditions and, hence, that disability is an individual problem. In other words, it represents an individual-level deviation from biomedical norms of structure or function that requires medical care and treatment from health professionals (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Boorse, 1975</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bickenbach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Pompili et al., 2013</xref>). Since treatment by the medical profession is central to this model, it is also referred to as the medical model of disability (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Finkelstein, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Oliver, 1981</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization [WHO], 2001</xref>). Unlike the individual model, the social model portrays disability as a cultural construct, the product of a particular social environment (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Oliver, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Roulstone et al., 2012</xref>). Physical barriers or social attitudes are considered the origin of disability, because they prevent individuals with a &#x0201c;disability&#x0201d; from gaining access to virtual and real spaces and make social participation difficult. In this model disability is not an individual attribute, but rather a complex collection of conditions which require social actions rather than just medical treatment (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization [WHO], 2001</xref>). Finally, since 2001 the <italic>ICF: International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health</italic> has used a biopsychosocial&#x02014;also known as interactive (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bickenbach, 2012</xref>)&#x02014;model of human functioning and health, which represents an attempt to integrate the conflicting medical and social models. To achieve this &#x0201c;synthesis&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization [WHO], 2001</xref>), disability is treated not as a consequence of disease but as the outcome of three variables related to human health: health status, environment, and personal factors.

Children&#x02019;s models of disability were first studied by <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Meloni et al. (2015)</xref>, who reported that the youngest group of children (6&#x02013;8 years old) thought of people with disabilities as being sick. This early representation of disability is consistent with the individual model of disability and was independent from parents&#x02019; explanations and representations of disability. Older children (9&#x02013;11 years old) had more knowledge of disability and endorsement of stereotypical beliefs tended to be lower, as children tended to espouse their parents&#x02019; representations.</p><p>Research based on Piagetian stage theory (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Piaget, 1929</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1952</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1954</xref>) claimed that young children&#x02019;s difficulty in conceptualizing disability was the result of their being too cognitively immature (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Lewis A., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Glasberg, 2000</xref>). According to these approaches, children can only process and structure knowledge about disability across a range of explanations for disabilities identifiable among the three main models of disability, which include physical, biological, and psychological causes of disablement and health, when they reach approximately 11 years of age. Although debates continue, studies of cognition in infancy demonstrate that knowledge begins to emerge early in life and constitutes part of humans&#x02019; innate endowment (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Baillargeon et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Spelke, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Baillargeon et al., 1995</xref>), even including an early understanding of disease causality (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Springer and Ruckel, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Sigelman et al., 1993</xref>). In line with this work, challenging Piagetian framed research on children&#x02019;s knowledge of illness causation, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Williams (2004)</xref> explored children&#x02019;s understanding of the causal origins of disabilities. They found that children of all ages showed a preference for physical and biological causes of disability (consistent with an individual/medical model) and rejected social&#x02013;psychological causal explanations (consistent with a social model).</p><p>The aim of the present paper was to explore the type of representation of disability and the effect of the presence of a disabled character on the expression of affect and on the cognitive dimensions of children&#x02019;s play. In accordance with previous findings (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Williams, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Meloni et al., 2015</xref>), we expected that, when one of the two puppets in the modified APS play task was in a wheelchair (disabled puppet), children would tell stories in which the psychological constructs, sequence of actions, and affective expressions were consistent with the individual/medical model of disability. We also expected that pretend play with a disabled puppet would display a strong connection between affective categories such as nurturance/affective and sadness/hurt and actions such as providing and receiving care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty Italian 6- to 10-year-olds were recruited from a public primary school.

The APS has been employed in numerous studies that have demonstrated its good psychometric characteristics. Good inter-rater reliability was achieved, with Cohen&#x02019;s kappa values ranging from 0.70 to 0.90 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Russ, 2004</xref>). The APS play task is video recorded and requires two neutral-looking hand-puppets, representing a boy and a girl, and some little wooden blocks. The instructions are standardized and facilitate the child playing freely, according to his or her skills, age, characteristics, and preferences. The researcher introduces the two puppets and the blocks to the child and asks him or her to play with them for five minutes.</p><p><italic>The modified APS</italic>, an adapted APS play task procedure, was developed for this study and involved changes to the APS materials and instructions.

Studying children&#x02019;s pretend play can also provide insight into human cognitive architecture and its development (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Weisberg, 2015</xref>).</p><p>With regard to the affective and cognitive components, children showed a play profile in line with Italian norms, playing in a typical way for their age (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Mazzeschi et al., 2016</xref>). Children showed more expressions of empathy or sympathy and helping or supporting with another character (nurturance/affection) and more expressions of pain, sadness, or loneliness (sadness/hurt) when playing with the wheelchair toy (modified APS play task).</p><p>The organization and elaboration of the play plot and the child&#x02019;s imagination and comfort in play, namely the cognitive components of the APS (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chessa et al., 2011</xref>), remained quantitatively unchanged across the experimental conditions (standard and modified APS play tasks). Disability&#x02014;suggested by the introduction of the wheelchair toy in the modified APS&#x02014;did not affect the construction of the structural components of the play plot and children remained available to symbolically play as usual. At the same time, children were shown to be very sensitive to the presence of the wheelchair toy, showing a general attitude of compassion and sadness toward disability. We infer that, from the point of view of the play plot, a wheelchair toy has the same weight as all the other play elements (hand-puppets and wooden blocks), by demonstrating that for a child one toy is like another. On the other hand, the child proves to know the emotional value of the wheelchair, since it is immediately associated with the disease and, therefore, with feelings of care, compassion, and sadness; this explains the variations measured in the affective components of play, but not the cognitive ones.</p><p>With regard to the children&#x02019;s models of disability, data confirm the finding of <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Meloni et al. (2015)</xref> that, for children, individuals with disabilities are mainly thought of as being sick. When children are involved in pretend play, from which concepts of disability emerge, these concepts are almost exclusively related to the individual/medical model of disability. As we expected, the children imagine the disabled puppet as sick (e.g., disabled puppet says: &#x0201c;I&#x02019;m sick because my legs are broken&#x0201d;), or requiring medical treatment (e.g., disabled puppet says: &#x0201c;The physician told me that within few days I&#x02019;ll be better&#x0201d;), and the non-disabled puppet as a provider of health care (e.g., non-disabled puppet says to disabled one: &#x0201c;The physician told that you must take these pills that make you feel better&#x0201d;). These findings were reflected in the higher frequency of nurturance/affection and sadness/hurt in the modified APS condition, as expected.</p><p>As a cognitive organizer, a model of disability helps people to identify and understand the causal origins of disability (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Meloni et al., 2015</xref>). The individual/medical model directs understanding of disability to the physical and biological condition of an individual, rejecting social and cultural determinants of disability. Therefore, our findings are in line with those of <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Williams (2004)</xref>, who found that 4- to 11-year-old children showed a preference for physical and biological causes of disability and rejected social&#x02013;psychological causal explanations.</p><p>The 26 pupils out of 55 who did not express concepts referable to a disability model were the youngest. It suggests that the capacity to tell stories in which disability is salient develops with age. At an early age, disability does not seem to attract children&#x02019;s attention and is not featured in their stories. When disability is mentioned in a story, however, it emerges as the most salient element and drives the narrative. The disability element in children&#x02019;s stories tends to conform mainly, if not exclusively, to &#x02018;schemata&#x02019; (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brewer, 1999</xref>) from the individual/medical model of disability.</p><p>That the youngest did not express concepts referable to a disability model highlights what <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Williams (2004)</xref> suggested with regard to open-ended verbal methods: young children may have been so concerned with spontaneously generating a causal explanation that they were unable to verbalize a cause. In fact, when a forced-choice paradigm is adopted, as in <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Williams (2004)</xref> and <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Meloni et al. (2015)</xref>, young children show some causal knowledge of disabilities.</p><p>Another interesting finding related to puppet wearing behavior before starting timing of the two APS sessions. In the standard APS, the majority of children wore both puppets, whereas in the modified APS most children only wore the non-disabled puppet freely. This behavior seems consistent with studies by <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. (2003)</xref> and <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Meloni et al. (2012)</xref>, which demonstrated that disability elicits disgust and, hence, avoidance behavior. As the medical model of disability schematizes an aspect of human diversity by providing a cognitive organizer, such as a &#x0201c;frame&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Minsky, 1975</xref>), the avoidance behavior provides a &#x0201c;script&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Schank and Abelson, 1977</xref>) as well. No wonder, then, that, despite voicing caring attitudes toward the puppet in the wheelchair, almost none of the children elected to wear this puppet freely.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Findings from this study support the validity of the APS to evaluate differences in children&#x02019;s play in different situations, confirming the validity of the scale in showing the affective nuances of the play of school-aged children.</p><p>Use of the APS also allowed for confirmation of what previous research on disability representations and attitudes in children aged 6&#x02013;10 years suggested. In particular, the perceptual salience of disability increases as the age of children grows. In the present study, all children who paid attention to disability tended to only describe and explain it in its biological and physical dimensions, neglecting any social and cultural determinants of disability. Therefore, the perspective of disability emerging from the children&#x02019;s attitudes in the APS play task was fully compatible with the individual/medical model of disability as defined in the scientific literature. This compatibility was further confirmed by the fact that sadness/hurt affect categories prevailed in children&#x02019;s storytelling when they interacted with the disabled character (puppet in the wheelchair), along with the nurturance/affection category. In fact, the prevalence of sadness/hurt feelings is consistent with the personal tragedy view (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Swain and French, 2000</xref>) on which the medical model of disability is grounded.</p><p>The results obtained also suggest that disability is strongly and stereotypically associated with a negative and unpleasant dimension of existence, providing evidence for a cognitive mechanism underpinning the cultural construction of the individual/medical model of disability. Moreover, according to <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Williams (2004)</xref> research on children&#x02019;s understanding of the causal origin of disability, our results challenge Piagetian&#x02019;s assumption (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Piaget, 1929</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1952</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1954</xref>) that young children conceptualize disability with difficulty. Children, indeed, were not surprised by diversity of disability, and demonstrated possession of cognitive schemata to elaborate on it and congruent emotions to respond to it. On the basis of these results, we claim that the child&#x02019;s education about disability should not have the aim to introduce the concept of diversity, but rather to enhance their views on disability, modeling the social and cultural dimensions of diversity among the disabled that seem to be lacking in children.</p><p>Future research might overcome some limitations of the present study. These include, for example, increasing the sample size, given that the sample of children recruited in the present study prevents us from generalizing the results as representative of the Italian child population. In addition, in order to better investigate the evolution of the concept of disability, a longitudinal study would be advisable. Finally, the present research reflects the Italian socio-cultural context, where the pressure to include disabled people in social life is a political and legal norm but not yet widespread in the social fabric. It would be interesting to see how the disability models feed children&#x02019;s narratives on disability in other socio-cultural contexts.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed the experiments: SF and FM.
