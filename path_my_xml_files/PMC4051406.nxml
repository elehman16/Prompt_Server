Skin reactions are the most common side effects of cetuximab. Rhagades of the tips of the fingers and toes, the heels and especially the interphalangeal joints are one of the most frightening and painful dermatological side effects that may develop from EGFR-inhibitor therapy. Rhagades are characterized by pain, severe tenderness and poor healing response. They are challenging to treat. Thus, rhagades often poses the most significant threat to the quality of life (QoL) for these patients. Ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (ECA), an ethyl ester of the 2-cyano-2-propenoic acid, is often used as adhesive in a variety of different work settings in industry, i.e. as a component in nail-care products such as nail glue. In addition, ECA is used for various medical indications, such as for liquid bandages and for suture-less surgery. Wound healing can be accelerated with ECA. The purpose of the SUPPORT trial is to investigate the efficacy of ECA for the treatment of cetuximab-induced rhagades and to assess the clinical usefulness of the SUPO score, a new classification system for rhagades induced by EGFR-inhibitor therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The SUPPORT trial is an open-label, prospective, randomized, national multicenter intervention study to evaluate the effectiveness of ECA versus the standard treatment of each institution on the pain intensity and QoL in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer suffering from painful cetuximab-induced rhagades during radioimmunotherapy. Primary endpoint is the assessment of the pain intensity 24 hours after application of ECA or the standard treatment quantified by the visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary endpoints are the evaluation of QoL assessed by the EORTC-QoL-C30 questionnaire and the Dermatological Life Quality Index (DLQI).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>During treatment with EGFR inhibitors it is necessary to recognize and manage side effects promptly to assure better patient QoL.

It has shown clinical activity against a variety of malignancies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In head and neck cancer cetuximab is approved in combination with radiotherapy as a curative treatment option for patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LASCCHN). In the pivotal phase III trial published by Bonner et al., a radioimmunotherapy with cetuximab resulted in a higher response rate, an improvement of the duration of locoregional control and an increased rate of 5-year overall survival
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Cetuximab, as with the entire class of anti-EGFR inhibitors is associated with a high prevalence of dermatological side effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Commonly experienced dermatological side effects include acneiform rash, hair changes, enhancement of radiation-induced dermatitis, pruritus, mucositis, xerosis cutis, rhagades and paronychia. While acneiform rash is the most common side effect during the first weeks of application of the monoclonal antibody cetuximab, xerosis of the skin and xerosis-associated rhagades usually develop after at least 5 to 6 weeks of treatment with an anti-EGFR inhibitor such as cetuximab
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the European literature fissures of the skin and skin cracking are termed rhagades
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Rhagades of the fingertips and toes, of the palms or knuckles, the heels, the soles and especially of the interphalangeal joints are one of the most frightening and painful dermatological side effects that may develop as late phase skin reactions from EGFR-inhibitor therapy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Rhagades occur in about 15% to 25% of all patients treated with an EGFR-inhibitor and are characterized by pain, severe tenderness and poor healing tendency. They can be very painful and, furthermore, may create a risk for local or systemic infection
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. All of those dermatological toxicities including cetuximab-induced rhagades have often led to reduction or even cessation of an effective anticancer therapy and they have been shown to decrease patients' quality of life (QoL) significantly. Activities of daily living (ADL) may be impaired due to skin reactions, especially due to anti-EGFR induced painful rhagades. Whereas prevention and treatment recommendations for cetuximab-induced acneiform rash are well established today and have been published from several research groups recently
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], treatment recommendations for the treatment of cetuximab-induced painful rhagades are only reported anecdotally
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Lacouture et al. published general recommendations for the prevention and treatment of rhagades recently based on their own expert opinion. The individual recommendations for prevention of rhagades include the wearing of protective footwear or covering the fingertips to avoid friction; for treatment the authors recommended the topical application of thick moisturizer, zinc oxide creams, propylene glycol 50% solution, salicylic acid 10% ointment, steroid tapes and hydrocolloid dressings or liquid glues like cyanoacrylate preparations to keep the rhagades from worsening
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Limited evidence also supports the use of silver nitrate or potassium permanganate foams and topical antibiotics
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Oral antibiotics, however, may be necessary if infection of the rhagades occurs and worsens despite topical treatment. Randomized clinical trials assessing the prevention or treatment of EGFR-induced rhagades, however, have not been performed so far. No published data are available supporting prevention or treatment recommendations for those rhagades. Thus, evidence-based treatment recommendations for anti-EGFR induced painful rhagades do not exist. All recommendations are based on individual observation, case studies and expert opinion. Another problem is that for those rhagades typically seen during and after anti-EGFR treatment no suitable classification system or scoring system is available. The NCI CTCAE criteria do not comprise a useful scoring system for this type of side effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, an appropriate scoring system is warranted to classify the EGFR inhibitor induced rhagades and to allow rational treatment decisions based on a standardized clinical scoring system.</p><p>Liquid glues such as ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (ECA), an ethyl ester of the 2-cyano-2-propenoic acid, are often used as adhesive in a variety of different work settings in industry, e.g. as a component in nail-care products such as nail glue. Besides, ECA is commonly used for various medical indications, especially for the treatment of wounds, e.g. for liquid bandages in children and for suture-less surgery. It is a colorless liquid with low viscosity at normal room temperature and it polymerizes rapidly in the presence of moisture. Wound healing can be accelerated with ECA
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. ECA is suitable for the treatment of rhagades due to the direct proportional influence of the OH-group concentration of ECA on the age hardening velocity which occurs within a spit second
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Sealing the cracks with ECA may also help to relieve pain
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, applying ECA leads to wound closure and to an effective germ barrier which may lower the rate of secondary wound infections
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Dermatological toxicities, especially rhagades induced by EGFR inhibitors, critically affect patients&#x02019; health-related quality of life and, as a consequence, the dose intensity of EGFR inhibitors and, thus, the effectiveness of antineoplastic regimens. There are several patients known from observation who did not receive their planned course of anticancer treatment due to severe cutaneous side effects and who, therefore, had a poorer outcome of their disease. Due to the missing data from clinical trials on the prevention and the management of EGFR-inhibitor induced rhagades, the crucial impact of rhagades on the patient&#x02019;s wellbeing and QoL and the adherence to anticancer treatment, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials are warranted to evaluate treatment options for EGFR-inhibitor induced rhagades, which hopefully may allow the establishment of evidence-based prevention and treatment guidelines.</p><p>The SUPPORT trial is a prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled intervention trial exploring the efficacy of ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate for the treatment of painful cetuximab-induced rhagades compared to the standard treatment of each institution. In addition, the clinical usefulness of the SUPO score, a new classification system for rhagades induced by EGFR-inhibitor therapy, will be assessed and validated in a clearly defined patient cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><sec><title>Study objectives</title><p>The purpose of the SUPPORT trial is to evaluate the effect of topical applied ECA compared to standard treatment on the pain intensity and quality of life in patients suffering from painful cetuximab-induced rhagades during cetuximab-based radioimmunotherapy for LASCCHN.

Furthermore, a photo documentation of the rhagades will be performed on baseline, 24 hours after first application of ECA or standard treatment and 5 to 7 days later. Furthermore, the SUPO score will be used at screening, baseline, 24 hours and 5 to 7 days after application of the specific treatment for diagnostics as well as for the assessment of clinical response.

Rhagades are one of the most painful and most dreaded complications from EGFR inhibitor therapy Currently, neither a scoring system for cetuximab-induced rhagades for diagnostics nor a standard of care for the treatment of the rhagades is established. Prevention and management of EGFR-inhibitor-related rhagades, however, is critical to maintain patients&#x02019; health-related quality of life and dose intensity of antineoplastic regimens as the pain, the discomfort and the reduced QoL caused by the rhagades can reduce compliance with anti-EGFR therapy. For this reason, exact diagnosis and appropriate treatment are very important. The SUPPORT trial is the first randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating a new treatment option for painful cetuximab-induced rhagades. The main goal of this study is to show a superiority of ECA compared to common standard treatments for patients with LASCCHN developing painful rhagades during combined radioimmunotherapy with the monoclonal EGFR-antibody cetuximab. Since there is no scoring system for rhagades described elsewhere, the new SUPO score will be prospectively assessed in terms of clinical usefulness for the classification of EGFR inhibitor induced rhagades. An effective management of the painful rhagades is essential to assure a better quality of life for the patients, to allow a better adherence to cancer therapy and to avoid interruptions or even discontinuation of antineoplastic treatment associated with poor outcome. The results of the SUPPORT trial may help to define an evidence-based treatment approach for EGFR-inhibitor induced rhagades in the near future.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADL: Activities of daily living; DLQI: Dermatological life quality index; ECA: Ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate; EGFR: Epidermal growth factor receptor; GCP: Good clinical practice; LASCCHN: Locally advanced sqamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck; VAS: Visual analogue scale; QoL: Quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no financial or non-financial competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KP, GH, CS, DJ and JD have developed the study concept.
