conducting trunk stabilization exercise on females after menopause for 24 weeks. [Subjects
and Methods] Thirty three female subjects over 47 years old and under the age of 53 were
selected and 16 for experimental group and 17 for control group were randomly selected.
Experimental group had performed spinal and pelvic stabilization exercise 30 minutes a
day, 5times a week, for 24 weeks. Except for the daily life, control group did not
participate in any characteristic movement. Bone density of every member in experimental
group was measured using average value of bone density of 1st&#x02013;4th lumbar through
quantitative computer tomography. [Results] There was a meaningful difference in only
control group about measured value of bone density within each group, experimental and
control group, but there was no meaningful difference in measured value of bone density
between two groups, experimental group and control group. [Conclusion] Through this
research, we could see the fact that although trunk stability exercise could not change
bone density meaningfully, it could maintain bone density. In the future, it is randomly
necessary to study things related this because results of researches can show different
results according to exercise intensity, exercise period, age, weight, hormone status and
mediation period. It is considered that it will help to prevent and treat patients with
osteoporosis a lot.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Bone mineral density</kwd><kwd>Computer tomography</kwd><kwd>Low intensity exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Menopause appearing in a normal time is a state of amenorrhoea for 12 months continuously
without removing uterus or ovary surgically, injecting hormone and lack dietary<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that incidence of
cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis increase in postmenopausal women and overall body
composition are being changed negatively such as muscle weakness<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Especially,
osteoporosis is metabolic disease of bone and it occurs when bony tissue per unit volume
decreases and bone resorption rate increases<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fracture can occur easily by a minor shock through change of bone
density. So it lowers the quality of life<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Today, patients with osteoporosis are
increasing steadily because our country is aging society. But until now there is no sure
method of treatment<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. So, early diagnosis
and prevention are emphasized more. Medicine treatment is used in prevention and treatment
of osteoporosis. But many researches regarding exercise program which is a drug free
solution are being carried due to side effect and burden of expense about medicine. And
proper exercise program is considered as essential element to increase bone density, treat
and prevent osteoporosis<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jeong et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> said that postmenopausal women who received weight training for 48
weeks had a positive effect in terms of increase of bone density, isokinetic muscular
strength and body composition. Also, Yoo et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> performed weight bearing exercise and muscle strengthening exercise.
Meta analysis investigating effect on bone density of women in after middle age showed that
weight bearing exercise worked best and muscle strengthening exercise didn&#x02019;t have a
across-the- board result. On the other hand, Bocalini et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> performed muscle strengthening exercise targeting 25 menopausal
women for 24 weeks. And they measured bone density of before and after muscle strengthening
exercise. There was meaningful difference in group for resistance movement. Especially,
moderate resistance movement could inhibit bone loss of menopausal women and could inhibit
loss of bone density of a femur and lumbar spine bone. This study is a contrast to
Rittweger&#x02019;s<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> research that low
intensity of exercise can&#x02019;t increase bone density. It is considered that opinions about
change of bone density are unsound. But it is necessary to study effect of exercise related
to bone density systematically due to various advantages of exercise treatments which have
been used and recommended frequently in clinical. There are Dual Photon Absorptiometry,
Single Photon Absorptiometry, Dual energy x-ray Absorptiometry, Quantitative Computed
Tomography in methods to examine bone density for systematic research. Quantitative Computed
Tomography is measured by separating cancellous bone from cortical bone and it is so
accurate because of obtaining three dimensional pure bone density without overlapping with
other tissue<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Whereas many researches
about effect of exercise on bone density have been done, they are controversial in terms of
effect, intensity and period of exercise.</p><p>This research intends to contribute to preventing and treating osteoporosis for
postmenopausal women by finding effect of low intensity exercise on bone density through
performing spinal and pelvic stabilization exercise for 24 weeks and providing preliminary
clinical data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by bioethics Committee of Sehan university center (IRB) (Approval
number: 2014-10) on October 1, 2014. It had been done targeting 33 subjects taking checkups
over 47&#x02005;years old and under the age of 53 in a medical institution located in Jeollanamdo,
South Korea between 1 November, 2014 and 30 July, 2015 for 9 months. Subjects had not
regularly exercised for 6months and had not received hormone injection and medical treatment
for osteoporosis and women who have had a state of menopause for more than a year or under 2
years without special lesion were selected and intervened for 24 weeks and they understood
purpose of this study very well and agreed to participate in this study voluntarily. There
were 17 women for control group and 16 women for experimental group among total 33 women.
Distribution of age was 51.5&#x02005;years old in control group and 50.3&#x02005;years old in experimental
group. Height was 160.8&#x02005;cm in control group and 159.9&#x02005;cm in experimental group. Distribution
of weight was 62.7&#x02005;kg in control group and 63.6&#x02005;kg in experimental group. And distribution
of bone density was 62.04&#x02005;mg/cc in control group and 63.64&#x02005;mg/cc in experimental group.
There was no research variable appearing a meaningful difference in all general
characteristics between control group and experimental group. So, it showed that two groups
were the same. <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristic of subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=17)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group (n=16)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.5&#x000b1;3.5<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.3&#x000b1;4.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hight (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">160.8&#x000b1;5.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">159.9&#x000b1;5.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.7&#x000b1;6.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.6&#x000b1;6.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMC (mg/cc)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.0&#x000b1;9.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.6&#x000b1;5.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Mean&#x000b1; SD</p><p>Control group: non exercise group, Experimental group: trunk stabilization exercise

is senile osteoporosis. Osteoporosis after menopause which is type I causes compression
fracture of spine and distal radius fracture by decrease of spongy bone. And it often occurs
between 50 and 60&#x02005;years old<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is said
that osteoporosis after menopause is developed by losing the balance of osteoclasis and
osteogenesis due to increase of osteoclasis by osteoclast through decrease of estrogen
secretion<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, decrease of bone density is quickly progressing within three
years after menopause and average loss rate of bone density reaches 9 percent a decade while
aging is progressing in late forties<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Elements of exoskeleton and endoskeleton should be considered to maintain bone density and
prevent decrease of bone density. Body activities, exercise, hormone and nutrition and so on
are included in elements of exoskeleton and endoskeleton. Especially, exercise should be
surely considered for comprehensive management because it is not sufficient for medicine
treatment to decrease rate of bone loss<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Spinal and pelvic stabilization exercise which is low intensity exercise had been performed
to women after menopause for 24 weeks in this study and this study investigated effect of
low intensity exercise on bone density and found that there was no a meaningful difference
in change of bone density within experimental group which had 63.64&#x02005;mg/cc before doing
experiment and had 66.9&#x02005;mg/cc after doing experiment. But there was a meaningful difference
in change of bone density within control group which had 62.04&#x02005;mg/cc before doing experiment
and had 60.03&#x02005;mg/cc after doing experiment (p&#x0003c;0.05). And there was no meaningful
difference statistically in change of bone density between two groups. Bone density of
experiment group was 63.64&#x02005;mg/cc before doing experiment and 66.9&#x02005;mg/cc after doing
experiment. Bone density of control group was 62.04&#x02005;mg/cc before doing experiment and
60.03&#x02005;mg/cc after doing experiment.</p><p>Spinal and pelvic stabilization exercise failed to improve bone density but it could
maintain bone density when compared to control group. Lee<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> researched how training of t&#x02019;ai chi chuan affects bone density and
bone marker of women after menopause for 12 weeks. As a result, training of t&#x02019;ai chi chuan
for 12 weeks failed to increase bone density but it decreased rates of bone loss. Also,
Han<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> performed resistance exercise
program targeting 11 women after menopause for 6 weeks and measured bone density of lumbar
and femur. There was not a meaningful difference statistically in this result but bone
density of lumbar increased. It implies that we can see the change of bone density by doing
exercise for a short time and especially, this study receives support in the way that
exercises that don&#x02019;t have a high intensity such as t&#x02019;ai chi chuan can affect rates of bone
loss.</p><p>Also, Sinaki<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> said that if safety and
Peripheral muscle strengthening through load of direction of major axis of spine work
basically, it can help to prevent falling and spinal fracture of women with osteoporosis. On
the other hand, Wolf&#x02019;s<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> meta-analysis
showed that exercise should have a high intensity to have the change of bone density. Also,
Kelley&#x02019;s<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> meta-analysis showed that
exercise of low intensity can&#x02019;t make change of bone density. But, recently meta analysis
performed by Tanaka et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> made an
interesting offer that Asian don&#x02019;t need to do exercise of high intensity than Westerner.
They claimed that Asian has lower BMI than Westerner. And because persons who have a slender
frame (&#x0003c;57.8&#x02005;kg) or women have a small bone mass from the beginning, exercise of low
intensity can affect bone density of persons who have a small frame as Asian<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. This hypothesis supports this study.</p><p>T&#x02019;ai chi chuan mentioned earlier is a low intensity exercise which has advantages that it
does not use tools and it is not limited by place<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, spinal and pelvic stabilization exercise used in this study
is a low intensity exercise which has advantages that it doesn&#x02019;t use tools and it can be
performed at home or everywhere in indoor. We expect that it can prevent osteoporosis
occurred after menopause and can be a good way to reduce loss in terms of social
economy<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. But many researches are
showing different results about exercise intensity and exercise period. We can guess that
many researches can have different results because taking calcium agent, injecting hormone
and daily life were not controlled properly<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. But most researches have a common opinion that proper exercise has
a positive effect on prevention and treatment of osteoporosis<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, this study did not control taking calcium agent, daily life,
and starting point of menopause of subjects exactly. But through this research, we can see
the fact that although trunk stability exercise cannot change bone density meaningfully, it
can maintain bone density. In the future, it is randomly necessary to study things related
this because results of researches can show different results according to exercise
intensity, exercise period, age, weight, hormone status and mediation period. It is
considered that it will help to prevent and treat patients with osteoporosis a lot.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by the Sehan University Research Fund in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Francucci</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Romagni</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Camilletti</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effect of natural early menopause on bone mineral
