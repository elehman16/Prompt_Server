We present a fundamental modular concept for CLC design, illustrated by clinical studies involving 11 adolescents and 27 adults at the Universities of Virginia, Padova, and Montpellier. We tested two modular CLC constructs: standard control to range (sCTR), designed to augment pump plus CGM by preventing extreme glucose excursions; and enhanced control to range (eCTR), designed to truly optimize control within near normoglycemia of 3.9&#x02013;10 mmol/L. The CLC system was fully integrated using automated data transfer CGM&#x02192;algorithm&#x02192;CSII. All studies used randomized crossover design comparing CSII versus CLC during identical 22-h hospitalizations including meals, overnight rest, and 30-min exercise. sCTR increased significantly the time in near normoglycemia from 61 to 74%, simultaneously reducing hypoglycemia 2.7-fold. eCTR improved mean blood glucose from 7.73 to 6.68 mmol/L without increasing hypoglycemia, achieved 97% in near normoglycemia and 77% in tight glycemic control, and reduced variability overnight. In conclusion, sCTR and eCTR represent sequential steps toward automated CLC, preventing extremes (sCTR) and further optimizing control (eCTR). This approach inspires compelling new concepts: modular assembly, sequential deployment, testing, and clinical acceptance of custom-built CLC systems tailored to individual patient needs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The maintenance of close-to-normal blood glucose (BG) levels slows the onset and progression of long-term microvascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>); therefore, the ultimate therapeutic goal of type 1 diabetes is to restore near normoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In the past decade, the advent of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and automated CGM-assisted insulin delivery, known as artificial pancreas or closed-loop control (CLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), have accelerated the achievement of this goal. Although the traditional therapeutic strategies target long-term average BG reduction measured by HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), CLC aims to minimize, in real time, glucose variability and prevent extreme glucose excursions (e.g., hypo- and hyperglycemia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This objective is achieved via frequent insulin adjustment modulated by a CLC algorithm, which takes into account CGM readings and the effects of previous insulin infusions to continuously compute the amount of insulin dose to be administered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Historically (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), systems controlling BG automatically can be traced back decades ago to when the possibility for external BG regulation was demonstrated using intravenous BG measurements and intravenous infusions of insulin and glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, these systems were cumbersome and unsuitable for long-term, or outpatient, use. The development of both CGM and portable devices for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) incited the implementation of subcutaneous CLC systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Promising results have been reported by several research groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Most of these studies point out the superiority of CLC over standard CSII therapy in terms of increased time within target glucose range (typically 3.9&#x02013;10 mmol/L), reduced incidence of hypoglycemia, and better overnight control.</p><p>However, to date, there are no randomized crossover studies of fully integrated CLC, defined as having all of the following three components: <italic>1</italic>) automated data transfer from the CGM to the controller, <italic>2</italic>) real-time control action, and <italic>3</italic>) automated command of the insulin pump. Only one previously reported study has a state-of-the-art randomized crossover design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), but it lacks automated data transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Conversely, the studies that use fully integrated glucose control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) do not follow a randomized crossover design.</p><p>We have developed a novel approach to CLC algorithm design based on a modular architecture concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Such a modular architecture would allow diverse components to be seamlessly integrated in a functional hierarchical system that can be sequentially deployed in clinical and ambulatory studies. Modularity allows a stepwise regulated approach: first, algorithmic modules designed to improve patient safety are implemented; and second, increasingly complex modules designed to optimally modulate insulin delivery in real time are used.</p><p>With this background in mind, we now present two multicenter randomized crossover trials using two fully integrated subcutaneous CLC systems based on the modular architecture concept (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Both systems aimed at maintaining near normoglycemia in the 3.9&#x02013;10 mmol/L target range and implemented a strategy known as control to range (CTR). The first system, standard CTR (sCTR), included a safety supervision module (SSM) mitigating the risk for hypoglycemia, and an sCTR algorithm activated when hyperglycemia was predicted. The task of sCTR was to prevent hypoglycemia and mitigate extreme hyperglycemia, without truly aiming for optimal glucose control. The second system, enhanced CTR (eCTR), included the same SSM to prevent hypoglycemia but coupled with a more sophisticated model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. The task of eCTR was optimal glucose control within a target range.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>FIG. 1.</label><caption><p>Design and profile of randomized clinical trials and timeline of inpatient admissions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2230fig1"/></fig><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>FIG. 2.</label><caption><p>Modular architecture of CTR.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2230fig2"/></fig><p>For both algorithms, we assess effectiveness of the system as reflected by time spent in near normoglycemia (3.9&#x02013;10 mmol/L), average glucose, and glucose variability.

At each site, after obtaining written informed consent, patients were randomized to determine the order of open-loop CSII and CLC. Patients were equipped with two CGM devices, either Dexcom 7 (Dexcom, Inc., San Diego, CA) or Navigator (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA), at least 24 h before admission and after careful instruction on their use. CGM devices were calibrated as per manufacturer schedule, using self-monitoring of BG measurements before admission and YSI (Yellow Spring Instruments) measurements during admission. Navigator was used at MON and Dexcom 7 was used at the other two sites; a posteriori analysis of CGM accuracy led to the conclusion that both CGMs performed similarly in terms of mean absolute difference and mean absolute relative difference (nonsignificant two-sample <italic>t</italic> test), and accuracy was improved compared with &#x0201c;at home&#x0201d; use, probably because of YSI calibrations. During the open-loop admission, patients used their own insulin pump to control BG according to capillary BG measured at patients&#x02019; discretion and at least before and 2 h after meals and snacks, at bedtime, and before and after exercise. Just before the closed-loop admission, one sensor was chosen by the study physician based on accuracy and signal quality and was used thereafter to drive the CLC system; the second sensor remained as backup in case of a primary sensor failure. Patients were equipped with Omnipod Insulin Management Systems (Insulet Corporation, Bedford, MA) filled with Humalog insulin (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN).</p><p>Studies 1 and 2 used identical protocols, which lasted 22 h as depicted by the timeline in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, including 30 min of moderate exercise (adults: 50% <italic>V</italic><sc>o</sc><sub>2max</sub>; adolescents: OMNI rate of perceived exertion &#x0003c;3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), a patient-selected meal (1.08 &#x000b1; 0.24 g carbohydrate per kg of weight, identical for both admissions), a standardized snack (20 g carbohydrate), and an 18-h CLC on the experimental days. Reference glucose values were obtained using plasma measurements (YSI 2300/2700) at least every hour over the span of the protocol (every 30 min at UVA) and more frequently during and for 1 h after exercise (every 5 and 10 min, respectively) and for an hour after meals (every 10 min). Hypoglycemia was defined as YSI reading &#x0003c;3.9 mmol/L or the occurrence of hypoglycemic symptoms (sweating, trembling, difficulty in thinking, dizziness, or impaired coordination). Hypoglycemia was treated with glucose tablets, the amount of which was left to physician discretion.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Control algorithms.</title><p>The control algorithms used by studies 1 and 2&#x02014;sCTR and eCTR, respectively&#x02014;were designed and tested in silico using computer simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), and each algorithm had a different focus: in study 1, the emphasis was on safety and prevention of hypo- and hyperglycemia, while in study 2, the emphasis was on tight glycemic control. Nevertheless, as outlined above, both control algorithms relied on the same modular architecture and belonged to the same CTR class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><sec id="s5"><title>Modular architecture.</title><p>The modular architecture of the CTR system comprises <italic>1</italic>) the bottom system layer (SSM), which operates continuously and is in charge of prevention of hypoglycemia&#x02014;the major barrier to tight glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>); <italic>2</italic>) the middle layer (range control module), which is responsible for real-time correction of insulin dosing and is different in sCTR and eCTR; and <italic>3</italic>) the top layer, which tunes the real-time control layer using clinical parameters and historical data, which was done off-line in this implementation. The communications between the CGM sensor, the CTR system, and the insulin pump were handled by the artificial pancreas system (APS) software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>The two algorithms presented below include the SSM (bottom layer) and different range controllers (middle layer).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>sCTR: Study 1.</title><p>The two modules of sCTR are the SSM and a standard range control module that avoids prolonged hyperglycemic excursions. Both modules use a real-time estimate of the patient&#x02019;s metabolic state based on CGM and insulin infusion data. This estimate is used for prediction of the risks of hypo- and hyperglycemia 30&#x02013;45 min ahead of the event. If a risk for hypoglycemia is predicted, the SSM attenuates automatically any insulin requests proportionally to the predicted risk level. How aggressively the system attenuates insulin is determined with readily available patient characteristics (e.g., body weight, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, and basal insulin delivery) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). If a risk for hyperglycemia is predicted, the range controller introduces a correction bolus using the predicted plasma glucose and the patient&#x02019;s CSII parameters to reach a predetermined glucose target (8.3 mmol/L); the system injects only half of the computed bolus and can do so once every hour. Premeal boluses are calculated by the patients, based on their usual routine. The meal carbohydrate content was provided to the patient as measured in the clinical research center (CRC) kitchen.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>eCTR: Study 2.</title><p>The two modules of the eCTR are the SSM and an enhanced range control module based on an MPC algorithm that aims to maintain glycemia in a target range. eCTR also uses insulin-on-board constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) intended to prevent insulin overdose during intensified therapy.</p><p>The rationale behind MPC was presented in detail in a recent review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).

One path toward CLC systems suitable for outpatient use can be charted by our modular approach: starting with a relatively simpler SSM operating alone, then adding more complex range control modules, and ultimately moving to control to target to approximate glycemic excursions in health. In addition to validated algorithmic components, initial outpatient studies will likely require back-end servers and communication tools for remote monitoring and intervention. Finally, to cope with the changing environmental conditions and with the physiological/behavioral changes of the patient, the future ambulatory artificial pancreas will have to adapt to the changes in an individual&#x02019;s biobehavioral parameters over time. Possible methods to cope with changing daily conditions include individual controller calibration strategies and run-to-run control algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), as well as behavioral analysis and profiling of patient lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). These approaches find their natural application in the upper layer of the modular architecture.</p><p>The two CTR systems tested here share the same lower architectural layer (SSM) but differ in the middle layer (range control module). In particular, sCTR is designed as an adjunct to CSII therapy: it operates only when the patient&#x02019;s risk for hypo- or hyperglycemia warrants adjustment of insulin delivery and resumes the usual CSII treatment when the danger has passed. eCTR includes the same safety module as sCTR but augmented by insulin-on-board constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and a range control module, based on MPC. eCTR aims to achieve tight glycemic control via take over of patient management of CSII (i.e., it is designed to control basal rate and to leave residual interaction only to trigger premeal insulin boluses, with insulin amount automatically calculated based on an estimate of meal intake).</p><p>As intended, sCTR improved patient safety, as shown by a significant decrease in the frequency of hypoglycemic events, and at the same time increased the time spent in near normoglycemia. This improvement was most prominent for patients with suboptimal CSII self-therapy: when we compared patients with below- versus above-median time in near normoglycemia on CSII, we determined that patients in poor control had greater benefits increasing their time in near normoglycemia from 39.5 to 65.4% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002), while patients with a better control maintained their time in near normoglycemia (80.9 vs. 82.6%). In other words, sCTR was most beneficial for subjects with poorer glycemic control at baseline.</p><p>In eCTR, the combination of a safety and an aggressive range control reduced significantly the average glucose, as well as glucose variability overnight&#x02014;results not reported to date with CLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, upper panels)&#x02014;and achieved close to 100% time within target range overnight and nearly 80% time spent within the tight range of 4.4&#x02013;7.8 mmol/L. It is important to note that eCTR reduced simultaneously average glycemia and glucose variability, which suggests that improved glycemic control would be possible using eCTR without concurrent increase in the risk for hypoglycemia.</p><p>Previous studies report significant increase in time within target overnight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and reduction in glucose variability as shown by a recent across-trial meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The studies presented here are therefore a step forward in the advancement of CLC, reporting improvement in both average glucose and glucose variability. Despite differences in control architecture and experimental protocol, it is also worthwhile to compare our results with those reported in a 24-h study of CLC using insulin and glucagon without premeal boluses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In a first set of experiments that had comparable mean BG (7.8&#x02013;8.3 mmol/L), 5 out of 11 subjects in that study (44%) experienced hypoglycemia despite glucagon injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Here we show that the SSM was similarly effective in preventing hypoglycemia without glucagon use: in our study 1, a total of 8 out of 25 patients (32%) experienced hypoglycemia during closed loop. Of note, in a second set of experiments, the glucagon system prevented all hypoglycemic events, but at the expense of increasing average glucose to 9.1 mmol/L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>It should also be noted that interday metabolic variations could lead to different outcomes in the same patient tested twice. This effect artificially increases variability during statistical analysis and can result in nonsignificant findings, particularly with a small number of subjects (such as in study 2). This limitation is intrinsic to pilot studies and cannot be avoided without multiple repeated admissions, both in open and closed loop for each subject, or without long-term outpatient experiments. Other limitations of the research presented here include short-term hospital-based studies, exact meal timing and balanced food composition, and standardized exercise. While these limitations, to a large extent, are mitigated by the randomized crossover design of our protocols, all of them gradually will be surmounted in subsequent work.</p><p>In conclusion, sCTR and eCTR represent sequential modular approaches toward and tightening of automated glycemic control. Therefore, specific clinical applications for each algorithm configuration can be speculated: for example, patients with both poor control and high BG variability, particularly at night, would benefit from using sCTR. In contrast, patients who are in good self-control with CSII, but who wish to further improve their therapy, would be potential candidates for eCTR. In other words, the modular approach to APSs prompts a compelling new concept: assembly from available modules of CLC algorithms tailored to individual patient needs. Further outpatient studies in larger patient groups and with longer duration therefore will be needed to bring CLC into mainstream clinical practice. Nevertheless, we believe that the modular CTR approach proposed here is an important step toward the development of a viable artificial pancreas, a foundation for stepwise deployment of CLC in home-based studies, and of high relevance to the future treatment of type 1 diabetes aiming to improve quality of life and prevention of long-term complications.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1445/-/DC1">http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1445/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn2"><p>See accompanying commentary, p. <related-article related-article-type="companion" id="d34e928" vol="61" page="2221" ext-link-type="pmc">2221</related-article>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was funded by a grant from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation as part of the Artificial Pancreas Consortium; by Fondo per gli investimenti della ricerca di base (FIRB) &#x0201c;Artificial Pancreas: In Silico Development and In Vivo Validation of Algorithms for Blood Glucose Control,&#x0201d; funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities, and Research; and by National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Grant 5-R21-DK-85641.</p><p>Insulet Corporation (Bedford, MA), Dexcom, Inc.
