Accordingly, an important objective in higher professional and vocational education is to educate students to become self-regulating learners who are driven to work on their professional development throughout their career (Boekaerts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1997</xref>; Bolhuis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2003</xref>; Candy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2000</xref>; Loyens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>; Zimmerman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1990</xref>). Typically, to nurture students&#x02019; self-regulated learning (SRL) capabilities, educational institutions in western countries offer their students mentoring, tutoring, and study skills classes. In these classes, students may learn to use self-regulated learning strategies, including self-reflection and goal-selection strategies to assess their learning needs and to select professional development activities to meet those needs (Hansford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2004</xref>; Jacobi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1991</xref>; Van den Boomet al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2007</xref>). In addition, most institutions enable their students to self-select professional development activities (i.e., activities to improve their professional competencies) by offering them a choice of elective assignments, projects, minors, and internships.</p><p>In this context, an important question is which SRL strategies optimally support students&#x02019; motivation to put effort into professional development activities. In the present research, we addressed this question by examining the effects of two types of SRL strategies on students&#x02019; perceived competence, intrinsic motivation, and effort intentions: <italic>strength</italic>-<italic>based SRL strategies</italic> (i.e., identifying perceived relative strengths and, subsequently, selecting professional development activities to further improve those strengths) versus <italic>deficit</italic>-<italic>based SRL strategies</italic> (i.e., identifying individual shortcomings and, subsequently, selecting professional development activities to improve those shortcomings).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Strength-based versus deficit-based SRL strategies</title><p>Self-regulated learning strategies refer to the self-controlled actions, such as self-evaluation, self-reflection, goal-selection, goal-setting, planning, and self-monitoring, that individuals take to acquire skills and knowledge and to optimize their learning (Sitzmann and Ely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2011</xref>; Zimmerman and Pons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1986</xref>). In higher professional and vocation education, a common practice for self-reflection and subsequent goal-selection is to review individual shortcomings and select professional development activities to improve those shortcomings. Specifically, in competency-based education, the standards that students have to meet are explicated in a competency profile. Students are then stimulated to reflect on their present level of competency relative to those standards, and to engage in professional development activities (which may be at school or on a job) to diminish the gap (Hoogveld et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2005</xref>; Kenkel and Peterson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2010</xref>; Lurie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>; Pintrich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2004</xref>; Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2010</xref>).</p><p>Clearly, such deficit-based SRL strategies can motivate students to put effort into professional development activities. For example, control theories (Carver and Scheier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1981</xref>; Powers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1973</xref>) posit that motivated behavior results from the perception of a discrepancy between the actual situation and a standard. However, a drawback of deficit-based SRL strategies is their inherent focus on students&#x02019; shortcomings, that is, the performance dimensions on which students feel relatively incompetent. As emphasized by influential motivational theories, such as self-efficacy theory (Bandura <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1997</xref>), self-determination theory (Ryan and Deci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2000</xref>), and the achievement goal approach (Elliot and Church <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>), perceived competence is an important determinant of motivation. Therefore, an exclusive focus on deficit-based SRL strategies may not be the most effective way to motivate students to put effort into professional development activities.</p><p>To address this issue, several scholars (Kluger and Nir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>; Linley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>; Seligman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2005</xref>) have proposed strength-based strategies, which entail that individuals assess their strengths, rather than their shortcomings, and select activities to further improve those strengths. Although improving shortcomings is obviously indispensable for mastering a profession, we suspect that that, to educate driven self-regulating learners, strength-based SRL strategies may make a valuable <italic>complement</italic> to the common deficit-based SRL strategies. Because their inherent focus on the performance dimensions on which students feel relatively competent, strength-based SRL strategies may support students&#x02019; motivation to put effort into professional development activities.</p><p>However, no research to date has examined the effects of strength-based versus deficit-based SRL strategies on students&#x02019; willingness to put effort into professional development activities. To fill this gap, we experimentally tested our research model, which posits that strength-based versus deficit-based SRL strategies positively affect effort intentions through subsequently perceived competence and intrinsic motivation (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Research model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11031_2015_9488_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Toward a research model</title><p>Students who focus on improving their strengths, rather than improving their shortcomings, may feel more competent, more intrinsically motivated, and more willing to expend effort. Indeed, research indicates that working on strengths is related to various motivational concepts. For example, in a cross-sectional study, Wood et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2011</xref>) found a positive link between use of strengths and self-esteem. Similarly, Linley et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>) found that using strengths was associated with goal progress and the fulfillment of psychological needs, including the need for competence. Furthermore, Proctor et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2011</xref>) found that use of strengths was associated with higher self-esteem and more self-efficacy. In addition, evidence for causal links has been obtained in a few experimental studies that compared strength-based interventions to a control group. For example, in a randomized experiment among undergraduates, Louis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2008</xref>) tested a strength-based development course against a waiting list control group and found that students in the intervention group were higher in perceived academic control. In a similar study among high school students, Austin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2005</xref>) tested a strength-based development course against a traditional health education course and found that the strength-based development course resulted in higher academic intrinsic motivation. Finally, in a study among university students, Rechter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>) demonstrated that, relative to a traditional feedback review, a strength-based feed-forward review resulted in higher self-efficacy and stronger effort intentions. However, although the findings of these experimental studies suggest that strength-based interventions may positively affect individuals&#x02019; perceived competence, intrinsic motivation, and effort intentions, a couple of limitations should be noted. First, these studies compared broad interventions, that is, courses and reviews, which varied on multiple dimensions. Therefore, the specific causes of the reported effects cannot be determined unambiguously. Second, in these studies, strength-based interventions were not compared with deficit-based interventions. Therefore, we do not know whether strength-based interventions lead to better results than the common deficit-based interventions. Third, these experiments did not examine underlying motivational processes.</p><p>To address these limitations, in the present research, we experimentally varied the conditions on a single strength-based versus deficit-based dimension and tested the effects on both process and outcome variables. Specifically, we tested the causal effects of strength-based versus deficit-based SRL strategies on students&#x02019; effort intentions and examined the mediating effects of perceived competence and intrinsic motivation. We discuss our research model (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) in more detail below.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Perceived competence</title><p>Because strength-based SRL strategies, relative to deficit-based SRL strategies, direct students&#x02019; attention toward the positive rather than the negative aspects of their functioning, we reasoned that the effects of strength-based versus deficit-based SRL strategies on perceived competence may be similar to the effects of positive feedback versus negative feedback. Several theorists have posited that positive feedback rather than negative feedback is beneficial for learning effort, because it bolsters students&#x02019; perceived competence or self-efficacy (Bandura <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1997</xref>; Ryan and Deci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2000</xref>). Indeed, research indicates that, relative to negative feedback, positive feedback enhances individuals&#x02019; self-evaluations (e.g., Baron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1988</xref>; Escart&#x000ed; and Guzm&#x000e1;n <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1999</xref>; Reeve and Deci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1996</xref>; Vallerand and Reid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1988</xref>; for a review, see Vallerand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1997</xref>). For example, Reeve and Deci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1996</xref>) examined the effects of (bogus) feedback on participants&#x02019; perceived competence in a puzzle-solving task. Their results showed that participants receiving negative feedback reported lower levels of perceived competence than participants receiving positive feedback. Similarly, research examining the effects of <italic>knowledge of results</italic> indicates that feedback on positive performances rather than feedback on negative performances enhances students&#x02019; competency perceptions and learning (e.g., Chiviacowsky and Wulf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007</xref>; Badami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>; Saemi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>). For example, Saemi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>) found that providing students with feedback after relatively good trials on a motor learning task resulted in higher self-efficacy compared with providing feedback after weaker trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intrinsic motivation</title><p>The effects of perceived competence on intrinsic motivation have been articulated in several theories. For example, both effectance motivation theory (Harter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1992</xref>) and cognitive evaluation theory (Deci and Ryan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1985</xref>) posit that individuals are more likely to manifest intrinsic motivation when they believe themselves to be more competent. Indeed, in an experimental study, Vallerand and Reid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1984</xref>) found that the effect of positive versus negative feedback on intrinsic motivation was mediated by perceived competence in a motor task. In another experimental study, Jussim et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1992</xref>, Study 3) found that positive versus negative feedback in an anagram task significantly affected intrinsic motivation through perceived competence. Similarly, Badami et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>) found that positive versus negative feedback enhanced participants&#x02019; intrinsic motivation through perceived competence in a golf-putting task.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Effort intentions</title><p>Intrinsic motivation is commonly regarded as beneficial for learning (Stipek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2002</xref>; Guay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>). Research has shown that intrinsic motivation is associated with valued educational outcomes, such as challenge seeking (Boggiano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1988</xref>; Vansteenkiste et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2004</xref>), persistence (Hardr&#x000e9; and Reeve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2003</xref>; Vallerand and Bissonnette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1992</xref>), achievement (Grolnick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1991</xref>; Miserandino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1996</xref>), and subjective well-being (Ryan and Connell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1989</xref>; Levesque et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>). Intrinsic motivation is typically examined as a process variable, linking antecedents of motivation to outcome variables, including effort intentions. For example, in a meta-analysis of 21 articles in the context of physical education, Chatzisarantis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2003</xref>) found that intrinsic motivation mediated the relationship between perceived competence and intentions to engage in physical exercise. Further, in a cross-sectional study into school drop-out among high school students, Vallerand et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1997</xref>) observed that self-determined motivation (a concept which includes intrinsic motivation) mediated the relation between perceived competence and intention to remain in school. In a similar study, Lavigne et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>) found that self-determined motivation to study science mediated the relation between perceived competence and intention to pursue science education. Furthermore, in a cross-sectional study among teachers, S&#x000f8;reb&#x000f8; et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2009</xref>) reported a positive link between intrinsic motivation and intention to use e-learning facilities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Overview of the present studies</title><p>The present research adds to the extant literature on SRL strategies and motivation by examining the <italic>causal effects</italic> of strength-based versus deficit-based<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> SRL strategies on students&#x02019; effort intentions, including the <italic>mediating effects</italic> of perceived competence and intrinsic motivation. We tested our research model (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) in two randomized experiments. In Study 1, we contrasted a strength-based SRL strategy with a deficit-based SRL strategy condition, and examined the effects on students&#x02019; perceived competence, intrinsic motivation, and effort intentions on a hypothetical school project. In Study 2, we added a neutral SRL strategy condition, and assessed the effects on students&#x02019; perceived competence, intrinsic motivation, and effort intentions on a professional development activity that they actually intended to carry out. <italic>Hypothesis 1</italic> was that strength-based versus deficit-based SRL strategies positively affect perceived competence, intrinsic motivation, and effort intentions. <italic>Hypothesis 2</italic> was that the effect of strength-based versus deficit-based SRL strategies on effort intentions is sequentially mediated by perceived competence and intrinsic motivation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Method Study 1</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Participants</title><p>The participants were 174 first-year to fourth-year bachelor&#x02019;s students (32&#x000a0;% men), representing different schools, including Healthcare (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;39), Management (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;52), Education (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;45), and Technology (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;38).

Participants first completed the &#x0201c;professional qualities test&#x0201d;, a 155-item inventory in which they were asked to indicate the extent to which 31 positive attributes applied to them. The test was based on the Dutch Abridged Big Five Circumplex (De Raad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1992</xref>). Sample items are, &#x0201c;I do my work in an accurate manner&#x0201d; (accurate), &#x0201c;I often talk to a lot of people&#x0201d; (communicative), and &#x0201c;I am a dependable person&#x0201d; (dependable). Response categories ranged from 1 (<italic>does not apply to me at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>completely applies to me</italic>). The scores on the five items of each subscale were averaged to calculate an index for each professional quality (all Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas &#x0003e;.63). The test outcome showed a rank order of professional qualities, ranging from #1 (<italic>applies most to me</italic>) to #31 (<italic>applies least to me</italic>).

Next, participants were asked to imagine that they signed up for a school project in which they could improve their #1 ranked professional quality (strength-based SRL strategy condition) or their #31 ranked professional quality (deficit-based SRL strategy condition), respectively.

In 90-min sessions, the participants conducted a self-reflection and goal-selection exercise, and completed a questionnaire. The exercise was based on Seligman et al.

First, using a Q-sorting procedure, students rank ordered 34 short descriptions of professional qualities, similar to those used in Study 1, on a scale ranging from #1 (<italic>applies most to me</italic>) to #34 (<italic>applies least to me</italic>). Second, participants were randomly assigned (see footnote 2) to a condition in which they were instructed to select one professional quality they wanted to work on during the following week, from their #1 to #5 ranked qualities (strength-based SRL strategy condition; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;75), from their #15 to #19 ranked qualities (neutral SRL strategy condition; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;90), or from their #30 to #34 ranked qualities (deficit-based SRL strategy condition; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;102). Third, the participants described in their own words the professional quality they had chosen. Fourth, the participants listed as many activities as they could think of to improve themselves on this quality. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows a number of examples of the activities that the participants thought up. Fifth, the participants selected from the activities they had listed, one activity to carry out during the following week.

Furthermore, Study 2 yielded additional empirical support for the hypothesis that the effect of strength-based versus deficit-based SRL strategies on effort intentions is subsequently mediated by perceived competence and intrinsic motivation. The findings of Study 2 extend those of Study 1 by demonstrating that these effects hold under real-life conditions, that is, when students themselves think up and select a professional development activity that they actually intend to carry out, rather than imagine a hypothetical project. In addition, the findings of Study 2 show that strength-based SRL strategies lead to more optimal outcomes than neutral SRL strategies. That is, strength-based SRL strategies resulted in higher perceived competence and intrinsic motivation; the difference in effort intentions was in the expected direction, but not significant.</p><p>Notably, the effect sizes in Study 2 were smaller than in Study 1. This may be explained by two differences in methodology. First, in Study 1 the students picked <italic>the highest</italic> ranked versus <italic>the lowest</italic> ranked professional quality to work on, whereas in Study 2, the students picked <italic>one of the five highest</italic> ranked, versus <italic>one of the five lowest</italic> ranked qualities to work on. Second, in Study 1 the students selected a hypothetical project, whereas in Study 2 the students selected a concrete activity that they had thought up themselves. Both differences in methodology are likely to diminish the contrast between the strength-based and the deficit-based SRL strategy condition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>General discussion</title><p>On the basis of our consistent findings across two randomized experiments, we conclude that, relative to deficit-based SRL strategies, strength-based SRL strategies positively affect students&#x02019; perceived competence, intrinsic motivation, and effort intentions. Moreover, in both studies, we found that perceived competence and intrinsic motivation sequentially mediated the effect of strength-based versus deficit-based SRL strategies on effort intentions.</p><p>These findings extend previous research in several ways. First, because we used a randomized experimental design, we were able to establish a causal relation between strength-based versus deficit-based SRL strategies and the dependent variables. As we used specific, unidimensional interventions, we are confident that the observed effects can be attributed to the use of strength-based versus deficit-based SRL strategies, that is, the selection of a project (Study 1) or a self-thought up activity (Study 2) to improve a perceived relative strength versus shortcoming. Second, because we contrasted strength-based SRL strategies with deficit-based SRL strategies, we now know that strength-based SRL strategies lead to higher perceived competence, intrinsic motivation, and effort intentions than the common deficit-based SRL strategies. We also demonstrated that strength-based SRL strategies lead to higher perceived competence and intrinsic motivation relative to neutral SRL strategies (i.e., a condition in which students selected an activity to improve a quality that they perceived as neither a strength nor a shortcoming). Third, the results of our multi-mediator analysis and structural equation modeling provide a better understanding of <italic>why</italic> strength-based versus deficit-based SRL strategies differently affect students&#x02019; effort intentions: namely, through perceived competence and intrinsic motivation.</p><p>More in general, our findings add to the literature on enhancing students&#x02019; intrinsic motivation to learn. Several theories, such as effectance motivation theory (Harter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1992</xref>), self-determination theory (Ryan and Deci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2000</xref>), and self-concordance theory (Sheldon and Elliot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1999</xref>), posit that intrinsic motivation is beneficial for learning. However, these theories do not articulate <italic>how</italic> students can self-select intrinsically motivating activities to improve their competencies. The present research demonstrates that students can self-select intrinsically motivating professional development activities by identifying their perceived relative strengths and aiming at further improving those strengths.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that our findings seem to contradict the position of scholars who posit that self-enhancing interventions do not improve learning (Forsyth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>; cf. Baumeister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2003</xref>; Mueller and Dweck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1998</xref>). Specifically, Forsyth et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>) suggested on the basis of experimental research that self-enhancing interventions may even be detrimental to learning. In their study, Forsyth et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>) manipulated the feedback that students received while preparing for a psychology exam. Their results indicated that students who received self-bolstering feedback performed worse relative to a control group. However, three specific differences between Forsyth et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>) and our research may explain these divergent findings. First, Forsyth et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>) conducted a feedback intervention which affected students&#x02019; efforts while they were working toward a preset goal, whereas we conducted a goal-selection intervention that affected which activities the students selected. As explained by Vancouver et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2002</xref>), self-enhancing interventions may differently affect students&#x02019; learning, depending on the self-regulatory process that is affected (e.g., performance monitoring versus goal-selection). Second, Forsyth et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>) affirmed students on the global level of self-esteem by sending emails with statements such as, &#x0201c;Hold your head and your self-esteem high&#x0201d;. In contrast, our strength-based SRL strategy intervention affirmed students on specific professional qualities, such as &#x0201c;creative&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;focused&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;unprejudiced&#x0201d;. Indeed, research has shown that the effects of affirmative interventions may differ depending on the level of specificity of the message (Hattie and Timperley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>; Baumeister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2003</xref>). Third, the study of Forsyth et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>) was conducted in the context of the mandatory curriculum, whereas our research was conducted in the context of professional self-development. Clearly, when preparing for a mandatory exam, intrinsic motivation is less of a prerequisite for effort (Sansone and Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2000</xref>; Lepper and Henderlong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>), however, in the context of professional self-development, intrinsic motivation is crucial for ensuring effort. In sum, the phase of the self-regulatory process (performance-monitoring versus goal-selection), the level of specificity (global self-esteem versus specific qualities), and the amount of autonomy (externally controlled versus self-development) may be significant moderators of the effects of self-enhancing interventions on students&#x02019; efforts. As far as we are concerned, testing the moderating role of these factors should be put high on the empirical agenda.</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The consistency of the findings across both experimental studies indicates the robustness of our findings. In addition, because we tested the effects of SRL strategies under field conditions, the ecological validity and practical relevance of our studies is high, which is an important strength. In contrast, the reliance on self-report measures, albeit appropriate for studies on motivational processes, may be considered a limitation. However, the assessment of self-report effort intentions, rather than actual behavioral effort, is an obvious consequence of the methodology we used. That is, the consequence of using Seligman et al.&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2005</xref>) procedure in a field setting is that students themselves can think up a wide range of different professional development activities. As can be seen in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, these activities vary substantially in terms of time expenditure. Consequently, these activities are not comparable at the behavioral level.</p><p>Furthermore, although our findings provide empirical evidence for the causal effects of strength-based versus deficit-based SRL strategies on perceived competence, intrinsic motivation, and effort intentions, our follow-up mediation and SEM analyses only provide suggestive evidence that the effects of these SRL strategies on effort intentions are sequentially mediated by perceived competence and intrinsic motivation. In future studies, series of experiments may be conducted to empirically establish the proposed causal chain (e.g., Spencer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Practical implications</title><p>Our findings have clear implications for the use of SRL strategies in higher professional and vocational education. Many educators aim for their students to become self-regulating learners who are driven to work on their professional development. However, the question is whether deficit-based SRL strategies, which are common practice, are the most optimal way to motivate students to put effort into professional development activities. Professional self-development requires willingness to expend effort, which appears to be a function of perceived competence and intrinsic motivation. Our findings demonstrate that these outcomes are induced by strength-based rather than by deficit-based SRL strategies. Therefore, we suggest that, to stimulate students&#x02019; to put effort into professional development activities, educators may teach their students to use strength-based SRL strategies. For example, the strength-based SRL strategy that we examined in Study 2 may be taught in mentoring, tutoring or study skills classes. For more practical suggestions, see Bouskila-Yam and Kluger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>), Clifton and Anderson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>), and Linley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>).</p><p>Finally, just to be clear, we do not suggest that strength-based SRL strategies are <italic>a substitute</italic> for deficit-based SRL strategies. Deficit-based SRL strategies are a sine qua non to qualify for any profession. That is, students need to work on diminishing the gap between their present level of competency and the prevailing standards for a particular profession. However, to enhance students&#x02019; motivation to put effort into professional self-development activities, strength-based SRL strategies may make a valuable complement to the common deficit-based SRL strategies.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>We conducted our studies at a university of applied sciences that practices competency-based education.
