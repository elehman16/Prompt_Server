At present, there are no effective pharmacological treatments for the cognitive impairments of patients with aMCI. Cognitive training has shown benefits, but training packages are typically repetitive and boring. To maximize engagement with training, we developed a novel memory game in collaboration with patients with aMCI and tested its effects on cognition and motivation. We found that patients who played &#x0201c;Game Show&#x0201d; on an iPad for 8 hours over the course of 4 weeks showed improved episodic memory (memories of locations and events) compared with patients who attended clinic as usual. High levels of enjoyment and motivation were also maintained throughout all hours of gameplay. &#x0201c;Gamified&#x0201d; cognitive training can thus be used to enhance memory and motivation in patients with aMCI.</p></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The number of people with dementia is 47.5 million worldwide, with 7.7 million new cases every year (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>). As innovations in the field of public health have lengthened the average human lifespan considerably, effective treatments for reducing cognitive decline in the aging population are needed. Cholinesterase inhibitors, including donepezil and rivastigmine, show modest time-limited benefits for individuals with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) but are more likely to be effective for the treatment of attentional dysfunction (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Eagger et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Sahakian et al., 1993</xref>). Since 2003, no additional treatments have been approved for AD, thus emphasizing the need for new interventions early in the course of the neurodegenerative process (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Barnett et al., 2016</xref>). As such, alternative nonpharmacological strategies for memory restoration and enhancement are now being developed (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Sahakian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Br&#x000fc;hl and Sahakian, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Savulich et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), often the prodromal stage of AD, report mild short-term memory difficulties but preserved independence in activities of daily living (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Albert et al., 2011</xref>). Individuals with multiple domain MCI can also show subtle decline across a range of other cognitive processes including language, attention, executive functions, problem solving, processing speed, and visuospatial abilities (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Petersen, 2011</xref>). The prevalence of MCI is estimated to be around 3% to 20% of individuals above the age of 65, and at least 10% to 15% of these individuals progress to AD annually (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">DeCarli, 2003</xref>). A significant proportion of individuals with MCI also experience comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy, anxiety, and depression, which negatively impact treatment entry and engagement and significantly predict conversion to AD (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Monastero et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>There are currently no approved drugs by the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, or Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction, including memory impairment, in individuals with MCI. Previous clinical trials have failed to show any pharmacological intervention that slows progression of MCI to AD (e.g., <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Petersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Feldman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Winblad et al., 2008</xref>). Cognitive remediation strategies, including cognitive training, are now used to enhance memory in neuropsychiatric disorders, with positive effects found in patients with schizophrenia (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Wykes et al., 2011</xref>). Cognitive training is also effective in MCI (for reviews, see <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Belleville, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Jean et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Gates et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Reijnders et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, individuals with MCI receive mild-to-moderate benefits in episodic, semantic, and working memory, as well as in language, attention/processing speed, self-rated anxiety/depression, visuospatial abilities, functional abilities, activities of daily living, and quality of life (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Cognitive training of memory has also been shown to increase activation and connectivity in widespread frontal, temporal, and occipital regions of the brain (Sanz <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Simon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Strenziok et al., 2014</xref>), including the hippocampus (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Rosen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kirchoff et al., 2012</xref>), in healthy older adults and in patients with MCI.</p><p>Despite the advantages of cognitive training, one major challenge is overcoming the high incidence of dropout rates typical of patient groups. The cost and inconvenience of delivery (e.g., use of specialized equipment, participant travel), in addition to apathetic or depressive symptoms often characteristic of older populations with memory difficulties, leads to considerable dropout rates. Engagement with cognitive training programs may therefore require a more motivational approach by increasing task-related enjoyment.</p><p>Computer games are highly rewarding and can deliver targeted cognitive training programs that also have the potential to improve motivational deficits found in patient groups with severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Savulich et al., 2017</xref>). Previously, video game training has shown to enhance sustained attention and working memory in older adults aged 60 to 85, with gains persisting up to 6 months and similar to those observed in untrained 20-year-olds (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Anguera et al., 2013</xref>). We recently demonstrated that 8 hours of playing &#x0201c;Wizard&#x0201d; (<uri xlink:href="www.peak.net/advanced-training">www.peak.net/advanced-training</uri>), a memory game designed for patients with schizophrenia, improved episodic memory and functional outcome compared with a treatment-as-usual group (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Sahakian et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, those that played our game reported high levels of enjoyment and desire to continue after each hour of gameplay, which likely represents a motivational improvement over traditional (usually boring) cognitive training programs. Gamified cognitive training can simultaneously improve cognition and motivation, and thus comprises an appealing option for disorders in which pharmacological treatments have failed to treat cognitive dysfunction or do not address the associated motivational deficits.</p><p>The present study aimed to test the effects of &#x0201c;Game Show,&#x0201d; a novel learning and memory game, on cognition and motivation in patients with aMCI. We hypothesized that patients in the cognitive training group (8 hours of supervised gameplay on an iPad over the course of 4 weeks) would demonstrate improved episodic memory, our key trained domain, and visuospatial abilities, a secondary measure of near transfer, compared with patients in a control group (clinic visits as usual). We further hypothesized that the cognitive training group would maintain high levels of self-reported enjoyment and motivation throughout all hours of gameplay.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-two patients were recruited from the Dementias and Neurodegeneration NIHR Clinical Research Network (Eastern DeNDRon) and memory clinics at the Cambridge and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust.

Pilot data was collected from 16 individuals (12 healthy elderly individuals and 5 patients with aMCI) to ensure that our game was fun, motivational, easy to understand, and in line with a concept suitable for an older adult population (i.e., daytime television game shows). Individuals played Game Show on an iPad for up to 1 hour and provided feedback on their experience, with suggestions for improvement. High levels of enjoyment and motivation were prioritized during development, as these properties were the key advantages of our game over other cognitive training programs. Pilot data from patients with aMCI indicated that the final version of our game was highly enjoyable (M = 9.32, SD = .66) and motivational (M = 9.40, SD = .58) (rated using 10-cm visual analogue scales, with higher scores indicated greater experience of enjoyment and motivation).</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Procedure</title><p>This study received full ethical approval from the National Research Committee East of England-Norfolk (13/EE/0290).

We hypothesized that patients with aMCI would show improved episodic memory and visuospatial abilities after 8 hours of cognitive training compared with a control group that attended clinic as usual. Due to the gamification of our cognitive training program, we further hypothesized that high levels of enjoyment and motivation would be maintained after each hour of gameplay.</p><sec id="s26"><title>Effects of Cognitive Training on Episodic Memory and Visuospatial Abilities</title><p>In support of our main hypothesis, cognitive training with Game Show led to improvements in episodic memory as measured by the CANTAB PAL task. Effect sizes found for total errors (23%), total trials (25%), and first trial memory score (21%) were modest between groups, but larger than for all other outcome measures. Specifically, the cognitive training group showed significantly better performance compared with the control group in terms of reduced errors and the number of trials needed for completion. For errors, the cognitive training group showed better performance at the second- and third-pattern stages. For trials, the cognitive training group showed better performance at the second-pattern stage. The cognitive training group also correctly remembered the locations of more patterns after the first trial summed across all stages completed (first trial memory score), which was the only significant between-group interaction that would survive strict correction for multiple comparisons. However, within-group comparisons revealed highly specific effects of cognitive training on episodic memory. Here, patients showed meaningful effects of training at <italic>lower</italic> loads of PAL task difficulty. Improvements at easier pattern stages reflect previous work from our laboratory showing that hippocampal activation is dependent upon memory load, such that patients with MCI activate more at lower loads and less at higher loads compared with controls (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">de Rover et al., 2011</xref>). A differential pattern of activation suggests that cognitive interventions for hippocampal-dependent memory deficits may be most effective at more tractable levels of PAL task difficulty. Furthermore, impaired performance on this task is known to be sensitive and specific for the early and differential diagnosis of AD (Swainson et al., 2001; Blackwell et al., 2004), with increased errors associated with decreased hippocampal volume (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Nathan et al., 2017</xref>). PAL performance is therefore one candidate neuropsychological marker for preclinical AD (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Beddington et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, our study demonstrates that cognitive training robustly improves PAL task performance within patients with aMCI, emphasizing that memory deficits are not necessarily stable and are amenable to change early in the course of the neurodegenerative process. These results are also consistent with our previous study showing that patients with schizophrenia demonstrate improved episodic memory following cognitive training with a memory game on an iPad (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Sahakian et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Results from the BVMT-R showed that the cognitive training group retained significantly more complex geometric information at delayed recall compared with the control group at outcome. This was anticipated, as both our memory game and the BVMT-R require participants to memorize different geometric patterns in a given spatial location. Data from this task suggests important convergent validity that our game produces an effect on an independent, but conceptually related, measure of visuospatial memory. Although encouraging, this result requires confirmation in a larger sample, as improved visuospatial abilities within a cognitive training group would substantiate training effects with evidence of near transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s27"><title>Effects of Cognitive Training on General Cognition and Neuropsychiatric Symptoms</title><p>Changes in MMSE scores were unexpected. Scores in both groups changed by a difference of more than half a point (higher for the cognitive training group, and lower for the control group) and significantly differed at outcome. However, MMSE scores from baseline to outcome were not significantly different within either group. Given that our training program specifically targeted episodic memory, it is possible that the trained cognitive domain would have generalized to improvements at the global level. However, a recent meta-analysis concluded that cognitive stimulation of multiple domains, typically including a social component, is the only cognitive intervention that improves general cognition in dementia (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Huntley et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore interpret our significant interaction with caution. Execution of our memory game in a group format, or introduction of an opponent or companion player option, might increase socialization needed to achieve these effects. This would be most advantageous if delivered before dementia is already diagnosed, as damage to the brain is usually too severe for improvements in global outcome measures following cognitive intervention in later stages of disease progression.</p><p>Lastly, apathy significantly increased within the control group from baseline to outcome. This may be due to indifference associated with knowledge about participation in the nonintervention group. Apathy scores from baseline to outcome did not significantly differ within our cognitive training group, but no participant showed clinically significant apathy at either time point. Use of gaming technology to reduce apathetic symptoms, however, has shown promise. &#x0201c;Serious&#x0201d; gaming, for example, has been successfully adapted for use in MCI patients with high levels of apathy (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Manera et al., 2015</xref>). Cognitive stimulating activities have also been shown to reduce apathetic and depressive symptoms in older adults with memory complaints (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Buettner et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to increasing the motivational aspects of cognitive training, serious games also have the potential to target impaired emotional and social processes, which would be beneficial for reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with aMCI and AD.</p></sec><sec id="s28"><title>Motivational Enhancement</title><p>One of the key aims of our study was to ensure that Game Show was developed with patient feedback to be easily understood, highly enjoyable, and motivating. Use of an iPad allowed for the titration of difficulty depending on individual performance, thus taking a more personalized approach to keep users engaged. Our game was further designed to have the same motivational properties typical of computer games, including stimulating music, character assistance, opportunities for progression, feedback and humor, in an effort to maximize player engagement and circumvent dropout rates often problematic of cognitive training studies (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Sahakian et al., 2015</xref>). Most cognitive training programs are overly repetitive and do not address the motivational deficits associated with older populations with memory difficulties (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Savulich et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that all participants in the cognitive training group completed each hour of gameplay and, importantly, reported high levels of enjoyment and motivation to continue, with self-confidence and self-rated memory ability improving over time. The lack of dropout in our study represents a motivational improvement over traditional cognitive training programs, where the attrition rate can be &#x0003e;15% (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Wykes et al., 2011</xref>) and encourages the potential for a wider application of serious games for cognitive training in other clinical populations with severe motivational deficits, such as traumatic brain injury or remitted depression.</p></sec><sec id="s29"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study had limitations. Firstly, our sample size was relatively small, with limited statistical power. Secondly, we did not include an active control group, such as patients with aMCI playing a nonmemory-related game or a game with no specific cognitive content. Although we cannot preclude the possibility that the effects observed here were epiphenomena of touch screen technology use more generally, we consider this unlikely as both groups reported similar levels of computer gaming, Internet use, and confidence using new technology at baseline. It is also possible that increased contact time and interaction with the research team, particularly with the elderly, positively impacts cognitive performance, raises self-esteem, or offers some other confounding social benefit not controlled for here. Replication and extension with a larger, more controlled trial, including an active control group with access to an iPad, but not our memory game, would address these methodological shortcomings. Although not within the scope of the current study, the duration to which cognitive improvements persist and their dependence on continued gameplay pose important areas of future research.</p></sec><sec id="s30"><title>Strengths</title><p>Strengths of our study include in depth public and patient involvement during the development of our game, the likelihood that portable devices increase active engagement with participation in cognitive training, and the reduction in negative stigma since games are popular with healthy people of all ages. Gamified cognitive training is also cost effective and not associated with side effects inevitably reported by patients taking medication. Integrating findings from neuropsychiatry with gaming technology could also lead to more widespread use of innovative nonpharmacological strategies for cognitive restoration and enhancement and help alter public perception of cognitive interventions for memory (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Sahakian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Savulich et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s31"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, the present study demonstrates that episodic memory is one cognitive process that can be targeted, with success, for enhancement by gamified cognitive training in patients with aMCI. Importantly, cognitive training with a game effectively maintains high levels of participant enjoyment and motivation and promotes confidence both in the self and subjective memory ability. Cognitive training also has the potential to improve visuospatial abilities. Early intervention and effective treatment is critical for neurodegenerative disorders, particularly before extensive neuropathological damage (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Beddington et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Sahakian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2011</xref>). Novel symptomatic interventions are urgently needed, and recent interest in nonpharmacological approaches of enhancement, which utilize novel technologies to target cognitive symptoms rather than diagnostic category, offer an alternative means for improving cognition in the absence of effective drug treatments (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Insel and Sahakian, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Insel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Sahakian, 2014</xref>). Gamified cognitive training strategies could thus be used to ameliorate memory deficits and increase motivation, either independently or in combination with other interventions for the elderly, such as physical exercise or pharmacological treatments, to synergize the effects needed for good cognitive outcome for patients with aMCI and mild AD. Larger, more controlled trials are required to test these hypotheses.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from Janssen Pharmaceutica/Johnson &#x00026; Johnson (71418) awarded to Barbara J.
