to determine the effect of these exercises on the balance and walking ability of elderly
women. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-four elderly women aged 65 or older were equally
assigned to a stationary bicycle exercise group and a treadmill exercise group, and they
performed exercise three times per week for 8 weeks for 20 minutes each time. In order to
examine gait, step length and time were measured as parameters of walking ability, and in
order to examine dynamic balance, subjects were evaluated with the Berg balance scale
(BBS). [Results] After the intervention, step time and step length and BBS significantly
increased significantly decreased, in both groups. A comparison of BBS after the
intervention between the two groups revealed that the stationary bicycle group showed
larger increases than the treadmill group. [Conclusion] The stationary bicycle exercise
group and treadmill exercise group showed significant improvements in gait and balance.
Stationary bicycle exercise can help to prevent falls by improving the balance of elderly
persons.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stationary bicycle exercise</kwd><kwd>Treadmill exercise</kwd><kwd>Elderly females</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A fall is one of the most frequently occurring incidents experienced by elderly
individuals, and such incidents can cause serious injury<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Approximately 30% of elderly persons over 65&#x02005;years old experience
at least one fall a year, and 15% of individuals annually experience a fall twice or
more<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Falls occur as a result of
several factors, including decreased vision, impairment of somatosensory functions, lower
extremity weakening, and decreased movement. Most falls experienced by the elderly occur
during walking, particularly when walking while performing another exercise or cognitive
task<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Due to aging, a decrease in muscle strength around the knees and ankles occurs more often
in the elderly than in younger individuals, resulting in gait and balance impairments.
Balance plays an important role in stability as well as mobility, and loss of balance is
considered to have the highest risk factor for a fall<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance or postural control is dependent on interactions among
various systems<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, but postural control
mechanisms tend to become inefficient as aging progresses<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>How to prevent falls by elderly individuals is a major area of study, but there are
limitations to the application of successful methods to the elderly population in
general<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nonetheless, exercise can
reduce the risk of a fall due to decrease in balance ability, thereby decreasing the risk of
fall for an individual elderly person as well who lives in a local community<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Dynamic resistance exercises<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, fall risk
assessment and management programs consisting of multilateral elements<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, proprioception training programs<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and programs utilizing music<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> and yoga<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> have all been found to improve the balance and walking ability of
the elderly.</p><p>In the present study, a stationary bicycle exercise and a treadmill exercise, which have
not been compared in previous studies, were conducted in order to determine the effect of
these exercises on the balance and walking ability of elderly women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of the present study were 24 elderly women from Gyunggi-do, Korea, who met the
following selection criteria: over 65&#x02005;years old, no experience of a fall for one year prior
to the study, no specific disease that might have influenced task performance, no visual or
hearing impairment, and no vestibular organ problem. Subjects also needed to sufficiently
understand the experimental tasks. All subjects agreed to actively participate in the
exercises once they had been given sufficient explanation of the tasks (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stationary Bicycle</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treadmill</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (year)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.1&#x000b1;3.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.1&#x000b1;2.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">159.5&#x000b1;4.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">159.8&#x000b1;3.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.3&#x000b1;5.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.4&#x000b1;4.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean&#x000b1;SD</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>).</p><p>The subjects were divided into two groups, a stationary bicycle group and a treadmill

of this study and provided their written informed consent prior to their participation in
the study, in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The stationary bicycle was set to no resistance, while the treadmill was set to start
increasing from 0.1&#x02005;km/hour to the maximum walking speed that could be achieved by the

the exercise, while step length and step time were measured with an AP1105 (GaitRite CIR,
USA) to measure the walking ability. The average &#x000b1; standard deviation of group measurements

individuals show decreased cadence and stride length, an increase in the base of support,
and a decrease in walking speed<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a
result, elderly individuals are vulnerable to falls, an event more common in elderly women
than any other group<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the two groups had similar physical characteristics before the start of the
intervention. Following eight weeks of exercise, the stationary bicycle group showed notably
improved balance compared to the treadmill group, and step length had also notably
increased. In particular, the BBS score was higher in the stationary bicycle group than in
the treadmill group, indicating that stationary bicycle exercise is more effective at
improving the balance of elderly women than treadmill exercise.</p><p>BBS is a measure of dynamic balance, and Thorbahn et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a BBS score of &#x0003c;45 indicates an increased risk of
a fall. In this study, the lower limb weight movement and stability exercise ofthe
stationary bicycle exercise had a positive effect on the BBS score of the elderly women.
This result is consistent with that of Englund et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> who showed that complex exercise through weight movement resulted
in an increase in the BBS score.</p><p>The stationary bicycle group showed a greater improvement in the BBS score than the
treadmill group because the bicycle exercise was a balance exercise on a narrow saddle,
compared to the treadmill, which requires stable weight movement using two feet. In
addition, in the bicycle exercise the right and left weight movement of the lower
extremities, in which the center of mass is dependent on a saddle, has more effect on the
lateral bending movement of the pelvis than walking on a treadmill. The subsequent increase
in pelvic movement in the elderly women positively influenced their balance.</p><p>Balance impairment can result in unstable walking<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study demonstrated that improved balance had a
positive effect on step length. One limitation of this study was the small number of
subjects, limiting the extent to which the results can be applied to elderly women in
general. Future research will need to include a larger number of elderly women to determine
the improvements of characteristics other than balance and walking resulting from stationary
bicycle exercise.</p><p>As society ages, the need to study the causes of falls and preventative measures that can
be applied to the elderly has been recognized, and effective exercise methods have been
introduced. The stationary bicycle exercise can help to prevent falls by improving the
balance of elderly women.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hausdorff</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Rios</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Edelberg</surname><given-names>HK</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Gait variability and fall risk in community-living older
