Local infusion of the NO donor glyceryl trinitrate at the site of surgery, showed a small analgesic effect that did not reach statistical significance in the sample size used. While the gene expression of iNOS and eNOS were not up-regulated, 3 hours after surgery, nNOS was downregulated in both treatment groups and eNOS gene expression was significantly lower in the ketorolac group compared to the placebo group.

It is produced intracellularly by the catabolism of L-arginine to L-citrulline by NO synthase enzyme (NOS), which is present in three isoforms, the neuronal (nNOS), endothelial (eNOS) and inducible (iNOS) isoforms. The role that NO plays in pain is not simple, since it may show pro- or anti-nociceptive effects depending on the circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The majority of data, in preclinical studies support a pronociceptive role of NO at the spinal level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Yet, other studies show inconsistent results; for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The effect of NO on pain and analgesia in the periphery is further conflicting. Sodium nitroprusside, which releases NO non-enzymatically, has an antihyperalgesic effect in the rat paw pressure test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Conversely, intradermal administration of the NOS substrate L-Arg or the NO donor SIN-1, both of which elevate NO levels, cause a dose-dependent mechanical hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Conflicting clinical effects are also reported; as intracutaneous injection of NO in healthy volunteers evokes pain in a dose dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], while transdermal application of the NO donor glyceryl trinitrate improved pain in patients with shoulder pain syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Associations between NO levels and pain intensity also show conflicting results. While there was no association between NO concentration in the perifacetal region and pain duration or pain level in patients with chronic low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], NO correlated with pain in the polyarticular subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis with active disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The role of different NOS isoforms in inflammatory pain process is derived primarily from animal experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. While nNOS is mainly observed at the spinal level or in neuropathic pain models, iNOS is up-regulated in inflamed tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and is involved in the development of hyperalgesia in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Knockout mice, providing another tool for the identification of the specific role of each isoform in different pain models, confirm the role of nNOS and iNOS isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, studies performed on knockout mice as well as those using different selective and non-selective NOS inhibitors point to a possible role for eNOS isoform in pain processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>NSAIDs are among the most prescribed medications, yet their efficacy is compromised by a ceiling analgesic effect. The inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on NO production has been reported in many studies both clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and the involvement of the NO-cGMP pathway in the antinociceptive effects of NSAIDs has been suggested in several experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of NO and NOS isoforms in acute inflammatory pain induced by a clinically well-defined model of clinical pain, third molar extraction. The effect of the NSAID ketorolac on NO production and NOS gene expression was also studied. To achieve this goal, two independent studies as well as a third pilot dose finding study were carried out: (1) a microdialysis study to estimate changes in NO levels at the site of tissue injury and to correlate these levels to pain intensity reported at the same time points; (2) a gene expression study to determine change in gene expression of the three NOS isoforms at the site of tissue injury, and finally (3) the glyceryl trinitrate glyceryl trinitrate study, which aimed at finding an efficacious dose to study the effect of the NO donor glyceryl trinitrate on pain intensity following tissue injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>I.

NO levels at the site of tissue injury</title><p>NO levels at the surgical site were evaluated every 20 min following tissue injury using microdialysis collection. Patients that had more than one sample missing from the set of 9 serial samples due to failure of microdialysis probe, blood contamination of the sample or a low sample volume that did not allow analysis of replicates were excluded from this analysis. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>, NO levels gradually increased over the first 80 min in the placebo-treated group before declining gradually over the last 100 min of the observation period, reaching its lowest level by the end of the 3 hours collecting period. Contrast analysis under the linear mixed effects model controlling for time shows that NO levels over the first 100 min were significantly higher than those over the last 80 min (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) in the placebo treated group. NO level in microdialysate in subjects administered ketorolac before surgery gradually decreased over the first 60 min but was similar to placebo over the 100-180 min observations. Although, there was no significant change in the NO levels over time in the ketorolac group, the difference between the two treatment groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.48).</p></sec><sec><title>C. Correlation between pain intensity and NO levels</title><p>Because both pain intensity and NO levels were reported repeatedly in the same patients, simple correlation analysis would have ignored this fact and would have tested the correlation considering each time point as a different patient.

However, we show here in a clinical study that NO is not only devoid of this pronociceptive property in the periphery, at this early stage of acute inflammatory pain, but it is also negatively correlated to pain.</p><p>The unresolved role of NO in nociception at the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] has been attributed in animal studies to several factors, including the level of NO. Low levels of NO at the site of injury show antinociceptive effects, whereas higher concentrations have pronociceptive effects. In a rat model of incisional pain, the NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) applied inside the surgical wound, reduced the incision allodynia at concentrations between 1-10%. On the other hand, higher concentration (30%) intensified the allodynia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The same finding was seen in the formalin test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Baseline level of neuronal excitability is also thought to affect the role of NO in nociception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Electrophysiological recordings of dural nociceptive afferents showed that neurons with higher mechanical activation thresholds were activated by NO donors, while neurons with lower mechanical activation thresholds were inhibited by NO donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Further, in PGE<sub>2 </sub>induced pain, the NO donor SIN-1 induced a dose dependent hypernociception when injected intradermally, while inducing an antinociceptive effect when injected subcutaneously, which suggests that different subsets of primary nociceptive neurons may respond differently to NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The NOS isoform expressed at the site of injury might also contribute to identifying the role of NO in nociception. The role of different NOS isoforms in pain processing is still subject to debate. It is known that nNOS and eNOS, though found primarily within the nervous system and endothelial tissue respectively, are also found in other tissues, whereas iNOS is expressed in various cell types, such as macrophages and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the present study, the three <italic>NOS </italic>isoforms were expressed in the gingival mucosa, following tissue injury. While both nNOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and iNOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] are frequently suggested to play an important pronociceptive role in several pain models, eNOS is not often studied. However, it was reported that eNOS was the only isoform involved in both phases of the rat formalin test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and eNOS<sup>-/- </sup>mice showed a more rapid recovery from thermal hyperalgesia compared to wild type mice after intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interpretation of findings in NOS<sup>-/- </sup>mice is compromised by the compensation of other isoforms for the deficient isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], at least at the spinal level. The analgesic role of NO at the periphery may be explained by the fact that NO generated by eNOS may modulate leucocyte adherence, which contributes to inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. NO is also responsible for vasodilatation with subsequent increased blood supply to the injured region and ultimately increased clearance of local inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], another possible mechanism for the analgesic effect of NO at the periphery.</p><p>The down-regulation of nNOS in both treatment groups seen here is an interesting finding that may reflect a feedback effect to the higher NO levels at earlier time points. However, the present data cannot indicate such a conclusion. Since the increase in NO production seen in the microdialysis samples occurred during the first 80 min, this may explain the minimal change noticed at the gene expression level of NOS isoforms at 3 hours. Therefore, further investigation to study the effect of tissue injury on NOS isoforms at earlier and latter time points is warranted. However, the gene expression results suggest a relatively low level of NO at the site of injury, given the down regulation of nNOS and insignificant change of the other two isoforms.</p><p>Taking into account the negative correlation between NO levels and pain intensity reported here, it is plausible that at lower levels, NO released at the periphery plays an analgesic role in this clinical model of inflammatory pain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Tissue injury increases NO production possibly via eNOS or nNOS in the early phase following surgery</bold>.

To our knowledge, the association between the expression of these two isoforms has not been reported earlier. It is known that both nNOS and eNOS are constitutive isoforms of NOS that are calcium-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We have recently reported the upregulation of kinin B<sub>1 </sub>and B<sub>2 </sub>receptors at the same pain model and time frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], both of which cause elevated free intracellular calcium upon activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] that may contribute to the activation of both NOS isoforms. The down regulation of <italic>eNOS </italic>by NSAIDs, on the other hand, is in line with the suppression of eNOS expression by high-dose aspirin or meloxicam, in retinas of diabetic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>The negative correlation between NO levels and pain intensity that we show here, is in line with the analgesic effect of topical glyceryl trinitrate that was reported earlier in several tendinopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Unfortunately, we could not show the same analgesic effect of glyceryl trinitrate in the present study as the infusion of a rather small dose of glyceryl trinitrate (150 or 200 &#x003bc;g) into the surgical site did not show a significant analgesic effect at the sample size used. However, combining both groups resulted in a small analgesic effect. It was not possible to further increase the dose of glyceryl trinitrate to examine a dose dependent nature of NO effect on pain, nor to extend the study due to ethical concerns, given the small analgesic effect and the associated increased rate of headache with glyceryl trinitrate infusion.</p><p>It is not clear, why infusion of glyceryl trinitrate in the present study did not achieve a clear analgesic effect, in contrast to the earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, it is possible that to reach a detectable analgesic effect, longer exposure to NO is required, given in our study glyceryl trinitrate was infused for 20 min only, while in earlier studies, patients received transdermal glyceryl trinitrate patch for at least three days and up to 24 weeks.</p><p>There is a great body of evidence that supports an inhibitory role of NSAIDs on NO production both in clinical and experimental settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, some studies suggest a stimulatory role e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and others did not show any effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This variability might be due to different experimental settings, including selectivity of NSAID, concentration used, stimulants and cell type, which may reflect on the NOS isoform expressed. Nevertheless, most of the studies showing an inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on NO production also show downregulation of iNOS expression. Since in the present study iNOS isoform was not up-regulated, 3 hours following tissue injury, this may explain the failure of ketorolac to decrease NO production at this early time point. Even though ketorolac down-regulated eNOS expression, this did affect NO levels, possibly because eNOS generate small amounts of NO, compared to iNOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which makes the effect of ketorolac on NO production rather small.</p><p>We therefore suggest that at this early phase of inflammatory pain, NO plays an analgesic role in the periphery. Further studies are needed to identify the contribution of NOS isoforms to this analgesic effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects and procedures</title><p>The present work shows the results of two independent studies: a microdialysis study, and a gene expression study.

Two mandibular third molars were extracted and a surgical difficulty score was assigned for each tooth. After extraction, a microdialysis probe (CMA/20 Microdialysis Probe; CMA/Microdialysis, North Chelmsford, MA) was placed along the buccal aspect of the mandible, beneath the mucogingival flap elevated for the surgical procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The probe fiber consists of a 10-mm flexible, nonmetallic, semipermeable dialysis membrane with a molecular cutoff ranging from 3000 to 20,000 Da. The probes were secured to an adjacent tooth with silk suture and the flap closed using 3-0 chromic gut suture. Sterile lactated Ringer's solution was pumped at 10 &#x003bc;L/min and samples collected at 20-min intervals after the completion of surgery. The samples were immediately placed on dry ice after each collection period. Subjects remained under observation for the first 3 hours after surgery to evaluate pain and adverse events and for collection of samples by microdialysis. Patients rated their pain intensity every 20 min for the first 3 h post-operatively using 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS).

Glyceryl trinitrate dose response was evaluated using linear regression. Comparisons between effects of ketorolac or glyceryl trinitrate treatment and placebo on VAS were performed using repeated measure two-way ANOVA. Linear mixed effects models were fitted to investigate the effect of time (at 9 levels), treatment, NO and the interaction effect between treatment and NO on VAS for the microdialysis study. Patient ID was assumed to be a random effect and each patient had a random intercept in all the linear mixed models since the samples were pulled out from a large population. The effect of treatment on NO production was also examined using linear mixed effect models. Data that did not follow normal distribution was transformed to ln(x+1). The relative change in gene expression was assessed by paired t-test, and the comparison between treatment groups was assessed by independent two-sample t test and the association among these gene expressed was examined by Pearson's correlation coefficients. Results were considered significant at &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MH contributed to the laboratory experimental design, conducted NOx measurments, qRT-PCR experiments, data analysis and manuscript writing.
