Adherence improved with weekly short message service (SMS) reminders in Kenya [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and twice weekly SMS reminders in Nigeria [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], whereas no benefit was observed with weekly SMS reminders in Cameroon [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and India [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], or with SMS reminders 5 days a week in Brazil [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Real-time adherence monitoring can be accomplished through pill bottles that record a date-and-time stamp for each opening, which is then transmitted over cellular networks. It is the only monitoring approach that can trigger an intervention precisely when needed. Two recent studies assessed the combination of real-time adherence monitoring with SMS reminders triggered by late or missed doses. One in China showed an improvement in overall adherence [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], whereas one in South Africa did not [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], although the latter found fewer sustained adherence lapses. SMS could also be used to engage social support systems, which have been shown to be important for ART adherence [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; however, this type of intervention has not been previously studied.</p><p>Given the variable results in the literature, we conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial of multiple types of interventions based on SMS and real-time adherence monitoring to improve adherence among individuals initiating ART in Uganda.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Participants were recruited from the Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) in southwestern Uganda, which cares for &#x0223c;10&#x0200a;000 HIV-positive individuals.

Inclusion criteria for study participants were: being 18+ years, initiating ART, owning a personal cell phone with reliable reception, willing and able to identify one to two social supporters, and living less than 20&#x0200a;km from MRRH (to facilitate participant follow-up). Inclusion criteria for social supporters were: being 18+ years, owning a personal cell phone with a reliable reception, knowing the study participant's HIV status, living less than 20&#x0200a;km from MRRH, and reporting prior provision of social support to the study participant (i.e. instrumental support to attend clinic or motivational support to take medicine). Exclusion criteria for both participant types were: inability to use SMS, unwillingness to have cellular reception confirmed at home, and inability to provide informed consent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>All study participants received a real-time adherence monitor (Wisepill Technologies, Cape Town, South Africa) and were followed for 9 months. Monitor openings during periods of inadequate cellular reception were stored for later transmission.

The study coordinator informed research assistants of the arm assignment at enrolment.

HIV RNA was determined at months 3 and 9 (Cobas Taqman Test, Roche, Switzerland). Social supporters were enrolled during month 3 to ensure ongoing relationships when the SMS notifications began.

Study participant characteristics were compared across study arms with Fisher's exact test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Our primary outcome of interest was adherence (calculated as the number of monitor opening signals received divided by the number of monitor opening signals expected, and capped at 100%). Monitor openings by staff were removed. A secondary dataset was created in which suspected technical difficulties or monitor nonuse per participant report was censored. Although subject to recall and social desirability biases, the secondary dataset may decrease misclassification bias. In an intention-to-treat analysis, percentage doses taken each month were compared by linear generalized estimating equations (GEEs); more than 48-h and more than 96-h lapses in dosing were compared by Poisson GEE regression. HIV RNA suppression (&#x0003c;100&#x0200a;copies/ml) was compared among study arms by Fisher's exact test. To compare adherence with HIV RNA, we ran the rank-sum test for median adherence among participants with suppressed versus unsuppressed HIV RNA. Loss to follow-up was defined as no contact or adherence data for 3 months. Missing adherence data was considered as nonadherence; HIV RNA was considered unsuppressed if no blood sample was obtained. All analyses were conducted in Stata (StataCorp., College Station, Texas, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>Human subject approval was obtained from Mbarara University of Science and Technology, Uganda National Council of Science and Technology, and Partners Healthcare.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>Between September 2013 and October 2014, 195 individuals were screened to identify 63 eligible study participants.

Our findings confirm the positive impact of fixed interval reminders in prior studies [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In one of these studies, daily reminders were not effective, but weekly reminders were [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; however, daily messages were sent for 48 consecutive weeks, potentially causing habituation. The decreasing frequency of SMS reminders in this study may have avoided that phenomenon.</p><p>Although prior studies saw significant benefit in overall adherence [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and adherence lapses [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] with SMS linked to real-time detection of late or missed doses, we did not. Potential explanations include the overall high adherence in this study and the small sample size. Additionally, qualitative data from this study (presented separately) [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] indicate that scheduled reminders were experienced as supportive, whereas triggered reminders could be received too late to be effective (i.e., after participants were asleep).</p><p>The lack of definitive benefit from SMS notifications to social supporters was surprising. Social support has been shown previously to be important for ART adherence (e.g., via access to resources and reduced stigma) [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Detailed assessment of the support provided and relationship dynamics between study participants and social supporters will be important to understand this finding.</p><p>Similar viral suppression among study arms is consistent with the two other studies of real-time adherence interventions [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Importantly, this study was not powered for differences in viral suppression. It is possible that differences in virologic outcomes could be seen in a larger study with longer follow-up.</p><p>This study has important limitations. Real-time monitoring in the control group likely has its own intervention effect and may have limited the ability to detect intervention effects from SMS in the other study arms &#x02013; a phenomenon explored in the separately presented qualitative findings [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, 37% of screened participants were excluded because they lacked access to a personal cell phone. Participants may have had relatively high socioeconomic status, thus limiting generalizability.</p><p>In summary, we found that scheduled SMS significantly increased adherence in individuals initiating ART in Uganda. The technology employed for real-time adherence monitoring and accompanying SMS was successfully implemented despite limited resources. Future work should assess costs of this technology to inform scalability. Studies are also needed to determine the benefits associated with SMS alone versus SMS tied to real-time adherence monitoring.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of Justus Ashaba, Judith Namanya, Moonlight Sheila, Moran Owembabazi, Emily Pisarski, and Melanie Tam as well as those of Wisepill Technologies, Dimagi, and Yo!
