These included two different vaccines conjugated to a mutant diphtheria toxoid (CRM<sub>197</sub>), and one conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT). MenC conjugate vaccines induce bactericidal polysaccharide-specific antibodies, which have been shown to correlate with protection against invasive disease <xref rid="pone.0101672-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101672-Borrow1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101672-Andrews1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition to inducing immunological memory, as defined by an anamnestic antibody response to subsequent challenge, several different factors are thought to contribute to long-term protection after immunisation with conjugate vaccines including reduced carriage, herd immunity and persistence of bactericidal antibody in the serum <xref rid="pone.0101672-Maiden1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101672-Trotter1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>In the UK, the currently available MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> and MenC-TT conjugate vaccines are used interchangeably in the immunisation schedule; however there is evidence that the TT-conjugated vaccine is more immunogenic and in particular is a better &#x0201c;priming&#x0201d; vaccine irrespective of the type of booster vaccine that is subsequently administered <xref rid="pone.0101672-Richmond1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101672-DiezDomingo1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, higher serum bactericidal assay (SBA) titres were observed following <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b (Hib) and MenC conjugate (Hib-MenC-TT) booster in children primed with Hib-MenC-TT than children primed with monovalent MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> in the first year of life, even though post-primary immunisation SBA titres were lower in the former group <xref rid="pone.0101672-Pace1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101672-Khatami1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These findings may relate to differences in the ability of these vaccines to generate memory B-cells following primary immunisations. It has been shown that antibody levels following a MenC-TT booster at 12 months of age are higher in children who received 1 dose of the same vaccine at 4 months of age, compared to children who received 2 doses at 2 and 4 months <xref rid="pone.0101672-Poellabauer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and that infants primed with 1 dose of MenC-TT mounted a greater antibody response to a polysaccharide challenge at 12 months of age, compared with those primed with either 2 or 3 doses of MenC-TT in infancy <xref rid="pone.0101672-Borrow2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, suggesting that the number of doses of primary vaccines may also be important in the generation of memory B-cells.</p><p>Frequency of antigen-specific memory B-cells in peripheral blood can be quantified by Enzyme-Linked Immunospot (ELISpot) that detects immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody secreting cells (ASCs). As part of a larger study, we investigated MenC-specific memory B-cells following different MenC conjugate vaccine schedules in infancy to determine the effect of the number of priming doses and type of vaccine on the number and kinetics of memory B-cells generated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101672.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101672.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants and Vaccines</title><p>Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee (study number: OXREC 10/H0604/7).

Children recruited at a research site with access to the necessary laboratory facilities, who were able to provide sufficient volumes of blood (&#x0003e;4 mL), and where samples were able to be processed within 6 hours were included in the analysis reported here.

The subset of participants on whom memory B-cells were measured were selected pragmatically from those recruited at the Oxford research site, from whom a sufficient blood volume could be drawn and where the sample could be processed in time. All comparisons of B-cell responses between study groups were exploratory. Primary analyses were based on all available blood samples (intention-to-treat analysis) as pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan for the randomised controlled trial within which this study was embedded. Calculations were carried out using Stata version 12 (StatCorp LP, Texas, USA) and GraphPad PRISM version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego California, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>).</p><p>When no cells were detected in the assay for an antigen, results were assigned a value of half the lowest level of detection (0.31 cells/million PBMCs) to enable log<sub>10</sub> transformation. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted of the log<sub>10</sub> transformed data to test for differences between groups in the number of memory B-cells detected at each visit. If the F-test for groups from the ANOVA was significant, pairs of groups were compared. Residual variance was checked for normality, and within-groups variance was tested for heterogeneity (Bartlett's test). If the data appeared to be non-normal, non-parametric Kruskal Wallis analysis was carried out. Comparisons were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and Bonferroni adjusted p-values for multiple comparisons.</p><p>Linear mixed models were used to estimate mean differences between two time-points for each group using log<sub>10</sub> transformed data. The mixed model takes account of missing data and the correlation between measurements on the same child at two time-points. The fixed effects were: group, time-point and the interaction between group and time-point. The covariance matrix was unstructured.

Furthermore, no evidence was seen in this study for a relationship between the number of priming doses of MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub>, and the generation of MenC-specific memory B-cells at any time-point following primary or booster immunisations in infants. These findings are in contrast to previously published studies which examined immunological memory after immunisation using antibody responsiveness as a surrogate and found that antibody responses following a booster were higher in those who had received fewer priming vaccine doses. Borrow <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0101672-Borrow2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> showed that infants primed with 1 dose of MenC-TT in the first year of life, mounted a greater antibody response to a polysaccharide challenge at 12 months of age, compared to priming with either 2 or 3 doses of MenC-TT. A more recent study has shown that antibody levels following a MenC-TT booster at 12 months of age are higher in children who received 1 dose of the same vaccine at 4 months of age, compared to children who received 2 doses at 2 and 4 months <xref rid="pone.0101672-Poellabauer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Similar results were demonstrated in a study comparing 1, 2 or 3 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in infancy, followed by a dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at 12 months of age <xref rid="pone.0101672-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Children who had received a single dose of priming vaccine mounted a greater serotype-specific antibody response following polysaccharide challenge than children who had received 2 or 3 priming doses. These previous studies imply that limiting the number of &#x0201c;priming&#x0201d; doses of vaccine may favour memory formation, at the expense of initial antibody response, potentially providing longer term protection. The results of the immunogenicity component of the current study confirmed these previous findings, demonstrating significantly greater MenC SBA titres following Hib-MenC-TT booster in children previously primed with a single dose, compared to two priming doses of MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0101672-Pace2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, with very small numbers of memory B-cells detected before booster vaccination, the current study may have lacked power to detect a difference between 1- and 2-dose priming with MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> conjugate vaccine with respect to memory B-cell responses.</p><p>It is not clear what signals are required to determine memory B-cell production following activation of na&#x000ef;ve B-cells. It has been suggested that a population of na&#x000ef;ve B-cells are intrinsically able to commit to any fate based on stochastic factors influenced by a large number of external and intrinsic signals <xref rid="pone.0101672-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101672-Hodgkin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Some of these signals may favour differentiation into plasma cells over memory cells, or vice versa, and may include the type or amount of antigen used for immunization <xref rid="pone.0101672-GoodJacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In the current study, the number of MenC-specific memory B-cells detected by the ELISpot assay was shown to be related to the type of vaccine used for priming and boosting. Whether these differences are related to the carrier proteins used in these vaccines, or other compositional differences is uncertain. Children primed with MenC-TT conjugate vaccine generated more memory B-cells following a Hib-MenC-TT booster than children previously primed with MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub>, suggesting that the carrier protein used for priming and boosting may have an important role in determining the polysaccharide-specific response to conjugate vaccines. These data may provide indirect evidence to support the recent finding from murine studies that an association of peptides from the carrier protein, along with oligosaccharides from the sugar component of conjugate vaccines, are presented together to T-cells on major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II receptors, challenging the traditional dogma about the mechanism of immune induction by conjugate vaccines <xref rid="pone.0101672-Avci1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The structure of the MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> polysaccharide-conjugate vaccine may interfere with antigen processing and/or presentation on MHC-II molecules following immunisation, whereas that of the MenC-TT conjugate vaccine may promote optimal presentation of carbohydrate epitopes recognised by T-cells. If this mechanism is verified in humans, it has important implications for new generation conjugate vaccine development.</p><p>The differences between vaccines in induction of MenC-specific memory B-cells may explain the differential antibody response noted following primary and booster vaccines when children were primed with either a MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> vaccine or Hib-MenC-TT in the first year of life and given a Hib-MenC-TT booster as toddlers <xref rid="pone.0101672-Pace1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101672-Khatami1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In these earlier studies, children in the MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> primed groups had higher SBA titres one month after primary vaccines, but lower SBA titres one month after the Hib-MenC-TT booster, than children in the Hib-MenC-TT primed groups. Similarly, children primed with MenC-TT have been shown to mount a greater SBA response following either MenC-TT or MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> booster in the second year of life, than children primed with MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0101672-DiezDomingo1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These observations may be related to a greater number of MenC memory B-cells generated by Hib-MenC-TT and MenC-TT than by MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> primary immunisations. Although in the current study no statistically significant difference was seen in the number of memory B-cells at 5 months of age in children who had received either MenC-TT or MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> at 3 months of age, there was a trend towards higher numbers in the MenC-TT group (data not presented).</p><p>In the absence of immunisation programmes, adolescents and young adults have a high incidence of invasive meningococcal disease and high case fatality rate (10&#x02013;14%) compared to younger children and to adults, and are also the drivers for transmission of the organism through high nasopharyngeal carriage rates (10&#x02013;35%) <xref rid="pone.0101672-Caugant1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The only validated correlate of protection against invasive MenC disease is an SBA titre &#x02265;1&#x02236;8 using rabbit complement or &#x02265;1&#x02236;4 using human complement <xref rid="pone.0101672-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101672-Borrow1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101672-Andrews1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Thus persistence of bactericidal antibody beyond childhood is critical for both direct protection of individuals through the &#x0201c;high risk&#x0201d; period of adolescence, and for maintenance of herd immunity. The level of MenC-specific memory B-cells produced after priming vaccines has been shown to correlate with the persistence of antibody and memory B-cells at one year of age, and with post-booster antibody and memory B-cell levels <xref rid="pone.0101672-BlanchardRohner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition, the persistence of MenC bactericidal antibody through early childhood is greater in children who mount a greater response to the toddler booster dose of vaccine <xref rid="pone.0101672-Khatami2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, vaccines which induce more memory B-cells following primary and booster immunisations may be associated with greater persistence of bactericidal antibody throughout childhood and adolescence and offer a practical advantage for infant immunisation schedules.</p><p>In this study, a rise in antigen-specific memory B-cells was seen following primary immunisations until booster vaccination at 12 months of age for all antigens tested. Variability in the assay over time was excluded and for MenC, this finding was consistent with an increase in the proportion of MenC-specific memory B-cells out of the total pool of IgG positive memory B-cells from 0.02% at 5 months to 0.04% at 12 months of age, suggesting that this is an antigen-specific increase, rather than a non-specific effect of immune maturation in infants. Furthermore, the absence of a rise in the number of MenC-specific memory B-cells in unprimed children suggests that this a true effect of priming on memory B-cell production. However, the rise in antigen-specific memory B-cells in this study is in contradiction to the findings of Blanchard <italic>et al</italic> who noted a decline in MenC memory B-cells between 5 and 12 months of age following 3 doses of MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> at 2, 3 and 4 months of age <xref rid="pone.0101672-BlanchardRohner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The main difference between these two studies is in the number of memory B-cells detected at 5 months of age: median 0.1&#x02013;0.8 per million PBMCs in children primed with MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> in the current study versus 11 per million PBMCs in the Blanchard <italic>et al</italic> trial. This may be related to the number of primary doses of vaccine administered (1 or 2 in the current study versus 3 in the previous trial). Furthermore, Blanchard <italic>et al</italic> used different concentrations of SAC and CpG which may have led to greater B-cell stimulation and higher spot counts in general. The differences are unlikely to be related to changes in carriage rates of MenC in the UK between 2005 and 2011/2012, since even prior to the introduction of MenC conjugate vaccines only 0.45% of adolescents were colonised with MenC, and this had reduced to 0.15% by 2000 <xref rid="pone.0101672-Maiden1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, with carriage rates in infants being virtually zero.</p><p>The formation of new memory B-cells for several months after immunisation suggests that this may either be occurring independent of the germinal centre (GC), or alternatively, in these infants, the GC reaction may continue for longer than is traditionally understood. The memory B-cell population in humans and higher vertebrates is known to be heterogeneous <xref rid="pone.0101672-GoodJacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In mice, antigen-specific B-cells with a memory phenotype have been demonstrated early in a GC reaction, with evidence of stable numbers or continued output for at least 5 weeks <xref rid="pone.0101672-Blink1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In addition, studies in mice indicate that GC-independent memory B-cells can be formed <xref rid="pone.0101672-Obukhanych1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101672-Alugupalli1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and subsets of memory B-cells continue to proliferate in GC-like structures in splenic B-cell follicles for up to 8 months after immunization <xref rid="pone.0101672-Dogan1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In humans, memory B-cells have been shown to continue to proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells in lymphoid tissues for several months after immunisation in response to antigen persisting on follicular dendritic cells <xref rid="pone.0101672-Holder1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In line with the mouse models described above, our results suggest that memory B-cells can continue to be generated for months beyond the original antigen stimulation.</p><p>In the context of waning bactericidal antibody described in the first year of life following infant immunizations <xref rid="pone.0101672-Pace1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101672-Campbell2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, an increase in the number of MenC-specific memory B-cells between 5 and 12 months of age suggests that after primary MenC vaccines, memory B-cells continue to be generated for several months, but there is a decline in the proportion that differentiate into plasma cells. Despite waning of bactericidal antibody levels, antibody avidity has also been shown to increase following primary immunisations with MenC and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in infants, until 12 months of age <xref rid="pone.0101672-Borrow2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101672-Goldblatt1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. One explanation for the discordance in antibody levels (waning over time) and antibody avidity and memory B-cell numbers (increasing over time) may be that separate B-cell precursors are responsible for the primary antibody-producing and memory B-cell populations <xref rid="pone.0101672-Berek1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. It should be noted however, that as no blood samples were drawn in this study between 5 and 12 months of age, we cannot exclude a higher peak in memory B-cell numbers at an earlier time-point after 5 months, with a decline until 12 months of age.</p><p>Primary and secondary GC reactions have been shown to be qualitatively very similar <xref rid="pone.0101672-Vora1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> although there are several quantitative differences, including the speed with which they develop. During a secondary response, IgG memory B-cells appear in the circulation more rapidly, and in adolescents receiving a booster dose of MenC conjugate vaccine memory B-cells were detected by day 6 <xref rid="pone.0101672-Kelly2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. For a tetanus booster in adults an increase in memory B-cells was not seen by day 4 but by day 12 there was a significant rise <xref rid="pone.0101672-Nanan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In infants, after the third dose of vaccine antigen-specific memory B-cells were readily detectable at all time-points from day 4 to 30 <xref rid="pone.0101672-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Most clinical vaccine trials compare pre- and post- booster antibody levels to detect an anamnestic response; often one month apart and based on a polysaccharide vaccine &#x0201c;challenge&#x0201d;. In the current study, detection of at least 2.5 MenC memory B-cells/million PBMCs in the peripheral blood, 6 days after a booster dose of Hib-MenC-TT was able to differentiate MenC-primed from un-primed children with a sensitivity and specificity of &#x0003e;85%. This could potentially be used as a novel way to test the ability of MenC conjugate vaccines to induce immune memory in infants and young children with the following advantages: 1) results are available from a single blood test, 2) earlier time-point to achieve results, 3) avoids the need for administration of a polysaccharide vaccine as a &#x02018;challenge&#x02019; dose in this population where there are concerns about possible induction of immunological hypo-responsiveness <xref rid="pone.0101672-Granoff1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This finding needs to be validated by testing in blinded fashion in other cohorts of children, as well as with other conjugate vaccines; however this study provides a &#x0201c;proof of principle&#x0201d; for using the ELISpot assay for detecting antigen-specific memory B-cells on the 6 -day post-booster blood sample to identify previously &#x0201c;primed&#x0201d; individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>MenC-specific memory B-cell production may be more dependent on the type of vaccine used for primary immunisation of infants, and perhaps the matching of carrier proteins, than the number of doses administered. Although the mechanistic differences between MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> and MenC-TT priming are unclear, it is possible that structural differences in these vaccines may underlie differential interactions with B- and T-cell populations and thus different effects on various memory B-cell subsets. The differences between these vaccines in induction of MenC-specific memory B-cells may explain the differential antibody response noted following primary and post Hib-MenC-TT booster immunisations. The MenC-TT/Hib-MenC-TT combination of vaccines may offer a practical advantage for infant immunisation schedules in terms of long-term persistence of antibody. Irrespective of the priming vaccine received, MenC primed children can be separated from unprimed children with a sensitivity and specificity of &#x0003e;85% by the detection of at least 2.5 MenC memory B-cells/million PBMCs in the peripheral blood, 6 days after a Hib-MenC-TT booster vaccine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0101672.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
