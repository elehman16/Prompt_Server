					<italic>Background/Aims</italic>. 20 Kilodalton-hGH (20&#x02009;K-hGH) is the second most abundant pituitary GH variant after 22&#x02009;K-hGH. In the steady state the proportion of 20&#x02009;:&#x02009;22&#x02009;K-hGH appears constant; does this proportion change with repetitive somatotroph stimulation? <italic>Methods</italic>. Forty adult males were randomised to receive a GHRH(1&#x02013;29)NH<sub>2</sub> bolus (0.5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg (<italic>n</italic> = 20) or 1.0&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg (<italic>n</italic> = 20)), preceded or followed by a saline bolus, 1 week apart. Four to six weeks later, 10 subjects received 0.5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg GHRH(1&#x02013;29)NH<sub>2</sub> at 0, 60, 120, and 180 minutes. Clearance rate of 22 and 20&#x02009;K-hGH was measured in 10 subjects. <italic>Results</italic>. Total amount/proportion of 22&#x02009;K-hGH/20&#x02009;K-hGH secreted was similar for both GHRH(1&#x02013;29)NH<sub>2</sub> doses. Repetitive stimulation reduced the amount of 22&#x02009;K-hGH released whereas the amount of 20&#x02009;K-hGH did not change significantly leading to an increase in the proportion of 20&#x02009;K-hGH (<italic>P</italic> = .05). Half-life of 20 and 22&#x02009;K-hGH were not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> = .55). <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Repetitive stimulation of the somatotroph may alter the proportion of GH variant released.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="section" id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Growth-hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) acts on the GHRH receptor in the pituitary gland to alter the rate of GH gene transcription, increasing the amount of growth hormone produced and released [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. GH secretion occurs immediately following a GHRH pulse, with the amount of GH released in response to an intravenous bolus dependent both on dose of GHRH and on how frequently the pituitary is stimulated with GHRH. Two main forms of GH account for most of the GH released in response to GHRH stimulation    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], 22&#x02009;K-hGH (191 amino acids)  (approximately 75% of total secretion) and 20&#x02009;K-hGH (176 amino acids) (5&#x02013;10%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Numerous other forms are also detectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. </p><p>The 20&#x02009;K-hGH version lacks residues 32&#x02013;46 as a result of alternate splicing within exon 3, but retains high biological activity on the GH receptor. It may bind less tightly to the extracellular domain of the GH receptor, but appears to have the same efficacy at the full length receptor    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The physiological importance of the different isoforms of GH in humans remains unclear as sensitive and specific immunoassays for 20&#x02009;K-hGH have only been recently developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. 22 and 20&#x02009;K-hGH have almost identical somatogenic activity in prepubertal male and female dwarf rats    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], but this reflects interaction with rodent receptors which differ from human GH receptor. </p><p>It is not known what controls the ratio of splicing of 20 versus 22&#x02009;H-hGH products in the pituitary, and whether they are stored as efficiently, but when secretion is studied, the 22&#x02009;K&#x02009;:&#x02009;20&#x02009;K-hGH ratio remains constant when measured over a 24 hour period and following exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In children the percentage of the 20&#x02009;K-hGH isoform remains constant independent of age, sex, puberty, height, body mass index, and rate of GH production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These observations have led to the suggestion that the overall production of 20&#x02009;K-hGH is under the same regulation as that of 22&#x02009;K-hGH. However, recent in vitro studies using transgenic mice pituitary cell lines have specifically addressed the relative splicing efficiencies of GH products in the context of mutations that alter the usage of splice donor/acceptor sites in favour of a dominant negative 17.5&#x02009;K-hGH form in which exon 3 sequences are completely eliminated    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In this case, driving synthesis and production in an in vitro system altered the relative amounts of alternately splice products made. We have, therefore, evaluated the impact of repetitive stimulation with GHRH in humans, a stimulus that also directly drives GH synthesis, on the amount of 20&#x02009;:&#x02009;22&#x02009;K-hGH produced.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. Subjects and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Subjects</title><p>40 adult male volunteers aged 19&#x02013;25 years were recruited to the study. All were of normal height (170&#x02013;182&#x02009;cm), weight (68&#x02013;80&#x02009;kg), and body mass index (22.8&#x02013;24.4). None of the subjects smoked and alcohol was avoided on the day before each study. Subjects fasted from midnight prior to admission the following morning to the Clinical Investigations Unit at 08.00h. An intravenous (iv) cannula was placed in a forearm vein to allow blood sampling and administration of iv bolus injections of GHRH(1&#x02013;29)NH<sub>2</sub> (Pfizer, Stockholm, Sweden). Subjects were allowed to rest for 60 minutes before the study commenced. Exercise and daytime napping were prohibited. </p><p>

Blood samples were drawn at 10 minutes intervals for the measurement of serum 20 and 22&#x02009;K-hGH until 240 minutes. At the start of the study an additional sample was drawn for the measurement of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Samples were spun and separated and the serum stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C prior to assay. </p></statement>

Microtitre plates were coated for 7 hours at 37&#x000b0;C with a 20&#x02009;K-hGH specific mouse monoclonal antibody HGH33 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Prior to assay, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% milk protein for 45 minutes. Standards and samples were incubated in triplicate for 90 minutes, after which a polyclonal sheep anti-hGH antibody (Scottish Antibody Production Unit, Roslin, UK) was bound to the 20&#x02009;K-hGH33 complex. This was followed by the addition of a biotinylated rabbit antigoat antiserum (DAKO Ltd., High Wycombe, UK) which recognises sheep immunoglobulins. Visualisation used an avidin:biotin complex with alkaline phosphatase as enzyme tracer (DAKO Ltd, High Wycombe, UK). The plate was developed at 24&#x000b0;C over 15&#x02013;19 hours using p-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate (Sigma-Aldrich Co.

The minimum detection limit of the assay was 0.1&#x02009;ng/mL as determined by the mean of zero + 3SD, based on 25 repeat determinations. The within-assay coefficients of variance (CV) were 12% and 6.5% at 2.8 and 7.0&#x02009;ng/mL, respectively. The between-assay CV were 13.0% and 11.8% at 2.8 and 5.3&#x02009;ng/mL, respectively.

In response to a repeated GHRH(1&#x02013;29)NH<sub>2</sub> stimulation lower total concentrations of hGH were achieved and a higher percentage of 20&#x02009;K-hGH was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2 </xref>and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These findings have implications for clinical practice as many endocrine centres measure peak 22&#x02009;K-hGH response to two consecutive GH provocation tests to diagnose growth hormone deficiency.</p><p>The overall effect of GHRH(1&#x02013;29)NH<sub>2</sub> on total hGH secretion was to reduce the concentrations achieved when the stimulus was applied with an interval of 1, 2, or 3 hours compared to the initial application of GHRH(1&#x02013;29)NH<sub>2</sub> a finding consistent with the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This effect was more marked for 22&#x02009;K-hGH than 20&#x02009;K-hGH. Our study differs from previous reports in that we have used a fixed dose of GHRH(1&#x02013;29)NH<sub>2</sub> and measured the concentration of GH variants not only in the steady state but also in response to intensive repeat stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].  We confirm that in the steady state with minimum stimulation the proportion of 20&#x02009;K-hGH found in the circulation accounts for approximately 10% of total, and that after repeated stimulation 20&#x02009;K-hGH comprises 15.7% of total hGH released. Our findings clarify previous reports which have also addressed the idea that repeated stimulation may affect the proportions of the different GH isoforms produced and released, but have been unable to distinguish isoforms produced by splicing, from other minor forms that can arise from fragmentation or deamidation, included in &#x0201c;non-22&#x02009;K-hGH&#x0201d; isoforms present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. </p><p>The effect of repeated stimulation with GHRH(1&#x02013;29)NH<sub>2</sub> on the percentage of 20&#x02009;K-hGH present in the circulation is unlikely to be materially affected by differences in the clearance of 20&#x02009;K-hGH as the measured disappearance half-lives of 22&#x02009;K-hGH and 20&#x02009;K-hGH were similar in these subjects. This does not rule out the possibility that there could be differential binding to circulating growth hormone binding proteins in the steady state, but this is less likely to impact on our findings given the short-time frames over which repeated stimulation was performed. It is more likely that our results reflect differences in the ratio of 20 versus 22&#x02009;K-hGH products secreted under these conditions. In addition to the factors altering splicing efficiency, differences in protein stability, granule packaging, or secretion could all contribute to these differences, as could the relative release rates of different granule pools, containing newly synthesized versus previously synthesized GH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It is however important to note that differences in the sensitivities of the 20 and 22&#x02009;K-hGH assays may also impact on these results with the larger decline in 22&#x02009;K-hGH which was detected possibly reflecting the difference between these two assays especially at values close to the limit of detection of the assay.</p><p>Although the biological effects of these changes may be insignificant, these observations nevertheless have implications for interpreting provocative GH testing in clinical practice. Many guidelines for testing the GH axis suggest that more than one test is undertaken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In many clinical situations it is convenient to combine tests so that the two tests may be applied consecutively. Leaving aside whether this is statistically valid or not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] there is the potential problem that the &#x0201c;cut-off&#x0201d; used to define normality on the second test should not necessarily be the same as that used for the first, especially if the components of what is being measured is changing between tests. With an increasing move towards monoclonal GH immunoassays and calibration using 22&#x02009;K biosynthetic hGH it is obvious that total bioactive GH secretion will be greater than that estimated only for 22&#x02009;K-hGH.  This may become important in situations of poor GH storage (with inadequate somatotroph mass) or constant hyperstimulation, where both reduction in secretory reserve and an increase in the proportion of 20&#x02009;K-hGH and other isoforms, may rise as hGH rises. Our observations stress the importance of considering the impact of chronic or repetitive stimulation of the GH axis on the production of GH bioactive forms that may escape detection in clinical diagnostic tests that specifically measure only maximal 22&#x02009;K-hGH secretion. These observations may have important implications for the interpretation of clinical diagnostic tests of the GH axis.  </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank Mrs. Brankica Leonard and Mrs. Caroline Dance for their technical support and Professor Mario Mellado, Centro National de Biotecnologia, Universidad Autonoma Madrid, for the supply of the 20&#x02009;K-hGH antibodies for the immunoassay. </p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Attie</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name><name><surname>Bengtsson</surname><given-names>B-A</given-names></name><name><surname>Blethen</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of growth hormone (GH) deficiency in childhood and adolescence: summary statement of the GH research society</article-title><source><italic>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism</italic></source><year>2000</year><volume>85</volume><issue>11</issue><fpage>3990</fpage><lpage>3993</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11095419</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baumann</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Growth hormone heterogeneity in human pituitary and plasma</article-title><source><italic>Hormone Research</italic></source><year>1999</year><volume>51</volume><issue>supplement 1</issue><fpage>2</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10393484</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>DeNoto</surname><given-names>FM</given-names></name><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>DD</given-names></name><name><surname>Goodman</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Human growth hormone DNA sequence and mRNA structure: possible alternative splicing</article-title><source><italic>Nucleic Acids Research</italic></source><year>1981</year><volume>9</volume><issue>15</issue><fpage>3719</fpage><lpage>3730</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6269091</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chapman</surname><given-names>GE</given-names></name><name><surname>Rogers</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name><name><surname>Brittain</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The 20,000 molecular weight variant of human growth hormone.
