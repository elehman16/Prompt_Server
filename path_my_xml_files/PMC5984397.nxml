In the United Kingdom (UK), three quarters of the 53,696 people diagnosed with breast cancer each year survive for at least 10&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Consequently, research concerning the longer-term psychosocial and physical health of people treated for breast cancer is important.</p><p id="Par12">An increasing body of evidence has linked post-diagnosis physical activity (PA) to length and quality of breast cancer survivorship, with results summarised in meta-analyses and systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Benefits of PA include improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition (including muscle mass and bone health), strength and flexibility, body image, self-esteem, mood, stress, depression, anxiety, nausea, fatigue and pain. Fear of recurrence is one of the main causes of distress in cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] but PA trials have not examined if being active addresses these fears. Professional bodies in different countries, including the UK, have published detailed PA prescription guidelines for people with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These bodies concur that unless advised otherwise, all cancer survivors should aim to meet national PA recommendations for the general public (currently &#x02265;&#x02009;150&#x000a0;min of moderate intensity aerobic activity per week, plus two sessions of muscular strength and endurance and some daily flexibility/balance exercises). A concern for breast cancer clinical teams is that only 16% of breast cancer survivors are meeting PA recommended guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and sedentary time remains high in the first year following treatment for breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, patients need effective evidence-based programmes to support them to increase PA.</p><p id="Par13">To date, the majority of PA trials in cancer have evaluated interventions under research (e.g. group exercise class led by a researcher) rather than &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Yet, PA programmes that are effective under research conditions are not translated in practice and PA programmes are not routinely part of the standards of care provided to people following a cancer diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. An advantage of using existing community-based PA services is that an infrastructure already exists but should only be recommended if there is evidence that they are clinically effective and uptake in the target population will be high. Determining if existing community-based PA services are likely to be used by people with cancer to aid their recovery is especially relevant in the UK where one of the leading cancer charities is rolling out a national &#x02018;physical activity offer&#x02019; to people recovering from cancer that includes use of existing community services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There are a range of existing PA services including cardiac rehabilitation exercise classes for people with coronary heart disease, and leisure centres and personal trainers for the general public. If people with breast cancer are offered a choice of these existing PA programmes, they may perceive increased control over their options and as proposed by most social cognitive models of human behaviour, offering choice will improve motivation to change behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Cardiac rehabilitation, which is widely available throughout the UK and in other countries, includes supervised circuit classes for people recovering from coronary heart disease. A core component of cardiac rehabilitation is PA and exercise so that people recovering from cardiovascular disease increase overall daily energy expenditure to achieve good cardiovascular health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A British Heart Foundation audit found that at 12&#x000a0;months after participation in cardiac rehabilitation there was a 14 percentage point increase in the number of people exercising five or more times a week for 30&#x000a0;min and a 23 percentage point reduction in those who rarely/never took exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Current guidelines for cardiac rehabilitation recommend use of <italic>generic</italic> evidence-based behaviour change techniques (BCTs) to support improvement in PA such as motivational counselling (active listening skills, empathy and open questioning), goal setting and instructing/coaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Hence, cardiac rehabilitation exercise classes using BCTs could also be relevant to people with cancer to increase PA. A core component of cancer rehabilitation is PA and exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and a recent study suggests that referral of people with colorectal cancer to cardiac rehabilitation exercise classes is feasible and acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Referral to cardiac rehabilitation exercise classes of people with breast cancer, however, has not been previously investigated.</p><p id="Par15">Another existing PA service is exercise referral schemes (ERS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Most ERS operate out of community leisure centres to provide health coaching, exercise consultations, motivational interviews, community-based gym and exercise classes, walking and/or gardening activities. ERS are highly heterogeneous but typically involve health professional referral of a patient to a leisure centre, agreement of a PA programme with a leisure centre instructor and discounted access to the leisure centre for 10 to 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A review of eight randomised controlled trials of ERS found an increased number of participants who achieved 90&#x02013;150&#x000a0;min of PA of at least moderate intensity per week (pooled relative risk 1.16, 95% confidence intervals 1.03 to 1.30) compared with controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It remains unclear if similar increases in PA could be achieved in people with breast cancer referred to a similar scheme.</p><p id="Par16">Travel and distance is a barrier to attending PA exercise classes for people recovering from treatment for breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Cardiac rehabilitation exercise classes and leisure centres may not be easily accessible to some people with cancer because they live in remote and rural areas. However, PA specialists located in leisure centres could potentially deliver telephone-based consultations and, in doing so, offer the unique advantages of increased convenience and access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A recent systematic review identified seven studies of telephone-delivered PA programmes for people with breast cancer, with evidence of a small to moderate effect on quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, the review identified only two studies including people with breast cancer who were on adjuvant treatment, and hence, it remains uncertain if patients on treatment for breast cancer would engage with this type of PA programme. Motivational interviewing was used in several of the studies included in the review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Motivational interviewing is recognised as a useful translation of self-determination theory (SDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. According to SDT, conditions that support a person&#x02019;s basic psychological needs, which is their need for &#x02018;autonomy,&#x02019; (feeling of being the origin of behaviour), &#x02018;competence&#x02019; (feeling of being effective) and &#x02018;relatedness&#x02019; (feeling of being understood and cared for by others), foster the most volitional and intrinsic forms of motivation for initiation and long-term maintenance of health behaviours including PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A growing body of empirical work has shown that SDT-based interventions are effective in augmenting changes in level of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], but SDT-based interventions have rarely been tested in &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; conditions or in people with cancer.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p id="Par17">In this paper, the findings of a mixed methods process evaluation of a PA intervention for people after surgery for breast cancer is reported. The main aim of the study was to understand if referral of people after surgery for breast cancer to the following existing community-based PA services&#x02014;cardiac rehabilitation exercise classes, the local leisure centre with 3-month free membership, or to telephone-delivered PA consultations&#x02014;is feasible to implement and if these PA programmes are acceptable to people with breast cancer. Medical Research Council guidance about process evaluation of complex interventions highlights the importance of investigating how interventions are delivered by practitioners and how patients engage with interventions as a means of understanding the implementation and functioning of the intervention in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. PA interventions are often poorly described, yet explicit reporting of what actually happens in a PA intervention is essential to the interpretation, translation and implementation of research findings into clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These types of evidence are particularly useful when an intervention fails to achieve intended theorised effects because it may be explained by lack of engagement or poor delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition to quantifying patient engagement and practitioner delivery, understanding patients&#x02019; motivations and barriers to PA will also help in the design of more effective interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This paper focuses on the following study&#x02019;s objectives: (1) quantify PA programme uptake and reach, patient engagement with the PA programme, PA programme delivery and fidelity and PA dose and (2) qualitatively explore patient experiences of taking part in the PA programmes. There is lack of consensus about reporting the effectiveness of interventions in preliminary work conducted before a full definitive trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In this paper we do not report outcomes because we did not include a control group to evaluate intervention effects, and the study was not powered to determine meaningful differences in health outcomes pre- and post-intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par18">The study was conducted in two phases. In Phase I, the referral of patients to cardiac rehabilitation exercise classes or to the local leisure centre with 3-month free membership was investigated. Phase I findings were used to inform which PA programmes would be included in Phase II. In Phase I, travel and distance was the most common reason why eligible patients were not willing to participate in the study. In Phase II, we aimed to improve intervention reach by removing this barrier to participation. Hence, in Phase II, we included the referral of people after surgery for breast cancer to telephone-delivered PA consultations. In Phase I, the majority of participants chose referral to the leisure centre with 3-month free membership so we only included this PA programme in Phase II. We did not include a comparison group such as a usual care group to act as a control group in either Phase I or II because the main aim of the study was to gather evidence about the implementation of the three different PA programmes in practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par19">Recruitment took place over 6&#x000a0;months in Phase I and 3&#x000a0;months in Phase II at one UK hospital serving an urban and rural population. The three different PA programmes (cardiac rehabilitation exercise class, leisure centre with 3-month free membership, telephone-delivered PA consultations) were delivered by local practitioners (either health professional delivering the local cardiac rehabilitation exercise classes or PA specialists from the local leisure centre).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par20">Phase I participants were referred to either a local cardiac rehabilitation exercise class or to a local leisure centre with 3-month free membership depending on participant choice. Phase II participants were referred to a local leisure centre or to telephone-delivered PA consultations that were delivered by a PA specialist from the leisure centre depending on participant choice. As explained above, the cardiac rehabilitation exercise class was not offered in Phase II because few participants chose this PA programme in Phase I. A logic model for the intervention, which was informed by the research team&#x02019;s previous work, such as the use of cardiac rehabilitation in colorectal cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], discussions with local PA service providers, the local breast cancer care team and the literature is available in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Cardiac rehabilitation exercise class</title><p id="Par21">Participants were referred to an existing cardiac rehabilitation exercise class. The cardiac physiotherapist informed the research team that the British Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (BACPR) guidelines were followed when delivering the exercise classes including goal setting and use of motivational interviewing techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. At a face-to-face induction with a cardiac rehabilitation physiotherapist, participants were given an initial fitness assessment with incremental shuttle walk test. Specific exercises and intensities that the participant was to do in the class were discussed at induction. Participants attended a 1-h&#x000a0;cardiac rehabilitation circuit exercise class in a gym at the local hospital once a week for 12&#x000a0;weeks. A cardiac physiotherapist and a physiotherapy assistant delivered the class. Exercise took place in a group setting alongside patients recovering from coronary heart disease. No changes to the cardiac rehabilitation programme were made to accommodate cancer patients. Nonetheless, the physiotherapists had attended an additional 1-day educational course delivered by a cancer and exercise specialist (AC) about PA for people recovering from breast cancer for the purposes of the study. Participants could attend health education sessions which took place after the exercise class and included general health advice (e.g. diet, exercise, relaxation), alongside cardiac specific sessions (e.g. medications).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Leisure centre with 3-month free membership</title><p id="Par22">This PA programme was designed to be similar to typical ERS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Participants were given a 3-month free leisure centre membership at one of the local leisure centres in the same city as the hospital where they were treated for breast cancer, providing them with free access to a range of fitness classes, gym and swimming pool. During an initial face-to-face induction with a PA specialist at the leisure centre, the participant received a standard health check by completing the PA Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] followed by agreement of an individual PA programme, including goal setting. After the face-to-face induction, there were no mandatory consultations with a leisure centre PA specialist during the remaining 12&#x000a0;weeks of the PA programme.

Participants initially met face-to-face with a PA specialist at the leisure centre for PA induction. At induction, participants received a health check by completing the PAR-Q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and an individual exercise programme was planned. During the remaining 12&#x000a0;weeks of the PA programme, participants had a weekly telephone-delivered PA consultation with the PA specialist. All PA consultations were conducted in accordance with self-determination theoretical (SDT) techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for list of techniques). The PA specialists had attended a 1-day education event delivered by a health psychologist (WM) about motivational interviewing, which is recognised as a useful translation of SDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Participants were also given a pedometer (2D G-sensor) to monitor step count each day. In line with SDT, research has shown that pedometer use leads to: increased &#x02018;autonomy&#x02019; (through supporting tailoring of PA), increased &#x02018;competence&#x02019; to achieve number of steps (through providing feedback) and &#x02018;relatedness&#x02019; (surveillance of participants&#x02019; steps can help participants to feel observed and supported) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

At each MDT, it was agreed by the clinical team which patients were eligible for the study and could therefore be approached at an out-patient appointment about the study by a breast surgeon or nurse specialist. Reasons for ineligibility were recorded at the MDT. Study information was given to eligible patients approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks after surgery at an out-patient appointment by a breast surgeon or nurse specialist. A researcher contacted by telephone participants who indicated willingness to participate and arranged a face-to-face meeting to discuss the study, confirm willingness to participate and obtain written informed consent.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p id="Par25">Female and male patients were eligible if they were aged 16&#x000a0;years or over and were recovering from surgery for early-stage (stages I&#x02013;IIIA) breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Patients were eligible if they were receiving any adjuvant treatment or had finished adjuvant treatment and were living within a 35-mile radius of the PA intervention site. Travel is a known barrier to participation in interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and the local NHS provides travel claims for those living in a &#x0003e;&#x02009;35-mile radius of the hospital.

To facilitate MDT decision-making about eligibility, the research team delivered a presentation about PA contraindications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] to the MDT prior to recruitment. No formal medical assessment was conducted with the patient because according to international experts &#x02018;this would create an unnecessary barrier to obtaining the well-established health benefits of exercise for the majority of survivors, for whom metastasis and cardiotoxicity are unlikely to occur&#x02019;([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]:1412). Other reasons for exclusion were that the patient was scheduled to have further surgery in the next 12&#x000a0;weeks and the patient had no access to a landline or mobile telephone (Phase II only).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par27">No formal sample size calculation to power the study was performed. In Phase I, we used routine hospital data in the site where the study was conducted about the total number of patients having surgery for early-stage breast cancer to estimate sample size. We estimated that 140 patients over a 6-month period with early-stage breast cancer would be screened for eligibility and 56 (40%) would be eligible. Using data from a previous PA study carried out in the same country (i.e. Scotland) with people with early-stage breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], we estimated that 15 (27%) eligible patients would consent to the study.

Descriptive statistics were calculated for reach and uptake (e.g. screening, eligibility, consent and drop-out, reasons for ineligibility and declining participation, age and on/off treatment), engagement and fidelity (e.g. PA programme choice, PA programme attendance/consultations, SDT-based techniques), PA dose (frequency, intensity, time and type) and reported as <italic>n</italic> (%) for categorical data and mean (Standard deviation [SD]) for continuous data. Qualitative data about the PA programmes were analysed thematically. Audio-recorded qualitative interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using the Framework approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], which is a rigorous method providing a structure within which qualitative data are organised and coded and themes are identified. In brief, a researcher (GH) became familiar with the interview transcript data by reading and rereading transcripts and assigning interview data (sentences and paragraphs) to two main themes, which were (1) choice of PA programme and (2) barriers and facilitators for engaging in PA. Second, subthemes were identified for each of these two main themes and a narrative summary of coded data was made under each subtheme. Finally, the researcher referred to the original data to ensure that participant accounts were accurately presented in this paper.

Hence, in Phase II, we removed travel and distance as barriers to participating in a PA programme by giving patients choice of receiving telephone-delivered PA consultations or attending the leisure centre. In Phase II, 45% of screened patients were deemed ineligible to participate in a PA programme for health reasons (e.g. poor wound healing) by the MDT.

One interview was conducted by telephone, and the others were conducted face-to-face at the university.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Choice of PA programme</title><p id="Par52">Four themes were identified from qualitative interviews about PA programme choice: travel distance, socialising, relevance and flexibility. In Phase II, the main reason for choosing telephone-delivered PA consultations rather than the leisure centre was long travel distance from the leisure centre. Nonetheless, travel distance created difficulties for participants choosing telephone-delivered PA consultations because they still needed to arrange a face-to-face PA induction with an exercise specialist at the leisure centre prior to commencing telephone-delivered support. One participant felt that travelling such a long distance just for a brief PA induction seemed hardly worth it. One participant who chose leisure centre with 3-month free membership found travelling frustrating and impeded regular attendance.</p><p id="Par53">Some participants felt self-conscious about their appearance following mastectomy. These participants did not wish to engage in PA among the general public and therefore chose cardiac rehabilitation exercise classes (exercising with other people who were recovering from illness) or telephone-delivered PA consultations in Phase II. However, some participants chose the leisure centre with 3-month free membership in order to socialise. One participant, for instance, chose the leisure centre with 3-month free membership because she believed that it would help build her confidence to meet other people. Since her breast cancer diagnosis, she had spent most of the time meeting other people recovering from cancer and the leisure centre provided an opportunity to meet people who did not have cancer. One participant questioned the relevance of cardiac rehabilitation exercise classes for people with breast cancer since the programme was designed for people recovering from a cardiac event and chose the leisure centre with 3-month free membership. Some participants chose the leisure centre with 3-month free membership because it provided greater flexibility for being physically active. The leisure centre enabled people to engage in activity that was not weather dependent. Cardiac rehabilitation exercise classes were offered once a week, on a set day and time, which did not suit everyone. Concerns about missing sessions due to feeling unwell, for instance, were eased when it was explained that they could attend the leisure centre at a time that suited them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Facilitators and barriers for engaging in PA</title><p id="Par54">Four themes were identified from the qualitative interviews about facilitators and barriers for engaging in PA: feeling better, feeling ill, weight management, family and friends. Participants perceived that PA made them feel better. One participant said that she had felt powerless and helpless during her treatment for breast cancer and that engaging in PA gave her back a sense of control. Another participant said that when she was active it stopped her from worrying about &#x02018;what might be&#x02019; (i.e. fear of recurrence). Nonetheless, a barrier to participation in the PA programme was feeling ill as a consequence of receiving adjuvant therapy. Some participants experienced fatigue or felt sick and dizzy which they said prevented them from partaking in PA. Several participants explained that they had put on weight due to treatments and wished to be active to help them to lose and maintain weight loss. Family and friends were key sources of support for engaging in PA. They accompanied participants during an activity such as walking. Having a pet dog also constituted a source of support because the dog needed to be walked. Family and friends acted as competition for daily step counts and were therefore an important source of motivation. Participants could become friends and help each other. A couple of participants who chose PA telephone-delivered consultations, for instance, teamed up to attend the gym together and found this was beneficial because they could talk about the exercises and how they were feeling on the day. Nevertheless, family commitments can also act as a barrier to participation. One participant explained that attending to the family members&#x02019; needs meant she was unable to go to the gym during a particular week.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par55">The aim of this paper was to address the general lack of published data about how practitioners deliver a PA intervention and the extent to which participants engage in the PA programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This exploratory study raises the following issues relating to implementation of community-based PA programmes for people recovering from surgery for breast cancer:</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Reach and uptake</title><p id="Par56">The study had very high retention rates with only two participants dropping out of the study due to ill-health. The retention rate is therefore somewhat consistent with previous trials of community-based PA interventions &#x02265;&#x02009;80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Nonetheless, the study consent rate (31%) is relatively low compared to other community-based PA interventions: 71% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], 61% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], 66% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], 61% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Why the study has a relatively low consent rate is unclear. The reasons given by eligible patients for refusing to participate in the study are similar to other studies and include health issues, not being interested, and other commitments (e.g. family and work) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. These factors are also cited in the literature as barriers to being physically active following a breast cancer diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Addressing these factors in future studies can therefore serve the dual purpose of increasing PA as well as the appeal of participating in studies of community-based PA programmes.</p><p id="Par57">The eligibility rate (46%) is comparatively low compared to some previous trials of community-based PA interventions: 76.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], 61% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], 46% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], 79% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. One seemingly obvious reason for this variation between studies is use of different eligibility criteria. Yet, two trials with similar eligibility criteria (e.g. people with breast cancer must have completed treatment, are physically inactive and have no contraindications for exercise) had differing eligibility rates of 42% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and 79% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], respectively. Another possible explanation for variation in eligibility rates is a difference in clinician interpretation and application of eligibility criteria. In the study, the MDT excluded 45% of patients in Phase II but only 9% in Phase I, which could be an artefact of differences in recruitment time periods (3 versus 6&#x000a0;months) or clinician variation in application of eligibility criteria. The proportion of people excluded by clinicians will influence PA programme reach and convincing clinicians of the benefits of PA for people with cancer may go some way towards improving the recruitment rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Engagement</title><p id="Par58">The qualitative interviews give insight about patient PA programme choice, with some participants choosing telephone-delivered PA consultations because they did not wish to travel long distances to attend the leisure centre and others choosing telephone-delivered consultations because they felt self-conscious about their appearance following mastectomy and therefore did not wish to engage in PA in front of members of the public. Preference for home-based PA was found in a previous survey of rural people with breast cancer (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;483), with respondents indicating a preference for home-based (63%), unsupervised (47%) and moderate intensity exercise (65%) that was primarily walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">The PA intervention was designed to allow maximum participant choice for the type of PA that they did during the 12-week PA programme. Diaries completed by participants show that the most common type of PA was walking (57.8%) and intensity was &#x02018;fairly light&#x02019; (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;11.97; SD 2.54). A survey of people with breast cancer (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;160) during chemotherapy found that walking and exercises specific to women with breast cancer were most frequently performed and preferred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]; another survey of patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;23) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] during treatment found that the majority preferred walking (100%) at moderate-intensity (61%) and another study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) found that walking was the most acceptable exercise modality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Preferences for walking have also been found in a survey of cancer survivors with different diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. A challenge therefore is encouraging people to engage in their preferred activities, such as walking, at a level of intensity that will optimise health benefits and to progress mean rates of excursion during a 12-week programme. Addressing this challenge may be critical because the findings of observational studies of PA and breast-cancer specific and all-cause mortality that have been summarised in meta-analyses and systematic reviews suggest that there may be a dose-response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], and while there is limited evidence about a dose-response relationship for other health benefits, one meta-analysis revealed that there may be a dose-response relationship for fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Fidelity</title><p id="Par60">All Phase I participants received an induction by a cardiac rehabilitation physiotherapist or PA specialist from the leisure centre but only 50% of Phase II participants received an induction by a PA specialist from the leisure centre. In Phase II, use of each of the 22 SDT-techniques reported by the PA specialists during a telephone-delivered consultation was high, with only two techniques being used in half or less of the PA consultations delivered by telephone. In Phase II, participants perceived that their three basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence and relatedness) were met by the PA specialists. However, self-reported use of behaviour change techniques is limited because of biased reporting and objective measurement such as recording PA consultations should be considered in future trials. In the study, the average number of participant contacts (e.g. face-to-face, telephone, email) by a PA specialist over the 12-week PA programme was six. While this is half than what was planned, this actual number is similar or greater than other telephone-delivered PA trials of similar duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In a previous trial, the mean number of calls was 6.7 (SD 1.81) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and in another study, the average total contact time over a 12-week home-based walking programme was 90&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Although the optimal contact time to promote behaviour change is uncertain, the qualitative interviews suggest that some participants found weekly &#x02018;checking up&#x02019; by a PA specialist on their amount of PA a source of motivation. For these participants at least, weekly contact (face-to-face, telephone or email) over the course of a PA programme is likely to be important for the improvement of PA and health.</p><p id="Par61">Nonetheless, a strength of the study is that it took place in a &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; setting because it is delivered by PA specialists at a local leisure centre and therefore likely to reflect what would happen were the PA intervention implemented into the cancer care pathway. In the study, over half of the Phase II participants did not receive a face-to-face induction with a PA specialist whereas in a previous trial all face-to-face induction prior to telephone-delivered support were carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. A key difference between these two studies was who was delivering the intervention. In this study, the PA induction and telephone-delivered consultations were delivered by PA specialists at a community-based leisure centre who were expected to fit the delivery of the PA programme around their other daily tasks whereas in the other study the PA counsellor was a Master&#x02019;s degree trained research assistant specifically employed to deliver the PA programme. This key difference may explain variation in intervention fidelity between the two studies. A challenge for using existing community-based services rather the research team delivering the PA intervention is therefore a lack of direct management over the weekly activities of the individuals who are delivering the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par62">The strengths of this feasibility work relate to the recruitment of a sample generally representative of the breast cancer population and the evaluation of a PA intervention, which was delivered using a pragmatic approach suitable for translation into practice. Limitations include the study only being conducted in one site with a small sample which limits generalisability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par63">The current community-based PA intervention is not yet suitable for progression to a definitive effectiveness randomised controlled trial. Further work is needed to optimise PA programme reach, uptake and fidelity. Further work is also required to assist participants to progress their level of exercise intensity when engaging in their preferred activity, for example, walking so that they achieve the health benefits associated with moderate to vigorous PA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec33"><p>
