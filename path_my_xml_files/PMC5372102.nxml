Some children become steroid-dependent (SD) and require addition of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to maintain remission. Since these oral agents are toxic, alternative interventions are needed for long-term treatment. The anti-CD20 antibody rituximab has shown promising steroid-sparing properties in clinical trials, but benefits are less convincing in complicated forms of SD-INS. Ofatumumab, a new anti-CD20 antibody with stronger affinity to CD20, may be superior to rituximab in maintaining oral steroid-free and CNI-free disease remission in children with SD-INS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This open-label, two-parallel-arm, controlled, phase II randomised clinical trial will enrol children with SD-INS maintained in remission with oral steroids and CNI. Children will be randomised to either ofatumumab or rituximab infusion. After infusion of either antibody, steroids will be maintained for 30&#x02005;days and then tapered off by 0.3&#x02005;mg/kg/week until complete withdrawal. 1 week after complete steroid withdrawal, CNI will be decreased by 50% and withdrawn within 2 additional weeks. We will enrol 140 children to detect as significant at the 2-sided p value of 0.01 with a power of &#x0003e;0.8, a reduction in the risk of 1-year relapse (primary end point) of at least 0.3 (ie, from 0.65 to 0.35; (risk ratio 0.54)) in the ofatumumab arm when compared with the rituximab arm. We will compare the amount of steroids required to maintain complete disease remission at 6 and 24&#x02005;months, relapse-free period, relapse rate per year as secondary end points. Circulating cell populations will be studied as biomarkers or predictors of the anti-CD20 response.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The trial received ethics approval from the local ethics board.

In Western countries, INS affects 2&#x02013;2.7 new children per 100&#x02005;000 children per year and has a prevalence of 16 cases per 100&#x02005;000.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Oral corticosteroids are the cornerstone of therapy, inducing remission of INS in &#x0223c;90% of children.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, up to 85% of cases relapse within 5&#x02005;years<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and many will develop steroid dependence (SD). SD-INS relapses within 2&#x02005;weeks of steroid withdrawal and requires continuation of treatment. Clinical practice guidelines suggest using low-dose prednisone to maintain remission in SD-INS (evidence 2C-D), and use of steroid-sparing agents (ie, calcineurin inhibitors; CNI) for children who develop steroid-related adverse effects (evidence 1B).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Given the toxicity of steroids and CNI, there is a need to investigate alternative treatment options.</p><p>The interest in the anti-CD20 chimeric antibody rituximab followed the observation of a dramatic reduction in proteinuria in children with nephrotic syndrome who received rituximab to treat idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> or a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> More recent observational studies<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;17</xref> confirmed potential benefits in mixed populations with nephrotic syndrome, but clinical trials did not confirm expected benefits in steroid-resistant (SR) forms of INS.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Although recent randomised controlled trials support the use of rituximab in SD-INS, benefits may be suboptimal, especially in complicated forms of the disease. While a single infusion of rituximab allowed steroid withdrawal and was non-inferior to steroids in maintaining remission in a trial of children with uncomplicated forms of SD-INS,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in children with frequently relapsing and complicated forms of SD-INS requiring the use of CNI, benefits of rituximab are less convincing.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Ofatumumab is a fully humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal IgG1(k) antibody of last generation<italic>.</italic> Ofatumumab binds with more affinity to CD20, potentially leading to more efficient complement-dependent cytotoxicity.

<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> From an economic point of view, ofatumumab is not superior to rituximab as the cost of the two drugs for square metres of body surface is similar. Ofatumumab is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, relapsing lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Owing to its stronger affinity for the CD20 and its fully humanised structure, ofatumumab may be used in larger doses with minimal risk of side effects leading to potentially larger benefits, that is, longer remission period, than the chimeric antibody rituximab. Some studies support this conclusion.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>

Knowledge generation to support the use of new steroid-sparing agents is an important unmet healthcare need in paediatric nephrology, especially for children with complicated forms of SD-INS requiring steroids and CNI (tacrolimus or ciclosporin). In the present study, CNI have been chosen among steroid-sparing agents because they are more effective than other drugs and therefore more commonly used.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>Head-to-head comparison between rituximab and ofatumumab is justified on the basis of available trials supporting the use of anti-CD20 antibodies to maintain remission of INS without steroids and CNI.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Objectives</title><p>This trial will test whether ofatumumab is superior to rituximab in maintaining oral drug-free disease remission (complete or partial remission) at 12&#x02005;months (primary objective) and reduce the risk of relapse in a longer follow-up of 24&#x02005;months (secondary objective) in children with SD and CNI-dependent INS.

Eligible participants will enter a 1-month run-in period, during which instruction on urine collection and dipstick readings will be carefully reviewed, compliance assessed and CNI and prednisone doses will be reduced to the minimum doses required to maintain complete remission (usually the minimum doses used in the previous 6&#x02005;months).

In the case of relapses during the study (see outcome section) children will be treated with oral prednisone (60&#x02005;mg/m<sup>2</sup>), in order to achieve remission. At remission, children will be treated with another infusion of either ofatumumab or rituximab, according to the allocation arm. After infusion of intervention or comparator, steroids will be maintained at initial dose for 30&#x02005;days and then tapered off by 0.3&#x02005;mg/kg/week until complete withdrawal. One week after the steroid withdrawal, CNI will be decreased by 50% and withdrawn within 2 additional weeks. Inability to withdraw CNI or need to restart CNI (development of steroid resistance) will be considered a relapse (primary end point) and a reason to terminate the study. In this case, patients should be treated at the discretion of the investigator, according to the best clinical practice guidelines.

Therefore, alternative treatment options are needed. Although recent studies support the use of rituximab as a steroid-sparing and CNI-sparing agent in SD-INS, benefits may be suboptimal, especially in complicated forms of the disease. The new anti-CD20 ofatumumab may be more effective than rituximab in controlling the disease, due to its stronger affinity for the CD20. Moreover, due to its fully humanised structure, it may be used in larger doses with minimal risk of side effects. These considerations motivated the use of an active comparator to test the effects of different agents blocking the CD20 antigen pathway.</p><p>This is the first randomised controlled trial comparing the effects of two anti-CD20 antibodies on the risk of relapse of INS following steroid and CNI withdrawal. Strengths in the design of this trial include: objective and clinical important outcomes, identification of a high-risk population (SD-INS maintained in complete remission with steroids and CNI), methods to reduce bias (allocation concealment, objective outcomes, steps to ensure complete follow-up and blinding of outcome adjudicators to treatment assignment), careful collection of safety data and large catchment area of the study centre with clinical and research expertise in paediatric nephrology.</p><p>The design of this trial has limitations. First, interventions are not blinded because ofatumumab and rituximab require different methods for infusion. Although strategies to mask the two interventions could have been designed, they would have been expensive. In addition and most importantly, the end point adjudication committee reviewing the clinical and laboratory data will be blinded to intervention assignments. Second, the primary end point is an intermediate rather than a final outcome. However, the laboratory-based measures we adopted to define disease relapse are objective and more distant outcomes, including cardiovascular or infectious complications of nephrotic syndrome, or progression of kidney disease to kidney failure are rarely observed during childhood. A very large multinational trial would be necessary to study these hard end points. On the other hand, relapse of nephrotic syndrome is an important outcome for children and their families, often requiring travel to the nephrology centre in order to access urgent care. Third, this trial will compare the risk of relapse at 1&#x02005;year based on the first event that occurs. While we planned to maintain participants into the assigned arm for follow-up studies by treating repeated relapses with the same antibody they receive, comparison of the effect of these antibodies on the risk of repeated relapses is not included in the present trial.</p><p>In summary, this study addresses an intervention question that is relevant to children with INS and their families. Results from this study may impact the management of paediatric SD-INS in the near future and provide information on safety of these agents more and more often used in clinical practice. In these children, ofatumumab may allow maintenance of long-term remission of INS without steroids and CNI therapy. Improvement in quality of life, reduction in hospitalisation rates and use of healthcare resources are other important expected benefits.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The Institute Giannina Gaslini (trial sponsor) will provide logistic and financial support to the trial through grants from the ministry of health (&#x02018;Cinque per mille of IRPEF-Finanziamento della ricerca sanitaria&#x02019;), the &#x02018;Fondazione Malattie Renali del Bambino&#x02019; and the &#x02018;Fondazione La Nuova Speranza&#x02019; (&#x02018;Progetto integrato per la definizione dei meccanismi implicati nella glomerulo sclerosi focale&#x02019;).
