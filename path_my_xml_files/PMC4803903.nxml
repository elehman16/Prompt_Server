Introduction</title><p>Approximately 4 million people have an indwelling urinary catheter (IUC) inserted each year (Adib-<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Hajbaghery &#x00026; Aghajani, 2009</xref>). Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most important adverse outcome of urinary catheter use, 80% of hospital acquired UTI(s) are attributable to an IUC (Anderson et al., 2008). Catheter use is also associated with negative outcomes other than infection, including nonbacterial urethral inflammation, urethral strictures, mechanical trauma (Anderson et al., 2008), bacteremia, leakage and recurrent blockage (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adib-Hajbaghery &#x00026; Aghajani, 2009</xref>). Complications associated with long-term catheterization are bacteriuria and UTI, encrustation and subsequent blockage (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Madigan &#x00026; Neff, 2003</xref>). UTI(s) have been shown to increase length of stay, hospital cost, and mortality (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Rosenthal, Guzman, &#x00026; Safdar, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Care for patient with IUC is an important element to prevent problems associated with indwelling IUC. Care for patient with IUC was described by <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Lo et al. (2008)</xref> which includes properly securing indwelling catheters after insertion, maintaining a sterile, continuously closed drainage system, not disconnecting the catheter and drainage tube unless the catheter must be irrigated, obtaining urine samples for culturing by aspirating urine from the sampling port, maintaining unobstructed urine flow, emptying the collecting bag regularly, keeping the collecting bag below the level of the bladder at all times, and cleaning the meatal area (area of urethral meatus) without using antiseptics. Many urinary catheter-associated problems are preventable by teaching the patients about simple measures such as hand washing, maintaining a closed system, securing the catheter, drinking enough fluids and properly positioning the drainage bag (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adib-Hajbaghery &#x00026; Aghajani, 2009</xref>). Use of antiseptic or antimicrobial solutions or ointments as part of routine meatal care does not reduce the incidence of bacteriuria or catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), so regular cleansing of the meatus as part of routine perineal hygiene without using antiseptics or antimicrobials may reduce the incidence of CAUTI, especially in patients with fecal incontinence (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Willson et al., 2009)</xref>. The use of external male catheter (condom) has been shown to reduce bacteriuria, CAUTI, and death in male patients (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Saint et al., 2006)</xref>. <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Slater (2011)</xref> reported that regular check up of IUC and drainage system and patient education regarding IUC care are important in the safe management of caring for individuals with long-term IUC(s).</p><p>Despite the strong link between urinary catheters and subsequent UTI, A national study conducted in the United States revealed that no single strategy was widely used for the prevention of nosocomial UTI (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Saint et al., 2008)</xref>. Intermittent urinary catheterization when required in managing elderly female urinary retention is superior to using IUC as IUC would hinder rehabilitation and adversely affect patient quality of life (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Tang, Kwok, Hui &#x00026; Woo, 2006</xref>). <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adib-Hajbaghery and Aghajani (2009)</xref> reported that the quality of care for patients with IUC(s) was low regarding patient preparation for urinary catheterization, patient education, and post catheterization care. Many of the indications for urinary catheterization are considered inappropriate such as to replace nursing care for urinary incontinence and prolonged postoperative periods without appropriate indications for urinary catheter use (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Gould, Umscheid, Agarwal, Kuntz &#x00026; Pegues, 2010</xref>). For this reason, staff education about indwelling urinary catheter management (i.e.: techniques for catheterization, catheter care, and technique of catheter removal) and prevention of CAUTI, combined with regular feedback about occurrence rates, reduces the incidence of bacteriuria and CAUTI (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Willson et al., 2009)</xref>. <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Mamatha (2005)</xref> concluded that structured teaching program is an effective method of improving knowledge and skills of staff nurses regarding indwelling catheter care in order to prevent the complications associated with IUC.</p><p>Because health care providers do not concentrate on preventing measures of IUC associated problems (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adib-Hajbaghery &#x00026; Aghajani, 2009</xref>), and no studies specific to care for patient with IUC were conducted in Jordan, and no previously proven method to increase knowledge level about caring for patient with IUC, the study purposed to assess knowledge level of associate degree nursing students in Al-Balqa&#x02019;a Applied University/Zarqa University College-regarding care for patients with IUC and to determine whether their knowledge level differ after they join a session of care for patient with IUC.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2.

The questionnaire (test) contained fourteen yes/no questions written in Arabic reflecting the knowledge of participant for care of patient with IUC (see Appendix B). The maximum score for the test was 14, with higher scores indicating more knowledge about caring for patient with IUC. On the posttest, an increase in the scores of participants will indicate an effectiveness of the teaching session of increasing knowledge about caring for patient with IUC.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>2.5 Data Analysis</title><p>First data will be screened for missing data and unexpected responses and treated with appropriate techniques. Means, standard deviations, and ranges for overall score for each participant will be calculated.

Discussion</title><p>The study purposes were to assess knowledge level of associate degree nursing students regarding caring for patient with IUC and whether their knowledge level change after joining the educational session about caring for patient with IUC. The results obtained from this study have shown that knowledge level of students has not been changed dramatically in posttest results (overall mean of scores changed from 10.41 in pretest to 11.36 in posttest). Among the possible causes for these results is inability of one educational session to make considerable change in the knowledge level of students. <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Grol (2001)</xref> concluded that a program to implement guidelines for clinical practice should be well designed, well prepared, and preferably pilot tested before use. <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adib-Hajbaghery and Aghajani (2009)</xref> have emphasized on the need for continuing education and reinforcement of the required behaviors in nursing and medical staff involved in IUC insertion to reduce the risk of developing UTI. The same point was addressed by <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Rosenthal, Guzman, and Safdar (2004)</xref> that implementation of education combined with performance feedback is necessary to increased compliance with guidelines for caring of patient with IUC and subsequent reduction in CAUTI rates, similarly as what <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Mamatha (2005)</xref> concluded that structured teaching program is an effective method of improving knowledge and skills of staff nurses regarding indwelling catheter care in order to prevent the complications associated with IUC, so the combination of continuing education, and performance feedback and reinforcement is necessary to increase knowledge level and skills of nursing students in caring for patient with IUC.</p><p>The results have also shown no significant difference between the control and the experimental group in the posttest results, and there was a significant interaction between posttest scores and level of student in the university (first year vs. second year). Second year students know more about caring for patient with IUC due to their practical training in teaching hospitals, and so what was added to their knowledge in the educational session is little compared with what was added to the knowledge of the first year students. <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Tobias (1994)</xref> concluded that prior knowledge about a specific topic raises more interest in learning what is new about that topic, a point that has been reported by <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Valliani, Ahmed, Saleem, Mirza, and Ejaz (2011)</xref> that old nurses are trained well and are doing better than the fresh medical graduates. However, <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adib-Hajbaghery and Aghajani (2009)</xref> have reported that there was inappropriate or lack of communication between caregiver and patient regarding using IUC, a point that indicates lack of knowledge or the application of traditional and irrationalized health care task. To plan for a change in clinical practice, characteristics of individual professionals and interpersonal factors should be addressed (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Grol &#x00026; Wensing, 2004</xref>). So presence of second year nursing students might have impacted the results obtained from this study because of their traditional learning and their prior knowledge gained during their clinical training in hospitals that might be irrationalized or not evidence-based, despite their good and holistic performance in providing nursing care.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5. Conclusion and Recommendations</title><p>In conclusion, joining one educational session is insufficient to increase knowledge level of associate degree nursing students regarding caring for patient with IUC, so it is recommended to include more than one educational session combined with reinforcement of the required behaviors while conducting educational programs about caring for patient with IUC. Furthermore, nursing students should be observed for their performance if will change from traditional and non-evidence based practices to the evidence- based and safe practices.</p><p>Level of student during university education should be addressed in future studies because of its confounding effects on the results of this study, a factorial design or repeated measure design (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Polit &#x00026; Beck, 2012</xref>) may isolate the effect of student level in both the experimental and control groups from the results obtained or to measure the change in knowledge level at different times.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would thank Mr. Mezyed Adwan, Mr. Ahmed Saleh, and Mrs. Weddad Ghanem for their participation in validating the content of the self - administered questionnaire.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adib-Hajbaghery</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Aghajani</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Quality of Care for Patients with Indwelling Urinary Catheter in Selected Hospitals in Kashan, Iran 2007</article-title><source>International Journal of Urological Nursing</source><year>2009</year><volume>3</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>43</fpage><lpage>49</lpage><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-771X.2009.01067.x">http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-771X.2009.01067.x</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>George</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Mallery</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><source>SPSS for Windows Step by Step: A simple Guide and Reference. 11.0 update</source><year>2003</year><publisher-loc>Boston, USA</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Allyn and Bacon</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>C.
