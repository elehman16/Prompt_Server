Engaging in an active lifestyle is associated with a better prognosis. Nevertheless, there is evidence to suggest that patients with chronic LBP are less likely to meet recommended physical activity levels. Furthermore, while exercise therapy has been endorsed by recent clinical practice guidelines, evidence from systematic reviews suggests that its effect on pain and disability are at best moderate and not sustained over time. A limitation of current exercises programmes for chronic LBP is that these programmes are not designed to change patients&#x02019; behaviour toward an active lifestyle. Therefore, we will investigate the short- and long-term efficacy of a multimodal intervention, consisting of supervised exercises, health coaching and use of an activity monitor (i.e. <italic>Fitbit Flex</italic>) compared to supervised exercises plus sham coaching and a sham activity monitor on physical activity levels, pain intensity and disability, in patients with chronic, nonspecific LBP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This study will be a two-group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial. One hundred and sixty adults with chronic, nonspecific LBP will be recruited. Participants allocated to both groups will receive a group exercise programme. In addition, the intervention group will receive health coaching sessions (i.e. assisting the participants to achieve their physical activity goals) and an activity monitor (i.e. <italic>Fitbit Flex</italic>). The participants allocated to the control group will receive sham health coaching (i.e. encouraged to talk about their LBP or other problems, but without any therapeutic advice from the physiotherapist) and a sham activity monitor. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months post randomisation. The primary outcomes will be physical activity, measured objectively with an accelerometer, as well as pain intensity and disability at 3 months post randomisation. Secondary outcomes will be physical activity, pain intensity and disability at 6 and 12 months post randomisation as well as other self-report measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour, depression, quality of life, pain self-efficacy and weight-related outcomes at 3, 6, and 12 months post randomisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study is significant as it will be the first study to investigate whether a multimodal intervention designed to increase physical activity levels reduces pain and disability, and increases physical activity levels compared to a control intervention in patients with chronic LBP.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT03200509">NCT03200509</ext-link>.

Nonspecific LBP is the most common form of LBP and the term &#x02018;nonspecific&#x02019; means that the pathoanatomical cause is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although most patients with acute LBP find that their symptoms improve in the first 6 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], about 40% of them may develop chronic and persistent symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Nearly 60% of these patients continue to report moderate levels of pain and disability after 1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Emerging evidence suggests the coexistence of chronic LBP and cardiovascular comorbidities such as obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Hence, health care professionals are now facing the challenge of using evidence-based interventions that also manage and prevent comorbidities in this population such as interventions that aim to increase physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Physical inactivity is commonly associated with chronic LBP. There is evidence to suggest that patients with chronic LBP are less likely to meet the recommended physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and are considered less active compared to individuals without LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, active patients with LBP have a better prognosis compared to sedentary patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although exercise therapy has been endorsed by recent clinical practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], its effect on pain and disability are at best moderate and smaller over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A systematic review from our group shows that most physical activity-based interventions failed to increase objectively measured physical activity levels of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We would argue that current interventions are not designed to change patients&#x02019; behaviour toward an active lifestyle.</p><p id="Par20">Behaviour-change interventions involve a range of techniques and have been advocated to change physical activity behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Health coaching is a behaviour-change strategy defined as the practice of health education and health promotion within a coaching context, to enhance the well-being of individuals and to facilitate the achievement of their health-related goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This strategy has been considered effective to promote physical activity among the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and among patients with acute and subacute LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Moreover, one technique commonly incorporated in interventions to promote physical activity is the provision of feedback. Recently, wearable physical activity monitors, such as the <italic>Fitbit</italic>, have been used to provide interactive feedback and individualised support on real-time physical activity behaviour (e.g. step counts). Interventions incorporating wearable devices to provide feedback on physical activity have been shown to be effective in promoting weight loss among obese participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] as well as for increasing physical activity levels in patients with musculoskeletal pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Therefore, we will investigate the efficacy of a multimodal physical activity intervention consisting of supervised exercises, health coaching and provision of an activity monitor on physical activity levels, pain intensity and disability compared to supervised exercises plus sham coaching and sham activity monitor in patients with chronic, nonspecific LBP. Our primary hypothesis is that the physical activity intervention will increase physical activity levels as well as reduce pain intensity and disability at 3 months post randomisation. The secondary outcomes are physical activity, pain intensity and disability at 6 months and 12 months post randomisation as well as other objective measures of physical activity (i.e. time spent doing light and moderate-vigorous physical activity, number of steps), self-reported physical activity levels, depression, pain self-efficacy, perceived recovery, weight-related outcomes and quality of life measured at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par22">This study will be a parallel randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted at two outpatient physical therapy clinics in Presidente Prudente, Brazil.

The physiotherapist will be trained to use active listening techniques, giving participants the opportunity to talk about their LBP or other problems. In response, the treating physiotherapist will reply in a warm and empathic manner, with a special interest in the report, but without providing any therapeutic advice. This strategy is designed to control for time with a physiotherapist and the therapeutic alliance that occurs within a consultation. A previous study found that this approach is credible which maximises participant blinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">All participants in the control group will be given a sham activity monitor, which will consist of a <italic>Fitbit Flex</italic> wristband without the accelerometer. A material that mimics the weight of the accelerometer will be inserted in the wristband and heat-shrink tubing will be used to cover the wristband as in the intervention group. The same information given to the intervention group about the activity monitor will be provided to the participants in the control group. Nevertheless, the participants will be informed that the treating physiotherapist does not have access to the <italic>Fitbit</italic> data for the control group.

Data will be collected and stored in spreadsheets by assessors blinded to group allocation. At baseline assessment, the physiotherapist assessors will collect data on participant characteristics (i.e. age, gender, educational level, presence of comorbidities, medication use and employment status). To characterise the study participants, information on fear of movement measured with the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and prognosis risk measured with the &#x000d6;rebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (&#x000d6;MPSQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] will be collected at baseline.

A complete data set for each patient will be defined as having at least 10 h/day of monitored wear over at least 5 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Non-wear periods will be defined as time intervals of at least 60 consecutives min of zero counts, with an activity interruption allowance of 0 to 100 counts/min lasting a maximum of two consecutive days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

We will test whether the proposed intervention reduces pain and disability, but at the same time increases physical activity levels. More importantly, the long-term follow-up of 6 and 12 months will allow us to investigate whether these effects are sustained over time after the completion of the intervention.</p><p id="Par48">For the physiotherapy field, this study will provide important elucidation about physiotherapists delivering interventions to promote physical activity. Indeed, the physiotherapists are in a privileged position to promote physical activity and, consequently, to prevent non-communicable diseases, improve biomedical outcomes and the lifelong health of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Although previous studies have shown that physiotherapists are not confident to change patients&#x02019; behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], this type of strategy should be viewed as a professional responsibility considering patients&#x02019; health.</p><p id="Par49">A strength of this trial is the use of a sham control treatment to determine the efficacy of an intervention to promote physical activity. In addition, our trial is designed to conform to SPIRIT and CONSORT guidelines and will be sufficiently powered to detect a difference in the primary outcomes. The limitation of this study is the lack of blinding of the treating physiotherapists due to the nature of the intervention.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par50">The recruitment started in August 2017 and is expected to finish in December 2018 with final data collection (12-month follow-up) in December 2019.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par57">
