They are particularly useful for primary care physicians because they deal with a wide range of patients and problems and need quick access to information regarding their practices. Sometimes abstracts are the only source of evidence they use.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</p><p>Abstract conclusions are the most crucial part of the whole abstract as they summarise the main results and provide interpretations.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A previous survey showed that primary care physicians paid the most attention to the conclusion.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The conclusion also guides primary physicians who are not confident in their skills in evidence-based medicine (EBM)<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> to interpret the results. Thus, a strong conclusion may alter the readers&#x02019; interpretation of the whole study.</p><p>Unfortunately, the conclusion is the most frequently distorted section in abstracts.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Exaggerating the results of the trial, such as using spin<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> or overstatement,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> is not uncommon. Examples of spin include omitting non-significant results of primary outcomes and focusing on significant secondary outcome or subgroup analysis.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Previous studies also found that 58% of RCTs with non-significant results,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and 70% of non-randomised studies<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> had spin. Subsequent studies reported that spin, misleading information or overstatements were common in various subspecialties, such as rheumatology,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> psychiatry,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> wound care,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> surgery<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> and oncology.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref>
</p><p>This suggests that, as far as abstract conclusions are concerned, the quality of reporting is still poor despite the consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT)&#x000a0;guideline for abstracts.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p><p>However, there has been limited evidence about the influence of such abstracts on the readers&#x02019; interpretations in the real world. Only one RCT<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> investigated the extent of the impact of inappropriate reporting on readers&#x02019; interpretations of the results. Boutron <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> randomised clinical researchers into two groups, and asked them to read an abstract with or without &#x02018;spin&#x02019;, which was defined by the authors as &#x02018;reporting the beneficial effect of the intervention as greater than shown by the results&#x02019;, to estimate how readers were influenced when they assessed the effectiveness of the intervention. The result showed that the participants who read abstract with spin were more likely to think that the intervention was beneficial for the patients than those who read the abstracts without spin.</p><p>Although their trial demonstrated that spin in the abstract had a small impact (effect size=0.24), it left several questions unanswered. First, the level of influence of spin in the abstract conclusion on the participants&#x02019; interpretation remained unclear because the investigators added changes to all sections of the abstracts. In their study, they either erased or added all the results of secondary outcomes while changing the wording. In other words, they investigated the general influence of spin in an abstract by comparing it with its &#x02018;paragon&#x02019; counterpart. Moreover, the target population was clinical researchers with publishing experience. Therefore, the influence of spin in the abstract conclusion on other types of evidence users remains unknown.</p><p>This study aims to determine the influence of the overstatements in abstract conclusions on general clinical practice by focusing on the primary care physicians who read reports of RCTs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting and design</title><p>This online study was a double-blind RCT conducted from January to February in 2017. The participants were masked to the study hypothesis, and the investigators (except RS who constructed the random sequence) were masked from the allocation. We recruited volunteers from members of the Japan Primary Care Association (JPCA) by sending email invitations. The intervention was conducted on a website specifically designed for this study. Participants were randomised into two groups and asked to read and evaluate 1 of the 10 abstracts (five pairs of two corresponding abstracts: one with and another without overstatement) of an RCT report. The trial was prospectively registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network&#x02014;Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN000025317) and now it is at "sutdy completed" stage. We had submitted the protocol including a statistical analysis plan to the JPCA before commencement but did not publish it to avoid the risk of participants reading it.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants and recruiting</title><p>The target population was recruited from the members of the JPCA. The JPCA was established in 2010 to the promote primary care specialty in Japan.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It is the largest organisation for primary care physicians in the country, and has been promoting evidence-based practice among its members. Currently, over 10&#x02009;000 doctors working in various types of medical institutions<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> belong to the JPCA, and 5836 out of a total of 10&#x02009;851 members are certified as specialists in primary care.</p><p>We sent email invitations to JPCA members who had more than 2&#x02009;years of clinical experience with registered email addresses. (The details of the recruiting process will be reported in a separate paper.) We excluded clinicians with less than 2&#x02009;years&#x02019; experience because our target population was primary care physicians, and doctors usually choose their specialty after 2&#x02009;years of clinical training in Japan. Interested individuals could access the DOCTOR study website via the link in the email. We added a code at the end of the link to ensure that participants accessed the website via the given link. As an incentive, an Amazon gift card worth 3000 yen (US$26.6) was given to 20 drawing winners.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for participants were as follows: JPCA member, medical doctor currently in clinical practice, more than 2&#x02009;years of clinical practice experience and access to up-to-date clinical research knowledge. We asked how respondents learnt about the recent clinical trials, and individuals who did not respond with any information source were excluded. Screening questions were on the leading page on the website. We excluded those who work at research laboratories or educational institutions.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p>When participants moved to the assessment page, they were randomly assigned an abstract either with or without overstatements with a 1:1 ratio. The block randomisation (10 for each block) was automatically performed using a computer-generated random sequence (created by RS). The allocation concealment was maintained through the automatic random allocation process.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Blinding</title><p>In the email invitations, participants were notified that this study aimed to investigate the impression of the abstracts and that they would be asked to score one randomly selected abstract numerically.

Thus, they were masked to the study hypothesis.

The remaining three had conclusions that emphasised the partial superiority of the intervention with respect to the control. They stated that the treatment was partially effective even though all the primary outcomes were non-significant. Together, they include different levels of overstatement from completely misleading to less informative (not mentioning non-significant primary outcome) conclusions. They were checked independently by two or more investigators (KS, AS and RS)</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Constructing abstracts with and without overstatements</title><p>We constructed abstracts in line with the following prespecified guidelines. First, we rewrote the conclusion to make a conclusion without overstatement following these rules.

We explicitly stated the primary outcomes and results (for example, OR, risk ratio, CI, P&#x000a0;value) from the text if they were not stated in the original abstract. Therefore, all abstracts had the information necessary for participants to understand the results of the primary outcomes from the method and results sections. This modification was necessary to keep the conclusion consistent with the other sections of the abstract. Without this step, the conclusion of an abstract without overstatement would be inconsistent with other sections of the same abstract because the conclusion of an abstract without overstatement would now be reconstructed based on the actual primary outcomes that were not mentioned in the original abstract. Additionally, this standardisation made it possible to estimate the influence of overstatement in the conclusion when the methods and results reported essential information.</p><p>Third, we changed the names of the intervention and control treatments to anonymous &#x02018;intervention A&#x02019; and &#x02018;control B&#x02019; to minimise bias. We added a few words for explanation when there was a medical term that seemed unfamiliar to primary care physicians (eg, VMS): hot flush, sweating and poor circulation). Finally, we translated the texts into Japanese. Except for the conclusion, abstracts &#x02018;with&#x02019; or &#x02018;without&#x02019; overstatement were identical.</p><p>We made established two pairs of investigators, and each pair did modification and translation of a half of the abstracts (&#x02018;with&#x02019; and &#x02018;without&#x02019; overstatement).

The model accounted for the correlation within abstracts by using an unstructured covariance matrix. We excluded the following subjects from our analysis before proceeding to the study analyses and therefore without knowledge of any outcomes: (1) those who were erroneously allocated by the web system although they did not satisfy the eligibility criteria and (2) those who were eligible and were randomised but did not complete the questionnaire or spent less than 30&#x02009;s on the questionnaire.

The 95% CI of the estimated effect (effect size by Cohen&#x02019;s d: 0.031, 95%&#x02009;CI &#x02212;0.13 to 0.20) rules out the existence of even a small effect. In the baseline questionnaire, 42% of participants answered that they read the conclusion section first when reading abstracts. However, more than 60% of them referred to the results section for their interpretation of the given abstract. They tended to judge the overstated conclusion as less valid than those without overstatement. These results suggested that primary care physicians who belonged to the JPCA with up-to-date knowledge of clinical trials were not misled by overstatements in abstract conclusions if the method and results section reported sufficient information. Our subgroup analysis showed that factors such as the workplace, types of information resources or experience of being a principal investigator would make little difference. These results suggest that the participants had good critical appraisal skills of research reports, which helped them to recognise the inconsistency between the result and the conclusion.</p><p>Our results differed in some respects from the previous study. Boutron and colleagues&#x02019; study<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> showed that the interpretation of abstracts was affected by spin. The &#x02018;abstracts with spin&#x02019; group considered the intervention more beneficial than the without spin group, and the &#x02018;with spin&#x02019; group was more interested in reading the full text. This was contrary to our main findings. On the other hand, the abstracts with spin group interpreted the abstract as less methodologically rigorous than the without spin group. This was consistent with our results.</p><p>However, we must consider some differences in design between Bourton <italic>et al&#x02019;</italic>s study and this study. First, the level of spin was much higher in their study than in this study. Boutron <italic>et al</italic> aimed to investigate the impact of spin in the abstract generally, so they removed all spin from the abstract and compared this &#x02018;perfect&#x02019; abstract with the original one. On the other hand, in our study, the difference between &#x02018;with&#x02019; and &#x02018;without&#x02019; groups was limited in the conclusion section because our aim was to estimate the influence of overstatement in the conclusion section. Thus, we added the information on the primary outcomes in the methods and results sections of both groups. Second, the baseline characteristics of the participants differed. While all the participants in the study of Boutron <italic>et al</italic> were experienced clinical researchers, we chose primary care physicians as our target. Although the participants in this study had little experience in clinical research, they were regular users of medical literature (90% of participants had read more than one abstract in the previous month). Most participants were eager to learn EBM and had some knowledge of critical appraisal. In addition, 60% referred to the results section when making clinical interpretation. Therefore, their study and ours are more complementary than contradictory.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p>Our strength is that this is the first and only RCT study that estimates the influence of overstatement in abstract conclusions. Authors of scientific articles like to use promising, positive words<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref>; nonetheless, we demonstrated that overstated conclusions did not affect the readers&#x02019; interpretations of the results if sufficient information was provided in other sections. Second, we evaluated the influence of overstatement in primary care physicians, who are among the major users of evidence. They encounter clinical queries in daily clinical practice and use evidence to make the best decisions for their patients. Therefore, it is important to clarify whether primary care physicians are susceptible to overstatement in abstract conclusions. The results showed that primary care physicians with up-to-date knowledge of trial/research information were not misled by an overstated conclusion.</p><p>There are some limitations. While the number of participants was above our targeted sample size, it may not have completely represented the JPCA members. The relatively low response rate of 11.1% (787/7040) limits the generalisability of our findings. Two things should be noted. First, we chose the JPCA as our recruiting pool because that the members were considered representative of active users of scientific evidence in their primary care practice. The JPCA is the only organisation that certifies clinicians as primary care physicians, and they regularly conduct workshop on EBM. However, those who responded to our invitation were potentially avid readers of scientific reports, which is the reason they volunteered for this assessment, and, therefore, they may have better critical appraisal skills for abstracts than other JPCA members. Actually, most of participants answered that they read abstracts regularly. This suggests that&#x000a0;they were not representative of all primary care physicians in Japan. Furthermore, the effect of overstatements in the abstracts that did not report the necessary information of primary outcomes or other various forms of inadequate reporting was not measured. In our study, we added essential information on primary outcomes in the methods and results sections as recommended by a CONSORT statement.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> More than 60% of the participants stated that they mainly refer to the results to evaluate the abstract. In contrast, only around 15% based their assessment on the conclusion. This means that adequate reporting of the results is necessary for interpretation of the abstract. Finally, we should not overgeneralise the association between the type or level of overstatement and its impact on interpretation. We chose five abstracts at different levels of overstatement as a sample, but the selection did not cover all levels of spin or all types of spin. Neither did we have sufficient sample size to explore such relationships. The influence of biased reporting on clinical decisions should be further researched.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggested that sensible and well-read clinicians are capable of discerning the inconsistency between results and conclusion and of making a sound judgement on the validity of misleading conclusions when primary outcomes are appropriately reported in the methods and results sections. However, this does not mean that overstatements can be overlooked. The conclusion sections of abstracts should be written solely based on the primary outcome results. The impact of inappropriate writing style in clinical settings should be further researched.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e246" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018355.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e247" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018355.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank those who participated in this study, A Igaki for organising and sending invitation e-mails, and S Kishimoto, for double checking translation of abstracts.
