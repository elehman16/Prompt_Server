Patients were screened for latent and active tuberculosis (see also online supplementary text). All DMARDs were discontinued &#x02265;4&#x02005;weeks before the first study agent administration.

Concomitant DMARD treatment, including MTX, was prohibited in all treatment groups (a 4-week washout period was required). At week 16, all patients in group 1 crossed over to receive golimumab 50&#x02005;mg in a double-blinded fashion.</p><p>The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with good clinical practice guidelines. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at each site. All patients provided written informed consent before any study-related procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study end points</title><p>Response to treatment was evaluated using the ACR criteria, the 28-joint count disease activity score (DAS28) using erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the ACR index of improvement in disease activity (ACR-N); physical function was evaluated with the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving &#x02265;20% improvement in ACR criteria (ACR20) at week 14. Due to ethical concerns about the potential for an inadequate response to placebo, week 14 was chosen for the primary efficacy assessment. Secondary end points included ACR50/70/90 response rates at weeks 14 and 24, changes from baseline at weeks 14 and 24 in DAS28 and HAQ-DI scores, ACR-N scores at weeks 14 and 24 and changes from baseline to week 24 in van der Heijde/Sharp (vdH&#x02013;S) scores.

All patients who received at least one study agent injection were included in the safety analysis. Patients who received one or more golimumab injection and had pharmacokinetic data available were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Descriptive statistics are reported. Differences between the treatment groups in ACR and DAS28 response rates were assessed using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Type I error at the 0.05 level of significance was preserved with a hierarchical approach to control for multiplicity, in which a comparison between groups 3 and 1 was performed first and a comparison between groups 2 and 1 was performed only if the difference between groups 3 and 1 was significant. For changes in continuous variables, treatment group differences were assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for HAQ-DI, DAS28 and vdH&#x02013;S scores or analysis of variance (ANOVA) for ACR-N scores. Least-squares means and 95% CIs are reported. ACR response rates, ACR-N and HAQ-DI were calculated using the last observation carried forward method for the week 14 and week 24 time points. In the analysis of DAS28 response at weeks 14 and 24, observed data were used with no imputation for missing data, with the exception of the DAS28 remission analysis, in which patients with missing data were counted as non-responders. Observed data were used in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</p><p>Changes from baseline in vdH&#x02013;S scores were compared between each golimumab group and placebo using two methods. ANCOVA was the prespecified method in the protocol and was chosen for consistency with the analyses of other continuous variables. A post hoc ANOVA based on van der Waerden normal scores was undertaken to account for the non-normal data distribution due to one patient in group 3 with an atypically large change in vdH&#x02013;S score. Additionally, a cumulative probability plot of the changes in vdH&#x02013;S scores from baseline to week 24 for each treatment group was constructed.</p><p>Assuming that 5% of patients would be excluded from the efficacy analysis owing to study discontinuation, the target total sample size of 300 patients provided &#x0003e;90% power to detect a difference between groups 2 and 3 and group 1 in ACR20 response rates at week 14 (&#x003b1;=0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient disposition and baseline characteristics</title><p>A total of 316 patients were randomised; eight withdrew consent before administration of any study agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201796F1">figure 1</xref>).

24 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012201796TB3">table 3</xref>). Infections were the most common AEs during this time period, consistent with results seen during the placebo-controlled period. AEs leading to discontinuation of the study agent after week 16 were ovarian neoplasm (non-malignant; n=1) and RA (n=1) in group 2 and breast cancer (n=1) in group 3. After week 16, SAEs occurred in three patients in group 2 (non-malignant ovarian neoplasm and dental pulpitis, each in one patient; paroxysmal tachycardia and RA in one patient) and in two patients in group 3 (breast cancer, between weeks 20 and 24 and organising pneumonia, one patient each); no SAEs were reported in group 1 during this period.</p><p>The incidence of injection-site reactions through week 16 was similar among all groups (group 1, 7/105 (6.7%); group 2, 8/101 (7.9%); group 3, 8/102 (7.8%)). From week 16 through week 24, the rates of injection-site reactions were 3.3% (3/92) in group 1, 6.3% (6/96) in group 2 and 5.0% (5/100) in group 3. All injection-site reactions were mild.</p><p>There were no reports of anaphylactic reactions, serum sickness-like reactions, or deaths through week 24. No cases of tuberculosis were reported through week 24; however, one case of atypical mycobacterial infection occurred in group 1 before week 16.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this phase 2/3 study of golimumab 50&#x02005;mg and 100&#x02005;mg in Japanese patients with active RA despite DMARD treatment, those treated with golimumab monotherapy had significant improvements from baseline to week 14 in clinical measures of efficacy, including ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates and DAS28 and ACR-N scores, in comparison with those who received placebo. Physical function was also significantly improved from baseline in the golimumab groups compared with placebo. These significant improvements were seen despite the overall study population displaying relatively mild disease at study outset (mean swollen/tender joint counts of 13/16). However, clinical response to golimumab monotherapy was relatively modest in comparison with golimumab+MTX treatment in another Japanese population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></p><p>Patients with active RA despite previous MTX treatment were evaluated previously in the large phase 3 GO-FORWARD trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> While concomitant MTX was included in GO-FORWARD golimumab 100&#x02005;mg monotherapy was also evaluated. ACR responses were also evaluated at week 14 in both trials and while significantly greater ACR response rates were achieved in group 3 in this study in comparison with placebo, the primary end point was not achieved in the golimumab 100&#x02005;mg monotherapy group in the GO-FORWARD trial. Possible explanations for the non-statistically significant response in the GO-FORWARD 100&#x02005;mg monotherapy group were previously described (eg, the relatively low disease activity in the trial population and the high response rate in the MTX monotherapy group).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> However, factors such as patient body weight, which is known to affect the pharmacokinetic properties of monoclonal antibodies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17 R18 R19">17&#x02013;19</xref> may also account for the difference in response seen in the two trials. While a previous study found no apparent differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of golimumab in healthy body-weight-matched Caucasian and Japanese male subjects,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> it is possible that the body weights of patients in 100&#x02005;mg monotherapy groups in this trial and in GO-FORWARD might have varied considerably<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> given that Japanese patients are generally more slight, and the resulting dose per unit mass would be higher than in other populations. Indeed, treatment effects on radiographic progression appear to be related to serum golimumab concentrations, as patients receiving golimumab 50&#x02005;mg+MTX in the GO-FORTH trial in Japanese patients with RA (week 16 median serum golimumab concentration=0.73&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/ml) demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than placebo-treated patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> while such a difference was not seen in this study, in which patients receiving golimumab 50&#x02005;mg had a week 16 median serum golimumab concentration of 0.46&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/ml.</p><p>Radiographic progression was evaluated at week 24, at which point patients randomised to group 1 had been receiving golimumab 50&#x02005;mg since week 16. The a priori ANCOVA did not show significant differences in radiographic progression between either groups 2 or 3 and group 1; however, in a post hoc analysis using normalised data, significantly smaller changes from baseline in erosion and total vdH&#x02013;S scores were seen in group 3 than in group 1. This significant difference was confirmed by an additional ANCOVA that excluded a single group 3 patient with an atypically large change in vdH&#x02013;S score (p=0.01; data not shown). Biological monotherapy with the anti-interleukin 6 agent tocilizumab has also demonstrated radiographic benefit in patients with RA with inadequate response to DMARD treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> In this study, the mean baseline CRP level, which is a good predictor of radiographic progression,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> was moderately raised and 22.1% of patients had a change in total vdH&#x02013;S that exceeded the smallest detectable change. In contrast, only 4.3% of patients in GO-FORWARD had such a change in total vdH&#x02013;S score.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> Thus, patients in our study probably had higher disease activity than patients in GO-FORWARD. This may account for the observation that radiographic progression in this study was greater than expected based on the clinical response seen at similar time points in earlier golimumab trials, including GO-FORWARD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> Our results suggest that golimumab 100&#x02005;mg monotherapy may prevent further joint damage in Japanese patients with active radiographic progression, which is consistent with the golimumab package insert approved by the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></p><p>Golimumab was generally well tolerated. Infections were the most common AEs. Serious infections were reported in two patients through week 16 and one patient between weeks 16 and 24; the week 24 incidences per 100 patient-years of follow-up indicated no increase in serious infection versus placebo. Most AEs were mild and few patients discontinued due to AEs. Rates of SAEs, serious infections and malignancies were low. No deaths and one malignancy (breast cancer) occurred through week 24. Of note, this study was not powered to detect rare events and these findings are limited also by the short-term nature of the analysis.</p><p>This was the first golimumab monotherapy study to demonstrate that Japanese patients with active RA despite prior DMARD treatment had significantly improved signs and symptoms of RA after 14&#x02005;weeks of treatment with 50 or 100&#x02005;mg golimumab in comparison with placebo. Group 3 had significantly less radiographic progression than group 1 when analysed post hoc using normalised scores, and median changes in total vdH&#x02013;S scores suggested a dose-dependent trend. Additional long-term analyses are needed to further explore the effect of golimumab monotherapy on joint destruction and fully assess its safety profile in Japanese patients with RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="loca-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media xlink:href="annrheumdis-2012-201796-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1511" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the patients, investigators and study personnel who made this trial possible.
