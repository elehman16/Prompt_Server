An estimated 300,000&#x02013;500,000 surgical site infections occur in the USA annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In Germany, approximately 60,000&#x02013;200,000 surgical site infections following surgical interventions are reported every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Despite the implementation of such preventive measures as preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and antiseptic skin cleansing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], surgical site infection rates in prospective trials using the standardized criteria of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) remain above 15&#x000a0;% after general abdominal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In patients undergoing colorectal surgery, surgical site infection rates as high as 20&#x000a0;% and up to 32&#x000a0;% are reported from randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. National data from the USA support these numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have shown an increase in the mean length of hospital stay by 6 to 24&#x000a0;days if surgical site infections occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The resulting direct costs have to be added to indirect costs such as loss of workforce or insurance payments resulting in substantial expenses for the health care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The most frequent pathogens causing postoperative surgical site infection in colorectal surgery are endogenous pathogens from the patient&#x02019;s gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A significant number of surgical site infections occur after postoperative day 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and it is was proposed that clearing contaminated secretions from the wound might reduce the incidence of surgical site infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Negative-pressure incision therapy (NPIT) devices were designed to remove fluids from the incisional wound in the early postoperative phase, to reduce tensile forces across the incision and to protect the incision from external contamination. While positive results have been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> and in animal models, the benefit of NPIT devices in clinical practice remains largely unclear.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Previous trials</title><p>Several previous trials have investigated the effect of NPIT in a variety of settings; however, all trials exhibit considerable risk of bias. Stannard <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] compared an NPIT system against standard dressings in a single-centre randomized controlled trial in patients with haematoma or fractures following high-energy trauma. In 44 patients with traumatic haematomas, the duration of wound drainage as well as the rate of surgical site infection was reduced using the NPIT system (surgical site infection rates were reduced by 50&#x000a0;% from 16&#x000a0;% to 8&#x000a0;%). The same authors reported a randomized single-centre study in 117 patients with open traumatic fractures randomized to irrigation and debridement followed by standard fine mesh gauze dressing compared with the same procedure followed by NPIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The authors reported significantly less infections in the NPIT group (7 versus 2; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.024).</p><p>Gomoll <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] reported a case series of 35 patients treated with an NPIT system following foot and ankle trauma and found no surgical site infection in NPIT-treated patients. Similarly, Reddix <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] found no surgical site infections in a case series of 19 morbidly obese patients undergoing acetabular fracture repair followed by NPIT therapy. In a second retrospective series by the same authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], 66 patients undergoing acetabular repair followed by standard dressings were compared with 235 patients with acetabular repair followed by NPIT therapy. While the control group exhibited 6.1&#x000a0;% deep wound infections, only 1.3&#x000a0;% in the NPIT group showed deep wound infections.</p><p>Atkins <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and Colli <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] reported a case series with a total of 67 patients using an NPIT system following cardiac surgery on sternal wounds. NPIT therapy was well tolerated and might have prevented surgical site infections in these cases.</p><p>Matatov <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] used an NPIT system on groin wounds following vascular surgery. While surgical site infections were observed in 30&#x000a0;% of patients in the control group, only 6&#x000a0;% of wounds were infected in the NPIT group. Similar results were reported in a small single-centre trial with 50 patients (25 per group) undergoing colorectal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In this population, NPIT reduced infectious wound complications from 11 cases to 2 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008).</p><p>A recent Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] evaluated NPIT therapy for skin grafts and surgical wound healing by primary intention in regard to the proportion of surgical wounds that healed completely. The review concluded that very limited evidence exists to evaluate NPIT and concluded that high-quality trials in this field are urgently needed.</p><p>Current data show that NPIT therapy can be used with few adverse events on different types of wound; however, a multicentre, high-quality randomized controlled trial evaluating NPIT therapy in abdominal surgery has not yet been performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objective</title><p>The Poniy trial aims to investigate whether the application of an NPIT device (Prevena Incision Management System, KCI, Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA) reduces the rate of surgical site infections within 30&#x000a0;days postoperatively, in surgical patients who underwent elective open colorectal surgery, by 50&#x000a0;% (from 25&#x000a0;% to 12.5&#x000a0;%). This rate of reduction is assumed based on previous studies with the NPIT device, all of which showed a reduction of at least 50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

The centres include university hospitals and community hospitals, some of which are certified centres for colorectal surgery (Darmkrebszentrum, German Cancer Society, DKG). All centres are members of the Trial Network (CHIR-Net) of the German Surgical Society. Physicians or nurses involved in the trial have been trained in ICH-GCP prior to initiation of the trial. Informed consent will be obtained from each patient. Furthermore, all centres and participants were specifically instructed in study-specific procedures before the start of the trial. The centres will be supported by an ICH-GCP qualified flying study nurse from the CHIR-Net Surgical Regional Centre in Munich to ensure protocol conforming data acquisition and trial interventions. Stratification will be performed according to centre.</p><p>The duration of the recruitment phase is expected to be 14&#x000a0;months. The last follow-up will be performed a maximum of 30&#x000a0;days after the last patient undergoes the trial intervention. Hence, the total duration of the trial (first patient in to last patient out) is expected to be 15&#x000a0;months. The study flow is outlined in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of the Poniy trial.

The envelopes contain data sheets with information regarding the group allocation and the randomization number. Both are prefabricated by a biostatistician of the <italic>Technische Universit&#x000e4;t M&#x000fc;nchen</italic> (Munich, Germany). Randomization (visit 2, see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) will be performed in the operation theatre at the end of surgery, after closure of the skin. This prevents potential bias by different methods of wound closure or wound irrigation. An interrupted skin closure must be performed with either sutures or staplers, according to local practice.</p><p>Randomization will be stratified by centre. To assure balanced group sizes, a block-wise randomization will be applied. Basic characteristics of the patient and day of randomization must be documented on the randomization sheets. Subsequently, randomization sheets must be dated, signed and stored away from the patient records and the trial documents, as well as the investigator site file, to ensure blinding. Patients, outcome assessors and the trial statistician will be blinded for the trial intervention. The outcome assessor (postoperative surgical site infection) will therefore neither be part of the surgical team that performs the trial intervention nor take part in the postoperative care of the patient and will have no access to the randomization sheets. Blinding of patients is not feasible, as the NPIT wound dressing system is different from the standard sterile dressing. However, the primary endpoint measure (whether or not there is surgical site infection according to the CDC definition, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) cannot be influenced by the subjective assessment of the patient.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Definitions of abdominal surgical site infections classified according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Superficial incisional surgical site infections</th><th>Deep incisional surgical site infections<sup>a</sup>

These numbers have changed little over the last 20&#x000a0;years despite internationally accepted recommendations for control of surgical site infections (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]). In prospective trials with clear definitions, surgical site infection rates above 15&#x000a0;% have frequently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and are especially high in colorectal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Applying standard definitions for surgical site infections is crucial, as a number of surgical site infections occur after discharge of patients from the hospital and would thus remain unnoticed if standardized wound evaluation, as well as adequate follow-up, were not applied. Unfortunately, numerous different surgical site infection definitions have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], albeit the surgical site infections definition of the CDC has gained wide acceptance over past decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. According to this definition, surgical site infections are grouped into superficial, deep and organ-space surgical site infections that occur within 30&#x000a0;days of the operation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>The most frequent pathogens causing postoperative surgical site infections in general surgical patients are <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species. Similarly, in abdominal surgical patients, <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species, <italic>Enterobacter</italic> species and <italic>S. aureus</italic> are the most frequently pathogens isolated from wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These data indicate that endogenous contaminations from the patients&#x02019; skin or the gastrointestinal tract occurring during surgery account for most surgical site infections. Therefore, a considerable number of surgical site infections might be prevented by draining contaminated wound secretions from the incisional site during the early postoperative period. Negative-pressure incision therapy devices (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) have been designed to drain wound secretions from the postoperative wound. The feasibility and safety of NPIT devices has been demonstrated in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], but their efficacy has not yet been tested in multicentre randomized controlled trials. However, previous studies were single-centre trials, lacked clear surgical site infection definitions and endpoint measures, or included only few patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, no data exists on the efficacy of NPIT devices in abdominal surgery.</p><p>The Poniy trial was designed to test the efficacy of NPIT in comparison with standard sterile dressings in a group at high risk of surgical site infection, i.e., patients undergoing open colorectal surgery. In similar patient cohorts, surgical site infection rates in randomized controlled trials using the CDC definition have consistently been reported as above 20&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Since further single-centre studies would not increase the external validity (generalizability), a multicentre approach was chosen and the trial was initiated within the Trial Network of the German Surgical Society (CHIR-Net). To further increase external validity, broad inclusion criteria and only a few exclusion criteria will be applied, allowing for the screening and recruitment of a large number of elective colorectal surgical cases in participating hospitals. Hospitals of different care levels will participate in this trial together, underlining the pragmatic approach of the trial. For many participating surgical departments, surgical site infections represent the most frequent postoperative complication and thus a pressing surgical problem that remains to be solved. To ensure data quality, members of all participating centres are trained in GCP guidelines, trial intervention, documentation and blinding. In addition, internal validity is ensured by patient- and observer-blinding, application of definite endpoint measures (surgical site infection definition by the CDC) and complete outcome reporting and follow-up for 30&#x000a0;days. Applying high methodological standards, the results of the trial should help to improve surgical treatment of patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Trial status</title><p>Planned recruitment will start on 1 October 2015.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p>US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CE</term><def><p>Conformit&#x000e9; Europ&#x000e9;enne</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHIR-Net</term><def><p>Trial Network of the German Surgical Society</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>Good Clinical Practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICH</term><def><p>International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NPIT</term><def><p>negative-pressure incision therapy</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>ALM, RS, TCM, VK, HF and JK participated in the trial design.
