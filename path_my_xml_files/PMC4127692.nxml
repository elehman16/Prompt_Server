Endodontic therapy can play a vital role in achieving this goal. Occasionally mishaps occur during endodontic treatment. One of them is perforation of root canal wall, which can significantly impact the long-term prognosis of the tooth. Furcation perforation refers to a mid-curvature opening into the periodontal ligament space and is the worst possible outcome in root canal treatment.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It has been reported that perforations were the second greatest cause of failure.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] To prevent bacterial contamination, perforations should be repaired as quickly as possible with a biocompatible material.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] An ideal perforation repair material should provide an adequate seal, be biocompatible, not affected by blood contamination, not be extruded during condensation, bactericidal, induce bone formation and healing, radiopaque, induce mineralization, cementogenesis and easy in manipulation and placement.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Several materials have been proposed for sealing of perforations. These materials include Zinc-oxide Eugenol cement (Intermediate Restorative Material, Super- Ortho Ethoxy Benzoic Acid), Glass ionomer cement, Resin cements, Resin &#x02013; modified Glass ionomer cement and Mineral Trioxide Aggregate. However, the divergent outcomes have demonstrated that so far no material has satisfied all the ideal requirements.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Today, most preferred furcation repair materials are bioactive materials like Mineral Trioxide Aggregate, Biodentine.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Recently, Endosequence root repair material have been developed as ready to use, premixed bioceramic material recommended for perforation repair, apical surgery, apical plug, and pulp capping.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Thus, the present study is designed to evaluate the sealing ability of MICRO-MEGA Mineral Trioxide Aggregate, Endosequence, and Biodentine in repair of furcation perforations using dye extraction method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty extracted human mandibular molars with non-fused and well developed roots were used in this study. Cracked teeth were discarded. After extracting, the teeth were kept in 5% sodium hypochlorite for 30 minutes. They were then cleaned from any debris and washed under tap water and kept in normal saline until next step. Molars were amputated 3 mm below the furcation area using a tapered diamond stone. A standardized access cavity was prepared in every molar with a round bur #2, and the root canal orifices were located.</p><p>Sticky wax was placed over the orifices of each canal and the sectioned root surface including pulpal floor. It was then coated with two successive layers of varnish in an attempt to increase the marginal seal. To ensure each perforation was centered between the roots, a black marker pen was used to mark the location of the defect. Artificial perforation of 1 mm in diameter was created from the external surface of the tooth with a #2 round carbide bur mounted on a high-speed hand piece with air water coolant [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>]. The chamber and perforation were flushed with water and dried.</p><p>Then, the teeth were randomly divided into four groups.</p><p>Group I: Ten molars, in which perforations were left unsealed (Positive control).</p><p>Group II: Ten molars, in which perforations were repaired with MICRO-MEGA Mineral Trioxide Aggregate.</p><p>Group III: Ten molars, in which perforations were repaired with Endosequence.</p><p>Group IV: Ten molars, in which perforations were repaired with Biodentine [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>1a: Pulpal floor view of perforation 1b: View of perforation from external surface 1c: Placement of samples in petri dishes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-17-340-g001"/></fig><p>Each group was placed in separate petri dishes containing 2% methylene blue such that all the teeth were immersed in dye up to the CEJ for retrograde dye challenge, and dye was added to access chamber of each teeth so that it was filled for orthograde dye challenge [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>]. All samples were stored for 48 hrs. After removal from the dye, teeth were rinsed under running water for 40 minutes and varnish was removed with a polishing disc.</p><p>The teeth were placed in vials containing 1 ml of concentrated (65 wt %) nitric acid until complete dissolution. Vials were centrifuged at 9000 rpm for seven minutes. Two hundred &#x003bc;l of the supernatant from each sample was then analyzed in a UV-visible spectrophotometer at 545 nm wavelength using concentrated nitric acid as the blank, and readings were recorded as absorbance units. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison test [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] were done using the Statistical Package SPSS (Statistical package for social science, version 4)</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Mean values of four different experimental groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-17-340-g002"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean absorbance values of experimental groups and controls in the current study showed that the positive control samples (Group I) in which perforations were left unrepaired had the highest dye absorbance (0.87 &#x000b1; 0.09487) of all groups denoting the accuracy of the technique. This was followed by Biodentine (Group IV), which had dye absorbance values (0.49 &#x000b1; 0.07379) significantly higher than MM-MTA (Group II) and Endosequence (Group III) showed lower dye absorbance than remaining groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The perforations irrespective of location or etiology may interfere with the prognosis of endodontic treatment. This iatrogenic or mechanical or pathological communication between root canal system and external tooth surface should be sealed with a biocompatible materials as soon as possible.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The present study evaluated the sealing ability of MICRO-MEGA Mineral Trioxide Aggregate, Endosequence, and Biodentine as furcation repair materials in mandibular molars using a dye extraction leakage method.</p><p>Dye penetration technique has long been used in endodontics because of its ease of performance and difficulty of other available techniques. Dye extraction methodology was employed in this study, which according to Camps J and Pashley gave similar results to the fluid &#x02013; filtration technique as both are based on quantitative measurements of liquid passage within interfaces.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In this study, an ultraviolet spectrophotometry was adopted since it is widely used technique because of its rapid analysis and the cost of the analysis is less expensive. Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry refers to absorption spectroscopy or reflectance spectroscopy in the ultraviolet-visible spectral region. This means, it uses light in the visible and adjacent (near-UV and near- infrared) ranges. The absorption or reflectance in the visible range directly affects the perceived color of the chemicals involved.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Mineral Trioxide Aggregate was actually introduced as a root-end filling material; however, because of its biocompatibility, it is now also considered as a material of choice to seal perforations.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate has certain drawbacks such as difficulty in handling and very slow setting reaction, which might contribute to leakage, surface disintegration, loss of marginal adaptation, and continuity of the material.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In order to overcome these difficulties, MICRO-MEGA introduced endodontic repair cement MICRO-MEGA Mineral Trioxide Aggregate. It is a modified Portland cement with added calcium carbonate, which allows the reduction of the setting time.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Biodentine is a calcium silicate-based material that has polycarboxylate-based hydro-soluble polymer system described as water-reducing agent to reduce the overall water content of the mix, along with CaCl<sub>2</sub> as a setting accelerator.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Biodentine bonds chemo-mechanically with the tooth and composite. This has high compressive and flexural strength.</p><p>Endosequence is a bioceramic material composed of calcium silicates, zirconium oxide, tantalum oxide, calcium phosphate monobasic thickening agents, and proprietary fillers.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Endosequence has been manufactured to overcome some of the difficult handling characteristics of Mineral Trioxide Aggregate.</p><p>The manufacturers of Endosequence material claim that premixed Endosequence putty has a working time of approximately 30+ minutes, a setting reaction initiated by moisture and a final set achieved approximately four hours later with the calcium silicate portion of the material produces a calcium silicate hydrate gel and calcium hydroxide. The calcium hydroxide then interacts with phosphate ions to form hydroxyapatite and water. The water produced continues to react with the calcium silicates to precipitate additional gel like calcium silicate hydrate. According to the developers of the Endosequence, the water supplied through this reaction is an important factor in controlling the hydration rate and the setting time of this material.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Shokouhinejad N <italic>et al</italic>. tested the bioactivity of Endosequence by exposing the set material on phosphate-buffered saline. There was precipitation of apatite crystalline structures, which is indicative of its bioactivity. Endosequence has been shown to have negligible cytotoxicity and capability to induce cytokine expression.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In the current study, control group showed high dye absorbance and Endosequence showed less dye absorbance. A significant difference with this material is its particle size, which allows the premixed material to penetrate into the dentinal tubules and bond to adjacent dentin.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] According to Ghattas SM <italic>et al</italic>., EndoSequence&#x02122; Root Repair material showed sealing ability similar to white mineral trioxide when used as a root-end filling material.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In the current study, another root repair material used is MM-MTA&#x02122; (Micro-Mega<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) an endodontic repair cement, developed in order to overcome handling properties of Mineral Trioxide Aggregate.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It is a modified Portland cement with added calcium carbonate (CaCO3). MICRO-MEGA Mineral Trioxide Aggregate is delivered in MM-MTA caps. It is biocompatible, radiopaque material with properties like faster setting time, homogenous pasty consistency for easy handling and placement. In this study, MICRO-MEGA Mineral Trioxide Aggregate showed less dye absorbance followed by Endosequence but statistically no significant difference when compared with Biodentine. Based on the results of this study, Biodentine showed high dye absorbance than Endosequence and MICRO-MEGA Mineral Trioxide Aggregate. According to Golberg <italic>et al</italic>., mechanical strength of Biodentine is time-dependent; at least two weeks are necessary to reach a final setting stage. Even after the initial setting, this material continues to improve in terms of internal structure towards a more dense material with a decrease in porosity.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, it was observed that Endosequence showed better sealing
