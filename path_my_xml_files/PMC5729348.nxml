In the exercise trial, participants completed 60&#x02009;min treadmill exercise (59 (4)% peak oxygen uptake) at 0&#x02013;1&#x02009;h and rested thereafter while participants rested throughout the control trial. Appetite ratings and concentrations of acylated ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) were measured at predetermined intervals.

Evidence suggests that acute moderate- to high-intensity exercise transiently suppresses appetite in healthy, lean individuals, which occurs with commensurate fluctuations in appetite-regulatory hormones, including acylated ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> These responses are transient, typically returning to resting control values in the hours after exercise and do not influence energy intake at meals on the day of exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> This lack of compensatory response highlights the ability of exercise to induce a short-term energy deficit and modulate weight control.</p><p>Considering obesity is characterised by a chronic surplus of energy intake above expenditure, it is conceivable that appetite responses to exercise may differ between lean and overweight/obese individuals. Previous non-exercise studies have demonstrated that postprandial increases in circulating satiety hormones (PYY and GLP-1) are blunted in obese compared with lean individuals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> and obese individuals exhibit lower fasting concentrations and reduced postprandial suppression of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Despite these divergent responses, few studies have investigated the acute effects of exercise on appetite regulation in overweight/obese compared with lean individuals.</p><p>Current evidence suggests that acute exercise does not stimulate any immediate compensatory changes in appetite, energy intake or appetite-regulatory hormones in overweight or obese individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> A direct comparison of lean and overweight/obese individuals identified a similar transient elevation in total PYY and GLP-1<sub>7&#x02013;36</sub> concentrations up to 1&#x02009;h after exercise in both groups that occurred without simultaneous changes in acylated ghrelin or appetite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake in the immediate postexercise period appears unaffected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> or reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> in lean and overweight/obese individuals. However, additional research is required to understand and compare the appetite regulation of lean and overweight/obese individuals in response to acute exercise, including examination of responses beyond the immediate postexercise period (&#x0003e;1&#x02009;h). This information is important for elucidating the impact of exercise on appetite regulation in a clinically relevant population.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the appetite, <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake and appetite-regulatory hormone responses during and for 7&#x02009;h after an acute bout of moderate-intensity exercise in healthy lean and overweight/obese individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study received approval from the NHS East Midlands Research Ethics Committee (13/EM/0290) prior to its initiation and was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup></p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Sixty participants provided written informed consent to participate in this study.

In the 48&#x02009;h before trials, participants standardised their diets using a weighed food diary and did not consume any alcohol or caffeinated drinks. Participants also refrained from strenuous physical activity and consumed a prescribed meal on the evening before each main trial. The meal, consisting of pasta, tomato sauce and chocolate biscuits, provided 3138&#x02009;kJ for males and 2820&#x02009;kJ for females (71% carbohydrate, 11% protein, 18% fat).

There was remarkably little difference in appetite, <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake and appetite-regulatory hormone concentrations between lean and overweight/obese individuals. Subtle differences in appetite hormone responses to exercise were, however, detected between the groups, with overweight/obese individuals experiencing a greater exercise-induced suppression in desacylated ghrelin and elevation in total GLP-1, whereas lean individuals experienced a greater increase in total PYY after exercise. These findings refute the hypothesis that overweight/obese individuals exhibit greater compensatory changes in subjective and homeostatic mediators of appetite in response to acute exercise-induced energy deficits.</p><p>To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, only two previous studies have directly compared appetite-regulatory hormone responses to acute exercise between lean and overweight/obese individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> In line with the findings of Ueda <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> appetite-regulatory hormone profiles were largely similar between the groups in this study with the exception of the anticipated greater meal-induced perturbations in insulin concentrations in overweight/obese individuals. This contrasts the findings of Marzullo <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> who observed lower fasting concentrations of total and acylated ghrelin in obese compared with lean individuals. Furthermore, previous non-exercise studies have demonstrated that obese individuals exhibit a diminished meal-induced increase in PYY and GLP-1 concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> and reduced postprandial suppression of acylated ghrelin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> compared with healthy, lean individuals. This inconsistency in findings is most likely explained by differences in the range of BMI values adopted to distinguish adiposity status coupled with key variations in study design. Specifically, appetite-regulatory hormone concentrations are influenced by factors such as diet standardisation, meal energy content and/or macronutrient composition, sample processing and the form of circulating gut peptide quantified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup></p><p>Despite the comparable appetite-regulatory hormone concentrations between groups, subtle differences in the magnitude of change in the hormone profiles after exercise emerged and represent a novel finding from this study. Specifically, the exercise-induced suppression of circulating desacylated ghrelin and elevation in total GLP-1 were greater in overweight/obese individuals, whereas lean individuals experienced a greater increase in total PYY after exercise. This contrasts previous findings suggesting that acute exercise elicits a similar increase in total PYY and GLP-1<sub>7&#x02013;36</sub> in lean and overweight/obese men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> However, it is possible that the short follow-up after exercise in the study by Ueda <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> (1 vs 7&#x02009;h in this study) precluded any between-group differences in the response of these appetite-regulatory hormones to exercise becoming apparent.</p><p>A potential explanation for the divergent appetite hormone response to exercise between groups in this study may reflect differences in body composition and insulin resistance. Along with regulating glucose metabolism, insulin acts as a chronic mediator of energy homeostasis and has also been implicated in short-term appetite regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> The lower insulin concentrations after exercise in the absence of a change in circulating glucose points to an acute improvement in insulin sensitivity in both lean and overweight/obese individuals, which represents a well-established effect of acute exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Insulin resistance increases with adiposity and has been associated previously with disrupted postprandial satiety signalling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> lower acylated ghrelin concentrations independent of weight status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> and impaired meal-induced incretin hormone secretion (for example, GLP-1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> GLP-1 exerts anorexigenic effects via central appetite-regulating pathways and augments the insulin response to nutrient intake to regulate postprandial glucose excursions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> Therefore, the greater exercise-induced elevation in total GLP-1 in overweight/obese individuals may point to enhanced postprandial satiety signalling and nutrient sensing in these individuals. However, PYY is co-secreted with GLP-1 from the intestinal L-cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> yet circulating total PYY concentrations were increased to a greater extent after exercise in lean individuals. Furthermore, no meaningful associations emerged between exercise-induced changes in appetite, energy intake or appetite-regulatory hormones that may explain these differences. Consequently, the implications of these findings remain unclear and further work is required to ascertain whether appetite hormone responses to exercise differ according to adiposity status.</p><p>Consistent with previous research, there was a marked suppression of appetite during and immediately after exercise that coincided with elevated total PYY and GLP-1 concentrations in the hours after exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> These outcomes occurred with a concomitant exercise-induced suppression in desacylated, but not in acylated, ghrelin concentrations.

Furthermore, direct comparisons of lean and overweight/obese individuals have reported that energy intake in the immediate postexercise period (&#x02a7d;1&#x02009;h postexercise) is unchanged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> or reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> in both groups. Collectively, these findings suggest that exercise can induce a short-term energy deficit in lean and overweight/obese individuals.

Although similar to previous study designs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> this pattern of meal provision may influence energy intake through non-homeostatic drivers of appetite. Additionally, participants were not familiarised with the <italic>ad libitum</italic> buffet meal before the experimental trials. The provision of a wide selection of foods may promote overconsumption and reduce the ability to identify exercise-induced changes in energy/macronutrient intakes. A further limitation concerns the use of BMI to define weight status, which does not account for differences in fat and fat-free mass,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> and combining the data for overweight and obese individuals may reduce the ability to detect between-group differences. However, further statistical analyses stratifying weight status according to waist circumference or body fat percentage and comparing distinct groups using the bottom and top tertiles of BMI, waist circumference and body fat percentage revealed comparable findings to those presented for the lean and overweight/obese individuals defined using BMI cut points. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, our findings provide important insights into appetite responses to acute exercise in lean and overweight/obese individuals.</p><p>In conclusion, a single session of moderate-intensity exercise transiently suppressed appetite and increased total PYY and GLP-1 concentrations after exercise in lean and overweight/obese individuals. Furthermore, exercise did not provoke any compensatory perturbations in energy intake or subjective and hormonal appetite regulation in either group, thereby maintaining the exercise-induced energy deficit on the day of exercise. These findings support the promotion of exercise as a method for inducing a short-term negative energy balance in lean and overweight/obese individuals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Professor Rachel Batterham for assistance with study design.
