As the polymerization process starts, most of the monomer is converted into polymer and the final bulk of the composite shrinks approximately two-to-three percent in terms of volume.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] On account of the polymerization shrinkage, stresses are generated within the restoration and at the margins, and if these stresses exceed the bond strength gap formation, microleakage may occur at the tooth restoration interface,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] which may cause ingress of cariogenic bacteria, postoperative sensitivity, and secondary caries, subsequently leading to a replacement of the restoration or even endodontic therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>There are several methods that may be advocated to reduce polymerization shrinkage, which is an area of continuous research. In recent times, several attempts to reduce shrinkage by changing the nature of the resin have demonstrated that bicyclic compounds cured by ring opening polymerization tend to shrink less as they harden.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The earliest attempts at this were made by Bowen. Similarly spiro-orthocarbonates were developed, which underwent ring opening and produced an expansion of about 3.5%, which could offset shrinkage. However, they exhibited incomplete ring opening and minimal copolymerization, which resulted in a minimal reduction of shrinkage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Of late, 3M ESPE has introduced a newer monomer, which, when activated, undergoes a cationic ring opening. This monomer, &#x02018;Silorane,&#x02019; is made up of &#x02018;siloxane&#x02019;and &#x02018;oxiranes,&#x02019; and these materials are claimed to have less then 1% volumetric shrinkage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] In addition to the improved marginal integrity at both the enamel and dentin interfaces, the inventors have claimed improved biocompatibility and increased hydrophobicity when compared to methacrylates, as also a decreased mutagenic potential of Silorane when compared to Oxiranes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>The aim of our study was to compare the microleakage scores obtained by the new silorane material compared to the hybrid composites, while using different etching and bonding protocols. We tested the hypothesis that a decrease in polymerization shrinkage of a Silorane composite would lead to lower microleakage scores at the tooth restoration interface.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sixty-three teeth were divided into groups, with a total of 21 teeth in each group; however, due to procedural error 20 teeth were included in group A, 20 in Group B, and 15 in Group C.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sampling technique</title><p>Random selection: The teeth, after being selected with respect to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, were randomly distributed into three boxes , labeled A, B, and C.

Teeth with previous cervical restorations or visible cracks were to be excluded, but we did not come across any teeth falling into that category. The teeth were scrubbed and soaked in hypochlorite for disinfection and then stored in distilled water to prevent dehydration.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Cavity preparation</title><p>Standardized Class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surface of each tooth at the cementoenamel junction using a tapered fissure carbide burr (FG 700,SS White) in a high speed handpiece, with an air/water spray. The preparation was 4 mm in length, 3 mm wide mesiodistally, and 2 mm deep, with an occlusal margin in enamel and a gingival margin in dentin. The same operator (principal investigator) performed all the cavity preparations and restorations to eliminate interoperator variability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Groups in study</title><p>After cavity preparations, the teeth in each group were assigned numbers and were randomly assigned into three treatment Groups (A, B, and C). Group A received the total-etch protocol and was restored with composite resin. Group B received the self-etch protocol and was restored with composite resin. Group C received the self-etch protocol and was restored with the Silorane composite.

All the restorations were then finished with a graded series of aluminum oxide disks (Sof-Lex TM, 3M ESPE). After restoration, the teeth were sectioned into dental blocks from the crowns of the buccal surface of the tooth, with approximate dimensions of 5 &#x000d7; 5 &#x000d7; 6 mm3, using a slow speed diamond disk (Diamond disk, Microdont).</p><p>All the teeth were thermocycled (Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient). The cycles were set at 200 cycles, between 5 and 55&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C, with a dwell time of 60 seconds at each temperature. All the specimens were then sealed with a coating of nail polish (Etude,Shade: coffe brown), except margins of 1 mm around the restorations. and immersed in 2% methylene blue dye for 24 hours. The teeth were then washed under running water and dried.</p><p>The teeth were mounted on a stone cast in such an orientation that the occlusal surface was visible outside the plaster. The teeth in the mounted cast were sectioned longitudinally in a buccolingual direction through the center of the restoration with a slow speed diamond disk (Diamond disk, Microdont). The cut surfaces were then examined under a dissection microscope (Inverted Microscope)(OLYMPUS SZ&#x000d7;12)at 40 X magnification. The dye penetration in the specimens was evaluated for both the occlusal and gingival surfaces, based on the graded scoring system given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

It was relatively easy to restore and therefore minimized interoperator variability. It had both enamel and dentinal margins and did not offer any inherent macro-mechanical retention.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>The samples were subjected to thermocycling in order to replicate the intraoral environment, because there was a difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion of the restoration and the tooth interface. The resulting mismatch in its value was said to cause fatigue of the bond between the restoration and the tooth, leading to a gap formation, which could lead to microleakage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>The two main established methods that are usually used to study marginal gaps are either dye penetration or scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In dye penetration testing, which is one of the main methods of assessing microleakage, the sample is subjected to a dye marker such as methylene blue, basic fuchsin silver nitrate, and rarely india ink; however, concerns have been raised, especially in the case of dye penetration, as there is lack of evidence supporting any correlation between clinical testing and <italic>in vitro</italic> dye penetration testing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Similarly, SEM requires that the sample be subjected to extensive chemical preparations before the scanning process and this may lead to alteration or even destruction of the interfacial zones, and even underestimation of the actual thickness of the hybrid layer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>As the Silorane-based composites are highly hydrophobic, they are not compatible with the conventional adhesive systems, and require a separate primer and bond. The primer is hydrophilic and the bond consists of a hydrophobic bi-functional monomer, to make it compatible with the hydrophobic silorane. As the primer consists of an etching monomer, which is usually cured before the application of the bond, it may be considered and therefore compared with other one-step adhesive systems. This is the reason we have used a one-step, self-etch adhesive as the control, as well as used the total-etch approach, to make our groups more comparable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>In our study we found that the total-etch and conventional composite groups had less microleakage scores as compared to the self-etch protocol that we used in both the Silorane-based as well as hybrid composites. This could be explained by the hydrophilic nature of the self-etching adhesives,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] as our samples were subjected to a 24-hour dye penetration challenge. It was hypothesized that this extended dye penetration would have led to increased water as well as dye absorption, resulting in a stained adhesive layer, compared to etching and rinsing with a less hydrophilic adhesive. This could have led to more false negative results in our case, as the stained layer could have been interpreted as gaps causing the microleakage.</p><p>To counter this potential challenge it has been recommended that either an adhesive with the same hydrophilicity be compared when performing dye penetration or the dye penetration time be reduced. This short penetration time will decrease the potential of the dye staining the hydrophilic adhesive.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Another possible explanation could be that as the Silorane primer is cured before the application of the bond an oxygen inhibition layer is formed between the primer and the bond interface and is seen in the Micro-Raman Spectroscopy as a zone of circa 1 um. This zone may also be a potential weakness in the bonding of Silorane and warrants further studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>A study was conducted to compare the Silorane restorative system with the self-etch adhesive in combination with a hybrid composite, and they found poor marginal integrity of the Silorane-based composite in both the enamel and dentinal margins; similar results are seen in our study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>However, Bagis YH , Baltacioglu IH, and Kahvagullaris S[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] compared the effect of different layering methods and different composite materials (nano-hybrid composites and Silorane-based micro-hybrid composites) on the extracted third molars, using the MOD (mesio-occluso-distal) cavity design. The authors did not observe any microleakage. The results were contradictory to our observations in which we observed significant microleakage in our Silorane-based group. These results could be explained by the <italic>in vitro</italic> study done on maxillary premolars in which the authors tested both cuspal deflection and microleakage on the low-shrink dental composites. The authors concluded that the significant decrease in microleakage observed in the Silorane-based composite was due to the decrease in cuspal deflection, which usually occurred in teeth that had weakened due to extensive MOD cavities, due to polymerization shrinkage stress at the tooth restoration interface. However, as the Class V cavities had not weakened and there was no deflection of the cavity walls, the reduced amount of polymerization of Silorane might have been very modest if there had been any effect in such cavities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Similarly a randomized clinical trial was carried out, to study the marginal adaptation of Silorane compared to a methacrylate-based composite. The authors did not find any significant difference between the two materials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>To our knowledge, literature is lacking in secondary studies such as systematic reviews, when it comes to low shrink composites, and warrants that one must be done.</p><p>No studies known to us have evaluated microleakage using the dye penetration method when studying Silorane composites, as most of the research is targeted at evaluating marginal adaptation. This research will add to the body of knowledge that is already present on Silorane composites. This research also questions the benefit of materials with low volumetric polymerization shrinkage, which should not be considered as the only parameter for decreasing stress, and other factors such as modulus of elasticity must also be kept in mind.</p><p>In summary, the results of our study do not indicate that Silorane-based composites are better than the conventional composites in terms of microleakage. We have also found poor sealing ability at the dentin or cementum margins compared to the enamel margins, in all the groups; a finding which is in accordance with other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The total-etch group has performed better than the self-etch groups in both the enamel and dentin / cementum margins, which is also seen in other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Strengths</title><p>The study questions and addresses a very important topic, relevant to everyday practice, as it relates to the longevity of a restoration.
