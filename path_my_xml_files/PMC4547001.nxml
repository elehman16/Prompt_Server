The present study aimed to analyze the effects of a computer-based program for training the spatial-simultaneous component of WM in terms of: specific effects (on spatial-simultaneous WM tasks); near and far transfer effects (on spatial-sequential and visuospatial abilities, and everyday memory tasks); and maintenance effects (1 month after the training). A comparison was drawn between the results obtained when the training was led by parents at home as opposed to an expert in psychology. Thirty-nine children and adolescents with DS were allocated to one of two groups: the training was administered by an expert in one, and by appropriately instructed parents in the other. The training was administered individually twice a week for a month, in eight sessions lasting approximately 30 min each. Our participants&#x02019; performance improved after the training, and these results were maintained a month later in both groups. Overall, our findings suggest that spatial-simultaneous WM performance can be improved, obtaining specific and transfer gains; above all, it seems that, with adequate support, parents could effectively administer a WM training to their child.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Down syndrome</kwd><kwd>visuospatial working memory</kwd><kwd>computer-based training</kwd><kwd>intellectual disability</kwd><kwd>memory improvement</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="38"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common cause of intellectual disability of genetic origin, affecting about 1 in 700&#x02013;1000 live births (e.g., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">McGrowther and Marshall, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Sherman et al., 2007</xref>). The vast majority of individuals with DS have some degree of intellectual impairment. Despite a marked variability in terms of the severity of specific impairments (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dykens et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Silverman, 2007</xref>), individuals with DS essentially have a profile featuring particular strengths and weaknesses. Their cognitive functioning is characterized by speech and language impairments (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chapman and Hesketh, 2000</xref>), and they often have more difficulty with expressive language than with language comprehension. Their non-verbal skills are usually less severely impaired, although recent studies have shown a variable picture that depends on which aspect of visuospatial cognition is considered (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Several researchers have focused on working memory (WM) because of its crucial role in many everyday situations, such as learning, orientation, reasoning, and comprehension (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Baddeley, 1986</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Baddeley and Hitch&#x02019;s (1974)</xref> and <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Baddeley&#x02019;s (1986)</xref> multicomponent model, WM can be seen as a system comprising several different components. The central executive is seen as an attention-controlling system responsible for managing resources and monitoring information processing. Two slave systems are responsible for the storage of information, i.e., the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad. The former is for temporarily storing and rehearsing speech-based verbal information, while the latter is for storing visuospatial information for brief periods of time.</p><p>Some researchers have analyzed WM functioning in DS, reporting impairments in executive processing (e.g., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lanfranchi et al., 2010</xref>) and the verbal component (e.g., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Hulme and Mackenzie, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Jarrold and Baddeley, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kittler et al., 2004</xref>), while findings on visuospatial WM are inconsistent. In fact, previous studies found participants with DS less impaired in visuospatial than in verbal WM, but more recent results suggest that individuals with DS may have difficulties in the visuospatial domain too (see <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2014</xref>, for a review), depending on which specific aspect of this ability is considered. For instance, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Lanfranchi et al. (2009)</xref> found that participants with DS performed worse than controls (children matched for mental age) in spatial-simultaneous WM tasks, but not in spatial-sequential ones. This finding can be explained in the light of the hypothesis advanced by <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Pazzaglia and Cornoldi (1999</xref>; see also <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Cornoldi and Vecchi, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Mammarella et al., 2008</xref>) that sees the visuospatial sketchpad divided into three components: a visual component, involved in the recall of an object&#x02019;s features; a spatial-sequential component, implicated in memory for sequentially presented information; and a spatial-simultaneous component, responsible for recalling configurations that describe simultaneously presented spatial locations.</p><p>Using this distinction, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Lanfranchi et al. (2009)</xref> observed a specific deficit in DS individuals&#x02019; spatial-simultaneous WM, irrespective of the level of control required (see <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Cornoldi and Vecchi, 2003</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>). This result was supported by later research conducted to explore impairments in spatial-simultaneous WM more closely. <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Carretti and Lanfranchi (2010)</xref> found, for example, that when children with DS aged from 5 to 12 years performed spatial-simultaneous WM tasks, they did not take advantage of structured materials (in which the positions to remember formed a pattern) as effectively as a control group with typically developing (TD) children matched for mental age. To see if the DS individuals had a general problem with using structured material to memorize information, or if this problem related specifically to spatial-simultaneous WM tasks, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Carretti et al. (2013)</xref> subsequently compared the advantage associated with the use of structured material in both spatial-simultaneous and spatial-sequential tasks in individuals with DS matched for mental age with TD children. Their results showed a marked difference between the two groups in the former but not in the latter tasks, confirming specific impairments in spatial-simultaneous WM in DS.</p><p>In the light of the above-mentioned findings on the particular weakness in spatial-simultaneous WM identified in individuals with DS, the aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of improving visuospatial WM in children and adolescents with DS. Previous studies investigating the efficacy of WM training programs in individuals with DS focused on the verbal component of WM. For example, some authors found improvements in auditory and/or visual span measures after using rehearsal training (e.g., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Broadley and MacDonald, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Comblain, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Laws et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Conners et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). These improvements were often limited to the skills directly treated, however. As for visuospatial WM, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al. (2013)</xref> assessed the effectiveness of a computer-based training program in reducing the memory difficulties of children with DS aged between 7 and 12 years. After approximately 3 months of training with the preschool version of the Cogmed Working Memory Training (which includes different visuospatial memory training tasks), the authors found improvements in both trained and untrained short-term visuospatial memory tasks, with no transfer to short-term verbal memory or WM skills.</p><p>In the present study, the feasibility of enhancing spatial-simultaneous WM in individuals with DS was tested using a training administered either by an expert in psychology or by parents at home. Earlier research had already demonstrated the efficacy of the training program adopted in terms of its specific effects on spatial-simultaneous WM, transfer effects on spatial-sequential WM, and maintenance effects after 1 month (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lanfranchi et al., 2014</xref>). In the present work, we focus on the person conducting the training activities because one of the problems of training administered by an expert concerns the burden on the families having to bring their child to a specialized center. With a view to the training&#x02019;s applicability, it therefore seemed worthwhile to see whether giving parents guidance on how to train specific aspects of cognition (such as WM) could produce similar results to those achievable by an expert.</p><p>The training activities were conducted using a computer, partly for its motivational value, and also because previous studies had shown that it can be used effectively with DS children (e.g., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Ortega-Tudela and G&#x000f3;mez-Ariza, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al., 2013</xref>). The final version of the training (based on <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Mammarella et al., 2010</xref>) consisted of activities in which memory load and attentional control were manipulated. The activities were structured to suit the cognitive profile of DS. For instance, the training involved: little verbal information and only very simple verbal instructions because DS is known to be associated with impaired verbal abilities (e.g., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Rondal, 1996</xref>); practical activities because of their difficulties with abstract reasoning (e.g., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Rowe et al., 2006</xref>); or simple images because they have trouble with perceptual analysis (e.g., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bellugi et al., 2000</xref>), and may have visual impairments (e.g., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dykens et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The present study therefore investigated whether WM training completed under the supervision of a parent could have positive effects. <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Conners et al. (2008)</xref> found that rehearsal training administered at home by parents was effective in improving memory span in children with DS. Although parent-implemented intervention may entail intervening variables, we agree with <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Conners et al. (2008)</xref> that training provided by parents can have a greater ecological validity and, if successful, improvements could be maintained by means of regular maintenance exercises.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty-nine children and adolescents with DS (16 males and 23 females) took part in the study.

The starting point was a training program for TD children designed to improve their visuospatial WM (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Mammarella et al., 2010</xref>). This software considers two aspects of visuospatial WM: the nature of the stimulus (visual, spatial-sequential, and spatial-simultaneous; only spatial-simultaneous tasks were used in the present study); and the level of attentional control, with tasks demanding a low, medium or high level of control. Individuals with DS are weak in spatial-simultaneous WM, so our training focused exclusively on activities engaging this area. Moreover the activities were selected and adapted to the DS cognitive profile.</p><p>In particular, given these individuals&#x02019; deficit in verbal abilities (e.g., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Rondal, 1996</xref>), the tasks contained little verbal information and we used very simple verbal instructions (and parents administering the training were advised to do likewise). We also used simple, concrete tasks because of DS individuals&#x02019; deficit in abstract reasoning (e.g., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Rowe et al., 2006</xref>), and performing complex activities (e.g., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lanfranchi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The training sessions focused alternatively on immediate attention and memory (recognition tasks), recollection (passive tasks), and active memory (active tasks that involve maintaining and processing information). In the immediate attention and memory sessions, the tasks mainly involved recognizing target stimuli; in the recollection sessions, the tasks were more complex than in the recognition tasks, and involved retrieving previously presented locations from memory; in the active memory sessions, participants were asked not only to analyze the spatial-simultaneous target stimuli, but also to maintain and process spatial-simultaneous information.</p><p>In all, there were 16 different activities. Each training session lasted approximately 30 min, and was administered twice a week. The activities proposed during the training sessions were identical for each participant in both groups.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A preliminary analysis &#x02013; one-way ANOVA

As mentioned previously, we had already tested the efficacy of the training program adopted in a previous study (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lanfranchi et al., 2014</xref>). Here, specific effects on spatial-simultaneous tasks, near transfer effects on spatial-sequential tasks, and far transfer effects on visuospatial abilities and everyday life were tested immediately after completing the training and again at a follow-up session a month later.</p><p>Judging from our results, the performance of both groups (i.e., individuals with DS trained by an expert psychologist or by their parents) improved after the training in both spatial-simultaneous WM tasks. In both cases their improvement was greater than the one seen in a passive control group in a previous preliminary study on the efficacy of our training program (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> was 0.16 for the passive spatial-simultaneous task, and -0.05 for the active spatial-simultaneous task; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lanfranchi et al., 2014</xref>). The time it took for the improvement to become apparent differed between the two groups, however.</p><p>Our most important finding lies in that parents were able to administer the training to their children, who benefited from the intervention: participants in the &#x0201c;Parent&#x0201d; group showed significant improvements in performing the passive spatial-simultaneous task. This was only true, however, for the comparison between the pre-test and the follow-up, whereas no improvement emerged immediately after completing the training. In contrast, participants in the &#x0201c;Expert&#x0201d; group performed better already at the post-test stage, and maintained this gain a month later. In other words, participants in the &#x0201c;Parent&#x0201d; group seemed to improve more gradually. The benefits of the training, in terms of specific effects, only became evident with time. The different rate of improvement in the two groups might mean that the expert was more effective in promoting changes in performance; parents would probably need more time to become familiar with the training activities. The improvement in the &#x0201c;Parent group&#x0201d; that emerged at the follow-up session might be related to changes in the way parents interacted with their children, producing &#x0201c;pervasive&#x0201d; effects on their performance that became apparent at the follow-up assessment. In other words, parents may have helped their children learn to pay more attention to details, or to use more appropriate strategies &#x02013; even outside the context of the training activities.</p><p>In contrast, no differences emerged between the two groups in the active spatial-simultaneous task: both groups performed better at post-test then at pre-test, and their improvement was maintained a month after completing the training.</p><p>In addition to the specific effects, the training also induced near and far transfer effects in both groups. Concerning the near transfer effects, there was some improvement in a WM component that was not treated specifically, i.e., spatial-sequential WM. Participants performed better at the post-test than at the pre-test session and this improvement was also maintained a month later. Similar findings emerged for the geometric puzzles task. Here again, the two groups improved from the pre-test to the post-test session, and maintained their better performance after 1 month. Taken together, these results confirm that the type of training considered here could be administered by parents just as effectively as by an expert.</p><p>On the whole, the specific and transfer effects identified here can be explained in terms of strategy acquisition: during the training activities, participants were stimulated to adopt appropriate strategies to solve the tasks, and to generalize them to other tasks.</p><p>Concerning the everyday memory questionnaire, our findings differed between the two groups: the &#x0201c;Expert&#x0201d; group improved from the pre-test to the follow-up, indicating that parents&#x02019; opinions of their children&#x02019;s everyday functioning became more positive after the training. In the &#x0201c;Parent&#x0201d; group, on the other hand, participants&#x02019; scores in the questionnaire showed no significant differences between the three sessions; they dropped slightly from pre-test to post-test, then returned to the same level as at the pre-test in the follow-up session. A possible explanation for these results lies in that, having received specific instruction, the parents concerned were more aware of their child&#x02019;s abilities and difficulties, and were consequently more severe in the opinions they expressed. In other words, the lower scores would indicate not a worse everyday functioning of the participants, but a change in their parents&#x02019; awareness of their memory ability.</p><p>In general, our study demonstrated the feasibility of improving WM performance in children and adolescents with DS, even with a relatively short training program and when the training is administered by parents. The effects of the training were not limited to the specific area of WM treated, but were also generalized to other skills, as demonstrated by near and far transfer effects. To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies to have attempted an analysis on the effect of visuospatial WM training in DS. In a recent study, for instance, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al. (2013)</xref> tested the efficacy of a computer-based training (that involved different visuospatial memory tasks) in reducing memory difficulties in children with DS. They reported improvements in both trained and untrained short-term visuospatial memory tasks and, in some children, also in tasks measuring executive functions, as indicated by parents&#x02019; responses to the BRIEF-P (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gioia et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, they reported finding no transfer effects on verbal short-term memory and verbal WM skills. The findings obtained by <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al. (2013)</xref> and our own results reported here support the feasibility of computer-based training programs enhancing visuospatial WM in individuals with DS, and also obtaining transfer effects.</p><p>In our opinion, the results of the present study are important for several reasons. For a start, having demonstrated the effectiveness of this training even when it is administered by parents show that it could be used more frequently and/or periodically in order to maintain the effects of the training. The other point of interest concerns the confirmation of its efficacy in everyday life functioning (such as learning activities, reasoning, orientation, etc.), the training program could prove useful in clinical and rehabilitation settings.</p><p>Beyond the results obtained here, it could be interesting in future studies to analyze the nature of the effects, and particularly of the transfer effects, more systematically. For example, it would be important to examine the effects on verbal WM or other domains of cognitive functioning, especially those related to everyday life. Further research could shed more light on this issue, which is a source of debate in the literature (e.g., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Melby-Lervag and Hulme, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In line with the results reported by <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Conners et al. (2008)</xref>, who found that training led by parents could produce positive effects on memory performance, our findings suggest that &#x02013; with adequate support and instruction &#x02013; parents of individuals with DS can administer their offspring effective WM training programs. In our research, we identified the same specific improvements in spatial-simultaneous WM, and the same transfer and maintenance effects, as when the training activities were administered by an expert psychologist.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a grant awarded by the University of Padova to SL (CPDA 127939).
