robot-assisted gait training combined with functional electrical stimulation on locomotor
recovery in patients with chronic stroke. [Subjects] The 20 subjects were randomly
assigned into either an experimental group (n = 10) that received a combination of
robot-assisted gait training and functional electrical stimulation on the ankle
dorsiflexor of the affected side or a control group (n = 10) that received robot-assisted
gait training only. [Methods] Both groups received the respective therapies for
30&#x02005;min/day, 3 days/week for 5 weeks. The outcome was measured using the Modified Motor
Assessment Scale (MMAS), Timed Up-and-Go Test (TUG), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and gait
parameters through gait analysis (Vicon 370 motion analysis system, Oxford Metrics Ltd.,
Oxford, UK). All the variables were measured before and after training. [Results] Step
length and maximal knee extension were significantly greater than those before training in
the experimental group only. Maximal Knee flexion showed a significant difference between
the experimental and control groups. The MMAS, BBS, and TUG scores improved significantly
after training compared with before training in both groups. [Conclusion] We suggest that
the combination of robot-assisted gait training and functional electrical stimulation
encourages patients to actively participate in training because it facilitates locomotor
recovery without the risk of adverse effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Robot-assisted gait training</kwd><kwd>Functional electrical stimulation</kwd><kwd>Chronic stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>To recover locomotor ability after a stroke, various therapies are traditionally used, such
as single-joint motor training with proprioceptive stimulation and conventional overground
gait training with walking devices. However, self-gait training without therapeutic
intervention in stroke patients can lead to an asymmetrical gait pattern<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, in stroke patients,
inappropriate weight bearing on the affected side with symptom-like foot drop may cause
severe problems in postural control and body alignment, as well as asymmetry and alteration
of muscle activation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result,
walking in patients with stroke even after rehabilitation therapy may be associated with
increased energy expenditure and less efficiency<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Body weight-support treadmill training (BWSTT) is used in stroke rehabilitation to improve
gait function by training of a normal gait pattern and for training in a safe
environment<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, BWSTT is too labor
intensive. To perform BWSTT, which entails a high workload even at a very slow speed,
patients require the assistance of 2 or more therapists<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) provides a more supportive environment and normalized
physiological gait training with benefits of temporal aspects and ideal kinematics<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, patients with severely affected
hemiplegia can be treated more effectively with RAGT than with treadmill training<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. RAGT is a form of training of a normal gait
pattern programmed automatically, and it can be performed regularly over a longer period
compared with treadmill training<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
automated process can also relieve therapists of the manual labor required during manual
treadmill training<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Lokomat system is the most widely used system for RAGT that is effective for locomotor
recovery in patients with stroke. It can retrain a patient&#x02019;s hip and knee movement patterns
while the patient walks<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The system is able to fix the ankle motion of stroke
patients but confers a foot-drop symptom<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This limitation may lead to an inappropriate walking pattern<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied to the lower extremity is well known as an
effective intervention for improving functional walking in chronic stroke patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. FES has been used in therapeutic methods
for ankle motion and muscle strengthening in stroke and spinal cord injury patients during
walking training<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. FES applied to the
dorsiflexors during the pre-swing and swing phases of the gait cycle can be a more effective
therapy than use of an ankle-foot orthosis, which decreases walking function on uneven
surfaces and limits ankle flexibility<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This repetitive and active movement
training, which is similar to a normal walking pattern, can affect motor learning and motor
recovery<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although FES can be used to supplement RAGT, no study has been conducted on the effects of
the combination of RAGT and FES. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of
RAGT combined with FES on locomotor recovery in patients with chronic stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>All hemiplegic patients (20 subjects, 13 men and 7 women; age 46&#x02013;72&#x02005;years) who were

institutional review board. The study protocol and procedures were also approved by the
SMC&#x02019;s ethics committee.</p><p>All the participants were assigned to either the experimental or control group by using a
random permuted block design with sealed envelopes. The experimental group received RAGT
combined with FES applied on the affected dorsiflexor, and the control group underwent the
RAGT only. Both groups received the respective therapies for 30&#x02005;min/day, 3 days/week for 5
weeks. In addition, all the participants received a regular 30-min conservative physical
therapy session based on neurodevelopmental therapy. Before and after the 15 sessions for 5
weeks, motor function, gait ability and balance were evaluated in all participants by a
blinded examiner. There were a total of two physical therapists for the pre- and
post-intervation assessments and two physical therapists conducted the intervations.</p><p>Lokomat (Hocoma AG, Zurich, Switzerland) was designed for RAGT in individuals. It consists
of a treadmill, dynamic body weight support system, and motor-driven robotic orthosis, which
enables patients to walk in a physiological gait pattern. The patients wore a harness to
keep themselves safely standing on the treadmill and started the gait training using the
body weight support system and motor-driven gait orthosis. The motor-driven gait orthosis
was designed to allow joint movement depending on a variable walking speed, and it is
controlled by a computer system. According to the programmed gait pattern, RAGT started
after lowering the patients with the body weight support system.</p><p>During training, therapists were able to control the gait speed, angle of the hip and knee
joints, and amount of support provided by the body weight support system. According to the
patient&#x02019;s tolerance, the guidance force was set from 100 to 0%. As the guidance force was
reduced, more active participation of the patient was required. Therapists increased the
gait speed from 1.2&#x02005;km/h up to the maximum speed to which patients could adapt. The amount
of body weight support was reduced from 40 to 0% according to the patient&#x02019;s gait pattern.
The sessions were kept at a demanding level; the velocity of the treadmill was set to the
maximum speed tolerated by the patients, the force of the drives was regulated, and body
weight support was reduced as soon as the patients could tolerate it. Therapists motivated
patients to actively move their legs<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>WalkAide (Innovative Neurotronics, Austin, TX, USA) was used for the RAGT with FES to
stimulate the peroneal nerve in the affected side, and the intensity of the device was
painlessly controlled by allowing sufficient dorsiflexion and eversion during the swing
phase of the robot-assisted gait cycle. It stimulated the peroneal nerve through an
activated tilt sensor when the affected leg was tilted from heel off to toe off in the
stance phase. It stopped just after foot strike when the leg was tilted forward. It was
attached below the knee, and it contained a cuff with soft electrodes<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All the assessments were performed by a single research physical therapist in a quiet,
isolated place, without any interruption. The two groups were compared in terms of gait
function and motor and balance performances. Motor performance was assessed using the MMAS
(intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC=0.95)<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance performance was assessed using the TUG (ICC=0.97) and BBS
(ICC=0.98)<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. These tests have excellent interrater and intrarater reliabilities
for subjects with stroke. Gait ability was assessed through gait analysis<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. A three-dimensional video-base motions
analysis system with 6 cameras with infrared light sources (Vicon 370, USA) was used to
assess the angles of the joints during walking. The Vicon system was considered to have an
accuracy of 1&#x000b0; and 1.5&#x000b0; (root mean square) in static and dynamic angular measurements,
respectively. The measured variables were the temporal-spatial gait parameters (gait speed,
cadence, step length, stride length, double support) and kinematics gait parameters (pelvic,
hip, knee, ankle joint angle).</p><p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov verification was used to prove the normality of the data, which were
found to be normally distributed. For demographic data of both groups, independent t tests
were used for continuous variables, while &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests were used categorical
variables. A paired t test was used to compare the pre- and post-therapy data, whereas the
independent t test was used to compare the changes between the groups. To prove statistical
significance, the significance level was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After completion of the 5-week intervention, gait speed (p =0.035), step length (p =

patients with hemiparesis after stroke. After completion of the 5-week intervention, step
length and maximal knee extension were significantly greater than those before intervention
in the experimental group only. There was a significant difference in maximal knee flexion
between the experimental and control groups. Motor and balance functions improved
significantly after intervention compared with those before the intervention in both groups.
The experimental group tended to improve better than the control group, but the difference
between both groups was not significant. These results suggest that RAGT with FES has an
advantage in terms of regaining gait ability and motor and balance functions. Husemann et
al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and Mayr et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a significant improvement in gait
ability and motor and balance functions after RAGT in stroke patients. Husemann et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> found that the period of weight bearing on
the affected side was increased after RAGT in stroke patients. Because of the weakness and
sensory impairment of the paretic leg, the hemiparetic gait is characterized by a shortened
single-support phase on the paretic leg and a prolonged single-support phase on the healthy
leg<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. After the RAGT, the patients were
assumed to be able to support their body weight on the paretic leg for a longer period.
Thus, their gait patterns became more symmetrical<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Positive effects of higher speed on gait quality have been
reported in RAGT<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. We think that there
was a significant improvement in gait ability and motor and balance functions in both groups
because of the strong advantageous of RAGT compare with FES.</p><p>Tong et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> reported the effectiveness
of the combination therapy of BWSTT and FES on walking speed and motor function. Hesse et
al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that a combined
therapy of treadmill gait training and FES produced positive training effects on gait
ability and motor and balance functions compared with either treadmill training or FES
alone. However, they did not measure the kinematic gait parameters through gait analysis
with a three-dimensional video-based motion analysis. In our study, we measured the
kinematic gait parameters. FES was applied to stimulate ankle dorsiflexor in the
experimental group. In addition, stroke patients received cues from the tingling sensation
of FES to stimulate ankle dorsiflexor during the swing phase of the robot-assisted gait
cycle, which encouraged them to actively participate in the training process. FES could
stimulate skin and proprioceptive receptors, which could provide appropriate alternate
movement training by concentric and eccentric stimulation<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. FES might improve the fitness and strength of the paralyzed motor
units of stroke patients who still have voluntary control<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the abovementioned previous studies, the combination of walking
training with FES was significantly more effective than conventional walking training for
reduction of spasticity, improvement of strength in the affected leg, and prevention of
muscular atrophy in stroke patients. These effects have also been shown in chronic stroke
patients<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. We thought that compared
with RAGT alone, RAGT with FES led to increases in maximal knee flexion and step length and
a greater decrease in knee hyperextension. Therefore, hyperextension of the knee might be
corrected and step length could be increased by the FES effects of increased ankle
dorsiflexion angle. However, it is thought that we could not observe the strong advantage of
peroneal stimulation with FES because the Lokomat system involves ankle fixation.</p><p>We expected that the combination of RAGT and FES would be more beneficial than RAGT alone
because FES applied to the ankle dorsiflexor could positively affect the mobility of the
knee, which would improve gait ability and motor and balance functions. By receiving the
combination therapy, patients could gain a more meaningful and functional therapeutic effect
from FES instead of passively letting their paralyzed muscles be stimulated electrically
during RAGT.</p><p>We found that the 5-week combination therapy of RAGT and FES had advantages with respect to
improvement of gait ability and motor and balance functions in the chronic stroke patients
compared with RAGT alone, although the motor and balance performances were not significantly
statistically different. Therefore, we suggest that the combination of RAGT and FES
encourages patients to actively participate in training because it improves gait ability and
motor and balance functions without adverse effects. Thus, this combination therapy may be
useful for treatment of chronic stroke patients.</p><p>The only limitation of this study is that the gait analysis was not explained in detail
using a variety of methods. Future research with a larger number of subjects is
recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a KOSEF grant (M10644000022-06N4400-02210) funded by the Korean
