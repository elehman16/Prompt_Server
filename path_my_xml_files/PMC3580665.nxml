The pathophysiology of ALI involves a pro-inflammatory state with increased permeability and fluid leakage into the alveoli and interstitium, resulting in pulmonary edema and impaired gas exchange. The resolution of alveolar edema is a key factor in recovery from ALI and has therefore been the subject of a substantial number of experimental studies. Many of these studies demonstrate that transportation of sodium and chloride across the alveolar epithelial cells, which can be achieved by increased exogenous cyclic AMP stimulation with &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonists, is one of the principal mechanisms in alveolar fluid clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In an ex vivo human lung model, alveolar fluid clearance doubled with use of a &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic receptor agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, a single center, phase II randomized trial (BALTI study) showed that patients with ALI receiving an intravenous &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonist had lower lung water, lower plateau airway pressures and lower Murray lung injury scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These laboratory and early clinical data showed promising results to suggest a potential therapeutic role of &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonists in improving clinical outcomes when used routinely in patients with ALI.</p><p>Based on this preliminary work, the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Clinical Trials Network conducted the ALTA study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. ALTA was the first multicenter, phase III randomized study to test the role of routine use of a &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonist in improving clinical outcomes in patients with ALI. The primary outcome measure for this study was the number of ventilator free days (VFDs) by day 28. The trial was terminated prematurely after recruitment of only 282 patients of the proposed 1,000 patients at the second interim analysis on grounds of futility. The primary outcome, the number of VFDs to day 28, was not significantly different between study groups. Mortality before hospital discharge to days 60 and 90 and the number of organ failure-free days were also not significantly different between the two groups. The number of intensive care unit-free days was lower in the albuterol-treated group, suggesting that survivors receiving albuterol spent more time in the ICU than survivors receiving placebo. Also noted was that the albuterol-treated group had a higher heart rate and a tendency towards more fluid resuscitation. The Kaplan-Meier survivor curves suggested worse survival in patients who routinely received albuterol compared to placebo, although the statistical significance of this analysis was not reported.</p><p>There are several potential reasons why &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonists failed to improve outcomes in this study, despite promising physiological evidence. Among these are the possible lack of significant drug delivery to the aerated, nonedematous lung; the presence of injured alveolar epithelium unable to clear lung water; and down-regulation of &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic receptors with continued use of &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonist. Under these scenarios, the &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonists would fail to achieve their intended effect in real-life clinical settings.</p><p>Another possibility is that &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonist might successfully improve lung water clearance but harm patients in other ways. For example, &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonists cause tachycardia which might lead to greater fluid resuscitation in the study drug arm. This was seen in ALTA, where patients in the &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonist arm experienced higher heart rates and a trend towards higher cumulative fluid balance in the albuterol-treated arm, particularly on day 2 after randomization. &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonists might also lead to lactic acidosis and cardiac arrhythmias, as were noted in another recent randomized controlled trial stopped early for potential harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Along these lines, this clinical trial provides an important caveat to our use of surrogate endpoints to guide clinical therapy in the intensive care unit. Surrogate endpoints such as oxygenation and lung water measurements are valid only when they are causally-related to a patient-centered outcome (i.e. mortality), and there is no other link between the therapy of interest and the patient-centered outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Our field has been burned before, with numerous examples of therapies that improved surrogate outcomes but when studied in large trials ultimately were found to harm patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Of course, physiology is and will always be an important component of clinical decision making in the ICU. However, we must remember that when we make decisions based on physiological rationale alone, we may harm our patients.</p><p>With regards to &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonists in ALI, there is additional cause for concern. &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonists are among the most commonly prescribed medications for mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU. Often they are prescribed routinely, regardless of evidence of significant airflow obstruction or intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure. In these cases, we may truly be causing harm in the absence of benefit. The ALTA study reminds us that no drug in the ICU is completely benign. Although this study certainly does not provide evidence precluding the use of inhaled &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonists in the ICU, any routine use in the absence of demonstrated airflow obstruction should be reconsidered.</p></sec><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>Whenever we use surrogate endpoints and physiologic rationale to make decisions in patient care, investigators and clinicians should be cautious when translating the data into clinical benefit. As seen from this study, routine use of &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonist in ALI cannot be recommended, since there was no benefit and a suggestion of a tendency to cause harm to patients. &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic agonist therapy could be used as a therapeutic agent for use in patients with ALI and evidence of air flow obstruction, but not on a routine basis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Rubenfeld</surname><given-names>GD</given-names></name><name><surname>Caldwell</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Peabody</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal/><article-title>Incidence and outcomes of acute lung injury</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>2005</year><volume>353</volume><fpage>1685</fpage><lpage>1693</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1056/NEJMoa050333</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16236739</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Matthay</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Folkesson</surname><given-names>HG</given-names></name><name><surname>Clerici</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><article-title>Lung epithelial fluid transport and the resolution of pulmonary edema</article-title><source>Physiol Rev</source><year>2002</year><volume>82</volume><fpage>569</fpage><lpage>600</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12087129</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sakuma</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Okaniwa</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakada</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal/><article-title>Alveolar fluid clearance in the resected human lung</article-title><source>Am J Respir Crit Care Med</source><year>1994</year><volume>150</volume><fpage>305</fpage><lpage>310</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8049807</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Perkins</surname><given-names>GD</given-names></name><name><surname>McAuley</surname><given-names>DF</given-names></name><name><surname>Thickett</surname><given-names>DR</given-names></name><etal/><article-title>The beta-agonist lung injury trial (BALTI): a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial</article-title><source>Am J Respir Crit Care Med</source><year>2006</year><volume>173</volume><fpage>281</fpage><lpage>287</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1164/rccm.200508-1302OC</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16254268</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>National Heart</collab><collab>and Blood Institute Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Clinical Trials Network</collab><name><surname>Matthay</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Brower</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name><etal/><article-title>Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of an aerosolized beta(2)-agonist for treatment of acute lung injury</article-title><source>Am J Respir Crit Care Med</source><year>2011</year><volume>184</volume><fpage>561</fpage><lpage>568</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21562125</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B6"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>SF</given-names></name><name><surname>Perkins</surname><given-names>GD</given-names></name><name><surname>Gates</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/><article-title>Effect of intravenous beta-2 agonist treatment on clinical outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (BALTI-2): a multicentre, randomized controlled trial</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2012</year><volume>379</volume><fpage>229</fpage><lpage>235</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61623-1</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22166903</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B7"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Fleming</surname><given-names>TR</given-names></name><name><surname>DeMets</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><article-title>Surrogate end points in clinical trials: are we being misled?</article-title><source>Ann Intern Med</source><year>1996</year><volume>125</volume><fpage>605</fpage><lpage>613</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8815760</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B8"><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><name><surname>Rubenfeld</surname><given-names>GD</given-names></name><article-title>Surrogate measures of patient-centered outcomes in critical care</article-title><source>Update in Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine</source><year>2003</year></mixed-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
