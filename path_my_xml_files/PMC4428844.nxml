Childhood anxiety often persists into adolescence and adulthood (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Weems, 2008</xref>) and is associated with academic difficulties (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Owens, Stevenson, Norgate, &#x00026; Hadwin, 2008</xref>), impaired social functioning and peer difficulties (<xref rid="bib1 bib12" ref-type="bibr">Asendorpf, Denissen, &#x00026; van Aken, 2008; Erath, Flanagan, &#x00026; Bierman, 2007</xref>), and is a major risk factor for subsequent psychological (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kim-Cohen et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>) and physical health problems (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Beesdo et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Specific fears are common in childhood with children experiencing general patterns of normative fear throughout their development with animal fears typically emerging in middle childhood (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Field &#x00026; Davey, 2001</xref>). The majority of childhood fears will remit spontaneously, however, for a significant minority of children, their fear and anxiety persists. Research aimed at better elucidating the mechanisms involved in the aetiology of childhood fears and anxiety is especially important given the considerable suffering, dysfunction and poor prognosis associated with anxiety. This research also has the potential to inform the development and testing of novel prevention and treatment methods.</p><p>According to cognitive models of anxiety, exposure to a potentially threat-provoking stimulus activates both semantic-evaluative information and behavioural responses such as avoidance (<xref rid="bib5 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Beck &#x00026; Clark, 1997; Ouimet, Gawronski, &#x00026; Dozois, 2009</xref>). Recent research has experimentally manipulated semantic evaluative information or behavioural responses to investigate the possible causal effects on fear-related cognitions and behaviours. One approach has been to investigate how fear develops in children given that many adult fears are rooted in childhood (<xref rid="bib24 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Huijding et&#x000a0;al., 2009; Muris, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Rachman's three pathways to fear model suggests that fears are acquired environmentally via a direct route of aversive classical conditioning and two indirect routes of modelling/vicarious learning through observing others and threatening semantic evaluative information transmission (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rachman, 1977</xref>). Empirical research supports both direct and indirect pathways to fear acquisition, although much of this evidence comes from retrospective studies thereby limiting conclusions regarding the causal role of these pathways in fear acquisition (<xref rid="bib3 bib30 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Askew &#x00026; Field, 2008; King, Eleonora, &#x00026; Ollendick, 1998; Muris &#x00026; Field, 2010</xref>). Fortunately, more recent research has used prospective paradigms in which participants are presented with threatening semantic evaluative information about a stimulus and the effect of this information on fear-related cognitions and behaviour established. Research with children has shown that providing verbal threat information about a novel animal (an Australian marsupial) increases children's fear beliefs (e.g. <xref rid="bib18 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Field, Lawson, &#x00026; Banerjee, 2008; Muris, van Zwol, Huijding, &#x00026; Mayer, 2010</xref>), influences avoidance behaviour (e.g. <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Field &#x00026; Lawson, 2003</xref>), biases selective attention and future contingency learning (<xref rid="bib14 bib17" ref-type="bibr">Field, 2006b; Field &#x00026; Lawson, 2008</xref>) and affects physiological responses (<xref rid="bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Field &#x00026; Price-Evans, 2009; Field &#x00026; Schorah, 2007</xref>). Providing positive information reduces children's fear beliefs and behavioural avoidance (<xref rid="bib16 bib27 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Field &#x00026; Lawson, 2003; Kelly, Barker, Field, Wilson, &#x00026; Reynolds, 2010; Muris, Bodden, Merckelbach, Ollendick, &#x00026; King, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, Approach-Avoidance Tasks (AAT) have been used to study behavioural responses in a range of fears (<xref rid="bib23 bib32 bib41 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Heuer, Rinck, &#x00026; Becker, 2007; Lange, Keijsers, Becker, &#x00026; Rinck, 2008; Rinck &#x00026; Becker, 2007; Roelofs et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). In the AAT, participants respond to a stimulus presented on screen by pulling it toward them or pushing it away using a joystick. The task builds on the premise that stimuli appraised as negative produce automatic avoidance tendencies characterised by pushing objects away from oneself, while stimuli appraised as pleasant produce automatic approach tendencies characterised by pulling the objects closer (<xref rid="bib8 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Chen &#x00026; Bargh, 1999; Solarz, 1960</xref>). These approach-avoidance tendencies have been found to differentiate high and low fearful individuals (<xref rid="bib31 bib41 bib42" ref-type="bibr">Klein, Becker, &#x00026; Rinck, 2011; Rinck &#x00026; Becker, 2007; Roefs et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). For example, spider-fearful participants were faster to push spider pictures away, indicative of avoidance, than to pull them closer with this effect not observed in non-fearful participants (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rinck &#x00026; Becker, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Using a modified approach-avoidance task it is also possible to experimentally manipulate behavioural response tendencies in order to begin to study the possible causal effect on fear-related cognitions and behaviours (for reviews see <xref rid="bib46 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Vandenbosch &#x00026; De Houwer, 2011; Woud, Becker, &#x00026; Rinck, 2011</xref>). In a modified AAT, participants are trained to repeatedly pull toward (training approach tendencies) or push away (training avoidance) neutral stimuli using a joystick with the direction of response required determined by some characteristic of the stimuli (e.g. push brown pictures, pull blue pictures). The premise being that repeatedly training approach tendencies by pulling the stimulus closer is hypothesised to lead to more positive appraisals, while training avoidance tendencies would lead to more negative appraisals (<xref rid="bib8 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Chen &#x00026; Bargh, 1999; Solarz, 1960</xref>).</p><p>Two studies have investigated the effects of manipulating behavioural-response tendencies on fear-related responses about novel animals in children (<xref rid="bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Huijding et&#x000a0;al., 2009; Huijding, Muris, Lester, Field, &#x00026; Joosse, 2011</xref>). Children were instructed to repeatedly pull toward (approach) or push away (avoid) pictures of Australian marsupials, quokka and quoll. In the first study, the approached animal was rated more positively while disliking of the avoided animal increased (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Huijding et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Greater avoidance and fear of the avoided animal relative to the approached animal was reported in girls only. No significant effects were observed on a measure of implicit attitudes, the Implicit Association Test (IAT, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Greenwald, McGhee, &#x00026; Schwartz, 1998</xref>). In a second study (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Huijding et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), training increased self-reported liking of the approached animal and disliking and fear of the avoided animal. Children sought out more negative information about the avoided animal and more positive information about the approached animal. Once again, no significant effects were observed on implicit attitudes.</p><p>Associative learning is one possible mechanism explaining how verbal information operates (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Field, 2006a</xref>). Telling a child a dog is dangerous may evoke a mental representation of threat that becomes linked in memory with the concept of dogs (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Muris &#x00026; Field, 2010</xref>). Few studies have investigated interactions between possible pathways to fear learning. However, giving verbal threat information before a direct negative conditioning experience or vicarious learning episode yielded a magnified (additive) effect on fear beliefs compared to either pathway alone (<xref rid="bib4 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Askew, Kessock-Philip, &#x00026; Field, 2008; Field &#x00026; Storksen-Coulson, 2007</xref>). These findings were interpreted as consistent with conditioning (association formation) models of anxiety (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Davey, 1997</xref>). Expectancies about the possible outcomes (unconditioned stimulus (US)) of interacting with the animal (conditioned stimulus, CS) shaped future fear learning by strengthening the CS-US association formed during a negative conditioning/vicarious learning experience. Verbal information may be a powerful means through which the strength of a conditioned response (CR) elicited by a CS can be revalued or devalued through a process called US revaluation (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Davey, 1997</xref>). However, presenting verbal information after a vicarious learning episode in an attempt to revalue the US did not significantly magnify changes in fear beliefs compared to vicarious learning alone (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Askew et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, Exp 3).</p><p>Approach-avoidance training operates via association formation principles, namely operant (i.e. stimulus-response) evaluative conditioning (<xref rid="bib10 bib48" ref-type="bibr">De Houwer, 2007; Woud, Becker, &#x00026; Rinck, 2008</xref>). The animal picture acts as the discriminative stimulus (CS), which determines response (UR) (push or pull), in turn triggering the approach-avoidance system with a pull movement leading to a positive approach state (CR) and a push movement to a negative avoidance state, thus influencing fear-related responses (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Woud et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Association formation models predict that giving verbal information prior to approach-avoidance training would have an additive effect: Prior expectancies created via verbal information may act to strengthen the CS-UR association formed during approach-avoidance training leading to magnified fear effects. Likewise, presenting verbal information after approach-avoidance training may strengthen the CR thus magnifying the effects on fear-related responses. If a child receives avoidance training and then subsequently hears threat information about the same animal then they may revalue that animal as even more aversive.</p><p>Associative learning effects may also be driven through generating and evaluating propositions about relations in the environment, which in turn drives conditioned responding (<xref rid="bib11 bib33" ref-type="bibr">De Houwer, 2009; Mitchell, De Houwer, &#x00026; Lovibond, 2009</xref>). In line with a propositional account, verbal information may be sufficient to influence learning effects. Telling participants that the quoll is a dangerous animal is expected to create a proposition, which in turn drives fear-related responding. If it is proposition formation that drives conditioned responding and not association formation then we hypothesise that the addition of approach-avoidance training after verbal information is unlikely to have an additive effect on fear-related responses. Predictions regarding the impact of giving approach-avoidance training prior to verbal information are less clear from this model. In both instances the automatic link formation mechanism thought to underpin approach-avoidance training is non-propositional and therefore unlikely to be affected directly by verbal information.</p><p>In the present study, participants were assigned to verbal information (VI), approach avoidance training (AATT), verbal information then approach-avoidance training (VI&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;AATT) or approach-avoidance training then verbal information (AATT&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VI). In an improvement to past experiments investigating the effect of approach-avoidance training, fear beliefs and indirect avoidance behaviour were assessed at pre- and post-time points permitting assessment of <italic>change</italic> in these measures. A direct measure of avoidance behaviour was included to test for effects on actual avoidance tendencies toward the novel animals. We hypothesise that repeated avoidance or verbal threat information would lead to an increase in fear beliefs, more negative implicit attitudes and greater avoidance behaviour. In contrast, repeated approach or verbal positive information was hypothesised to lead to a decrease in fear beliefs, more positive implicit attitudes and relatively less avoidance behaviour. We test competing hypotheses regarding propositional and association formation accounts by investigating the magnitude of fear-related effects across the four conditions (VI, AATT, VI&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;AATT and AATT&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VI).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Method</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>One hundred and sixty children (78 males, 82 females, <italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8.94, <italic>SD</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.13 years, range 7&#x02013;11 years) were recruited from primary schools.

Children were trained to avoid (push) one animal and approach (pull) the other animal. The task comprised two training phases and three manipulation checks. Participants responded to on screen pictures of quokkas and quolls by pulling or pushing the Logitech Attack 3 joystick. Pulling the joystick made the picture increase in size creating the impression of approach while pushing the joystick away made the picture decrease in size giving the impression of avoidance. During the test phases, pushing or pulling the joystick all the way forward or backward made the picture disappear. During the training phases, the picture only disappeared if the correct response was made, thus forcing participants to make the required response before proceeding. To begin the next trial participants returned the joystick to the middle position and pressed the fire button.</p><p>During the practice, a picture of a quokka was presented, the experimenter told the child it was a quokka and then asked the child to move the joystick forward or backward until the picture disappeared. This was repeated for the quoll.

After identifying each picture, they pushed or pulled the joystick to make the picture disappear and to proceed to the next trial. The experimenter did not suggest any response direction. This phase consisted of 24 trials (12 pictures per animal) presented in a fixed random order. The purpose of this phase was to ensure the participants were able to discriminate between quokkas and quolls and to establish a baseline measure of the proportion of spontaneous push and pull preferences for each animal.</p><p><italic>Phase 2 (first training phase):</italic> Children were instructed to push away quokkas and pull toward them quolls, or vice versa for children in the opposite condition. This phase consisted of 48 trials (24 per animal) presented in a fixed random order. Six pictures of each animal were used and presented on four occasions.</p><p><italic>Phase 3 (post-training assessment 1):</italic> Children were again presented with pictures of the animals and were instructed to name the animal as quickly as possible before pushing or pulling the joystick to proceed to the next trial.

Approach movements significantly increased for the animal that was consistently pulled closer and significantly decreased for the animal that was pushed away. The impact of approach-avoidance training on fear-related responses was limited: there were significant reductions in fear beliefs for <italic>both</italic> the approach and avoid animal, but no significant effect on implicit attitudes or avoidance behaviour. Providing children with verbal information had pervasive effects on fear-related responses. Threat information led to a significant increase in fear beliefs and relatively greater avoidance behaviour. Positive information led to a significant decrease in fear beliefs and relatively less avoidance behaviour. No significant effects were observed for implicit attitudes. The pattern of findings for the combined conditions was similar to that observed for verbal information only. We found no convincing evidence for an additive effect of verbal information and approach-avoidance training, irrespective of the order in which they were combined.</p><p>Consistent with past research, exposure to verbal threat information appears to be an important pathway for the aetiology of childhood fears (see <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Muris &#x00026; Field, 2010</xref> for a review). Effect sizes were consistently larger for threat information than positive information. This could reflect a methodological detail, although the information was matched for content and salience. It could also suggest that verbal information is a more powerful route to inducing fear than reducing it, at least for the present stimuli, which were novel and not of obvious fear relevance. Notwithstanding this, the possibility remains that the provision of positive verbal information may be an effective corrective tool (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kelly et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). However, the present findings and those of <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kelly et&#x000a0;al., (2010)</xref> demonstrate the effect of only a short burst of non-threat/positive information about stimuli about which children have no or limited prior experience. It is as yet untested how effective positive verbal information might be in modifying long-established fears in clinically anxious children. However, these preliminary results are encouraging as positive information yielded medium to large effects for change in fear beliefs, <italic>d</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.92, and indirect avoidance behaviour, <italic>d</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.48 (although it is important to note that the effect of positive verbal information on indirect avoidance behaviour marginally failed to survive multiple testing corrections. However, effect sizes are in our opinion of greater value in interpreting the magnitude of effects than merely relying on statistical significance).</p><p>We did not fully replicate previous findings showing that approach-avoidance training had differential effects on self-reported fear beliefs. In an initial study (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Huijding et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>) no clear effects were seen &#x02013; when gender was considered, girls but not boys showed greater fear beliefs about the avoided than approached animal. In a second study, a measure of fear beliefs given at post-training showed fear beliefs were higher for the avoided than approached animal (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Huijding et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). In this study, fear beliefs were assessed at pre- and post-training permitting stronger conclusions regarding the effect of approach-avoidance training on <italic>change</italic> in fear beliefs. Fear beliefs decreased significantly for <italic>both</italic> the approach and avoid animal, although the effect size was larger (and in the hypothesised direction) for the approach animal.</p><p>We found no convincing evidence that training avoidance tendencies <italic>increased</italic> self-report fear beliefs, which argues against a causal relationship between behavioural response tendencies and fear responses in childhood. However, this conclusion is premature given the infancy of research using the approach-avoidance task and the nature of the stimuli used in the present experiment. Stronger evidence for causality may emerge with more extensive approach-avoidance training. It is perhaps also noteworthy that the AATT lacks a motivational component typically inherent in operant conditioning whereby the behaviour reinforced or minimised leads to a biologically significant event (e.g. repeated training to pull a lever (reinforced behaviour) leads to delivery of food (reward)). Learning the behaviour to approach one animal and avoid the other is not reinforced with a tangible and significant outcome. One possibility is that stronger effects on fear-related responses would be observed if the approach behaviour was rewarded (e.g. pulling the joystick leads to the award of points, or hearing a pleasant sound) and the avoidant behaviour was reinforced by the absence of an aversive experience (e.g. pushing the joystick is reinforced by not losing points, or not hearing an unpleasant sound).</p><p>It remains unclear why avoidance training led to <italic>reductions</italic> in fear beliefs (and indirect avoidance behaviour), although these effects were small and didn't survive multiple testing corrections. Notwithstanding this, one possible explanation is that previous studies did not assess pre-post training change in fear beliefs. When examining only post-training fear beliefs data, a similar pattern to that reported by Huijding et&#x000a0;al. is observed with fear beliefs (and indirect avoidance ratings) higher for the avoided than approach animal (albeit not significantly so). One possibility is that repeated administration of the avoid animal picture over successive training trials in the absence of overt negative consequences may have attenuated any negative effects of avoidance training on fear beliefs and avoidance behaviour.</p><p>Neither verbal information nor approach-avoidance training altered children's implicit attitudes. The affective priming task may not be sensitive enough to detect the effect of the fear manipulations on implicit evaluations. The empirical evidence from adult studies investigating whether training of behavioural responses affects implicit evaluations is mixed (<xref rid="bib46 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Vandenbosch &#x00026; De Houwer, 2011; Woud et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>) and no significant effects were reported in past child studies (<xref rid="bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Huijding et&#x000a0;al., 2009, 2011</xref>). More extensive approach-avoidance training or the provision of more or repeated verbal information may produce results on an implicit measure. Studies that have demonstrated effects on implicit attitudes have employed considerably more training trials (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kawakami, Phills, Steele, &#x00026; Dovidio, 2007</xref>). The word stimuli used may also have been too distal from the nature of the fear manipulations. Future research should consider using approach (e.g. touch, hold) and avoidance (e.g. hide, run) oriented words or positive (gentle, soft) and negative (angry, dirty) words that are more semantically consistent with the verbal information presented.</p><p>This was the first study to compare the effects of verbal information and approach avoidance training and to investigate the combined effects of these two pathways. The effects of approach-avoidance training were consistently smaller compared to verbal information alone or the combined conditions. The only exception being the comparison between VI and AATT conditions for the change in fear beliefs for the positive/approach animal where the effect was no longer significant once stringent multiple testing corrections were applied, but still represented a medium effect size (<italic>d</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.48). On balance, our results provide relatively robust evidence that a short burst of verbal information represents a stronger route to fear learning (and fear reduction) about a novel animal in children than does the pairing of a picture of a novel animal with an approach or avoid behavioural response. Unlike previous findings that reported an interaction between verbal information and a negative conditioning experience (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Field &#x00026; Storksen-Coulson, 2007</xref>) and a vicarious learning episode (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Askew et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>), we did not find an additive effect of combining VI and AATT compared to VI alone. This indicates that expectancies created via verbal information did not act to strengthen the CS-UR association proposed to underpin approach-avoidance training nor strengthen the CR potentially via US revaluation. However, the weak effects of approach-avoidance training may have limited the potential for verbal information to influence the strength of association/response. As previously outlined, it remains unclear the extent to which approach-avoidance training mimics operant conditioning due to the lack of a motivational component in the UR or CR. Given that associative learning may not have occurred in the AATT condition, it is perhaps premature to fully dismiss an associative account in favour of a propositional explanation. Nonetheless, the present findings are more consistent with the idea that conditioned responding is driven by proposition formation rather than association formation (<xref rid="bib11 bib33" ref-type="bibr">De Houwer, 2009; Mitchell et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Verbal information alone is sufficient to create a proposition (e.g. quolls are dangerous) that drives fear-related responses at a cognitive and behavioural level. However, we would still advocate further research into the interaction between different pathways to fear acquisition, as it is highly likely that complex fears originate through multifaceted interactions between different possible pathways to fear learning.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, order of administration of the cognitive and behavioural outcome measures was not counterbalanced, which may have introduced order effects into the data. Second, we observed an imbalance in age between the VI and AATT&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;VI conditions despite randomisation, which may have biased our statistical tests. It remains possible that the observed differences between these groups on outcome measures may be explained by age and not the effect of the experimental manipulations and that age may interact with the experimental manipulations to influence outcome. However, we consider this unlikely given that all outcome variables were uncorrelated with age and the difference in mean age between the groups was less than 1 year. Third, it is unclear the extent to which children believed that a real animal was present in the BAT. To reduce the possible impact of placing ones hand into the first box and realising that a real animal was not inside, the order of presentation was kept constant to ensure that the first animal (the quoll) that the child was asked to respond to was across participants equally often the animal associated with positive information/approach training and threat information/avoidance training. Fourth, the present study focused on novel, benign looking animals. Larger effects may be observed with fear-relevant stimuli or for familiar animals about which children already possess fear (e.g. spiders, snakes). Finally, the present experiment contrasted positive information/approach and threat information/avoid training limiting specific conclusions regarding independent effects of these conditions. While partly mitigated by the use of pre-post measures, the inclusion of a suitable no-training condition using neutral information or no behavioural response contingencies should be investigated.</p><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Verbal information is a plausible pathway involved in the aetiology of childhood fear learning. This is an important finding because most children are frequently exposed to potentially threatening information, whether that be via peers, parents or through mass media (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Muris &#x00026; Field, 2010</xref>). We found only very limited evidence that training approach-avoidance tendencies influenced fear-related responses and no evidence for an additive effect of verbal information and approach-avoidance training. However, from a clinical perspective, exposure therapy for childhood phobias is often highly efficacious and thus the potential role of approach/avoidance in the onset and reduction of childhood fears is worthy of further investigation. Our findings suggest that actively focussing on children's semantic evaluative beliefs regarding feared animals may be a powerful route to fear reduction. In fact, giving positively tinted, realistic information as a way of modifying threat-based interpretations and beliefs is already common during cognitive-behavioural interventions for childhood fears (<xref rid="bib601" ref-type="bibr">Ollendick &#x00026; King, 1998</xref>). The extent to which established fears are amenable to change via positive information alone is worthy of further investigation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
