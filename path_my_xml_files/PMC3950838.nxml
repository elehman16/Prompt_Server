Mechanical ventilator, urinary catheters, and intravenous catheters are the major causes of this difference. Based on the report by Center for Disease Control, nosocomial infections caused 88,000 deaths in the United States.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the first cause of death due to nosocomial infection in ICU with an incidence of 9% in ventilated patients.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] These infections increase duration of hospitalization, and mortality by 5 to 65% and increase treatment costs.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Furthermore, several risk factors play a role in its incidence, which can increase hospitalization period in ICU, treatment costs, and mortality.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] One of the predisposing factors of VAP is related to gastrointestinal disorders and administration of antacids like pantoprazole, and sucralfate, which facilitates colonization of bacteria, especially gram negative bacteria in nasopharynx and their aspiration to the lungs. This process increases the risk of pneumonia, so administration of an appropriate antacid with the least complications can significantly reduce the risk of VAP, and hence, reduce mortality, morbidity, and costs, and improves patients&#x02019; health.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is defined as a group of pneumonias that occur 48 h after the patient is ventilated if the patient did not have primary signs of the infection at the time of arriving ICU. VAP is one of the most prevalent nosocomial infections and pneumonia is causes 27% of infections in ICU.</p><p>Symptoms and signs of pneumonia are fever, leukocytosis and purulent discharge. Laboratory testing is the best diagnostic method. Administration of antibiotics and cooperation with laboratory are important subjects after diagnosis. Furthermore, as the duration of hospitalization increases, the risk of VAP and incidence of more dangerous organisms in ventilated patients increase.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Finally, the ICU patients are at risk of stress ulcer for different reasons, which can put patients at risk of pneumonia because of the reflux and entering stomach contents to pharynx and lungs.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] To prevent from stress ulcer, anti reflux and antacids are administered for ICU patients, two of which are sucralfate and pantoprazole.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Sucralfate covers the stomach mucosa and prevents movement of bacteria toward pharynx and lungs. Pantoprazole inhibits proton pump, and prevents acid secretion. So patients who receive sucralfate experience aspiration pneumonia less[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Therefore, this study aimed to compare the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in two groups of patients receiving these drugs in Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This clinical trial was conducted on two groups of 74 ICU patients in Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan. Patients were treated with sucralfate or pantoprazole. The study was conducted between early 2010 to mid 2011. Inclusion criteria were admission to ICU, and accepting to cooperate. Exclusion criteria were early discharge from ICU, death before 10 days, inception of antibiotic before incidence of pneumonia or sensitivity to the drug. The study was approved by the medical universities ethics committee Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>Intensive care unit (ICU) patients were selected if they met the inclusion criteria. Then they or their companions were briefed, and after they agreed to cooperate, patients were consecutively assigned to each group. The first patient was selected randomly. Matching is essential in removing confounding factors that play a role in pneumonia, so group matching was done for gender and age &#x000b1; 3 years. One group received pantoprazole, and the second group received sucralfate. Pneumonia was compared during their hospitalization period. Diagnostic criteria for pneumonia were CDC criteria.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Data were entered into computer and analyzed using SPSS version 18.
