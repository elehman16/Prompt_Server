Participants were recruited for development and evaluation activities related to Guy2Guy, a text messaging&#x02013;based human immunodeficiency virus infection prevention program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Eligibility criteria included being between 14 to 18 years old; being a cisgender male; self-identifying as gay, bisexual, and/or queer; being literate in English, exclusively owning a cell phone, enrolled in an unlimited text messaging plan, intending to keep their current phone number over the next 6 months, and having used text messaging for at least the past 6 months. Recruitment experiences and subsequent steps to refine the Internet-based recruitment strategy are discussed for 4 research activities: online focus groups, content advisory team, beta test, and randomized controlled trial (RCT). Recruitment relied primarily on Facebook advertising. To a lesser extent, Google AdWords and promotion through partner organizations working with AGBM youth were also utilized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Facebook advertising strategies were regularly adjusted based on preidentified recruitment targets for race, ethnicity, urban-rural residence, and sexual experience. The result was a diverse sample of participants, of whom 30% belonged to a racial minority and 20% were Hispanic. Facebook advertising was the most cost-effective method, and it was also able to reach diverse recruitment goals: recruitment for the first focus group cost an average of US $2.50 per enrolled participant, and it took 9 days to enroll 40 participants; the second focus group cost an average of US $6.96 per enrolled participant, and it took 11 days to enroll 40 participants. Recruitment for the first content advisory team cost an average of US $32.52 per enrolled participant; the second cost US $29.52 per participant. Both recruitment drives required 10 days to enroll 24 participants. For the beta test, recruitment cost an average of US $17.19 per enrolled participant, and it took 16 days to complete enrollment of 20 participants. For the RCT, recruitment cost an average of US $12.54 per enrolled participant, and it took 148 days to enroll 302 participants. Google AdWords campaigns did not result in any enrolled participants of whom the research staff members were aware.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Internet-based strategies can be a cost-efficient means to recruit and retain hard-to-reach populations from across the country. With real-time monitoring of participant demographic characteristics, diverse samples can be achieved. Although Facebook advertising was particularly successful in this study, alternative social media strategies can be explored in future research as these media are ever-changing.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Facebook</kwd><kwd>mHealth</kwd><kwd>recruitment methods</kwd><kwd>intervention development</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>adolescent</kwd><kwd>AGBM</kwd><kwd>sexual minority</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Among the youth in the United States, 9 in 10 new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections occur among adolescent gay, bisexual, and other teen men who have sex with men (AGBM) between the ages of 13-19 years [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Clearly, to affect HIV incidence, efforts to reach and engage AGBM are critical. In the face of this obvious need, it is perhaps surprising that few validated prevention programs are available [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In part, this lack of health programming reflects the challenge of successfully recruiting and retaining these hard-to-reach youth. More specifically, these challenges to recruitment and retention include the need to obtain parental permission or an institutional review board (IRB) waiver for those younger than 18 years [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; gaining the trust of youth who may face social stigma for their sexual minority status; and recruiting a sufficient sample size, particularly if the sampling frame is local rather than national. Internet-based recruitment has the potential to address some of these challenges, but it can also introduce challenges in terms of validating the respondent and ensuring a diverse sample. Certainly with the popularity of social networking sites, particularly Facebook (FB), among adolescents [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], researchers are beginning to use Web-based recruitment strategies to engage hard-to-reach populations [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Even with the increasing use of other social networking sites (eg, Twitter, Instagram, Vine) FB remains the most popular site with youth, including 72% of adolescent men [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, among youth who use social networking sites, 1 in 3 report using FB exclusively. Importantly, too, racial and ethnic minority youth are well represented among FB users. Usage is relatively similar by urbanicity (ie, 77% of urban, 75% of rural, 67% of suburban teenagers) and socioeconomic status (eg, 77% of youth from households earning less than US $50,000 annually compared with 68% of those from households earning more than US $50,000 annually) as well [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Given this diversity and breadth of reach, particularly among hard-to-reach youth, social networking sites may be an ideal place for researchers to recruit study participants.</p><p>Although the use of social networking websites to recruit research participants is increasingly documented in the literature [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], few studies have leveraged social networking websites to specifically reach <italic>children</italic> (ie, 18 years of age and younger). We also were unable to find any studies that documented the recruitment experiences of sexual minority youth in particular. To address this research gap, we will discuss our experiences developing and refining a national Internet-based recruitment protocol targeting AGBM 18 years of age and younger, primarily through FB advertising and also with Google AdWords and assistance from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)&#x02013;focused organizations. Participants were recruited for development and evaluation activities related to Guy2Guy, a text messaging&#x02013;based HIV prevention and healthy sexuality program for AGBM. Lessons learned here have the potential to inform future HIV prevention programs aiming to recruit hard-to-reach populations, particularly sexual minority children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The research protocol was reviewed and approved by Chesapeake Institutional Review Board, the Center for Innovative Public Health Research&#x02019;s IRB of record, and the Northwestern University IRB. Youth provided informed assent or consent, depending on their age, and completed a capacity to consent assessment [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A waiver of parental permission for participants younger than 18 years was obtained, primarily because requiring parental consent could increase risk to participants who may be victimized by their parents as a result of disclosing their sexual minority status [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The waiver also avoided the potential for fatal sampling bias that might occur if only youth who were out to their parents chose to enroll [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition to a waiver of parental permission, a Certificate of Confidentiality [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was obtained from the National Institutes of Health to protect participants&#x02019; data from subpoenas and other law enforcement efforts.</p><p>Given the wide reach of both social media and text messaging, we developed a recruitment plan that facilitated enrollment of youth across the United States. The recruitment protocol was refined across 4 different national research activities that were delivered either online or via text messaging. These research activities included online focus groups to better understand AGBM sexual decision making, online content advisory teams to vet the proposed program messages, a beta test of the Guy2Guy text messaging program, and the randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Guy2Guy. Here, we describe the recruitment experiences and resulting recruitments of our strategy across time and research activities.</p><sec><title>Eligibility Criteria</title><p>Eligibility criteria for all research activities included being 14-18 years of age; being cisgender men (ie, those whose current gender identity and sex assigned at birth are both male); self-identifying as gay, bisexual, and/or queer; and being English-speaking. To promote the likelihood of the sample reflecting those who might use the text messaging&#x02013;based program if it were publicly available, participants were also required to be exclusive owners of a cell phone, be enrolled in an unlimited text messaging plan, intend to keep their current phone number for the next 6 months, and have used text messaging for at least the past 6 months. Exclusion criteria included knowing another person already enrolled in the program and participating in a previous study activity (eg, those who took part in the focus groups were ineligible to take part in the RCT). The same eligibility criteria were applied for each study development activity with one exception: male gender identity was directly queried after the focus groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants were recruited primarily using FB ads, which must adhere to character limits (ie, 25 characters for the headline, 90 characters for the body text) and include an image. These ads must also be approved by FB. Our ads were targeted based on the user&#x02019;s location (United States), age (14-18 years), and sex (note &#x0201c;gender&#x0201d; is the term used by FB; male). We also included a list of 65 keywords (referred to as &#x0201c;interests&#x0201d; in the FB ad manager) relevant to AGBM including pop culture interests (eg, LGBT community, Katy Perry). Two types of ads were displayed depending on how the user accessed FB: News Feed ads (ie, ads are embedded in the dynamic news field central column) and right column ads (ie, ads are displayed in the static column on the right side of the webpage). People accessing FB on their desktop computer received both types of ads; those accessing the social networking site on a mobile device were only shown News Feed ads.</p><p>During the online focus groups, we asked partner organizations working with AGBM youth to promote the study. In subsequent research activities, we also used Google AdWords, which grants free advertising to the Center for Innovative Public Health Research for being a nonprofit organization. These ads included a title line of up to 25 characters, 2 description lines with up to 35 characters each, and a URL field. Ads linked to the project website, which included a brief project description and a Web-based contact form for those who wanted to be contacted for potential participation. The contact form was purposefully brief to reduce burden and promote form completion. As such, it consisted of 15 questions that queried study eligibility questions as well as demographic characteristics that were used to facilitate the recruitment of a diverse sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Enrollment</title><p>Web-based eligibility screeners received were emailed to the project coordinator. Ineligible candidates were sent a link to a sexual health website [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] relevant to sexual minority youth via email. Eligible candidates and those whose eligibility was unclear (ie, because of &#x0201c;do not want to answer&#x0201d; responses) were sent a text message by research staff to schedule an appointment via telephone. On the call, research staff confirmed the candidate&#x02019;s eligibility, explained the study, conducted a decisional capacity assessment [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and obtained verbal assent or consent to participate. Those in the beta test and RCT also completed a self-safety assessment to determine whether it was safe for them to receive text messages about sensitive topics (eg, anal sex, being gay or bisexual) on their cell phones. The assent form, which included contact information for the IRB and principal investigator, was emailed to participants for later reference. All study recruitment and enrollment documents (eg, Web-based screener, assent or consent forms, self-safety assessment) can be found online [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For the focus groups and content advisory teams, enrollment occurred at the time of verbal assent or consent. Participants in the beta test and RCT were enrolled after they completed the baseline survey and confirmed receipt of a text message from the study program to ensure that their phone was compatible with the study software.</p><p>To ensure a diverse sample for the beta test and RCT, recruitment goals were preidentified by creating allocation &#x0201c;bins&#x0201d; (ie, recruitment goals) for race, ethnicity, urban-rural residence, and sexual experience (ie, ever versus never had anal or vaginal sex). Race and ethnicity targets were based on the 2010 US population demographics, which were the most current data available at the time of recruitment (ie, 72.4% white, 12.6% black, 16.3% Hispanic) [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our targets were revised slightly so that the sample had a greater percentage of minority race (35%) and Hispanic ethnicity (20%). We also targeted 50% of the sample to be sexually inexperienced (ie, never had anal or vaginal sex) and 20% living in a rural residence. Urban-rural residence targets were identified to ensure sufficient representation among youth living in outer communities that often have fewer available LGBT resources. A Web-based study interface was programmed to automatically track the demographic characteristics of enrolled participants, allowing staff to monitor in real time the characteristics of the sample. Youth were enrolled sequentially until their bin was filled.</p></sec><sec><title>Protecting Against Deception by Participants When Recruiting Online</title><p>Several measures were taken to limit the potential for deception by participants during the recruitment and enrollment process (ie, the same participant enrolling in the study multiple times, an ineligible candidate providing fake responses to become eligible), as this is often a concern when conducting Web-based research in which researchers are unable to see the candidate face-to-face [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The project description provided in the Web-based screener did not include study eligibility criteria or mention an incentive. Furthermore, to reduce a candidate&#x02019;s ability to identify and provide the &#x0201c;right&#x0201d; answers for eligibility, the eligibility form did not exclusively include questions necessary to determine study eligibility, but also included questions to target enrollment (eg, race, ZIP code, sexual experience) and additional questions (eg, how they found the website). The eligibility screener also captured the candidate&#x02019;s Internet protocol address, which allowed us to identify possible duplicate entries. Additionally, eligibility questions were queried again over the phone and compared with the answers provided previously on the Web-based screener. Discrepant responses for questions expected to be consistent (eg, age) were questioned further, whereas discrepant responses for more fluid questions (eg, sexual identity) were not further explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>The outcome measures for this enrollment case study included the following.</p><sec><title>Advertisement Metrics</title><p>Quantification of study interest was based on measures provided by the FB and Google AdWords analytics reporting. &#x0201c;Clicks&#x0201d; referred to the number of total clicks on the ad. &#x0201c;Reach&#x0201d; referred to the number of people the ad was shown to. &#x0201c;Unique clicks&#x0201d; referred to the number of unique people who clicked on the ad. &#x0201c;Click-through rate&#x0201d; (CTR) referred to the number of clicks received divided by the number of impressions (ie, number of times the ad was shown). &#x0201c;Unique click-through rate&#x0201d; (uCTR) referred to the number of unique clicks received divided by the number of unique people the ad reached. The &#x0201c;average cost per click&#x0201d; (CPC) was calculated as the amount spent advertising divided by the CTR.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment Efficiency</title><p>The length of time to recruit the target sample and the number of youth who completed a screener needed to successfully enroll an eligible participant were indicators of recruitment efficiency. For the RCT, we also reported the number of phone calls required to enroll 1 person to quantify recruitment efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Diversity</title><p>Because health disparities are apparent by race and ethnicity [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and by rural versus urban community residence (as youth in rural communities often lack access to LGBT resources compared with those in urban settings), we believed it critically important to ensure the enrollment of a diverse sample. As such, we had a complex sampling scheme based on race, ethnicity, urban versus rural residence (determined by ZIP code), age, and sexual identity. For the sake of parsimony, we report the sample characteristics for the RCT only.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Online Focus Groups</title><p>A total of 4 focus groups were conducted to inform the development of program content and the protocol: 2 with sexually experienced youth and 2 with sexually inexperienced youth. A more detailed description of the focus group methods and results are described elsewhere [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><sec><title>Advertisement Metrics</title><p>Facebook ads for the first round of focus groups (ie, 1 with sexually experienced youth, 1 with sexually inexperienced youth) were submitted to FB for approval on November 9, 2012 and approved the same day. The ads ran for 4 days (ie, November 9-12). On the basis of FB recommendations, pricing was set with a maximum bid per click of US $0.90 and maximum daily budget of US $25. Additionally, our LGBT-focused partner organization posted an announcement regarding the study on its website forum from November 3 to 7, 2012.</p><p>At a total cost of US $100, with an average of US $0.68 per click, the FB ad campaign resulted in 148 clicks and a CTR of 0.04 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We spent an average cost of US $2.50 per enrolled participant (n=40).</p><p>In January 2013, another recruitment effort was implemented to enroll youth for the second set of focus groups. Facebook ads were submitted 5 days before the intended recruitment start date to ensure we had approval; ads were approved the same day of submission. The FB ads ran for 9 days (ie, January 14-22, 2013). Pricing was set again with a maximum bid per click of US $0.90 with a maximum daily budget of US $25. Another LGBT-focused partner organization also posted an announcement of the study on its FB page on January 12, 2013.</p><p>A total of 13 screeners were received during the first 3 days of recruitment. Of these, 6 appeared to be eligible. To invigorate enrollment, our previous LGBT-focused organization partner emailed the recipients in its mailing list on January 16, 2013. We also modified the FB recruitment ads by removing the targeted interests or keywords (eg, Katy Perry), adding targeting criteria to include teenaged men who were &#x0201c;interested in men,&#x0201d; updating the image to one thought to be more relevant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>), increasing the daily ad budget to US $100, and changing the maximum bid per click to US $0.74. These changes doubled our selected audience (ie, the number of people the ad had the potential to reach based on ad targeting criteria) from 21,000 to 46,000 and resulted in 143 newly completed screeners in a 24-hour period.</p><p>The FB ads were active for a total of 7 days, posted nonconsecutively between January 14 and 22, 2013 (ie, ads were paused or stopped during the ad campaign depending on recruitment needs). We spent an average of US $6.96 per enrolled participant in this second effort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; n=40).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table

For the second round of focus groups, among the 152 candidates who appeared eligible given their screener responses, 75/152, 49.3% were contacted.

The second round of focus groups required 11 days to enroll 40 participants.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Content Advisory Teams</title><sec><title>Advertisement Metrics</title><p>Next, we recruited a content advisory team, comprising 10 young participants from our target population, to review the draft of our program content. To do so, we made several changes to the FB campaign originally launched for the focus groups: we created multiple versions of the same ad in which the headline and tagline varied, increased the daily budget to US $150, and changed the maximum bid per click to be between US $0.25 and $0.69. The FB ads were live for 10 days between July 5 and 14, 2013. These changes resulted in an average cost of US $32.52 per enrolled participant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; n=24).</p><p>We also created a Google AdWords campaign of 187 keywords (eg, gay guys, gay teen, gay chat rooms). Ads were targeted by: network (all), device (all), location (United States), and language (English). The bid strategy was focused on clicks, manual maximum CPC bidding, and a set maximum daily budget of US $329 per day. A total of 3 different Google AdWords campaigns ran for 7 days (July 6-12, 2013) and received 962 clicks, 79,315 impressions, a CTR of 1.2%, and CPC of US $1.61. The total cost of the campaign, which was included in the advertising budget grant covered by Google AdWords, was US $1547.07.</p><p>After integrating findings from the first content advisory team into the content, we recruited a second content advisory team to confirm the modifications to the messaging. The FB recruitment campaign was further modified to optimize the pricing to get more clicks (ie, FB automatically bids to maximize the clicks to a website that can be achieved with the campaign budget) as opposed to preidentifying a maximum bid per click [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The FB ads were active for 7 days between August 28 and September 5, 2013, resulting in an average cost of US $29.52 per enrolled participant (n=24).</p><p>We used the same targeting criteria as described above in our Google AdWords campaign. As an exception, we set the network specifically to Google search networks (ie, a group of search-related websites, such as Google search sites and non-Google search sites&#x02014;like AOL&#x02014;that partner with Google to show search ads, where the ad may appear), rather than both search and display networks (ie, display networks consist of a group of more than a million websites, videos, and apps where the ad may appear) [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A total of 4 Google AdWords campaigns ran for 10 days (August 28 to September 6, 2013) using the same list of keywords noted above.

Additional headlines hypothesized to be more attention-grabbing (ie, by asking a question: &#x0201c;Are you a gay or bi teen?&#x0201d;) were added. Google AdWords were active for 6 days (March 12-17, 2014) and generated 599 clicks, 42,092 impressions, a CTR of 1.4%, CPC of US $1.43, and a total cost of US $854.46.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment Efficiency</title><p>We received 236 completed screeners during the beta test recruitment, of which 68/236 28.8% did not meet the study eligibility criteria at the initial screening.

Again, no participants were enrolled through the Google AdWords campaign. It should be noted that the question querying how candidates heard about the research study was removed from the beta test Web-based screener. That said, no participants reported hearing about the study through Google AdWords.</p><p>It took 16 days to enroll 20 participants into the beta test. The length of time to complete enrollment exceeded that for previous recruitment activities because we newly implemented our targeting strategy to ensure a diverse sample of participants. This protocol was added at this step to ensure feasibility during the RCT enrollment effort.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomized Controlled Trial</title><sec><title>Advertisement Metrics</title><p>The same FB ad settings used in the beta test were implemented in the RCT. We were able to take advantage of a newly added FB targeting category that allowed us to advertise to users who were &#x0201c;interested in men and women&#x0201d;; previously, we were only able to target those who were &#x0201c;interested in men.&#x0201d; New ad images were used toward the end of field that were thought to be more salient to specific populations (ie, younger participants, nonwhite race; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref>, numbers 2-5). The FB ads were active for 52 nonconsecutive days between June 20 and October 31, 2014, and cost an average of US $12.54 to enroll each of the 302 RCT participants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Notably, 32.3% (US $1221.55/$3787.08) of the recruitment money was spent to reach and enroll the last 10% of the sample, as these represented the youth who were particularly difficult to reach (eg, 14- to 15-year-old black youth; 14-year-old youth). Excluding these participants, the average cost per enrolled participant was US $9.47.</p><p>In total, 4 Google AdWords campaigns using the same targeting criteria as above were active for 15 days (June 16-30, 2014) before they were discontinued.

Among the 1111 eligible or potentially eligible screeners received, 600/1111, 54.0% candidates were contacted sequentially based on their allocation bin during the enrollment period. Those who were eligible but their allocation bin was filled were not contacted. Among those contacted, 494/600, 82.3% candidates responded, and 342/494, 69.2% candidates spoke to study staff, ultimately resulting in the enrollment of 328/342, 95.9% participants, of whom 302/328, 92.1% were randomized into the RCT.</p><p>It took 148 days to enroll and randomize 302 participants at an average rate of 13.7 participants per week (range 1-28 participants). Research staff aimed to enroll between 15 and 20 participants per week, so that a manageable number of participants were actively receiving the intervention at any given time. An average of 1.54 contact attempts were required to enroll study participants (range 1-6).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Diversity</title><p>Screeners were more commonly completed by sexually experienced 865/1522, 56.8% than inexperienced 628/1522, 41.3% young men. Inexperienced youth were also slightly more likely to respond to staff outreach about the program, 258/494, 52.2% versus 236/494, 47.8%. In total, 1036/1522, 68.1% of the screeners were from white youth, compared with 91/1522, 5.98% from black or African American youth and 39/1522, 2.6% from Asian youth.</p><p>Facebook advertising was regularly adjusted based on the allocation bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3">Figure 3</xref>). For example, if all the bins for 18-year-olds were filled, we adjusted the targeting on FB ads to include only 14- to 17-year-olds. Also, when noticeably fewer screeners were received from 14- to 15-year-olds, in part because of fewer FB profiles of young people in this age range, we created FB ads that specifically targeted these younger teenagers. This purposeful sampling strategy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) resulted in a sample that was 14.2% black or African American and 23.2% living in rural settings.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Randomized controlled trial randomized participant demographic characteristics based on allocation bins (N=302).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="203" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" border="1"><col width="3" span="1"/><col width="100" span="1"/><col width="100" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="bottom"><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Participant characteristics<sup>a</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n (%)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Sexually experienced</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">153 (50.7)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">149 (49.3)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Age, years</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14-15</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">116 (38.4)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16-18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">186 (61.6)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Race</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">White</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">204 (67.5)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Black</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">43 (14.2)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">All other</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">55 (18.2)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Hispanic</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 (22.2)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">235 (77.8)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Sexual identity</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gay and/or queer</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">195 (64.6)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bisexual</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">107 (35.4)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Type of community</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rural</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">70 (23.2)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Urban</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">232 (76.8)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table2fn1"><p><sup>a</sup>Demographic characteristics reflect participant responses during the phone screener, as most of these questions were not again queried in the baseline survey.

Indeed, our Google AdWords outreach effort did not result in a single participant being enrolled. This is likely because our reach&#x02014;based on the keyword targeting we utilized&#x02014;was too diffuse. Beyond keywords, we could only target Google AdWords campaigns by location (eg, United States). Therefore, the people who saw our ads went well beyond our very specific population of interest. On the other hand, FB advertising was much more successful, resulting in the enrollment of 405/450, 90.0% of our study sample across the 4 research activities. The FB ad manager allowed the ad to be targeted on multiple criteria beyond location, such as gender, age, and the relationship interests that FB users indicate in their profile (ie, interested in men, interested in men and women). In sexual health research, this ability to target ads based on relationship interest can narrow the ad audience down to the target audience, in our case AGBM, thereby increasing recruitment cost-effectiveness and efficiency. It is worth noting that our experiences may not generalize to other populations and research topics, however [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Although our specific recruitment goals were identified before recruitment (eg, race, ethnicity, age), the ability to reach recruitment goals is nonetheless dependent on having those from diverse backgrounds actually see the recruitment advertisement and subsequently complete a screener. Although FB ad manager did not allow for tailoring based on diversity targets (eg, race, ethnicity) at the time, resulting screeners reflected a sufficiently diverse group of youth that allowed us to follow-up with youth who met our diversity goals. It should be noted that updating the ad image so that it better resonates with a specific population or targeting the ad to specific cities or states that have demographic profiles of interest can also invigorate sample diversity.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>These findings should be considered within the context of the study&#x02019;s limitations. For example, by targeting FB users through the &#x0201c;interested in&#x0201d; targeting category, we targeted those youth who are more likely out because they indicated their dating preferences on a social networking profile. However, FB users can choose to make specific parts of their profile private (eg, only visible to them or their friends), so that they can still complete their profile while limiting who is able to see their information (eg, parents, nonfriends). Additionally, by recruiting on FB, this inherently excludes those youth who are not on FB. Given that FB continues to be the most popular social networking site for teenagers, however [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], this recruitment method still provides a unique opportunity to reach a national sample of adolescents. Indeed, some may wonder why we did not use other Web-based recruitment strategies such as the Turk. This is because our goal was to test the interest of our intervention among AGBM teenagers in places where they &#x0201c;hang out&#x0201d; online rather than places where people go to earn money.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This research has elucidated important and effective strategies for utilizing social media for the recruitment of youth to research. The utilization of social media for recruitment of hard-to-reach youth, particularly sexual minority teenaged males for whom privacy may be an issue, is increasingly important as targeting these youth for health, support, and sexual health programs is a public health imperative. Although our research indicates the cost-effectiveness and overall efficiency of using Facebook in particular for recruiting AGBM into research, alternative social media strategies should be explored as they become more popular with youth. It will be essential to continue documenting successful outlets for recruitment of hard-to-reach youth. Given that the research project we described herein was sensitive in nature and we were able to demonstrate success in Web-based recruitment, we are confident that these strategies can be utilized to recruit AGBM for research related to sexual health topics and perhaps other topics. Additional research is needed to demonstrate the success of these strategies with other populations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge all study participants for their vital role in completing this study.
