Measurement of lactate concentration in blood seeks to indirectly gauge physiologic responses to the increase in physical exercise. Swimmers face multiple maximal-exertion events during competition. Strenuous physical exercise leads to fatigue and, thus, a decrease in sports performance.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1941738113500769"><title>Hypothesis:</title><p>Regeneration exercises in swimming increase the clearance of blood lactate and therefore improve athletic performance within a single day of competition.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1941738113500769"><title>Study Design:</title><p>Crossover study.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1941738113500769"><title>Level of Evidence:</title><p>Level 1.</p></sec><sec id="section5-1941738113500769"><title>Methods:</title><p>Of 25 swimmers, 21 were included, with a mean age of 17 years. They performed exercises that increased blood lactate on 2 days. The protocol was a warm-up, followed by a 100-m freestyle workout at full speed. Swimming exercises followed that were increasingly demanding, during which serial lactatemia measurements were taken. On the first day, regeneration exercises were performed; on the second day, the swimmers rested. Next, lactatemia was measured, and a timed 100-m freestyle workout was performed at maximum speed.</p></sec><sec id="section6-1941738113500769"><title>Results:</title><p>The stress exercises increased the mean lactate concentration by 4.6 mmol/L, which corresponds to 78% of the initial basal level. The postregeneration lactatemia level was lower than that after resting (mean, 2.76 vs 6.51 mmol/L). The time to swim 100 m after regeneration was 68.11 seconds, while that after rest was 69.31 seconds.</p></sec><sec id="section7-1941738113500769"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Blood lactate levels rose by up to 78% after the intensity of the training sessions was progressively increased. Regeneration exercises increased the rate in which blood lactate dissipated, in comparison with passive recuperation. The rate of lactate dissipation for regeneration exercises was 68%. This factor may have improved the physical performance of swimmers.</p></sec><sec id="section8-1941738113500769"><title>Clinical Relevance:</title><p>Regeneration exercises improved the performance of swimmers in maximal-exertion competition in a single day.

This prospective study followed 25 young swimmers; 4 were excluded because they did not complete the cycle of measurements required for the study. The mean age was 17 years (range, 15-19 years), and participants had a mean body mass index of 22.22 and mean fat percentage of 11.35%. The protocol consisted of 3 stages. The pretest stage consisted of a 20-minute warm-up of stretching exercises both in and out of water and a timed 100-m freestyle swim at peak performance, followed by a 5-minute rest. In the second stage, an exercise protocol of increasing intensity was performed, with serial lactatemia measurements based on an existing training program.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1941738113500769" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-1941738113500769" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This protocol consisted of 3 sets of freestyle sprints (4 &#x000d7; 200 m) with increasing intensity. The first set was performed at 65% to 70% intensity, the second at 80%, and the final set at 100%. Exercise intensity was adjusted to each participant&#x02019;s heart rate through a Polar RS400SD running computer with heart rate monitor (Polar Electro, Lake Success, New York) (intensity: 70% = 150<italic>x</italic>&#x02032;, 80% = 160<italic>x</italic>&#x02032;, 100% = 180<italic>x</italic>&#x02032;-190<italic>x</italic>&#x02032;). Between each set, lactatemia was registered using an Accutrend lactate analyzer (Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana) 3 to 5 minutes after the end of the series.</p><p>The final stage was dichotomous, and the 2 groups of swimmers were randomly selected. The first group performed active recuperation exercises (regeneration) with 20 minutes of low-intensity swimming (50%-60%); the second group rested (passive recuperation). After the recuperation period, the performance evaluation stage consisted of a 100-m freestyle swim at maximum speed. Lactatemia levels were measured after the regeneration exercises and after the rest period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941738113500769">Figure 1</xref>). The Shapiro-Wilk test was initially used to evaluate the distribution of data.
