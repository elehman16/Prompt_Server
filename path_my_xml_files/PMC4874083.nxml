Thus, this study was designed to compare efficacy of intravenous dexmedetomidine and propofol for moderate sedation during spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Material and Methods:</title><p>A total of 120 patients of age group 18-60 years of American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I &#x00026; II, posted for surgeries under spinal anesthesia were randomly divided in to three groups (<italic>n</italic> = 40 each); Group D received infusion of dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg over 10 min followed by maintenance infusion of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. Group P received infusion of propofol 6 mg/kg/h for 10 min followed by the infusion maintenance of 2.5 mg/kg/h. Group C (control group) received normal saline. Level of sedation (using observer's assessment of alertness/sedation score), pain intensity (by visual analogue scale), onset and recovery from sedation, hemodynamic changes, and overall patient's satisfaction were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The onset and recovery from sedation were significantly earlier with propofol (15.57 &#x000b1; 1.89 min vs. 27.06 &#x000b1; 2.26 min; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) however intraoperative sedation (level 4), and overall patient's satisfaction was significantly better with dexmedetomidine group (p &#x0003c; 0.05).

The intense sensory and motor block, continuous supine position and the inability to move the body also brings a feeling of discomfort and phobia in many patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Thus, sedation has been shown to increase patient satisfaction during regional anesthesia. Moderate sedation is defined as &#x0201c;A drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by mild tactile stimulation. No intervention is required to maintain a patent airway and cardiovascular stability.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Earlier, this kind of sedation was popularly known as &#x0201c;conscious sedation&#x0201d; but Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JCAHO) in 2001 has coined the term moderate sedation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Many agents have been used for this purpose. Continuous infusion of propofol is a useful method for sedation because of the easy titratibility and rapid emergence. Intravenous (i.v.) dexmedetomidine prolongs the duration of spinal anesthesia, provides sufficient sedation, with fewer side effects.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Hence we designed this study to evaluate the sedative, hemodynamic and side effects of i.v. dexmedetomidine and propofol when used for intraoperative moderate sedation alongwith spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>The present prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical study was conducted after obtaining permission from institutional ethical committee on 120 American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I-II patients, between 18-60 years of age, of either sex posted for surgeries under spinal anesthesia. Patients using &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> -adrenergic receptor antagonists, calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, having dysrhythmias, or a body weight more than 100 kg were excluded from the study.</p><p>Informed written consent was taken from all patients. The patients were allocated to either of the three groups using computer generated random numbers. Group D (dexmedetomidine group) received an initial dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg infused over 10 min, followed by maintenance of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. Group <italic>P</italic> (propofol group) received an initial dose of 6 mg/kg/h infused over 10 min followed by maintenance of 2.5 mg/kg/h. Group C (control group) receiving normal saline infusion.</p><p>Standardized anesthetic protocol was followed in all the patients. No premedication was given to any patient. Patients were informed to communicate about the perception of any pain or discomfort during surgery. Preoperative sedation level was assessed using modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale (OAA/S).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Once the patients were shifted to the operating room, the patients were connected to multipara (IntelliView Phillips MP30) for monitoring noninvasive blood pressure monitor, pulse oximeter, and electrocardiogram. Baseline measurements were recorded. A large vein was chosen for intravenous i.v. access and 18G cannula was secured. All patients were preloaded with 15 ml/kg of ringer's lactate prior to spinal anaesthesia. Under aseptic precautions, lumbar puncture was performed at L3-L4 interspace with Polymed 25G Quincke type spinal needle. After free flow of CSF had been obtained, 3.5 ml of 0.5% Bupivacaine heavy was injected into the subarachnoid space. Patients were then made to lie in the supine position. Study drugs were started according to the group allocated, after assessment of maximum sensory blockade.</p><p>The onset of sedation was taken as time taken to reach OAA/S score of 4 as it most closely meets the condition of moderate sedation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The infusion of propofol and dexmedetomidine was continued at a constant rate throughout the procedure and was not altered till a sedation score of 3. Level of sedation was assessed at every 5 min interval. The infusion was stopped 10 min before the completion of surgery. ECG, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure (MBP), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded every 5 min intervals after baseline measurements till end of procedure.</p><p>Duration of effective analgesia (time interval between administration of spinal to first request for supplementary analgesics) and recovery time (time taken to return to sedation score 4 or more on modified OAA/S scale after stopping the infusion of study drugs) was recorded in all the patients studied. Overall satisfaction of patients was also assessed.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The side effects such as nausea, vomiting, hypotension, respiratory depression, shivering, pruritus, motor weakness, and seizures were noted both intraoperatively and postoperatively. During the procedure, if bradypnea (RR &#x0003c;10) or SpO<sub>2</sub> 92% or less were recorded, 4 L/min of supplemental oxygen was administered via a nasal cannula with reducing rate of infusion of the drug aiming to awaken the patient and to resume his normal breathing. Hypotension (MBP &#x0003c;50) was treated with fast 0.9% normal saline and i.v. bolus of mephenteramine 6 mg and bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;50) with 0.5 mg of i.v. atropine stat, with a reduction in the rate of infusion.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Statistical analysis was done using Graph Pad InStat 3 software.

Arain, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] noted that the targeted sedation was achieved within 10 min with propofol but took 25 min with dexmedetomidine. Similar results were obtained by Abdelkareim, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Both Groups D and <italic>P</italic> had significantly deeper level of sedation as compared to Group C.

Recovery time was shorter in Group <italic>P</italic> as compared to Group D possibly due to rapid metabolism and excretion of propofol. The finding of our study correlates well with the results of previous authors.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Mean duration of effective analgesia was significantly prolonged in the dexmedetomidine group as compared to propofol group and control group. Our finding is comparable to the results of other authors.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Dexmedetomidine produces analgesia by binding to adrenoreceptors in the spinal cord. Jorm and Stamford, observed that dexmedetomidine has an inhibitory effect on the locus coeruleus (A6 group) which is located at the brain stem.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This supraspinal action could explain the prolongation of spinal analgesia after i.v. administration of dexmedetomidine.</p><p>In our study, a significant decrease in mean HR with dexmedetomidine was observed at 5 min of starting the infusion. This difference persisted throughout the procedure and could be attributed to sympatholytic properties and vagal mimetic effects of dexmedetomidine. The results of our study correlate well with Al-Mustafa, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Mahmoud, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>MBP was significantly decreased in Group <italic>P</italic> at 5 min after starting infusion and persisted throughout the procedure as compared to Group D and Group C. There was no significant difference in MBP from baseline value in Group D and Group C throughout the whole duration of procedure. The fall in MBP in patients receiving propofol could be attributed to direct powerful inhibitory effect of propofol on sympathetic outflow causing vasodilatation. Dexmedetomidine is also known to decrease sympathetic outflow and circulating catecholamine levels and would, therefore, be expected to cause a decrease in MBP similar to those of propofol. However, larger doses of dexmedetomidine have a direct effect at the postsynaptic vascular smooth muscle to cause vasoconstriction, and it is possible that the sympathoinhibitory effects of dexmedetomidine were slightly opposed by direct &#x003b1;-2 mediated vasoconstriction. Results similar to our study were observed by Arain, <italic>et al</italic>.;[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Al-Mustafa, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Mahmoud, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Both propofol and dexmedetomidine are known to have minimal respiratory depression when used as sedative agents which is evident for our results wherein the EtCO<sub>2</sub> level, SpO<sub>2</sub>, RR did not differ significantly from baseline among all the three groups. Ryu, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] observed that dexmedetomidine was associated with fewer incidents of oxygen desaturation and a reduced need for the oral cavity suction than Remifentanil during flexible bronchoscopy. Postoperative shivering was significantly reduced in the dexmedetomidine group as compared to the control group. Similar results were obtained by Jabbary, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] who observed no post anesthesia shivering in all the patients who received clonidine premedication irrespective of opium addiction (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).</p><p>The above factors such as better sedation, stable cardio-respiratory profile and analgesic effect resulted in significantly better overall patient satisfaction in the dexmedetomidine group. Results of our study correlate well with those of Arain, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"
