There are few animal studies that have reported the enhancement of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain with citicoline (exogenous cytidine-5&#x02032;-diphosphocholine). A study aimed at determining whether citicoline (50 mg/kg., twice daily) could influence retinal catecholamine levels in adult male Albino rabbits, has reported that, compared to vehicle-treated controls, citicoline-treated animals displayed a significantly higher retinal dopamine concentration and a tendency toward an increase in adrenaline concentration, while the noradrenaline concentration remained unchanged.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Citicoline is an intermediate in the making of phosphatidylcholine, a phospholipid, in cell membranes. Citicoline activates the biosynthesis of structural phospholipids in the neuronal membranes, increases brain metabolism, and influences the levels of different neurotransmitters. It has been shown to increase acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels in the central nervous system. Citicoline is currently used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and stroke as a brain stimulator.</p><p>Citicoline is presently also tried in the treatment of amblyopia.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, studies to evaluate the effect of citicoline in amblyopia have not been conducted in India.

Subjects who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected for the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. The study was divided into two phases. In Phase 1, a complete history of the included patients was elicited including family, personal, and birth history. Visual acuity was tested with the Snellens chart. Dry retinoscopy and Wet retinoscopy were conducted followed by acceptance and prescription of the required glasses. Ophthalmic examination and slit lamp examination were performed for anterior segment examination. Dilated fundoscopy was carried out to rule out any retinal pathology.</p><p>The following tests were conducted:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Complete refractive status of both eyes</p></list-item><list-item><p>Binocular single vision by stereo charts and Worth four-dot test</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cover test/uncover test for the amount of squint and type of squint, added vertical or oblique deviation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Alternate cover test</p></list-item><list-item><p>Extraocular movements</p></list-item><list-item><p>Prism cover test</p></list-item><list-item><p>Forced duction test as per the case, local or general anesthesia</p></list-item><list-item><p>Dilated fundoscopy for the macular shift in cases of oblique overaction or eccentric fixation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Direct ophthalmocopy for eccentric fixation in strabismic amblyopia</p></list-item><list-item><p>Observation of result on initial patching therapy in strabismic cases.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Color vision testing.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Following this, the patching therapy was started in both groups. The patients were followed at one month intervals and visual acuity was recorded. If there was no improvement in the visual acuity for three consecutive followups, then a plateau was considered. It was approximately corresponding to the maximum correction that could be achieved with patching. Once a plateau was achieved, the patient entered phase 2 of the study.</p><p>In phase 2, group I received citicoline in addition to continued patching. The doses of citicoline were 250 mg OD (for patients below five years) and 500 mg OD (for patients above five years). Group II continued to receive only patching. In both groups, the respective treatment was continued for six months in phase 2. At the end of this period citicoline was gradually tapered by giving half the dose daily for two months, half the dose on alternate days for another two months, and then discontinued. Patching was continued for 12 months in both groups.</p><p>The patients were followed at one month intervals for 12 months in phase 2. The visual acuity was recorded in every followup visit. Visual acuity was converted into the Logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR). The mean LogMAR visual acuity was calculated in both the groups. Proportional improvement in the visual acuity, adjusted for fellow eyes, was calculated using the following formula, suggested by Stewart C E <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Proportional improvement = (VAas &#x02013; VAae)/(VAas &#x02013; VAfe)</p><p>Where VAas is the LogMAR visual acuity of an amblyopic eye at the start of the study (baseline); VAae is the LogMAR visual acuity of the amblyopic eye at the end of the respective interval; and, VAfe is the LogMAR visual acuity of the fellow eye at the end of the respective interval.</p><p>Age: 1, (maximum 6:1) schedule was followed for patching. For example, for a patient of five years, 5:1 schedule was followed (five days full-time patching for the better eye and one-day patching for the worse eye). For a patient of 10 years, 6:1 schedule was followed.</p><p>The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the significant difference between the mean LogMAR values. Differences in the proportional improvements were tested with a non-parametric test like the Mann Whitney U test. Other tests like Chi-square test and <italic>Z</italic>-test were also used at appropriate places. Analysis was done using SPSS 16.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>In the study period 165 patients were primarily screened for inclusion in the trial.

This study has suggested that addition of citicoline, even after maximum improvement with conventional patching was achieved, can further improve the visual acuity.</p><p>Citicoline primarily acts by increasing the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, the primary neuronal membrane phospholipid, thus enhancing the production of acetylcholine. Oral citicoline administration increases the plasma levels of choline and cytidine, the building blocks used to restore neuronal membrane integrity.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] It is also postulated that citicoline facilitates the preservation of sphingomyelin, which promotes signal transduction in nerve cells.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Citicoline may significantly impact the brain-remodeling activity. A study in rats has shown that citicoline treatment significantly increases the length and branch points of the dendrites, increasing the overall surface area occupied by neurons, which leads to an increased efficiency of sensory information processing. This mechanism of activity may potentially account for a significant portion of citicoline's neurorestorative functions.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>Campos <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] have also recorded that citicoline was effective in the treatment of amblyopia. They published the preliminary results of their study and stated that statistically significant improvement in visual acuity was found both for the amblyopic and sound eye in 46 of the 50 patients (92%). The behavior was different for normal and amblyopic eyes. The improvement remained stable for at least four months. Similarly Porciatti <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] recorded that visual acuity improved 1.4-1.5 lines in the amblyopic eyes and 0.4 lines in the normal eyes with citicoline. They also reported improvements in the contrast sensitivity and increase in the visually evoked potential. This study was conducted in adults with a mean age of 24.8 years. Ghosh S and Ghosh R, in a study on amblyopic patients, in the age group of 10 to 18 years, reported that 71% of the patients had shown visual improvement with citicoline.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>Our findings were in contrast with the findings of Michela Frenisa <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] who have reported that addition of CDP-choline to patching therapy was not found to be more effective than patching alone after a 30-day treatment. They have reported that adding CDP-choline to patching stabilized the effects obtained during the treatment period.</p><p>There are few limitations of this study, which must be documented. This was not a double-blind study rather it was an open study. This could have resulted in observer or investigator bias. Second, we have analyzed only those subjects whose follow-up data was available up to one year in phase 2. Therefore, there was a problem of attrition, which may have affected the results. No imputation methods have been used to fill the missing values. Nevertheless, this study has shown that the addition of citicoline to patching therapy can significantly improve the visual acuity in amblyopic patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Attebo</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Cumming</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Jolly</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Sparkes</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence and causes of amblyopia in an adult population</article-title><source>Ophthalmology</source><year>1998</year><volume>105</volume><fpage>154</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9442792</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group.
