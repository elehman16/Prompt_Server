It also causes a transition to a new biological situation which results in a gradual loss of fertility.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Transition to menopause starts with a change in menstrual cycle length of more than 7 days different from the normal length in the presence of high levels of follicle-stimulating hormone. Menopause, which is diagnosed after 12 months of amenorrhea, marks the end of menstrual cycles.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Menopause is a manifestation of aging as well as a predictor of diseases and health-related problems in old ages.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] During this period, reduced ovarian activity is associated with reduction in hormone levels, hot flashes, menstrual disorders, feeling a constant urge to urinate, urinary bladder inflammation, and being prone to urinary tract infections.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It typically occurs in women aged between 40 and 60 years. At present, the average age of menopause in women is 51 years.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The various complications experienced by postmenopausal women are divided into short-term and long-term types. Short-term complications include vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats that affect 80% of women at some point in the menopausal transition) and physical symptoms (including cardiac diseases, sleep disturbances, joint and muscle pain, and urogenital symptoms such as sexual and urinary bladder problems) as well as psychological problems (depression, irritability, mood swings, anxiety, dysphoria, feelings of sadness, and restlessness). However, long-term complications include cardiovascular diseases and osteoporosis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In general, 30&#x02013;40% of postmenopausal women suffer from psychosocial problems such as fatigue and insomnia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Moreover, the prevalence of symptoms among such women has been reported up to 65%. Several factors can affect sleep disorders in postmenopausal women. Among these factors, which cause sleep disorders in such women, snoring is more common. As women age, their sleep becomes lighter. Hot flashes and night sweats also intensify the problem.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Hypnotic drugs are known as the first-line treatment of insomnia. However, such medications have serious potential side effects that can be minimized by using nonpharmaceutical methods.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Acupressure is one of the mentioned methods. This alternative medicine technique is derived from acupuncture therapy, in which the acupuncture points are stimulated using finger and palm pressure.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Energy channels (usually called meridians) start at the direction of pressure points on the skin and then connect to the brain and a particular meridian associated with a specific organ. Meridians are distinct channels which circulate electrical energy throughout the body. A master communication system of life energy helps to achieve a better connection of the organs with all sensory, physiological, and emotional aspects of the body.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Similar to acupuncture, this technique can effectively cause muscle relaxation, decrease pain, and increase comfort by raising the level of endorphins in the brain. It also regulates physical mechanisms that induce muscle relaxation and improve sleep quality.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Manipulating this pressure point can strengthen, relax, and spread Chi, which is the fundamental life energy, such that it can ultimately flow easily and smoothly throughout the body. Accordingly, a balanced and harmonious relationship between the mind and body is created which, in turn, can reduce or eliminate the symptoms and complications of the disease.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Acupressure is now used increasingly because it is inexpensive and does not require specialized equipment. It is also an effective, safe, quick, and noninvasive treatment.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Moreover, it can be easily applied and learned. Nurses are in an excellent position to apply such techniques. Furthermore, because many patients become nervous when facing the needle, acupressure is a more convenient alternative to acupuncture.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Pilates-based exercise is another nonpharmaceutical approach. Pilates (or Contrology) is defined as the complete coordination of body, mind, and spirit. During the exercise sessions, individuals initially take complete control of their own body through Contrology in a purposeful manner and then achieve a normal coordination by repeating exercises gradually and progressively.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Pilates-based exercise program has been approved by physicians as a unique method of physical fitness in which a combination of techniques, such as muscle strengthening, lengthening, and breathing, has been used to develop trunk muscles and restore muscle balance.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Unlike traditional resistance exercises in which the muscles are trained in isolation, such program needs activation and coordination of several muscle groups at a same time with a holistic approach.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Contrology fosters coordination among body organs, modifies incorrect body position and movement, restores life energy to the body, and increases mental capacity. Pilates-based exercises are trained in a manner that helps prevent sports injuries.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Both acupressure and Pilates exercise program create a balanced and harmonious relationship between the body and mind.</p><p>Nordio and Romanelli consider stimulation of wrist acupoint (Shenman point) as a reliable and effective method without any side effects.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Another study proved the efficacy of acupressure in the treatment of cancer-related insomnia.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The results of several studies showed that acupressure and acupuncture techniques can lead to the release of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, which induce a sense of relaxation.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Another study reported that certain peptides are released during acupuncture which have analgesic and sedative effects.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Considering the high prevalence of sleep disorders among women and the lack of clinical trials available on Pilates-based exercises in the field of nursing science and gynecology, the researchers attempted to establish a connection between the mentioned sciences and traditional medicine by relying on authentic and reliable scientific articles and teachings of traditional medicine elders. In the present study, we aimed to compare the effects of acupressure and Pilates-based exercises on sleep quality of postmenopausal women, aged 40&#x02013;60 years who were referred to medical clinics affiliated to the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in 2014.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was a single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial registered in the registry of clinical trials (IRCT registration number: IRCT2014042017344N1) 2014 year of the study.

Demographic data included age, educational level, employment status, history of diseases, and menopausal status. PSQI is a self-report questionnaire that assesses the sleep quality of an individual over a 1-month interval. It comprises 9 questions measuring seven components including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disorder (sleep fragmentation), use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. Obtained score ranges from 1 to 21, whereby a score of &#x02265;5 indicates poor quality of sleep.

Majority of the participants were married (95.37%) and housewives (90.74%). The mean (SD) age of menarche was 13.41 (1.51), 13.38 (2.15), and 13.41 (1.61) in the Pilates, acupressure, and control groups, respectively. Furthermore, the mean (SD) age of menopause was 51.08 (2.61), 50.25 (3.05), and 50.72 (2.51) in the Pilates, acupressure, and control groups, respectively.

Almost 50% of postmenopausal women suffer from sleep disorders which can negatively affect their quality of life.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Considering the growing population of postmenopausal women, raising the level of their health seems quite important. Currently, several therapeutic methods have been employed in the treatment and management of insomnia, among which pharmaceutical treatment has been the most commonly used.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Because of various side effects such medications may cause, recently nonpharmaceutical interventions have been strongly recommended.</p><p>According to traditional Chinese medicine, there are several acupoints on human's body, such as Shenman, Yanglingquan, and Anmian, and stimulating them can help to induce sedation and improve sleep quality. Similarly, stimulation of Fengchi, Shenman, Yanglingquan, and Anmian acupoints increase the brain's levels of serotonin and melatonin, induce relaxation, and naturally enhance sleep quality.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Furthermore, several studies have shown that taking deep diaphragmatic breaths during Pilates exercise program helps to control stress, and thereby reduces sympathetic nerve activity, which is effective in recovery of health-related symptoms such as sleep disorder.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Intergroup comparison showed no significant difference between the two intervention groups indicating that both acupressure and Pilates-based interventions had almost similar effects on increasing sleep quality scores (<italic>P</italic> ~ 1). There was also no significant difference between the groups with respect to the mean scores of sleep quality subscales, except the subscale of daytime dysfunction, reflecting that Pilates-based exercises were more effective than acupressure in improving daily functioning.</p><p>Many studies have confirmed the effectiveness of Pilates-based exercises and acupressure in improving sleep quality. Similar to our findings, Mohammad <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated the positive effects of Pilates-based exercises on sleep quality.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Arab <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that acupressure intervention could decrease the total score of PSQI and its subscales including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disorders, and daytime dysfunction.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Similarly, Hoseinabadi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] proved the effect of acupressure on sleep quality in Iranian elderly nursing home residents. A review article on acupuncture analgesia revealed that acupressure on the Shenman point could improve insomnia up to 2 weeks after the intervention.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Moreover, Caldwell <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] proved that Pilates exercise is an effective intervention, which can help to improve mental parameters in college-age individuals. Likewise, we can conclude that Pilates-based exercises can positively affect sleep quality, mood, and self-efficacy (mental parameters) in all age groups.</p><p>The results of the present study showed a significant improvement in our participants sleep quality after a 12-week intervention. Our findings were consistent with those of Leopoldino <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] who studied the effect of Pilates exercises on sleep quality in a sedentary population and found that their sleep quality significantly improved after the exercise program.

Moreover, deep breathing increases oxygen delivery to active muscles and oxidation of fat cells, lowers estrogen, and increases progesterone levels.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Accordingly, it can improve individuals' psychological symptoms as well as their sleep quality.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] It seems that physical activity can improve sleep-affecting mood symptoms (stress and anxiety) through the mechanism which affects brain endorphins.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</p><p>The results of the present study indicate that Pilates-based exercises and acupressure can both be applied in all therapeutic, preventive, and supportive fields as effective alternative and complementary methods. Such techniques can improve sleep quality and reduce the complications caused by drug use and dependence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It can be concluded that Pilates-based exercises and acupressure can effectively improve sleep quality. Considering the efficacy and novelty of these approaches in Iran, it seems that proposing and applying such methods in the treatment of insomnia not only would be welcomed by clinicians but can also be used as a background for further and broader studies.
