This widespread and devastating disease has still not been conquered. Judicious use of fluoride through different ways has a great impact on the arrest of initial carious lesion as well as the severity of dental caries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Extensive clinical and epidemiological research has been carried out to explore the multifaceted nature of the preventive roles of fluoride. The effectiveness of fluoridated dentifrices is an integral part of caries preventive strategy. Fluoride dentifrices have been accepted as the most practical and effective approach toward prevention of dental caries, simultaneously providing the benefits associated with improved oral hygiene.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Since the introduction of fluoride dentifrices, varieties of changes in formulations have taken place resulting in improved anti-caries efficacy. The forms of fluoride used in dentifrices have been sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate, and amine fluoride. One such innovation has been the addition of calcium glycerophosphate and sodium monofluorophosphate to dentifrices. Literature reveals that very few studies have been conducted using this formulation, especially in developing countries like India.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Therefore, the present study was carried out with the dentifrice containing sodium monofluorophosphate and calcium glycerophosphate against a placebo dentifrice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study protocol</title><p>This project was as an 18 month, randomized, double-blind clinical study registered with the Director, Indian Council of Medical Research, Government of India, New Delhi, India. The present study was conducted using dentifrice containing sodium monofluorophosphate (1000 ppm) and calcium glycerophosphate as the active ingredients in comparison with placebo dentifrice. No commercial brand of toothpastes was used. Since it was a blind study, both toothpastes were specially formulated, labeled by the Pharmacologist/Chemist at the Pharmacology Department as Tube A and Tube B and handed over to the examiner for the study. Both pastes (50 g each) were prepared using common ingredients of commercial non-fluoridated toothpaste with sodium monofluorophosphate and calcium glycerophosphate as additives in Paste A (revealed after the study).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Area of study and the participants</title><p>The study was designed and carried out in schools situated in Mumbai, India. The necessary approval for the study was taken from the school board and ethical committee clearance was obtained from the concerned authorities. A written consent from parents of the children participating in this study was obtained. The fluoride content of drinking water in schools was estimated to be 0.09 ppm. The total number of participants was 595 (271 girls and 324 boys) school children in the age group of 12&#x02013;15 years, who had at least one carious tooth. Selected children were divided into two groups according to the dentifrice given and were randomly assigned to the two groups (the participants were allotted numbers, and thereafter a table of random numbers was used for allocation into either control or test group). Simple random sample was utilized. Care was taken to have the proper representation of the age groups in both the groups (i.e. control and test). The control group had 293 children and the test group had 302 children. The control and test dentifrices were prepared and packed in white tubes of 50 g each by the chemist of the Pharmacology Department and handed over to the examiners blinded to the ingredients, coded as &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;B,&#x0201d; respectively. The active ingredients in test dentifrice were sodium monofluorophosphate (1000 ppm) and calcium glycerophosphate. The control dentifrice was placebo (placebo had all characteristics and ingredients of test toothpaste but without active fluoride content). Participants (both control and test groups) consumed drinking water with negligible fluoride content at 0.09 ppm. Also, no systemic/topical fluoridation program had been undertaken in the study area. Further, the participants (both groups) habitually used toothpastes without fluoride as it was more economical. The children and parents were motivated to comply with the conditions and schedule of the study, i.e. no other household member would use the assigned dentifrice and children would brush with pea-sized toothpaste twice daily (after breakfast and before going to bed) for 2 minutes. Medically/physically compromised patients and those undergoing orthodontic treatment were not included in the study. (None of the participants were on fluoride regime, either systemic or topical.)</p><p>In the present study, the diet diary revealed that the children consumed their customary diet which was not different from routine dietary practices.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Clinical examination and data collection</title><p>Oral examination was done and findings were recorded as per the criteria specified by WHO (Oral Health Assessment Form &#x02013; 1997).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Dental plaque was disclosed with the plaque disclosing solution in dilutions of 1:50 with deionized distilled water (PLAK-SEE; ICPA Health Products, Mumbai, India) and recorded as per Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Brushing technique (Bass method)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] was demonstrated to the children and they were asked to follow it.
