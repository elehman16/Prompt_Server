The study aimed to evaluate the effect of monthly sodium bicarbonate with a single (SBCG1) or double dose (SBCG2) of calcium gluconate injections on OA of the knee; as well as the efficacy and safety of both SBCG interventions in the long term.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A double-blind parallel-group clinical trial with 74 knee OA patients was performed during 12&#x000a0;months, both SBCG interventions were followed-up for another 6mo after intervention. The outcome variables were the Western Ontario-McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the Lequesne&#x02019;s functional index and joint-space width changes from serial radiographs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After 12&#x000a0;months, group SBCG1 decreased &#x02212;14.8 (95% CI:-14.2, &#x02212;17.0) and group SBCG2 decreased &#x02212;14.6 (&#x02212;16.9, &#x02212;12.4) in the global WOMAC score, the mean changes represent 80% and 82% lessened pain, respectively. In the Lequesne Functional Index scale, SBCG1 decreased &#x02212;11.9 (&#x02212;10.4, &#x02212;14.2) and SBCG2 decreased -11.9 (&#x02212;13.8, &#x02212;10.0), representing 66 and 69% of improvement. Both mean scores were maintained after intervention discontinued. SBCG2 improved the knees&#x02019; joint space width more than SBCG1 at 3 and 18&#x000a0;months.

OA may affect several joints, especially weight-bearing joints such as the knees. A joint&#x02019;s cartilage degradation is clinically recognized by a gradual development of pain, stiffness, and loss of motion. Among the elderly, hip and knee OA causes a greater degree of disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is estimated that 9.6% of men and 18% of women above 60&#x000a0;years have symptomatic OA primarily in the knees and hips [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Therapeutic management of OA of the knee has focused on pain relief, preserving or improving the range of motion and preventing secondary functional disability as well as joint damage. Besides surgery, which is recommended for severe cases, there are a wide variety of OA therapies commonly used: Non-pharmacological treatments are mainly aimed to unload the joint, such as weight loss or the use of lateral wedge insoles for medial OA of the knee; and pharmacological therapies which include analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), opioids, hyaluronic acid (HA) or corticosteroid injections and various drugs purported as disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to a recent review of knee OA therapeutic responses, HA injections, corticosteroids injections and opioids have demonstrated the highest effect of the recommended treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, none of these interventions have demonstrated to halt the disease progression. Moreover, several side effects have been demonstrated, mainly from oral NSAIDS treatments, which have been associated with gastrointestinal side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and opioids have been strongly associated with constipation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, somnolence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. HA injections may lead to increase medial co-contraction and accelerate joint deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Corticosteroid injections, although they have not demonstrated to change the functionality of the knee, they are associated with reductions in knee pain over 2&#x000a0;weeks, however, these clinical improvements disappear by 4&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and it is unsafe to inject it more than 4 times per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, therapies appear to be misdirected and a different approach should be used to evaluate different alternatives.</p><p>Past research on OA treatments reported a beneficial effect of large doses of bicarbonate on certain chronic joint diseases; the effect was attributed to its alkalinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Previous research also found a beneficial effect of calcium gluconate on arthritis and other rheumatic diseases, this compound operates by allowing the linkage between chondrals and bone proteins, which avoids the hyperosmotic and acid conditions of the extracellular matrix and allows recovery of the homeostatic mechanisms of the cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore a pharmaceutical solution of a combination of these two compounds might be beneficial to treat knee OA patients.</p><p>The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an intra-articular administration of a sodium bicarbonate solution combined with two different concentrations of calcium gluconate injections on progression of symptoms and joint space width as well as the safety of these injections in patients with knee OA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients eligible for the study were males and females aged &#x02265;40&#x000a0;years with at least 1&#x000a0;year of being diagnosed with OA of the knee. According with the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, OA was confirmed with physical exploration diagnosis of knee pain plus one of the following: bone crackling with movement, morning stiffness &#x02264;15&#x000a0;min, age&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;years or articular hypertrophy. And grade II-IV knee OA was confirmed by radiology according to the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Patients diagnosed with grade I were referred for a less invasive treatment and patients with grade IV were included to evaluate the treatment effect in OA most advanced conditions. Three physicians examined and diagnosed the recruited patients, two were orthopedic specialist and one was surgeon specialized in radiology. Exclusion criteria included: An intra-articular injection of any substance administered within the last 3&#x000a0;months, joint inflammatory diseases, microcrystalline arthropathies, current pregnancy, uncontrolled hypertension, active infection, undergone surgery/arthroscopy within the last 3&#x000a0;months and diagnosis by radiography of knee OA Kellgren and Lawrence grade I, coagulation or platelet disorders or any concomitant disease that could interfere with the evaluation,. Patients were enrolled by public advertising and were studied at the San Jos&#x000e9; Hospital in Queretaro, M&#x000e9;xico.</p><p>The study was conducted in compliance with ICH (International Committee of Harmonization) Good Clinical Practices and the Declaration of Helsinki, and its applicable amendments. It was approved by the institutional review board for human research of the University of Quer&#x000e9;taro and all subjects voluntarily signed informed consent before being enrolled in the study.</p><p>A total of 26 patients per experimental group were necessary to detect a clinically significant change of 20% within experimental treatments, from baseline to post treatment evaluations in the global score of Lequesne Index and Western Ontario and McMastern University Index (WOMAC) indexes considering an estimated standard deviation of 35%, a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and a statistical power of 0.8. Considering a possible drop-out rate of 35%, 72 patients had to be recruited. In addition, the mentioned sample size can find a significant difference of 30% between two experimental groups&#x02019; changes in the global score of Lequesne and WOMAC. The parameters used to calculate the sample size were estimated from the results of a pilot study previously carried out with 18 participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-design clinical trial. Patients were followed up during 12&#x000a0;months with treatments and for 6&#x000a0;months after intervention to evaluate a longer term effect and safety of the treatment. Subjects who met the selection criteria were randomly assigned to receive one of two treatments in both knees (except for 2 patients with prosthesis only one knee was intervened): 1) Sodium bicarbonate and calcium gluconate (SBCG1) 2) Sodium bicarbonate and a double dose of calcium gluconate (SBCG2). The randomization method was based on a list of randomly assorted treatments, generated by using an online computing program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. One researcher that had no direct contact with patients created the randomization list and delivered it to each physician that examined the patients who were assigned to each physician in a systematic order. The treatment was administered to each patient every 30&#x000a0;days by one of the 3 trained and experienced physicians who followed the same patients throughout the study. In the baseline evaluation and in the monthly scheduled visits during intervention period and post-intervention follow-up, patients were clinically evaluated with the WOMAC and Lequesne questionnaires and also monitored for adverse events. All the fieldwork personnel were blinded to the treatments.</p><p>Knee radiographs were taken to each patient at baseline, after 3&#x000a0;months, after 12&#x000a0;months of intervention and also after 6&#x000a0;months of post-intervention follow up. Patients were not permitted to receive concomitant treatment with analgesic or systemic corticosteroids.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatments</title><p>The treatments were identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration and appearance. Both treatments, SBCG1 and SBCG2 were pharmaceutical compositions in aqueous solution (5&#x000a0;mL) ready for intra-articular infrapatellar injection. They were prepared at the pilot plant of the Center for Research and Technological Development in Chronic Disease (Cindetec A.C.). The SBCG1 treatment was a solution with sodium bicarbonate and calcium gluconate, both at a concentration of 7.5% (w/v); and SBCG2 had the same concentration of sodium bicarbonate than SBCG1, while the concentration of calcium gluconate was 15% (w/v).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy outcome variables were the changes from baseline to post-intervention assessments in the WOMAC, and Lequesne&#x02019;s functional indexes and joint space width.</p><p>The WOMAC OA index is a validated, multidimensional, disease specific, health status measure. It provides with clinically important patient relevant symptoms in the areas of pain, stiffness and physical function in patients with hip and/or knee OA. It consists of 24 questions in three separated subscales: pain, physical function and stiffness. Each subscale score weighed 10 points, and the WOMAC global scale is the sum of the three subscales and ranges from 0 to 30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The Lequesne index is a 10-question interview-style survey that includes evaluation of pain or discomfort, maximum walking distance and daily activities performance. The total questionnaire is scored on a 24 points scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Joint space width changes were assessed on radiographs that followed standardized techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. At each time point 4 knee radiographs were obtained per patient, to get from each knee a standing anterior-posterior and lateral views. All radiographs were taken by the same technician and were interpreted by 2 independent physicians who were blinded to treatment, both with certifications in orthopedics and traumatology. The outcome measure was the progression of joint space narrowing as suggested by Abadie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. One independent collaborator, blinded to treatment measured joint space width in radiographs by visual reading according to a validated method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] at the joint&#x02019;s narrowest point using an X10 magnifying lens graduated at 0.1&#x000a0;mm intervals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Safety evaluation</title><p>The safety of experimental treatments was assessed with reported adverse events, defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporary present during the intervention period, whether or not related to the treatment. Adverse events were either reported by the patient or discovered by physicians during visits. Adverse events were classified into light, moderate, serious and lethal according to the Mexican Official Norm for Drug Surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition patients were monitored with laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry and urine analysis) at baseline, 12 and 18&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Baseline demographic variables and treatments&#x02019; compliance were analyzed with the chi square test. The collected data were analyzed in an intention-to-treat basis with subjects that received the allocated intervention and attended to at least one post-treatment evaluation. The WOMAC, and Lequesnes&#x000b4;s functional indexes&#x02019; mean values were calculated for each evaluation and a Student <italic>T</italic> test was used to evaluate the significance of changes at each post-treatment evaluation compared with baseline evaluation. Mean changes between both treatments at each evaluation were compared with ANOVA.</p><p>In the radiographies' analysis, the narrowest joint space from both measurements in each knee was selected for analysis. Mean values were calculated for both knees joint spaces and a paired <italic>T</italic>-test was performed to evaluate joint space change for each treatment. To evaluate the response between treatments, a Generalized Estimating Equation model was performed to evaluate joint space changes, this model considered the correlation between each subject&#x02019;s knees and the baseline values as a covariate.</p><p>To evaluate safety of the treatment, adverse events were classified by seriousness and were quantified to get the incidence of each adverse event.</p><p>All statistical models were tested at the 0.05 level of significance. Analyses were performed with SPSS&#x000ae; for Windows version 18.0 (IBM&#x000ae;).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 123 patients were initially screened for the study between December 2007 and February 2008, 50 did not meet the inclusion criteria or refused to participate. A total of 74 subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups, one refused to receive the allocated intervention, 21 refused to continue at some point during the trial due to personal reasons and 1 due to a rash that according with the physician should not continue with the treatment. Thus, 51 patients finished the intervention and follow up period (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow of patients through the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2015_568_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The baseline demographic characteristics of the patients that initiated the study and the patients that completed the study did not differ among the experimental groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The baseline values of the WOMAC index of patients involved in this study corresponded to symptoms of mild to moderate severity.</p><p>The study confirmed that both SBCG formulations improved OA symptoms during and after a period of 12&#x000a0;months and that the effect was maintained for 6 additional months without treatment. These improvements exceeded those that have been considered clinically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. According to a review of Raynauld et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], intra-articular injection of hyaluronate reduced knee pain in patients with OA by 20-40% over 6&#x02013;12 months. In another randomized, placebo controlled trial, patients taking 1500&#x000a0;mg oral glucosamine sulfate daily for three years showed significant reduction of 34.1% in total WOMAC index compared with baseline values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In the present study, both treatment groups experienced a reduction on the WOMAC global scale of 84% which is a substantial functional improvement.</p><p>Similarly, both experimental groups improved the pain, maximum walking distance and daily activities scores according to Lequesne&#x000b4;s functional index. A reduction of about 30% in Lequesne&#x000b4;s functional index has been defined as an effective treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In a 3-year, randomized double-blind study, a treatment with glucosamine sulfate produced a reduction of about 20% in the Lequesne&#x000b4;s index total score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In another study, five weekly intra-articular injections of hyaluronate produced a reduction of 45% after 6&#x000a0;months (from 10.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.7 points at baseline to 5.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.2 points after treatment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In the present study, the mean improvement in the Lequesne&#x000b4;s global score after 12&#x000a0;months was of 70 and 64% for SBCG1 and SBCG2 groups, respectively. These changes are above the values used to define treatment effectiveness and more effective than previous studies. No further changes were observed during the 6&#x000a0;months follow-up period which shows that the benefits of the administration of this solution will remain for at least six months.</p><p>The effect of the experimental treatments on joint space width, was evaluated by measuring the change in width of medial tibio-femoral joints&#x02019; space since it is the primary outcome recommended by several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. After one year of treatment, a slight narrowing of joint-space width was observed in the SBCG1 group. The SBCG2 group did not experience a narrowing in joint space during the intervention period. Several studies have assessed the natural narrowing of joint space width in patients with OA, it has been observed a joint-space width change of about &#x02212;0.6&#x000a0;mm/year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A large long-term study has shown that a joint space narrowing of no more than &#x02212;0.1&#x000a0;mm/year could bring clinical benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The mean joint space narrowing in the SBCG1 group was above that value (&#x02212;0.37&#x000a0;mm), this suggests that although SBCG1 relieves symptoms of OA, the lower concentration of calcium gluconate does not stop its natural progression. In contrast, administration of SBCG2 prevented this naturally occurring joint space narrowing (0.36&#x000a0;mm). This effect was evident after the first year of treatment and remained after 6&#x000a0;months follow-up with no treatment. Therefore, a higher dose of calcium gluconate may decelerate joint space narrowing or even widen the joint space. Calcium gluconate may produce a similar or greater effect than glucosamine sulfate, a compound that has proved to modify the joint structure, since several reported clinical trials have shown a little change in joint-space width (~ &#x02212;0.06&#x000a0;mm/year) with glucosamine sulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, the effect of calcium gluconate on joint-space narrowing found in the present study could be even more beneficial than glucosamine sulfate in a longer term. Moreover, according to Abadie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] SBCG2 may have the characteristics to become a DMOADs. Thus, further research needs to be performed to confirm the effect of the experimental treatment in joint space narrowing compared with other potential pharmacological drugs.</p><p>The experimental treatment was developed upon previous works on the beneficial effect of large doses of bicarbonate on certain chronic joint diseases because of its alkalinity. Schweiz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] administered intra-articular isotonic sodium bicarbonate 1-29% in several doses from 0.5 to 2.0&#x000a0;mL at 2-day intervals. Two to four injections were administered depending on each patient&#x02019;s symptoms improvement. The knee-joint was the most often and most successfully treated. Additionally, Beckett in a US patent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], described the use of an aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline bicarbonate solution useful for preventing and treating inflammatory diseases such as OA. It has been documented in <italic>in-vitro</italic> studies that sodium bicarbonate activates the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> -HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> exchanger which promotes a recovery of the intracellular pH of chondrocyte leading a normalization of intracellular metabolic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]; and as a result, a rearrangement of the extracellular matrix is expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>The effect of calcium gluconate in the treatment of inflammatory diseases was also reported previously. Walter in a US patent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] described the use of corticosteroid combined with calcium gluconate for arthritis and other rheumatic diseases that involved an inflammatory process. Recently, Kang et al. demonstrated that calcium gluconate has a protective effect against OA through inhibition of COX-2 and related chondrocytes apptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Calcium compounds applied simultaneously with corticosteroids in the treatment of rheumatic diseases, reduced inflammation. It has also been reported that calcium gluconate allows the linkage between chondrals and bone proteins, which avoids the hyperosmotic and acid conditions of the extracellular matrix and allows recovery of the homeostatic mechanisms of the cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism of action of the SBCG formulation has not been fully elucidated yet. The effect of sodium bicarbonate and calcium gluconate over clinical symptoms of OA and joint space could be due to its effects on cartilage metabolism, including stimulation of anabolic activities, such as the synthesis of proteoglycans, and the depression of catabolic activities such as the effects of caspase-3 and Poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) a key mediators of apoptosis of chondrocytes.</p><p>To clarify the precise mechanism by which SBCG formulation produces a beneficial effect on knee OA, further studies with longer follow-up period and different designs are needed. Although significant therapeutic effects of intra-articular injection of SBCG for knee OA were observed in this study, the following limitations must be considered: 1) Since recruited patients attended to the hospital to get an OA treatment, it was not appropriate to provide a placebo treatment, thus all patients received treatment. 2) There was no active-control treatment, a review of results from similar studies that use the same evaluation scales was considered enough to evaluate the treatment&#x02019;s effect compared with other treatment options. 3) The sample included a wide range of OA severity and segmented analyses based on the severity of OA were not possible to perform due to lack of statistical power. 4) Another limitation of the study was that radiographic views were used to assess joint structural changes; it is known that magnetic resonance imaging is more accurate; however significant differences were found with the increased variability that radiographs could cause. The findings in this study are applicable to Hispanic adults with knee OA that are seeking for a treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings of the present study demonstrate that a combination of sodium bicarbonate and calcium gluconate administered once a month directly into the knee joint produces a highly significant reduction of pain and improvement in physical function measured with WOMAC total score and Lequesne&#x000b4;s functional index starting from the first intervention. The experimental formulation&#x02018;s improvement is maximized until 10 to 12&#x000a0;months; and its beneficial effect is maintained for at least 6&#x000a0;months after the administration is discontinued. Only when the dose of calcium gluconate is increased, it eliminates further narrowing of joint space. Although the possible mechanism is not known at present, the administration of these two physiological substances in combination represents a highly effective and safe alternative for the treatment of knee OA.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>OA</term><def><p>Osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HA</term><def><p>Hyaluronic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAIDs</term><def><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WOMAC</term><def><p>Western Ontario-McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBCG</term><def><p>Sodium bicarbonate and calcium gluconate</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>This study was partially financed by Nucitec SA de CV.
