</p><sec id="epi12998-sec-0007"><p>The responsive neurostimulator system (RNS System; NeuroPace Inc., Mountain View, CA, U.S.A.) provides an opportunity not only to treat medically intractable partial seizures but also to evaluate the characteristics of long&#x02010;term ambulatory electrocorticography (ECoG). The system includes a cranially implanted neurostimulator connected to one or two depth or cortical strip leads that are implanted near one or two seizure foci. The RNS System detects specific patterns of ECoG activity, provides closed&#x02010;loop electrical stimulation at a seizure focus, and stores ECoG activity, all based on physician&#x02010;programmed parameters.</p><p>To assess long&#x02010;term ambulatory ECoG data, a first step is to determine the interrater reliability in identifying ECoG seizures. Despite the long history of ECoG,<xref rid="epi12998-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> few have evaluated the reliability in identifying potential electrographic seizures recorded from intracranial electrodes. None have evaluated ECoG recordings obtained from chronic ambulatory devices.

A subset has characteristics suggestive of electrographic seizures: (1) a <italic>long&#x02010;episode</italic>, an event for which detection of epileptiform activity continued beyond a preset physician&#x02010;defined duration; and (2) a <italic>saturation</italic>, an event with amplitudes exceeding amplifier sensitivity. Approximately four 90&#x000a0;s ECoG samples were stored at any one time, after which new ECoG recordings overwrote the oldest. To free neurostimulator memory, patients were instructed to transfer data daily and after a clinical seizure from the neurostimulator to an external remote monitor. Thus, the numbers of ECoG recordings from each patient varied with detection parameters, the nature of the EEG pattern, and the frequency with which patients transferred the data.</p><p>Subjects included had a continuous period &#x02265;84&#x000a0;days beginning at least 18&#x000a0;months after implant in which settings were optimized and held constant. The ECoG recordings reviewed were the first 100 most recent long episodes and saturations (for a maximum total of 200 events) stored during the 84&#x02010;day sampling period. ECoG recordings consisted of four bipolar channels recorded at 250&#x000a0;Hz, a band pass of 4&#x02013;90&#x000a0;Hz, and a standard review sensitivity of 0.8&#x000a0;mV peak&#x02013;peak.</p><p>Qualified reviewers interpreted ECoG studies while blinded to patient, neurostimulator settings and leads, and each other's interpretations. We defined an &#x0201c;electrographic seizure&#x0201d; as a sustained rhythmic discharge, including repetitive spiking or spike&#x02010;and&#x02010;wave pattern faster than or equal to 2&#x000a0;Hz, with definite evolution in frequency, location, or morphology, and clearly distinguishable from background, lasting at least 10&#x000a0;s in duration.<xref rid="epi12998-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> &#x0201c;Nonseizure&#x0201d; samples consisted of epileptiform activity or nondescript patterns.</p><p>An agreement rate and Fleiss&#x02019; kappa statistic<xref rid="epi12998-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> were calculated for the all and for individual pairs of reviewers. Because particular patients with &#x0201c;difficult&#x0201d; ECoG patterns could account for the bulk of disagreements, intrapatient agreement rates were calculated for patients with greater than the median number of ECoG recordings reviewed (representing those with sufficient samples from which to calculate intrapatient agreement).</p><p>ECoG recordings were then grouped by interrater results into (1) those that both reviewers identified as electrographic seizures; (2) those that both identified as nonseizures; and (3) those that one reviewer ranked as electrographic seizure and the other as nonseizure.

The majority of detections were electrographic seizures, but those detections classified as &#x0201c;nonseizures&#x0201d; usually contained abnormal, epileptiform activities. The bottom quartile of patients accounted for interrater agreement rates worse than 75%, meaning that detections from the majority of patients yielded highly reliably interpreted events.</p><p>This is the first study of the interrater reliability of seizure detections obtained from long&#x02010;term ambulatory ECoG, and one of the few studies of interrater reliability of ECoG seizure interpretation. Disagreements may arise from the definition of seizures and follow those ambiguities well established in interpretation of ictal versus nonictal epileptiform activity.<xref rid="epi12998-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="epi12998-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> One of the strengths of this study&#x02014;the total number of events exceeded 7,000&#x02014;may also be a weakness, as the on&#x02010;line system facilitated rapid review of many recordings. A more traditional print&#x02010;based review of far fewer recordings may have yielded higher agreement rates. The limited spatial acquisition (four channels maximum) may also affect reliability when compared to the &#x02265;128 channels of intracranial EEG monitoring.</p><p>ECoG studies with poor interrater agreement&#x02014;mainly periodic discharges or low amplitude fast activities&#x02014;are those that are difficult to classify in other areas of EEG interpretation. For example, periodic discharges fall into the hole of clinical correlation noted in algorithms of possible nonconvulsive status epilepticus.<xref rid="epi12998-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> Although periodic discharges as seizures remain controversial, their appearance in ambulatory ECoG samples supports the concept of periodic discharges as a marker of the epileptic lesion.<xref rid="epi12998-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Low&#x02010;amplitude fast activities also were less reliable because establishing evolution or duration was ambiguous.</p><p>The RNS System is a therapeutic rather than a diagnostic device. Although continuously monitoring, the RNS System does not continuously record. One can review only what was detected and stored. In practice, the neurostimulator may make hundreds of detections a day&#x02014;based on patterns that precede that patient's seizures&#x02014;and provide brief (usually 100&#x000a0;msec) bursts of stimulation, amounting to &#x0003c;6&#x000a0;min per day. Those that are preferentially stored are episodes suggestive of an electrographic seizure. To assess whether these ECoG episodes can be correlated with the patient's clinical seizure frequency, it will be necessary to define the clinical significance of each of these types of detections.</p><p>Physicians in the RNS System trial<xref rid="epi12998-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> strived to set parameters to achieve detection of typical seizures. The finding that a minority of patients accounted for agreement rates &#x0003c;75% meant that programming parameters allowed recording of activity that could be reliably interpreted in the majority. In other words, most events stored by the RNS System occupy clear ends of the interictal&#x02010;ictal spectrum on physician interpretation. Subsequent studies using the recording capabilities of the neurostimulator&#x02014;for example, evaluations of detection frequency, temporal distribution, or location&#x02014;can be undertaken with greater confidence. Further work will be needed to reliably use ECoG studies recorded by the RNS System as surrogate markers for electrographic seizures.</p></sec><sec id="epi12998-sec-0012"><title>Disclosure of Conflict of Interest</title><p>Felice Sun and Emily Mirro are employees of NeuroPace.
