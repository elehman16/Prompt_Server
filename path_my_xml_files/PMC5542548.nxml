Changes in HRV due to altered prefrontal cortex functioning can be predicted using the neurovisceral integration model, which suggests that prefrontal hyperactivity increases parasympathetic tone and decreases contributions from the sympathetic nervous system. Working memory (WM) tasks and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been used independently to modulate brain activity demonstrating changes to HRV in agreement with the model. We investigated the combined effects of prefrontal tDCS and a WM task on HRV. Bifrontal tDCS was administered for 15 minutes at 2mA to 20 participants in a sham controlled, single-blind study using parallel groups. A WM task was completed by participants at three time points; pre-, during-, and post-tDCS, with resting state data collected at similar times. Frequency-domain HRV was computed for high frequency (HF; 0.15&#x02013;0.4Hz) and low frequency (LF; 0.04&#x02013;0.15Hz) power reflecting parasympathetic and sympathetic branch activity, respectively. Response time on the WM task, but not accuracy, improved from baseline to during-tDCS and post-tDCS with sham, but not active, stimulation. HF-HRV was significantly increased in the active tDCS group compared to sham, lasting beyond cessation of stimulation. Additionally, HF-HRV showed a task-related reduction in power during performance on the WM task. Changes in LF-HRV were moderately inversely correlated (r &#x0003e; 0.4) with changes in WM accuracy during and following tDCS compared to baseline levels. Stimulation of the prefrontal cortex resulted in changes to the parasympathetic branch of the nervous system in agreement with a linearly additive interpretation of effects. Sympathetic activity was not directly altered by tDCS, but was correlated with changes in WM performance. This suggests that the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches respond differentially due to similar, but distinct neural pathways. Given the ease of HRV data collection, studies of prefrontal tDCS would benefit from collection of this data as it provides unique insight into tDCS effects resulting from propagation through brain networks.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Open access of our participant data has been restricted by the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee (HC 13278, contact: <email>humanethics@unsw.edu.au</email>) overseeing this study.

Alteration of prefrontal cortex activity has been independently demonstrated to modulate HRV using both non-invasive brain stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and cognitive tasks reliant on prefrontal functioning [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, several outstanding questions remain. Specifically, whether brain stimulation of the prefrontal cortex alters HRV at rest, whether these effects outlast the period of stimulation, and what the combined effect of both prefrontal cortex brain stimulation and a task known to predominantly engage regions of the prefrontal cortex is on the autonomic nervous system.</p><p>The prefrontal cortex is known to modulate brain regions involved in the regulation of autonomic nervous system activity, such as heart rate [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Both parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of the nervous system are mediated by cortical-subcortical pathways which involve the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the insula, the hypothalamus, and the brainstem [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The neurovisceral integration model posits that the prefrontal cortex regulates and tonically inhibits activity in limbic structures which act to supress parasympathetic activity and activate sympathetic circuits&#x02013;see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181833.g001">Fig 1</xref> [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Variation in the output of these two branches of the autonomic system produces heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic nervous functioning [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, activation of the prefrontal cortex results in change to HRV [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which can be thought of as a measure of the aggregate effect of activity in a complex brain network, regulated top-down by the prefrontal cortex. According to the model, hyper-activation of the prefrontal cortex inhibits the sympathoexcitatory circuit of the amygdala, which is known to have outputs relevant to autonomic regulation [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This in turn reduces sympathetic activity and parasympathetic suppression, culminating in a reduction in heart rate.</p><fig id="pone.0181833.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0181833.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Neurovisceral integration model.</title><p>(A) Simplified depiction of the neurovisceral integration model described by Thayer and Sternberg [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

For example, Gianaros et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found evidence for associations between working memory task difficulty, corresponding decreases in vagally mediated HRV, and a concurrent change in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, a meta-analysis of the relationship between cognitive and emotional processes and HRV found significant associations in key areas such as the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex via changes in rCBF [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The effects of moderating prefrontal function have also been studied using non-invasive brain stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation which modulates neuronal functioning, resulting in both excitation and inhibition of neuronal activity at regions of interest that lie between the electrodes [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an important node in the fronto-parietal network [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], has been the focus of much tDCS research due to its relevance for psychiatric illnesses [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and its role in subserving higher level cognitive functions, including working memory [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Brunoni et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] investigated the effects of anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC during performance on an emotional picture viewing task, finding increased vagal activation, as measured using the power spectra of heart beat intervals within the high frequency (HF) range (0.15&#x02013;0.4Hz). However, to-date no study has investigated the effects on HRV of prefrontal tDCS under resting state conditions, though the neurovisceral model would predict that increased activation of the prefrontal cortex leads to an increased parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic output.</p><p>HRV has been used to examine task-induced cognitive stress, demonstrating an inverse relationship between working memory load and sympathetic activity i.e. greater demands on working memory, which require higher levels of operator effort, suppress output to the sympathetic branch of the nervous system [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, working memory load has been correlated with prefrontal connectivity [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], suggesting this outcome is in agreement with the neurovisceral integration model, which predicts a reduction in tonic suppression of the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, thereby increasing vagal tone, whilst simultaneously decreasing sympathetic activity [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. TDCS, when administered to the prefrontal cortex during a working memory task, has been shown to augment performance [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, the facilitatory effects of prefrontal tDCS during a working memory task could be expected to decrease the relative mental load placed on the participant, resulting in performance enhancement as well as mitigation of the cognitive stress-related inhibitory effect on sympathetic activity. Furthermore, the neurovisceral model predicts a positive relationship between parasympathetic tone and performance on the cognitive task due to increased prefrontal activation.</p><p>Here we investigate changes in HRV induced by prefrontal tDCS and a working memory task subserved by the left DLPFC using the neurovisceral integration model as a theoretical framework to interpret results. Using the model, stimulation of the left DLPFC using only tDCS is expected to increase parasympathetic tone and diminish sympathetic activity relative to sham. Similarly, improvements in cognition mediated by prefrontal regions are anticipated to correlate with HRV markers of parasympathetic and sympathetic branches (positively and inversely, respectively). Finally, these changes should continue beyond stimulation due to the lasting neuroplastic effects of tDCS, which have been reported to last up to an hour [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Materials and method</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty healthy participants were randomly allocated to receive either active or sham tDCS. All participants provided informed consent prior to participation. Recruitment was achieved through a university website, and thus attracted predominantly students (mean age: 22.8 &#x000b1; 3.5; range: 18&#x02013;30). Exclusion criteria included significant psychological or neurological illness, excessive alcohol or illicit substance abuse, smoking, and ambidextrous or left-handed applicants assessed using the Edinburgh handedness test [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The experimental protocol was approved by the UNSW Human Research Ethics Committee (HC13278) and all participants gave written informed consent prior to participation. This study forms a subset of a larger study of the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance using concurrent EEG.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Protocol</title><p>To investigate the effect of prefrontal tDCS on HRV and the relationship with cognitive functioning, we acquired electrocardiography (ECG) before, during and after tDCS to the left DLPFC while participants were at rest or performing a working memory task. Participants were comfortably seated in a chair in a partially soundproofed room and placed in front of a computer screen positioned at approximately eye level. The working memory task we used was a visual 3-back task, which was adapted from Mull and Seyal [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The task required participants to press a key when the letter displayed on the screen matched the letter presented three trials previously. Participants were first given the opportunity to practice the task for five minutes, and were then stratified according to their performance on a second five minute long presentation of the same task. Stratification was achieved using d-prime (d&#x02019;) scores obtained from a similar experiment of working memory in healthy participants [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] into low (1.5 &#x02264; d&#x02019; score &#x0003c; 2.5), medium (2.5 &#x02264; d&#x02019; score &#x0003c; 3.5), and high (3.5 &#x02264; d&#x02019; score) performance categories. Following stratification, participants were randomised to receive either active or sham tDCS. Inquisit 4 (Version 4, Millisecond Software) was used to administer the working memory task and to record button presses.</p><p>Following stratification, setup of electrodes used for ECG, electroencephalography (EEG) and tDCS took approximately 30 minutes. The experiment itself took a further 35 minutes to complete and ECG was acquired for the entire duration. A baseline recording was first obtained for five minutes at rest. Participants then received tDCS for 15 minutes, during which they sat at rest for the first five minutes then performed a working memory task for an additional seven minutes. Following tDCS, participants were again at rest for five minutes prior to completing a working memory task again. Resting state activity was recorded with eyes open and focussed on a fixation cross presented on the screen.

Sham stimulation was gradually ramped up to 2mA over 30s, maintained in intensity for 30s to elicit paraesthetic sensation and preserve participant blinding [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and then ramped back down over a further 30s.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>ECG data acquisition</title><p>ECG data was obtained as part of an EEG recording set up using a 72-channel TMSi Refa amplifier (TMS International, Oldenzaal, Netherlands).

We hypothesised an increase in parasympathetic, and decrease in sympathetic, activity with tDCS onset, which would persist beyond stimulation, and correlate with performance on a working memory task. Differential effects were found on HRV for resting-state and task-related activity. Active tDCS resulted in increased HF power compared to sham, consistent with increased vagal tone with prefrontal stimulation, thought to reflect parasympathetic disinhibition. During task performance, tDCS both inhibited working memory performance and suppressed adaptive modulation of LF power, which was evident during sham stimulation, in response to a cognitively demanding task. Finally, changes in LF power from baseline were inversely associated with working memory performance across both conditions.</p><p>Unexpectedly, in our study working memory performance significantly improved in terms of faster response time under sham stimulation but not in the group receiving active tDCS. We think the most likely interpretation of this finding is that participants receiving sham tDCS improved due to a practice effect, whereas in those receiving active tDCS stimulation may have hindered the practice effect, i.e. faster responding on the working memory task.</p><p>In addition to impeding performance on the working memory task, active tDCS also resulted in a concurrent increase in parasympathetic tone. Interestingly, this disagrees with our initial hypothesis, which predicted better cognitive performance to coincide with greater HF-HRV as both are correlates of prefrontal activation [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Meta-analyses of prefrontal tDCS effects on working memory found that tDCS improved response time, but not accuracy, in healthy participants in agreement with our findings [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Using a similar working memory task (i.e. 3-back task), past studies have shown increased task performance accuracy compared to sham following anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These studies differed slightly from our experiment design in that they used a lower current intensity (1mA), and a montage placing the cathode on the contralateral supraorbital region (Fp2) instead of the right DLPFC, which may partly explain the opposite findings. Additionally, our electrodes were approximately half the area of the &#x02018;standard&#x02019; 5 &#x003a7; 7cm in use in the majority of tDCS experiments, resulting in a much greater current density at the stimulation site. Interestingly, a recent meta-analysis of prefrontal tDCS cognitive effects suggested that greater current density is a positive predictor of improved working memory performance outcomes in healthy participants [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], as examined in studies with a range of current densities of 0.03&#x02013;0.08 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. However, this study used a current density of 0.125 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, raising the possibility that the dose-response curve may have an inverted-U shape, and that higher current densities as used in this study may impair function in healthy volunteers.</p><p>The observed variations in HF-HRV can be interpreted as the aggregate outcome of linearly additive effects operating on different time scales; cumulative mental stress and fatigue due to the experimentation process [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; task-related cardioacceleration resulting in reduction to both parasympathetically and sympathetically mediated HRV [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; and finally, preferential activation of key brain regions (e.g. excitatory tDCS to the prefrontal cortex) altering HRV output in line with predictions from the neurovisceral integration model.</p><p>Our observation of increased HF-HRV, which occurred immediately during tDCS of the prefrontal cortex and endured beyond the end of stimulation, seems to accord with existing literature. Montenegro et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] found greater HF-HRV and reduced LF-HRV values following left temporal tDCS, indicating enhancement of cardiac parasympathetic activity and reduced sympathetic activity, respectively. Similarly, anodal stimulation of the left insular cortex in healthy elderly volunteers significantly raised HF-HRV and altered the sympatho-vagal balance (calculated as a ratio of LF/HF) in favour of greater parasympathetic tone [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Adopting a bifrontal tDCS montage comparable to the one employed in the current study, Brunoni et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] observed increased vagal activity during visual presentation of negative stimuli in a test of emotional arousal. Lastly, Petrocchi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] observed that a single 15 minute session of 2mA tDCS applied to the left temporal lobe was able to increase vagally mediated HF-HRV and produce a concurrent soothing positive affect. These findings are in agreement with the neurovisceral integration model, which proposes shared neural circuitry, originating from the prefrontal cortex, that both regulates the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system, and modulates cognitive activity [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, the left hemisphere has been linked to preferential regulation of vagal sinus arrhythmia [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and in particular the medial prefrontal cortex has been correlated with the vagal component of HRV, suggesting an inhibitory role on autonomic regulation [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, our findings can be interpreted as preferential activation of parasympathetic neural circuitry via increased activity of the left DLPFC, an important node in the prefrontal, using excitatory anodal tDCS. However, it is important to note that a clear picture regarding the effects of tDCS on HRV is yet to emerge, largely due to the scarcity of tDCS studies assessing HRV as well as the high degree of heterogeneity in experiment designs [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For example, two studies have reported null findings, showing no difference in HRV between sham and active tDCS in healthy participants at rest [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], while another noted an increase in LF-HRV following stimulation in direct contrast to our results [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>We observed significant reductions in HF-HRV during working memory task conditions compared to rest. This represents a robust finding in the HRV literature, for which there is considerable experimental supporting evidence [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Increases in respiration rate (both amplitude and frequency), heart rate, and blood pressure, which result in a corresponding decrease in HRV, are taken as symptomatic of an altered physiological state in response to task and are generally attributed to mental stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Thus, replication of these previous findings lends further credibility to our data.</p><p>Contrary to expectation, we were unable to find evidence of an association between working memory improvement and HF-HRV, though an inverse relationship was found with LF-HRV. Previous studies have developed research protocols using HRV measures as an independent variable by dividing participants at baseline into either high-HRV or low-HRV groups. The outcomes of these studies provide evidence linking cardiac parasympathetic activity to working memory. For example, Hansen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] showed that participants with a higher root mean square of successive interbeat interval differences (RMSSD; thought to reflect vagal modulation) at baseline had greater accuracy on a working memory task, and had a reduction in vagally mediated HRV during task presentation. This is consistent with our results, which found a significant reduction in HF-HRV during task presentation compared to baseline. However, these changes in HF-HRV were not associated with working memory performance. Beyond the tDCS literature, improvement of executive performance on a Stroop task has been associated with an autonomic reduction in HF-HRV (0.12&#x02013;0.4Hz band) and a corresponding decrease in the heart period [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Studies of the effects of cognitive load on HRV have shown similar results. An evaluation of HRV during a cognitively demanding working memory task, such as the 3-back task, revealed that the amplitude of the LF component (0.1Hz) decreased as the working memory load increased [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Comparably, spectral analyses of 10 healthy male participants showed a reduction in power in the LF component (0.06&#x02013;0.12Hz band) with increased task-related processing demands [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Likewise, physiological data in combat pilots showed a tendency for low frequency power to decrease during high levels of information load [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Our finding of a medium-to-strong inverse correlation between changes in LF-HRV and changes in working memory performance is, to the best of our knowledge, a novel finding. This association may reflect a link between sympatho-adrenal system suppression due to the cognitive stress brought on by a challenging memory task and the resulting impact such exertions of mental effort have on performance outcomes. Independent lines of research suggest that moderate-high levels of mental stress both increase LF-HRV [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and decrease working memory performance [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These results tentatively indicate that LF-HRV may be a measure of task-related engagement of the prefrontal cortex, revealing a shift in sympatho-vagal balance to incorporate a higher degree of sympathetic tone. Thus, participants who improved in working memory performance tended to show reduction in sympathetic tone (LF-HRV power) compared to baseline, whereas those who did not improve showed an increase in sympathetic activity. Additional research using larger samples is required to understand this relationship in greater detail and determine whether these findings are robust.</p><p>Speculatively, HF-HRV may primarily reflect tDCS-induced alterations to neural circuitry shared between the parasympathetic cardiac control network and the fronto-parietal network, which includes the DLPFC. LF-HRV, however, may predominantly measure the intersection between the sympathetic cardiac control network and cognitive control network required for working memory, which also includes the DLPFC [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In agreement with this interpretation is supporting evidence that the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system have similar, but distinct, neural pathways, although further research is required to understand these circuits in detail [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><sec id="sec015"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although previous studies have obtained significant findings with similar sample sizes, these have used within-subject designs to increase statistical power [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, our study is limited by its small sample size, and is likely underpowered to probe the more complex interactions of tDCS and HRV. However, agreement with past research suggests a consistent effect.</p><p>The current experiment design does not allow us to specify whether correlations between LF-HRV and WM performance are the result of generalised alterations to prefrontal cortex functioning or due to other brain regions involved in WM processing. Additional research utilising control tasks that also engage the prefrontal cortex, and/or engage the prefrontal cortex to a lesser extent than during WM processing, is therefore required to further explore this association.</p><p>Finally, the study design was cognitively demanding, which therefore may have resulted in excessive cognitive stress. This effect may have carried over into resting-state recordings of HRV and thus minimised ability to infer statistical significance. However, cognitive load was equivalent in both groups, therefore comparisons should yield valid differences. Future studies should allow additional time between tasks for participants&#x02019; HRV to return to baseline.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Measures of HRV present as potential indices for activation of cortico-subcortical neural circuitry following activation of the prefrontal cortex both during vagally dominated periods of resting-state activity and sympatho-adrenal mediated task-related activity. This network is shared for both cognitive processes, as well as regulation of cardiovascular control via changes to sympatho-vagal tone, and can be feasibly assessed using HRV in conjunction with more standardised behavioural outcomes. A frequency-domain HRV measure in the HF band, a marker of parasympathetic activity, was able to detect increased vagal activity both during, and in the 15 minutes following tDCS. Additionally, power in the LF band was found to correlate with changes in cognitive functioning, indicating an association between PFC activity and the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system.</p><p>Given the ease of HRV data collection (requiring as few as two electrodes), studies of prefrontal cortex stimulation would benefit from collection of ECG data as it provides additional insight into distributed effects of tDCS from propagation through pathways connecting the DLPFC. Future tDCS research might benefit from concurrent use of HRV in patient populations (as in Brunoni et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181833.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]) in conjunction with other physiological measures, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and galvanic skin response (GSR), and additional probes of cognitive functioning to develop a multimodal model of the efficacy of tDCS interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0181833.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Thayer</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sternberg</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name> (<year>2006</year>) <article-title>Beyond heart rate variability</article-title>. <source>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</source>
