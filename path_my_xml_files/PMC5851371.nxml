osteoarthritis in patients with different pain intensities. [Subjects and Methods] Sixty
subjects (37 men and 23 women) with moderate knee osteoarthritis participated in the
current study. Randomization software was used to select the participating subjects&#x02019;
numbers from the clinic records. They were classified into three groups according to pain
intensity: mild, moderate, and severe pain groups. All groups underwent a standard set of
pulsed electromagnetic field, ultrasound, stretching exercises, and strengthening
exercises. Pain intensity, knee range of motion, knee function, and isometric quadriceps
strength were evaluated using the visual analogue scale, universal goniometer, Western
Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index, and Jamar hydraulic dynamometer,
respectively. The evaluation was performed before and after a 4-week rehabilitation
program. [Results] All groups showed significant differences in pain intensity, knee range
of motion, isometric quadriceps strength, and knee function. The score change in moderate
pain group was significantly greater than those in mild and severe pain groups.
[Conclusion] Pain intensity is one of the prominent factors that are responsible for the
improvement of knee osteoarthritis. Consequently, pain intensity should be considered
during rehabilitation of knee osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Knee osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Pain intensity</kwd><kwd>Quadriceps strength</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Degenerative joint arthritis is the most common joint disorder that is caused by
biomechanical stresses affecting both the articular cartilage and subchondral bone.
Degenerative osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and is a major cause
of morbidity and functional limitation, especially in elderly patients<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The incidence of knee OA is expected to increase over the
next decades<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Knee OA is directly related
to disabilities due to pain, quadriceps dysfunction, and impaired proprioception. Moreover,
knee OA is responsible for the impaired ability of the quadriceps muscle to control force in
patients with OA. Nevertheless, exercise therapy is effective in reducing the pain and
improving the function of patients with knee OA<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Unlike many other pain conditions in which the underlying injury typically heals or
resolves, OA is a disease that does not resolve. Thus, OA is typically accompanied by
chronic pain. Whether, and to what degree, this ongoing chronic pain (i) plays an important
nociceptive role, (ii) represents maladaptive pain, or (iii) reflects other aspects of the
pain experience are not clear<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pain is one of the most commonly reported and prominent factors that are responsible for
physical inactivity in patients with knee OA<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. This impairment in physical activity associated with knee OA has
important implications for aerobic power and cardiovascular health. Hence, patients with OA
are at a particular risk of poor health outcomes<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pain pattern and severity of knee OA as either absent, mild,
moderate, severe, or very severe could affect the range of motion (ROM) that involves daily
activities and quality of life<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Moreover, muscle weakness in knee OA usually results in joint stiffness and decreasing ROM
that involves daily activities<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Quadriceps muscle impairment in knee OA is well documented in the literature. In addition,
the differences in the magnitudes of muscle strength are caused by the differences in the
subjects&#x02019; characteristics, OA severity, pain severity, and definition of the control
group<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with knee OA
experience chronic form of pain and show a declining ability to use their joints, which
consequently weakens the muscles. Hence, these destabilise the joints and reduce the
physical functions of patients; further, the motions required for the patients&#x02019; daily
activities become restricted<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although pain is a symptom of OA that is present in almost all classification criteria for
OA, there is often a discordance between reports of pain and radiologic OA<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is suggested that this discordance
applies, in particular, to the less severe grades of knee OA and that pain is more common in
more severe grades of OA (1 and 2)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, Erden et al. reported that pain
intensity and degrees of inaccuracy of knee joint position sense were positively correlated
at 60&#x000b0; and 90&#x000b0; knee flexions. The relationship between pain intensity and knee joint
position sense is very important for patients with OA in the improvement of rehabilitation
programs<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Given these findings, only
few studies have considered pain severity during rehabilitation programs for patients with
knee OA. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of a physiotherapy
treatment program on moderate knee OA with different grades of pain intensity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In this study, 78 patients with moderate bilateral knee OA were identified as potential
participants based on the orthopaedic physical therapy clinic records. Seven patients did
not meet the inclusion criteria, and five subjects refused to participate in the study. A
total of 66 patients were recruited via convenience sampling. The participants were
classified into three groups according to their pain intensity<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>: mild pain group (23 subjects), moderate pain group (21
subjects), and severe pain group (22 subjects). At the end of the 4-week treatment period,
outcome data were available for 20/23 patients in the mild pain group, 20/21 in the moderate
pain group, and 20/22 in the severe pain group. Some participants withdrew from the study
and were lost to follow-up. Thus, 60 subjects (37 men and 23 women) participated in the
current study.

Conversely, the exclusion criteria were as follows: inflammatory knee

intra-joint injection, and use of analgesics in the past 3 months<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
The study was conducted in accordance with the 1975 Helsinki Declaration principles, as
revised in 1996. The study procedures were approved by the institutional review board of
Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University (Approval No. P.T.REC/012/001751).</p><p>The intensity of knee pain was evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) after the
patients have remained in a weight-bearing state for 5 minutes (walking or standing)<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pain level was rated by each patient
from 0 to 10&#x02005;cm, where 0 represented &#x02018;no pain&#x02019;, and 10 represented &#x02018;unbearable pain&#x02019;. The
pain was also graded as follows: 0 to 4&#x02005;mm, no pain; 5 to 44&#x02005;mm, mild pain; 45 to 74&#x02005;mm,
moderate pain; and 75 to 100&#x02005;mm, severe pain<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on these grades, the three groups of knee OA were
created.</p><p>Measurement of active knee flexion ROM: While the patients were lying supine on an
examination table, active knee flexion ROM was measured using a plastic universal goniometer
with 25-cm arms, while the goniometer&#x02019;s pivot tip was placed on the femur&#x02019;s lateral
epicondyle. The patients maintained maximum flexion of the knee joint with hip flexion. The
angle between the maximum flexion and maximum extension was described as the excursion
range. The range was measured thrice, and the mean value was calculated<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The patients&#x02019; disability was evaluated using the valid and reliable modified Western
Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC)<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is a questionnaire that evaluates disabilities in
performing daily living activities. This method is relevant and appreciated for its
simplicity and allows assessment of the patients&#x02019; opinions of their functional
disabilities.</p><p>The isometric quadriceps strength was measured using Jamar hydraulic dynamometer
(Lafayette, IN 47903, USA). Such a device has been proven to have a good to excellent
reliability in different populations<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The patients were instructed to sit on
the side of the bed with their back flat, arms crossed, hip at 90&#x000b0; flexion, and knee at 30&#x000b0;
flexion. After ensuring stabilisation in these steps, the therapist held the dynamometer
between his hand and the patients&#x02019; limb segment. The dynamometer was positioned two finger
widths above the lateral malleolus on the anterior aspect of the tibia, and the patients
were then instructed to push the dynamometer with their maximum strength for 5 seconds. The
mean value of the three repetitions with 2-minute intervals was calculated<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the treatment program was firstly initiated for treating knee OA based on
the Battecha and Soliman program<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. All
groups underwent a standard set of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF), ultrasound (US), and
stretching and strengthening exercises. A PEMF device (ASA/Easy terza series, Italy) was
used to provide electromagnetic therapy. The pulse frequencies were 50&#x02005;Hz for the solenoids
and up to 100&#x02005;Hz for the applicators. The solenoid encircled the target limb segment at the
level of the knee. Each patient was exposed to low-intensity 15 GPMF (Gauss permagnetic
field) with a frequency of 50&#x02005;Hz for 30 minutes per session. Thereafter, a US device (ITO,
US/100, Japan) was used to provide deep heating therapy. Continuous US waves with a 1-MHz
frequency and 1-watt/cm<sup>2</sup> power were applied using a 4-cm<sup>2</sup>-diameter
applicator. The US therapy lasted for 5 minutes per session<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both PEMF therapy and US therapy were continued for three sessions
weekly for 4 weeks.</p><p>Immediately after PEMF and US application, each patient was asked to perform stretching
exercises and strengthening exercises in the following fixed sequence: hamstrings muscle
stretching and calf muscle stretching. The physical therapist repeated the passive
stretching exercises thrice per session. Each stretch was sustained for 30 seconds, with
10-second rest intervals<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. After a rest
period of 5 minutes, the patients were asked to perform the following: 1) isometric
quadriceps contraction (quadriceps drill) in full knee extension maintained for 5 seconds,
followed by a 5-second rest; the exercise was performed for 20 repetitions per session<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>; and 2) straight leg raising exercise in a
crock lying position (the patients were asked to tense the quadriceps muscle, elevate the
limb to 45&#x000b0; and maintain it for 6 seconds, and lower the limb slowly and then relax for 6
seconds; the exercise was performed for three sets of 10 repetitions per session)<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both stretching and strengthening
exercises were performed for three sessions weekly for 4 weeks. The evaluation and treatment
procedures were done for the patients by the same therapist before and after the treatment
period. They were instructed to maintain their activity levels during the study period<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM Corp.: Armonk, NY
USA) version 20.0. A one-way analysis of variance was used to compare the effect of the
physical therapy treatment on the VAS score, knee ROM, quadriceps strength, and WOMAC score
among the three groups with knee OA. Score changes were also calculated. The level of
significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The descriptive statistics of the VAS score, knee ROM, quadriceps strength, and WOMAC score

knee OA according to their pain intensity. The results of this study support the hypothesis
that a physiotherapy treatment program has different effects in patients with moderate knee
OA with different grades of pain intensity, indicating that the magnitude of pain is one of
the prominent factors that are responsible for the improvement of knee OA. However, these
results are not supported by the findings of K&#x000fc;lc&#x000fc; et al. who reported that there is no
relationship between VAS scores and regular physical activity habit and symptom duration in
patients with knee OA<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The patient classification completely depended on the pain intensity, since many previous
studies have shown that there is a discordance in the relationship between pain and
radiologic OA. There are patients with a Kellgren/Lawrence grade of 3 or 4 for knee OA
without any pain in the knee<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example,
29.9% of patients with Kellgren/Lawrence grade 2 and 64.1% of those with Kellgren/Lawrence
grade 3 in the knee in an open population study experienced pain at some points<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the pretreatment condition, it was observed that the patients with knee OA with moderate
and severe pain showed significant declines in the knee ROM, isometric quadriceps strength,
and level of functional performance, which may be due to the level of pain that resulted in
the weakening of muscle strength, instability of the knee joint, and decreased physical
function<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the impairments
of muscle activation are magnified in subjects with knee OA ranging from 8 to 25% in
populations of varying disease severities<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Reduced voluntary activation of the muscles and decreased
contractile rates are meaningful as these explain the strength decline and changes in muscle
size<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>, which were experienced by the
patients with knee OA with moderate and severe pain in the current study. However, a recent
study discovered that pain did not influence the thigh muscle electromyogram (EMG)
amplitudes or proprioceptive acuity in patients with mild and moderate knee OA during a
stair climbing task<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The rehabilitation program decreased the pain intensity and improved the knee ROM,
isometric quadriceps strength, and level of functional performance in all knee OA groups. In
addition, it was clear that the rehabilitation program had more drastic effects in the
moderate pain group. Thus, the levels of improvement in the moderate pain group were
superior to those in the other groups in all measurement outcomes. The compatibility of the
results of the VAS and WOMAC is consistent with the findings of Riddle and Stratford who
concluded that the WOMAC scores are most strongly associated with pain intensity in patients
with unilateral and bilateral pain<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The significant improvement in the muscle strength of the three groups might be explained
by the findings of Lewek et al. who reported that the arthrogenic inhibition of the
quadriceps muscles of patients with knee OA may be corrected using exercise training<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the results of the current
study are in line with the findings of Knoop et al. who reported that all grades of knee OA
severity can achieve improvement in pain and functional performance after an exercise
therapy program<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it should be
noted that this study included an exercise program only, which was applied in patients with
knee OA with different grades (mild, moderate, and advanced knee OA); conversely, the
current study included patients with moderate knee OA only, and the rehabilitation program
included stretching exercises, PEMF, and US. The difference in the intervention and patient
characteristics could explain the greater improvement in the moderate pain group than in the
severe pain group.</p><p>The lesser improvement level in the severe pain group in all outcome measures may be
explained by the greater inactivity caused by the higher pre-intervention pain levels
experienced by the patients in this group, which had profound adverse effects on skeletal
muscle function and metabolism in terms of weakness and atrophy<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the knee extensors have a prominent role in
resisting gravity; they undergo a greater magnitude of weakness and atrophy than other
groups of muscles during inactivity<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Conversely, the findings of this study revealed a trend toward greater improvements in the
moderate pain group, which can be explained by the greater reduction in the score change in
the pain in this group. In the same circumstances, the reduction of pain can improve the
level of function, ameliorate physical impairment<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>, and reduce the restriction of movements (knee ROM) as a protective
mechanism in patients with knee OA<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, the chronic form and level of pain can result in muscle weakness, and it seemed
that the greater pain reduction and strengthening exercises in this group were responsible
for improving the isometric quadriceps strength<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study has several limitations. Firstly, it did not have a control over the daily
activities of the patients. Secondly, the long-term effects of this treatment were not
identified. Thirdly, the outcome measures of the study did not involve functional tests,
such as the 6-minute walk test. Further research studies with longer durations evaluating
the effects of physiotherapy rehabilitation programs should be conducted on patients with
knee OA, especially those with severe pain. Finally, further studies are needed to examine
the effects of rehabilitation programs on the hip and ankle joints of patients with OA with
different degrees of pain, since previous studies have reported that examination of the hips
may be indicated in patients with knee OA<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, knee OA leads to weakness of the ankle joints, plantar
flexors, and dorsiflexors<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup> and deficits
in ankle proprioception<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, all patients with moderate knee OA with different grades of pain can benefit
from a physiotherapy rehabilitation program, which was shown to be highly effective in
patients with moderate pain, although this effect might be reduced in patients with severe
pain. Hence, the effects of physiotherapy treatment programs might be optimised by
identifying the grade of pain and subgroups of patients.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>No conflict of interest is declared by authors.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bosomworth</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Exercise and knee osteoarthritis: benefit or
