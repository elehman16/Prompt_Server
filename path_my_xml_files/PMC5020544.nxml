A postal survey was carried out during a separate study on preferences for different first-line CRC screening modalities (non- or full-laxative computed tomographic colonography, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy). Individuals were allocated at random to receive a pack containing information on one first-line test, and a paragraph describing CRC surveillance recommendations for people who are diagnosed with intermediate-risk adenomas during screening. All participants received a description of two surveillance options: annual single-sample, home-based stool testing (consistent with Faecal Immunochemical Tests; FIT) or triennial colonoscopy.

Eligible individuals are offered a biennial guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBt), followed by therapeutic colonoscopy if the initial test result is abnormal. Those who have adenomas detected are often referred for surveillance: Per current BCSP guidelines, standard practice is for individuals who have three or more adenomas (one of which is large; &#x02265;1&#x000a0;cm), or five or more smaller (&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;cm) adenomas to be considered high risk of developing CRC and recommended to undergo a colonoscopy in 12&#x000a0;months, followed by colonoscopies at 3-year intervals. Similarly, individuals who have one or more large (&#x02265;1&#x000a0;cm) or 3 or 4 smaller adenomas (&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;cm) are considered to be at &#x02018;intermediate risk&#x02019; of developing CRC, and are referred for triennial colonoscopies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Although annual colonoscopy is considered the optimal surveillance test for individuals at high risk of CRC, there are limitations to its use for surveillance of people at intermediate risk. It is resource-intensive and low yield; only approximately 3&#x000a0;% of&#x000a0;surveillance colonoscopies detect advanced adenomas in intermediate risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, around 20&#x000a0;% of those at intermediate risk (and even high risk) for CRC do not attend colonoscopic surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Factors associated with non-attendance of screening colonoscopy may include laxative bowel preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], anxiety about the procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], expectations of pain and embarrassment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and perceived unpleasantness of the test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hence, there is interest in the possibility of incorporating alternative tests into surveillance in order to mitigate these issues and improve uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>One possible option is the faecal immunochemical test for haemoglobin (FIT), which may also be more acceptable to invitees: A previous trial randomised screening-na&#x000ef;ve individuals to an offer of first-line screening with either FIT or colonoscopy and reported higher uptake of FIT (34.2&#x000a0;% vs. 24.6&#x000a0;%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Similarly, a recent study found that after experiencing both tests, patients at average risk of CRC preferred FIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Using FIT as the primary surveillance test could also have the advantage of reducing demand on endoscopy services resulting from widespread adoption of population-based CRC screening programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, previous studies on people&#x02019;s preferences for stool tests (not necessarily FIT) vs. colonoscopy have been in the context of first-line screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and to our knowledge, only one has been in the context of surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, it is uncertain how FIT performs and compares to colonoscopy for follow-up of patients diagnosed with intermediate risk adenomas, in terms of sensitivity and specificity for advanced adenomas and CRC. A large, pragmatic accuracy and efficacy study (&#x02018;FIT for Follow-Up&#x02019;) is in progress to assess this. Although the accuracy of FIT has been reported to be lower than colonoscopy as a one-off test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], FIT might perform comparably with triennial colonoscopy when offered on a shorter test interval (annually)&#x000a0;and at a low concentration threshold (high FIT sensitivity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The present study is part of a related strand of research regarding people&#x02019;s preferences for the respective surveillance tests.</p><p>In a previous small-scale, qualitative &#x02018;FIT for Follow-Up&#x02019; study we used four focus groups to explore attitudes towards an annual single-sample FIT vs. triennial colonoscopic surveillance of individuals at intermediate risk of CRC. The principal finding was that participants with no experience of colonoscopic surveillance had positive perceptions of FIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, one of the key perceived benefits of annual FIT was the higher frequency of testing; participants believed this might improve detection of advanced lesions. Conversely, participants who preferred triennial colonoscopy often felt that this was the more sensitive test for finding polyps or cancer. However, since the previous study was small-scale, the present study aimed to obtain a more definitive estimate of public preferences for these two potential surveillance tests, in a larger sample of screening- and surveillance-na&#x000ef;ve individuals. Each participant was asked to imagine they were at intermediate-risk of CRC, consider the two possible surveillance options, and state an overall preference for one method or another on a questionnaire, along with their underlying reasons using a multiple choice question.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>The recruitment strategy has previously been reported in full [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In summary, 3100 screening- and surveillance-na&#x000ef;ve individuals aged 45&#x02013;54 years from three General Practices in England (two in Cumbria; one in London), were invited to participate in a survey. Exclusion criteria were (i) a previous diagnosis of bowel cancer or recent (i.e., in the past 6&#x000a0;months) diagnosis of any cancer; (ii) receiving regular colonoscopies; (iii) learning disability or significant cognitive decline; (iv) clinically judged to be unsuitable to participate (e.g., due to physical or psychological difficulties). Eligibility was determined by systematic database queries and inspection of patient records by their primary care physician.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design and measures</title><p>This study took place as part of a larger survey that compared people&#x02019;s willingness to undergo four potential first-line screening tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

People at intermediate risk would be offered a follow-up test in the future to check that no new polyps have grown. This is called &#x02018;polyp surveillance&#x02019;.

Since no validated measure of surveillance preferences could be located, items were designed by members of the study team (AG, HB &#x00026; CVW; see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Response options were based on recurring themes in the previous qualitative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Participants were asked to report their gender, age, ethnicity, current employment status, and highest level of education achieved. Postcodes were used to calculate 2010 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores (an area-based measure of socioeconomic deprivation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Participants were also asked whether they knew anyone who had been diagnosed with bowel cancer and whether they had ever had a bowel test themselves (i.e., not limited to screening but any bowel test for any purpose).</p><p>Participants were asked to complete the questionnaire and return it in a provided Freepost envelope (which constituted consent), or to return the questionnaire blank if they did not wish to participate. After 2 weeks, a reminder letter and a replacement Freepost envelope was issued to all non-responders.

Stated surveillance preferences and underlying reasons were summarised using descriptive statistics. Further analyses tested for differences in preferences between subgroups (e.g., men and women) using Pearson&#x02019;s &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests for association. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to compare preferences by employment status and education due to expected counts being less than five in some cells. Wilson score 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for overall preferences, preferences within each subgroup, and reasons for preferences. Responses to the measure of education were divided into three groups: participants with a degree or higher degree were categorised as &#x0201c;high education&#x0201d;, those with a lack of formal qualifications were categorised as &#x0201c;low education&#x0201d; and participants responding in other ways (e.g., A-levels or BTECs) were categorised as &#x0201c;medium education&#x0201d;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><p>Out of 3100 invitations, 686 questionnaires were returned across the four conditions (22.1&#x000a0;%; n per condition: 164 to 178), of which 603 participants (19.5&#x000a0;%) were eligible for the main analysis outlined elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A further 28 (0.9&#x000a0;%) participants who did not answer the question on surveillance preferences and 84 (2.7&#x000a0;%) patients with previous bowel test experience were excluded as the numbers were too small for subgroup analyses, resulting in a final sample of 491 (15.8&#x000a0;%).

We found that the majority of participants stated a preference for surveillance with an annual, single-sample, home-based stool test consistent with FIT over triennial colonoscopy. The findings suggest that participants prioritised frequency, convenience, and lower risk of harm or side effects as the reason for their preference for FIT, and test sensitivity and thoroughness as their reasons for preferring colonoscopy. The views of participants who favoured colonoscopy were also influenced by the perspective that they would have already had a colonoscopy as part of the initial screening pathway. These findings are largely consistent with our previous qualitative study comparing attitudes towards an annual FIT versus triennial colonoscopic surveillance among individuals at intermediate risk of CRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Stated reasons for participants&#x02019; preferences were also similar to those of a study in which participants preferred to be screened using FIT when considering test preparation and avoiding complications but preferred colonoscopy when considering accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It was more surprising that 16.8&#x000a0;% of participants who stated a preference for FIT did so on the basis that they would have had the test before; this may have been related to awareness that the current BCSP is based on first-line stool testing (which they expect to take up in future) and that stool tests are available in other contexts (e.g., for diagnosis).</p><p>There were no differences by ethnicity, employment status, education level, or for participants that knew someone who had bowel cancer but women were more likely than men to prefer the stool test over colonoscopy. This latter observation is in line with previous research showing that women have lower attendance rates for screening colonoscopy than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], that they hold more negative expectations about the test (e.g., relating to pain or fear of a cancer diagnosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and are more concerned about modesty, embarrassment, and risks related to the procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In terms of colonoscopy experience, women report poorer tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], more pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and more discomfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] during colonoscopy than men, suggesting that some of their pre-existing concerns are well-founded. The higher proportion of women stating a preference for the stool test is also consistent with a meta-analysis of studies on FIT in the context of screening and another recent study that tested patients&#x02019; preferences after experiencing both colonoscopy and FIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>As with the previous qualitative study, these findings are most directly applicable to the English BCSP. In organised CRC screening programmes, it is often necessary to offer a default first-line and therapeutic test (e.g., first-line gFOBt and therapeutic colonoscopy) and impractical to offer a range of options. This also applies to surveillance tests when they are offered to a large number of people in a centralised fashion. Previous studies have reported several barriers to colonoscopy attendance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and our findings suggest that a home-based stool test may be a more attractive alternative to colonoscopy. Hence, the present study adds evidence that offering annual FIT as the default surveillance method could be an effective strategy for increasing participation rates in the context of surveillance. Furthermore, it could also lower colonoscopy demand, which is a significant challenge for healthcare systems in several countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In principle, the BCSP could use a similar system for surveillance of people at intermediate risk of CRC to that used for coordinating first-line screening with gFOBt. Annual, single-sample FIT kits could be posted to eligible individuals, who could then complete the test at home and return it to a laboratory for analysis. However, the preference for a stool test resembling FIT was not universal, with about 1 in 3 participants preferring triennial colonoscopies. One potential method of optimising uptake of CRC surveillance would be to offer FIT as a default test but for colonoscopic surveillance to remain an option for those who persistently decline FIT. These findings also suggest that in healthcare systems that offer a choice of tests, it would be effective to allow patients to select their preferred method.</p><p>These possible applications should be considered in the context of current uncertainties regarding the relative sensitivity of annual FIT and triennial colonoscopy. Higher uptake of FIT may not translate to superior health outcomes or cost-effectiveness unless it delivers adequate sensitivity and specificity. The results of the FIT for Follow-Up study will address this important question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>An important limitation of this study was that participants were asked to imagine that they were being offered follow-up testing after being diagnosed as intermediate risk of CRC. Therefore, preferences may not be representative of individuals in a real life setting (i.e., with people who had undergone CRC screening, including a diagnostic colonoscopy). For example, one previous study found that a majority of patients undergoing colonoscopy reported that the experience was better than expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Similarly, patients facing the prospect of surveillance following screening would be older than this sample (and would differ on related demographic characteristics e.g., employment and personal health status). Participants in this study were recruited on the basis of being screening-na&#x000ef;ve but approaching the eligible screening age, in order to assess preferences for first-line tests without their perceptions being affected by previous invitations and experience of tests as part of the existing BCSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, surveillance preferences may differ to this screening-na&#x000ef;ve sample. In addition, although the sample was larger than the previous qualitative study, the response rate was lower than expected, introducing a possible selection bias. Although we observed few differences in preferences between subgroups, the number of participants that were non-white British, not employed or retired, and had a low level of education was lower than in the general population and there may have been differences that could not be detected in this study.</p><p>Another important limitation was that participants were only given information about the sensitivity of colonoscopy and not the stool test. In the absence of more definitive estimates, information on the sensitivity of FIT could have been provided using data on its performance as a one-off, first-line test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or a biennial test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Estimates of sensitivity for FIT are relatively low compared with colonoscopy in this context. However, they were omitted due to being unlikely to offer a valid approximation of the performance of FIT as a surveillance test repeated over three rounds. Consequently, participants&#x02019; perceptions of the stool test may have been based primarily on its appearance (e.g., a non-invasive and less thorough test may have also been perceived as less capable of detecting adenomas) and preferences may change in light of additional information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Future research could determine whether preferences are consistent when people are also given this information, once more applicable estimates are available.</p><p>Furthermore, the four randomised conditions provided slightly different information about the first-line screening tests. For example, invitees allocated to receive literature about colonoscopy for first-line screening were provided with extra information about the test e.g., that it was <italic>&#x02018;over 90&#x000a0;% accurate for detecting polyps and cancer&#x02019;</italic>, whereas invitees in other conditions were given the associated statistic for a different test (either flexible sigmoidoscopy or a form of CTC). This meant that participants receiving information about colonoscopy might have had more knowledge about its capabilities, particularly since information on accuracy of FIT as a diagnostic test was not provided. However, although information and measures relating to preferences for first-line screening tests may have been distracting, when we compared surveillance preferences across the four conditions we did not find statistically significant differences. The numbers were small but this suggests that the type of information participants received regarding screening did not affect their preferences for surveillance tests.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>When asked to imagine being at intermediate risk of CRC, individuals aged 45&#x02013;54 years generally stated a preference for an annual single-sample home-based stool test resembling FIT over triennial colonoscopy for surveillance. FIT may be a viable alternative to colonoscopy, and may be favoured by women in particular. Future research should consider whether this preference translates to improved adherence in a real surveillance setting.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12876_2016_517_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Information provided on the two surveillance tests.
