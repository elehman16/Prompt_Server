The aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study was to determine whether pre-treatment with IV ramosetron, used for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), would reduce propofol-induced pain as an equivalent to lidocaine.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Hundred and twenty American Society of Anesthesiologists grade (ASA) I and II patients were randomly assigned into three groups (40 in each). Group N received 2 ml of 0.9% saline, Group L received 2 ml of lidocaine, and Group R received 2 ml of ramosetron. Mid forearm was occluded manually before injection and released after 1 min and then propofol was injected over 5 s. Patients were observed and questioned 15 s later if they had pain in the arm and pain was scored on a four-point scale: 0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, and 3 = severe pain. Unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test and chi-square test/Fisher&#x02019; exact test were used to analyze results.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The incidence of pain in groups N, L, and R were 65, 35, and 30%, respectively.

It has been arranged as the seventh most important problem in current practice of clinical anesthesia by American anesthesiologists.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Strategies to reduce the incidence of pain on injection include adding lidocaine to propofol, cooling or warming propofol, diluting the propofol solution, injection of propofol into a large vein, and pretreatment with IV injection of lidocaine, ondansetron, metoclopramide, an opioid, magnesium, or thiopental with or without tourniquet; all have been tried with variable results.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It has been demonstrated that ondansetron, a specific 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonist, provided numbness when injected under the skin and is 15 times more potent than lidocaine.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] It has been further demonstrated that ondansetron successfully relieved pain following propofol injection without any adverse effects in a significant number of patients.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In our practice, ramosetron is routinely administered as premedication to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients scheduled for general anesthesia.</p><p>Ramosetron is a serotonin 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and demonstrates superior efficacy and longer duration to granisetron.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] We used ramosetron pretreatment to determine its efficacy to decrease the pain of propofol injection as equivalent to lidocaine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Institutional ethical committee approval was obtained and informed written consent was taken from all patients. Hundred and twenty adult patients belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II class, scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia were randomly allocated to either of the four groups using computer generated random numbers (40 in each group), for this prospectively randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study. Patients having problems in communication and history of allergic response to either propofol or 5HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists were excluded from this study.</p><p>All patients were kept fasting for 6 h for solid food and were premedicated with tab alprazolam 0.5 mg and tab ranitidine 150 mg night before surgery and 2 h prior to induction. On arrival to the operation theatre, a 20 G cannula was inserted into a vein on the dorsum of the patient's nondominant hand and lactated Ringer's solution was infused. The pretreatment solutions consisted of 2 ml of 0.9% saline (Group N, <italic>n</italic> = 40) as placebo, 2 ml (40 mg, Group L, <italic>n</italic> = 40) of lidocaine (Loxicard 2%, Neon laboratories ltd, Mumbai, India), and 2 ml (0.3 mg, Group R, <italic>n</italic> = 40) of ramosetron (Nozia, Cadila Healthcare Ltd, Goa, India). Pretreatment drug was injected after venous drainage was occluded manually at the mid-forearm for 1 min. Patient's then received one-fourth of the total calculated dose of propofol-LCT (long chain triglycerides) over 5s and 15 s later the patient was assessed for pain during injection of propofol.</p><p>The level of pain was assessed by a second anesthetist who was unaware of the group to which the patient had been allocated. Assessment included standard questions asked to the patients about the comfort of the injection, verbal response, and behavioral signs (such as facial grimacing, arm withdrawal, or tears). Pain was graded using a four-point scale: 0 = no pain, 1= mild pain (pain reported only in response to questioning without any behavioral signs), 2 = moderate pain (pain reported in response to questioning and accompanied by a behavioral sign or pain reported spontaneously without questioning), and 3 = severe pain (i.e., strong vocal response or response accompanied by facial grimacing, arm withdrawal, or tears).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Later anesthesia was induced with intravenous propofol-LCT 2.5 mg/kg. All study drugs were kept at room temperature and used within 30 min of preparation. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium and anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and fentanyl.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Based on the literature, the incidence of pain on injecting propofol is assumed as 80%, and 50% reduction in pain was considered clinically significant.

All measured values are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and numbers (%).

Although it is not a serious complication, efforts are assumed to reduce the severity of the pain or discomfort. Propofol belongs to the group of phenols that can irritate the skin, mucous membranes, and venous intima.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Injection pain associated with propofol characteristically occurs immediately or later after the drug injection with a delayed response of 10-20 s.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The explanation for the pain includes endothelial irritation, osmolality differences, unphysiological pH, and the activation of pain mediators.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Many methods have been used to reduce the incidence of pain on propofol injection with variable results. Lignocaine added to or given before injection of propofol is widely employed.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Gajraj and Nathanson[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] studied the optimal dose of lidocaine for propofol pain and concluded that 30 mg lidocaine is the optimal dose for attenuation of propofol pain. Cooling the propofol to 4&#x000b0;C reduces its injection pain possibly by delaying the activation of enzyme cascade of pain mediators.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Injecting into a large forearm vein also reduces the pain, probably by reducing contact between drug and endothelium.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Metoclopramide shares the structural and physiochemical properties with lidocaine and is a weak local anesthetic. It has also shown to be as effective as lidocaine in reducing propofol injection pain.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Ye <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] found in rats, that ondansetron is approximately 15 times more potent local anesthetic as lidocaine and this property probably contributes to its antiemetic action. Ondansetron had been shown to relieve pain by its multifaceted actions as a Na channel blocker, a 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, and mu opioid agonist.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Ondansetron pretreatment may be used to reduce the incidence of pain on injection of propofol with an added advantage of prevention of PONV.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Ahmed <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] the incidence of propofol injection pain was reduced from 60 to 15% after granisetron pretreatment. Pretreatment with granisetron/lidocaine may be effective not only in attenuating pains during IV injection of propofol, but also in preventing postoperative nausea, vomiting, and shivering.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In a study by Piper <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] severity but not the incidence of pain on injection was significantly reduced by dolasetron (50 %) compared with placebo and there was no significant difference between dolasetron and lidocaine. Ramosetron is a recently developed 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist. Lee <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported the incidence of pain in the groups pretreated with ramosetron 0.3 mg or combination with ramosetron and lidocaine 20 mg were 60 and 38%, respectively. These results show effective reduction in propofol injection pain. Pretreatment with ramosetron alone or with combined pretreatment of ramosetron and lidocaine also prevented pain effectively for moderate to severe pain.</p><p>In our study, the incidence of pain was 65% in the placebo group. The incidence of pain pretreated with lidocaine 40 mg and ramosetron 0.3 mg were 35 and 30%, respectively. These results show that there is significant reduction in the pain for propofol injection and both lidocaine and ramosetron are equally effective. Even there is significant decrease in moderate and severe pain (5% in each L and R group) compared with normal saline group (25 and 30%, respectively).</p><p>Our study had few limitations. Occlusion at mid forearm was done manually, which will vary from person to person, this could have been overcome by using tourniquet with constant pressure. Also drug could have been injected using syringe pump instead of injecting manually.</p><p>We concluded that IV ramosetron when given as pretreatment is as effective as lidocaine on propofol associated pain with an added advantage of preventing PONV.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marik</surname><given-names>PE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Propofol: Therapeutic indications and side-effects</article-title><source>Curr Pharm Des</source><year>2004</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>3639</fpage><lpage>49</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15579060</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sim</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>DY</given-names></name><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ki</surname><given-names>KH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>DH</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Pain on injection with microemulsion propofol</article-title><source>Br J Clin Pharmacol</source><year>2009</year><volume>67</volume><fpage>316</fpage><lpage>25</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19220277</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dubey</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pain on injection of lipid-free propofol and propofol emulsion containing medium-chain triglyceride: A comparative study</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2005</year><volume>101</volume><fpage>1060</fpage><lpage>2</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16192520</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Macario</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinger</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Truong</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Which clinical anesthesia outcomes are both common and important to avoid?
