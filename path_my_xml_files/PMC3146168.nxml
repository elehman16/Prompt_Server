Both groups received similar premedication. General anaesthesia in group I was induced with propofol 2-3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and following LMA insertion, the anaesthesia was maintained with 0.5-1.5% halothane. In group II the incision site was infiltrated with 10 ml of 1.5% lidocaine with adrenaline and patients were sedated with intravenous midazolam 0.07mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and ketamine 0.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. A rescue dose of 0.15 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> of ketamine was given in group II if the patient complained of pain or discomfort during the procedure.

Sixty consecutive ASA I/II female patients between 20-40 years with a gestation period less than 10 weeks scheduled for medical termination of pregnancy along with laparoscopic tubal ligation were randomized to receive either general anesthesia with LMA (Group I) or local anesthesia with sedation (Group II). Randomization was done using sealed envelopes having the choice of anaesthetic techniques for the case. All patients were fasting overnight and were premedicated with fentanyl 2&#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> and metoclopramide 10 mg, administered 20 minutes before induction of anesthesia.</p><p>Intraoperative monitoring included continuous ECG (lead II), oxygen saturation, and non invasive blood pressure measurement. In group I, GA was induced with intravenous propofol 2-3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, followed by insertion of a size 3 or 4 classic LMA. Anaesthesia was maintained with halothane (0.5-1.5%) delivered in oxygen and nitrous oxide. Halothane and N<sub>2</sub>O were discontinued after ligation of the fallopian tubes and the LMA was removed following completion of skin suturing, allowing patients to breathe room air.</p><p>Group II patients received intravenous midazolam 0.07 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and ketamine 0.5mg kg.<sup>-1</sup> The incision site was also infiltrated with 10 ml of 1.5% lignocaine with adrenaline (1:200,000). Oxygen (FIO<sub>2</sub>-0.3) was given to all patients using a ventimask. A second dose (rescue dose) of intravenous ketamine 0.15mg kg<sup>-1</sup> was given if the patients complained of discomfort or pain. The data recorded during the procedure included induction to skin incision time, number of attempts of Verres needle insertion, total volume of CO<sub>2</sub> insufflated, maximum intra-abdominal pressure, besides the vital signs. The duration of surgery, recovery time, intraoperative and postoperative complications were also recorded.</p><p>Postoperative pain was treated with intravenous diclofenac sodium 1mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in all patients. The patients were monitored every five minutes in the post anesthesia care unit discharge.</p><p>The data was recorded as mean&#x000b1;SD. Student &#x02018;t&#x02019; test was used for comparison between the groups and paired t test was applied for intra-group comparison. A p value of &#x0003c;0.05 was taken as significant. The data was analysed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 12 software.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Both the groups were comparable with regard to age, weight, period of gestation and hemoglobin levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>).

The difference in systolic blood pressure between two groups was statistically significant at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes, whereas the difference in diastolic blood pressure was statistically significant only at 5, 10 and 15minutes. These changes in blood pressure did not have any clinical effects. The SpO<sub>2</sub> was maintained in both the groups throughout the procedure. The volume of CO<sub>2</sub> used was similar in both the groups (1.98 &#x000b1; 0.29L and 1.95 &#x000b1; 0.32L in Group I and Group II respectively). The difference in the mean intra abdominal pressure was statistically significant, 13.20 &#x000b1; 1.45 mm Hg in Group I and 14.07 &#x000b1; 1.62 mm Hg in Group II, without any clinical effects.</p><p>Intraoperatively 25 patients (83.3%) in Group I and 27 (90%) in Group II had no complication. Bradycardia (heart rate &#x0003c; 60/minute) occurred in 5 patients (16.7%) in Group I and 3(10%) patients in Group II, necessitating the use of atropine.

Most anaesthetic studies focus on postpartum tubal ligation, but in our hospital such procedures are done either as elective interval procedures or following medical termination of pregnancy.</p><p>Although tubal ligation can be performed under local anesthesia with sedation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, its effectiveness has been questioned<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> and it has been suggested that the anaesthetic technique (i.e., regional versus general) should be individualized, based on anesthetic and/or obstetric risk factors and patient preference.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p><p>General anaesthesia has been recommended for tubal ligation to reduce the complications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, but it is not a very safe technique. The case-fatality rate for tubal sterilization procedures has been reported to be 3.6/100,000 procedures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> Out of 29 reported deaths, 11 were attributed to complications of general anesthesia, including hypoventilation in non intubated women, remaining were due to cardiorespiratory arrests of unknown cause.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p><p>Our study enrolled 60 ASA I &#x00026; II with similar demographic profile. The significantly higher induction to skin incision time in group I (5.13&#x000b1;0.93min versus 3.01&#x000b1;1.86 min in Group II) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>) was attributable to the time required for induction of general anaesthesia and insertion of LMA and was similar to the observations of Swann et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> The decline in heart rate in group I can be attributed to propofol, which blunts the pressor response to surgical stimulation and causes a reduction in blood pressure without a compensatory increase in heart rate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> Subsequent fluctuations in blood pressure in group I can be attributed to propofol and substantiation of its depressant effect on baroreceptor reflex and sympathetic over activity by fentanyl &#x00026; halothane. Similarly the rise in blood pressure in group II can be attributed to ketamine.</p><p>The fall in SpO<sub>2</sub> to 90% in group I could be due to coughing and breath-holding during insertion of LMA in light plane. The incidence of intraoperative bradycardia requiring atropine was more in group I (16.7% vs. 10%) possibly due to vagal mediated reflex bradycardia due to the stretching of peritoneum as well as the use of propofol, fentanyl and halothane.</p><p>The time to recovery and discharge were comparable in both the groups and were similar to the observations by Raeder et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> Postoperative nausea and vomiting was one of the main complaints after the procedure. The higher incidence of nausea and vomiting in group I could be due to gastric insufflation with volatile anaesthetic agent. Earlier studies have implicated the use of nitrous oxide in gynecologic procedures for the higher incidence of postoperative vomiting by 33%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>More patients complained of pain in group I (10% vs. 6.7%) requiring analgesia early (24.3&#x000b1;3.9 min vs. 29&#x000b1;2.4 min). Bordhl et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> have reported a higher incidence of abdominal pain in the general anaesthesia group (83% vs. 35% in LA &#x00026; sedation group). The preoperative administration of parenteral ketorolac or oral ibuprofen has not been found to decrease postoperative pain or side effects when compared to placebo in this outpatient population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></p><p>The lower incidence of pain the LA &#x00026; sedation group could be due to bupivacaine spray of fallopian tube.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> Both the techniques were found to be safe as there were no major complications with either technique and the patients could be discharged to home within 20 minute of the procedure.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
