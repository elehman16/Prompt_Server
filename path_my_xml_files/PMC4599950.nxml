The FMF50 score required improvement by &#x02265;50% in five of six criteria (attack frequency, attack duration, global patient assessment, global physician assessment, frequency of attacks with arthritis, and levels of acute-phase reactants) without worsening of the sixth criterion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the original trial rilonacept was considered effective according to the primary outcome measure (differences in the attack frequency) with eight analyzable patients considered responders and four as non-responders. According to the FMF50 score, only two participants would have been considered responders to rilonacept, and one to placebo. Only two participants had &#x02265;50% differences between rilonacept and placebo in five criteria. The major explanation for non-response to treatment was that with rilonacept the duration of attack decreased by &#x02265;50% in only 2 participants and 5 participants had no attacks of arthritis either during screening (before randomization) or during treatment with rilonacept.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The proposed FMF50 score did not differentiate well between responders and non-responders compared to the a priori defined primary outcome measure in this successful controlled study and should be revisited prior to adoption as a primary outcome measure in multinational FMF trials.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Hashkes</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Spalding</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Giannini</surname><given-names>EH</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><article-title>Rilonacept for colchicine-resistant or -intolerant familial Mediterranean fever: a randomized trial.</article-title><source>Ann Intern Med</source><year>2012</year><volume>157</volume><issue>8</issue><fpage>533</fpage><lpage>541</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7326/0003-4819-157-8-201210160-00003</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23070486</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
