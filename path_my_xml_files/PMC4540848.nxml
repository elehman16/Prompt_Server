particularly the scapular muscles, on poststroke trunk alignment. [Subjects and Methods]
The study involved 30 patients with residual hemiparesis following cerebrovascular stroke.
Patient assessment included measuring shoulder muscle peak torque, scapular muscles peak
force, spinal lateral deviation angle, and motor functional performance. Patients were
randomly allocated either to the control group or the study group and received an
18-session strengthening program including active resisted exercises for shoulder
abductors and external rotators in addition to trunk control exercises. The study group
received additional strengthening exercises for the scapular muscles. [Results] The two
groups showed significant improvement in strength of all shoulder and scapular muscles,
with higher improvement in the study group. Similarly, the lateral spinal deviation angles
significantly improved in both groups, with significantly higher improvement in the study
group. Transfer activity, sitting balance, upper limb functions, and hand movements
significantly improved in the two groups, with higher improvement in the latter two
functions in the study group. [Conclusion] Strengthening of shoulder girdle muscles,
particularly scapular muscles, can significantly contribute to improving the postural
alignment of the trunk in patients with poststroke hemiparesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Scapular muscles strengthening</kwd><kwd>Lateral trunk alignment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebrovascular stroke (CVS) is a neurologic event related to diseases of the cerebral
circulation. CVS has been shown to be a major cause of death and disability in all
communities. According to the American Stroke Association, about 87% of strokes are
ischemic, and the remaining 13% are hemorrhagic<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke survivors can suffer some
neurological impairments, such as hemiparesis, communication disorders, cognitive deficits,
or disorders in visuospatial perception<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hemiparesis of the upper limb is conceivably the most serious impairment and most in need
of rehabilitation. Population-based studies indicated that 73&#x02013;88% of first-time strokes
result in an acute hemiparesis of the upper and/or lower limbs<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The impact of upper limb
impairments on disability and health is very obvious<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, limited attention has been
given to upper-extremity rehabilitation after stroke, and generally functional recovery of
the upper limb and hand is limited compared with that of lower extremities<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
A scapular stabilization exercise program performed over a 4-week period resulted in
improvement of upper limb function in an group of 11 chronic hemiparetic patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Even in patients with acute stroke,
passive range of motion exercises can improve the function of upper extremities<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hemiparetic patients have an altered postural alignment in standing compared with subjects
without neurological deficits<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural
alignment is defined as the relationship of body parts to the line of the center of gravity
(COG). Maintaining postural stability is a complex process that is an essential prerequisite
for the advanced stages of motor control including; controlled mobility and skilled
activity<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Structures in the
brainstem, the red nucleus, pontine and medullary reticular formations, vestibular nuclei,
and superior colliculus, are responsible for the control of posture and spatial
orientation<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Applications of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) for upper-extremity recovery are
promising in chronic and acute stroke<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, and is less promising in subacute
stroke<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other studies showed that
repetitive training of isolated movements against resistance for 15 minutes twice a day for
4 weeks improved the motor function of paretic hands in subacute stroke<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized
trials of strengthening interventions in stroke patients concluded that strengthening
interventions increase strength, improve activity, and do not increase spasticity<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of strengthening exercises for
shoulder girdle muscles, particularly the scapular muscles, on lateral trunk deviation in
both static positions and functional activities in hemiparetic patients after stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in the outpatient clinic of the Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo
University, between December 2010 and January 2012. The study included 30 patients with
cerebrovascular stroke, either ischemic or hemorrhagic, based on a clinical assessment, CT
scan, and/or MRI. The study was approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Faculty. All
patients provided a written informed consent prior to participation in the study.</p><p>Clinical evaluation of the patients included neurological, musculoskeletal, and perceptual
assessments using the line cancellation test. Shoulder stability was examined by palpating
the space between the acromion process and humeral head. In addition, shoulder pain was
assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale.</p><p>The study included pain-free hemiparetic patients with scapular asymmetry, dropped
shoulder, and spinal lateral deviation towards the affected side in a sitting position. The
inclusion criteria were age 45&#x02013;60 years, disease duration 6&#x02013;12 months, good sitting balance,
and good voluntary motor control of at least stage 4 according to Brunnstrom&#x02019;s scale. The
exclusion criteria included balance disturbance due to other causes, stroke with unilateral
neglect, sensory manifestations, uncorrected visual impairment, spinal deformities, and
orthopedic disorders of the lower limbs or back. Participants were randomly divided into two
equal groups, a study group and control group.</p><p>All participants were subjected to the following twice; before and after treatment:</p><p>1. Shoulder girdle muscle strength: An isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3, Biodex
Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA) was used to assess the peak torque of shoulder abductors
and external rotators. During the test, the patient sat in the Biodex system&#x02019;s chair. For
each muscle group, three trials were recorded with five seconds of rest in between them. No
verbal encouragement or other reinforcement was given to any patient during the actual
test.</p><p>2. Scapular muscle peak force measurements: A handheld dynamometer (HHD) (Lafeyette Manual
Muscle Test System, Model number 01163, Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette IN, USA) was
used to measure the isometric peak force (kg) of the supraspinatus, upper trapezius, and
serratus anterior muscles. Three trials were performed for each muscle with a rest period of
15&#x02013;20 seconds so that declines in strength across trials, due to fatigue, could be avoided.
The supraspinatus and upper trapezius muscle peak forces were recorded from a sitting
position on a stool with the hips and knees at 90&#x000b0; flexion and the feet supported. The
serratus anterior muscle peak force was tested from a supine lying position.</p><p>3. Two-dimensional (2D) postural assessment with the CorelDraw software: The patient was
asked to expose his/her chest, upper limbs, and posterior superior iliac spines. The
scapular bony landmarks, that is, the superior angle, inferior angle, and lateral scapular
angle, were all palpated and marked. The lateral scapular angle was marked at a 5&#x02005;cm
distance from the acromion. The spinous processes of C7, the corresponding thoracic
vertebrae to the scapular bony landmarks, and the posterior superior iliac spines (PSISs)
were marked. The C7 spinous process, inferior scapular angles, and the two PSISs points were
the main bony landmarks corresponding to the scapular and spinal angles.</p><p>4. Capturing the patient spine: Digital photographs of the patient spine and both scapulae
were taken in the frontal plane in a sitting position with one digital video camera
(DSC-W110, Sony Corporation, Tokyo Japan).</p><p>5. Image analysis and angles calculation: The scapular and spinal angles were calculated
using computerized photogrammetry with the CorelDraw Graphics Suite (X5) software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Measurement of the scapular and spinal angles. The Qa angle represents the scapular
upward rotation angle on the affected side, while the Qb angle represents that on the
non-affected side. The SI is a line passing through the two inferior scapular angles,
while the PI is a line passing through the two PSISs. The ASI is a line drawn
perpendicular to the SI line, while the API is a line drawn perpendicular to the PI
line. The angle of intersection of the two perpendicular lines, the ASI and API,
represents the spinal lateral deviation angle (S angle).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-2195-g001"/></fig>). The scapular resting upward rotation angle is the angle between two lines, that is,
the line connecting the C7 spinous process and inferior angles and the vertical (V) line
passing through C7. The Qa angle represents the scapular upward rotation angle on the
affected side, while the Qb angle represents that on the the non-affected side. The lateral
spinal deviation angle lies between two lines, that is, a line passing through the two
inferior scapular angles (SI) and a line passing through the two PSISs (PI). After defining
the SI and PI lines, a perpendicular line (ASI) was drawn to the SI, and another
perpendicular line (API) was drawn to the PI. The angle of intersection of the two
perpendicular lines, ASI and API, represents the spinal angle (S angle). The direction of
the angle represents the direction of spinal lateral deviation.</p><p>A selective six-week strengthening exercise program was applied for the shoulder girdle
muscles (shoulder abductors and external rotators) to the two groups. The patients received
3 sessions weekly (a total of 18 therapeutic sessions). They received preparatory stretching
exercises for the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, rhomboids major and minor, and teres
major muscles prior to starting the strengthening exercises. In addition, trunk control
exercises, that is, active flexion, side bending, and rotation in a sitting position, were
applied. The study group received additional strengthening exercises focusing on the
scapular muscles, that is, the supraspinatus, serratus anterior, and upper trapezius
muscles.</p><p>The data for shoulder muscle strength, scapular muscle strength, scapular and spinal
angles, and the score of Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) for stroke patients were collected
before and after treatment. All statistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS
Statistics version 20. Numerical data were expressed as means and standard deviations or
medians and ranges as appropriate. Qualitative data were expressed as frequencies and
percentages. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test) was used to examine the relation
between qualitative variables. For quantitative data, comparison between two groups was done
using the independent Mann-Whitney test. Comparison of repeated measures was done using the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The Spearman rho method was used to test correlation between
numerical variables. A p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The study primarily involved 30 patients. Seven patients did not complete the study due to

the shoulder girdle muscles and scapular muscles in hemiparetic patients on the strength of
these muscles and the spinal lateral deviation angle. Strengthening of the scapular muscles
resulted in a significantly higher effect in these two aspects. There was a strong positive
correlation between the peak force of the three scapular muscles with the scapular upward
rotation angle and strong negative correlation with the spinal lateral deviation angle.</p><p>Scapular muscle strengthening was associated with a significant increase in the scapular
upward rotation angle and significant decrease in the spinal lateral deviation angle. The
two angles were positively affected by strengthening of the shoulder girdle muscles, but the
effect was more pronounced after scapular muscle strengthening. In fact, the peak torque
values of the shoulder abductors and external rotators were higher after scapular muscle
strengthening. This effect can be explained by the normal synergist coactivation reported
between shoulder girdle muscles working at the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic levels in
addition to the neurophysiologic effect of resisted exercises<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Improvement of the strength of the scapular muscles in the control
group despite the lack of training can also be explained by the synergist coactivation
between different shoulder muscles.</p><p>The resting scapular upward rotation angle was specifically measured in the present study,
as it reflects the strength of the three studied scapular muscles, the trapezius, serratus
anterior, and supraspinatus. These muscles work together to maintain the scapula&#x02019;s elevation
and upward rotation orientation. We also measured the scapular and spinal angles in the
sitting position to eliminate the effect of unequal weight shifting on the lower limbs so
that we could concentrate on the effect of the shoulder girdle muscles<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Based on previous studies<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, we planned the training dose to be 1&#x02005;h/d, 3 d/wk for 6
weeks (18 h). Previous authors recommended 4&#x02013;6 weeks as an optimum duration of strengthening
exercises to be effective in stroke patients. We extended to the maximum of six weeks, as
the extent of strength gain was positively correlated with the intensity and the number of
exercising units<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Based on the study of Mottram<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
current study considered manual resisted exercises rather than any other types of
strengthening interventions. These exercises primarily reeducate the stability and control
around the scapula to improve postural alignment. Folland and Williams<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> and Falvo et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> found that resisted exercises may enhance the recruitment, firing
rate, and synchrony at the level of the motor neuron by enhancing neural adaptation.</p><p>The shoulder muscles selected to be strengthened in the current study were abductors and
external rotators, as shoulder external rotation is more important than internal rotation in
providing stability to the shoulder joint<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>External rotators gained the highest improvement in the two groups. This can be explained
by synergist coactivation of these muscles during scapular muscle strengthening. Escamellia
et al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that shoulder abductors
and external rotators showed increased firing activity during serratus anterior muscle
strengthening with a forward pushing exercise.</p><p>The significant improvement in the resting scapular upward rotation angle in the two groups
in this study can be attributed to the relation between scapulothoracic stability and
trapezius-serratus anterior force coupling<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shoulder stability exercise can improve range of motion, muscle
strength, and grasping power of the upper limb<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Improvement of scapular muscle strength can also influence
postural stability of the shoulder girdle and the proximal trunk<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a group of normal young males, Alizadeh et al.<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> tested the effect of a progressive exercise program including
resistive strengthening, stretching, and postural exercises on the position of the scapula.
They reported improvement of the scapular position by 70% with their exercise program. This
improvement was correlated with improved strength of the scapular elevators, mainly the
trapezius muscle. The primary result of the present study was the significant improvement of
the spinal alignment in the two groups with better improvement after scapular muscle
strengthening. The spinal lateral deviation angle showed strong negative correlation with
the peak force of the three scapular muscles. To our knowledge, this study seems to be the
first to consider the influence of shoulder muscle strengthening on spinal alignment in
patients with stroke. Gomes et al.<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>
published a case study that supports the effect of shoulder girdle posture on spinal
alignment in patients with stroke. They reported mild improvement of scapular position and
spinal lateral deviation after global postural reeducation (GPR) exercises for scapular and
pelvis girdle muscles, and they attributed the improvement in spinal alignment to the effect
of the GPR technique in providing better scapular and pelvic alignment. Mottram<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> and Williams et al.<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup> found that scapulothoracic joint stability provided mainly
by trapezius-serratus anterior coupling had an important contribution to the core stability
of the trunk. In addition, the rotator cuff group could have an influence on scapular
alignment and therefore core stability, although it does not have direct attachments to the
spinal column or rib cage<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
conclusion, this can be considered a pilot study on the effect of shoulder and scapular
muscle strength on postural alignment in stroke patients. The study provided preliminary
evidence that manual resisted exercises for shoulder muscles (external rotators and
abductors) and scapular muscles (serratus anterior, trapezius, and supraspinatus)
significantly reduced lateral spinal deviation angle in the sitting position. In addition,
these exercises rectified the position of the scapula on the affected side.</p><p>The limitations of this study can be summarized as the relatively small sample size, which
limits generalization of the study&#x02019;s results. In addition, inclusion of only patients above
45&#x02005;years old did not allow evaluation of the physiotherapy program for younger patients who
are involved in higher grades of activity and need gait correction.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="eref">American Heart
