for screening purposes in small proof of principle studies during early drug
development. We investigated early changes in serum levels of several candidate
biomarkers involved in cartilage and bone metabolism following the initiation of
adalimumab as a prototypic active treatment in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) compared to
placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Twenty-four PsA patients were randomized to receive either adalimumab 40 mg s.c. every
other week or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by an open label extension phase. Serum
samples were obtained at baseline and after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment and analyzed for
levels of CPII and PINP (synthesis of type II and type I procollagen), melanoma
inhibitory activity (MIA) (chondrocyte anabolism), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, C2C
and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) (type II collagen degradation),
osteocalcin (OC) (bone formation), NTX-I and ICTP (both type I collagen
degradation).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After 4 weeks, there was a significant decrease in serum MMP-3 levels in
adalimumab-treated patients (P&#x0003c;0.005), while no change was observed in the
placebo group. A significant increase in serum MIA was noted after adalimumab therapy
(P&#x0003c;0.005) but not after placebo treatment. After 12 weeks, there was a marked
reduction in serum MMP-3 in both groups (P&#x0003c;0.005), whereas other markers did not
show significant changes compared to baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MMP-3 and MIA could serve as soluble biomarkers associated with inflammation as well as
joint remodelling and destruction and may, together with clinical evaluation and in
combination with other biomarkers, assist in distinguishing between effective and
ineffective therapy in small, proof-of-principle studies of short duration in PsA.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN23328456">ISRCTN23328456</ext-link>

destruction in the majority of patients <xref rid="pone.0012556-Rahman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The articular damage develops over months to years, but can often be detected
within 2 years of the first consultation of a rheumatologist <xref rid="pone.0012556-Kane1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The chronic inflammation of the synovial membrane is
thought to be responsible for degradation of cartilage and bone, in part by locally produced
cytokines and proteinases. Treatment with conventional antirheumatic drugs can improve the
clinical manifestations and inhibit permanent joint damage, but these drugs are not
effective in or tolerated by all patients. New targeted therapies, such as tumor necrosis
factor (TNF) blockade, have expanded therapeutic possibilities, but not all patients respond
well <xref rid="pone.0012556-Mease1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012556-Tracey1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Therefore, there is still a need for new and better
treatment options, and several new therapeutic strategies are in the pipeline of
pharmaceutical industry. The increase in the development of numerous new, targeted therapies
clearly raises the need for sensitive biomarkers which could be used on the group level for
early selection of potentially effective treatments.</p><p>It has recently been proposed to use small, intensive studies providing a high density of
data to obtain initial proof of principle in an early stage of drug development before
larger, conventional clinical trials are conducted to determine whether the effects of a new
treatment are clinically meaningful <xref rid="pone.0012556-Gerlag1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0012556-Kruithof1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In this design
additional biological data is collected alongside conventional measures of disease activity
to determine if there is a biological effect related to the mechanism of action of the drug
tested. We have previously shown that synovial biomarkers may be used in this context in
clinical trials in both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and PsA <xref rid="pone.0012556-vanKuijk1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012556-Kruithof1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The use of soluble biomarkers could increase the
feasibility of this approach, as synovial biopsy is not routinely available in all centers.
Moreover, various biomarkers could be combined together with clinical evaluation for initial
assessment of efficacy.</p><p>The treatment objectives in PsA are not limited to improvement of clinical signs and
symptoms, but include protection against joint destruction. Since structural damage outcomes
require lengthy clinical trials, the availability of biomarkers associated with these
long-term endpoints would be an attractive therapeutic development strategy, especially in
early phase trials when decisions are being made whether and how to proceed with pivotal
clinical trials. For this reason, biologic markers of bone and cartilage metabolism are of
particular interest, because they may reflect changes related to the integrity of the
affected joints <xref rid="pone.0012556-Landewe1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012556-Degroot1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Bone matrix is mainly composed of type I collagen, while type II collagen is the main
collagen in articular cartilage. Type I collagen telopeptide fragments, such as C-terminal
cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I and ICTP) and N-terminal cross-linked
telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX) in serum are currently considered to be sensitive
markers of bone resorption <xref rid="pone.0012556-Garnero1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.
ICTP is released from bone type I collagen by activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
while CTX-I is generated by cathepsin K activity, but not MMPs <xref rid="pone.0012556-Garnero2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Pro-collagen serum type I N-terminal propeptide
(PINP) and osteocalcine (OC) are markers of bone formation.</p><p>Type II collagen synthesis can be detected by measurement of C-propeptide of type II
collagen (CPII), while cartilage degradation by collagenases can be detected in serum by
cleavage products of type II collagen, such as Col2-3/4C (C2C) and cartilage oligomeric
matrix protein (COMP) <xref rid="pone.0012556-Poole1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Of
importance, several studies in patients with inflammatory arthritis have shown that some of
these markers of bone and cartilage metabolism are associated with progression of
radiographic joint damage <xref rid="pone.0012556-Landewe2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0012556-Verstappen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and that
their tissue expression and serum levels may change after initiation of effective (biologic)
therapy <xref rid="pone.0012556-Landewe2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012556-Vis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0012556-Vandooren1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Similarly, it has been suggested that melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA),
also known as cartilage-derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein (CD-RAP), a marker for
chondrocyte anabolism, could be used as a biomarker in patients with RA <xref rid="pone.0012556-MullerLadner1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. MIA is suppressed by
pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro, and serum MIA levels are increased after one year of
infliximab treatment in patients with inflammatory arthritis <xref rid="pone.0012556-Vandooren2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>The early effects of active treatment on synovial biomarkers, following the initiation of
adalimumab as a prototypic active treatment compared to placebo, have recently been reported
for this study cohort of patients with active PsA <xref rid="pone.0012556-vanKuijk1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. As a secondary endpoint in this study, we
investigated early changes in serum levels of several candidate soluble biomarkers involved
in formation and degradation of cartilage and bone, following the initiation of adalimumab
treatment compared to placebo in the same cohort of patients. The results on soluble
biomarkers presented in this paper are supplementary to the results previously published on
synovial biomarkers. The ultimate goal of our studies is to identify biomarkers that could
be used in combination as a screening tool to differentiate on the group level between
potentially effective and ineffective treatments in small proof of principle studies during
an early stage of clinical development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study protocol</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Academic Medical

if serum biomarkers of cartilage and bone metabolism could be used to screen for potential
efficacy on the group level in small, early phase trials of short duration. The recent rise
in new drugs discovered may have consequences for the way these potential novel therapies
are tested in patients. This is usually done in relatively large, placebo-controlled
clinical trials. It has become increasingly difficult to enrol a large number of patients
with active disease in these trials, because of the growing number of compounds to be
tested, and the fact that effective treatment is available for many patients. Therefore, in
an early stage of drug development it could be favourable to test potential drugs in a short
intensive proof of principle trial for selection purposes, using a small number of patients
in which a large amount of data is collected. If no clinical or biological effect is found
in such a trial, the compound appears less likely to be effective in a larger clinical trial
of longer duration. If, on the other hand, there is a clear clinical and/or biological
effect, the compound may be effective, and could be considered for conventional phase 2
clinical trials to determine whether these effects appear clinically meaningful. Our results
suggest that MMP-3 and perhaps MIA may be instrumental as a screening method to test new
drug candidates for PsA requiring relatively small numbers of subjects. Obviously, the
results presented here need to be confirmed and validated in a comparable study design using
another effective drug with a different mechanism of action, for instance ustekinumab <xref rid="pone.0012556-Gottlieb1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, for which this study provides
the rationale.</p><p>We found a rapid and strong reduction of serum MMP-3, a matrix metalloproteinase that is
involved in inflammation as well as degradation of cartilage and bone, after initiation of
adalimumab therapy. The effect of treatment on reduction of MMP-3 in serum was comparable
with the reduction of measures of inflammation (CRP levels and ESR) in the ANCOVA model. The
change in serum MMP-3 levels also strongly correlated with clinical improvement as measured
by DAS28. The observed changes in MMP-3 concentration are interesting for 2 reasons. First,
this may reflect a change in cartilage degradation in the affected joints, while the
assessment of CRP and ESR merely represents a change in inflammation. Secondly, it is of
particular interest in patients with PsA, because these patients do not always have elevated
levels of CRP and ESR, even while their disease is active. The decrease in MMP-3 was
sustained up to 12 weeks.</p><p>It has been shown that serum MMP-3 levels are elevated in patients with inflammatory
arthritis compared with healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0012556-Yoshihara1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0012556-Garnero4" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. There is still
controversy, however, whether baseline MMP-3 level or change in MMP-3 level after treatment
are good predictors for future radiographic progression in individual patients. While some
authors find an association between baseline MMP-3 and subsequent radiographic joint damage
<xref rid="pone.0012556-Yamanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012556-Tchetverikov1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0012556-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, some do not <xref rid="pone.0012556-denBroeder1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012556-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Evidence for a correlation between radiographic
progression and reduction of MMP-3 level after treatment was reported by only one group
<xref rid="pone.0012556-YoungMin1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The rapid decrease of
serum MMP-3 level after TNF blocking therapy is in line with earlier observations in
patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). In a study with 22 patients with active SpA who were
treated with infliximab (n = 12 including 6 PsA patients) or placebo (n = 10) <xref rid="pone.0012556-Vandooren1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, there was a significant
reduction of serum MMP-3 level one week after start of infliximab treatment, which was
sustained up to week 12, while no changes were observed in the placebo treated patients.
Similarly, an open-label study showed a significant decrease in serum MMP-3 levels 12 weeks
after initiation of etanercept treatment in 20 SpA patients (including 6 PsA patients) <xref rid="pone.0012556-Kruithof2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In patients with ankylosing
spondylitis treated with adalimumab (n = 38), serum MMP-3 concentration significantly
decreased after 12 weeks of treatment, while it was unchanged after placebo <xref rid="pone.0012556-Maksymowych1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>We also found an increase of serum MIA, a marker for chondrocyte activity, after 4 weeks of
adalimumab treatment. The change in serum MIA levels correlated with clinical improvement as
measured by DAS28 at week 4 in the adalimumab treated patients. It has been demonstrated
that serum MIA levels are reduced in patients with active inflammatory arthritis when
compared to healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0012556-MullerLadner1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012556-Vandooren2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. A 39%
increase of serum MIA concentration was observed in 15 RA patients one year after start with
infliximab, as compared to a 20% increase in 25 SpA patients <xref rid="pone.0012556-Vandooren2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In a subset of 7 RA patients receiving
infliximab, it was demonstrated that this increase in serum MIA level was detectable from
week 30 and beyond. Of interest, we observed a swift increase in serum MIA concentration
after initiation of adalimumab treatment in PsA patients after 4 weeks, but after 12 weeks
no significant effect could be detected. This could indicate that initiation of adalimumab
therapy in PsA patients induces a short period of enhanced chondrocyte activity in PsA
patients after initiation of adalimumab therapy, which returns to normal after several
weeks. However, the control group did not show an increase in MIA level after initiation of
adalimumab. More data are obviously needed to understand the underlying mechanism of MIA
regulation and the effect of TNF blockade.</p><p>Only small (trends towards) changes were observed in the other markers tested after
initiation of TNF blocking therapy. Although these trends may reflect an important
biological mechanism, these markers may not be the best candidates to assess effective
therapy in early phase clinical trials of short duration. MMP-3 seems to be more responsive
to change than the other markers involved in cartilage breakdown. The lack of change of the
other markers might be explained in part by the relatively short study duration. The goal of
our study was to identify biomarkers that may help to distinguish between effective and
ineffective therapy in proof of principle studies of short duration. We cannot exclude the
possibility that changes would be seen for CPII and COMP after more prolonged treatment</p><p>In conclusion, adalimumab therapy in PsA is associated with a specific and highly
significant decrease in serum MMP-3 and an increase in serum MIA levels, suggesting that the
measurement of these soluble biomarkers, known to be associated with the effects on the
structural integrity of the joints, could be useful for screening purposes on the group
level in proof of principle trials during early drug development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0012556.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>Consort checklist.</p><p>(0.19 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0012556.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0012556.s002"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Changes in serum levels of MMP-3 in relationship to treatment.
