Initial randomization continued till 24 weeks. Patients who did not contravene the exclusion criteria at 24 weeks were allowed to enter &#x02265;52-week double-blind extension trial stretching to a long-term period of 76-week. Observations were compared from baseline to week 76.</p><p>T2DM patients previously untreated (no oral or injected antidiabetes treatment for 12 weeks before randomization) were recruited with inclusion criteria of age 18&#x02013;65 years (for India), body mass index &#x02264;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and inadequate glycemic control despite a diet and exercise regimen (HbA1c 7&#x000b7;0%&#x02013;10&#x000b7;0%).

All patients provided signed and dated informed consent before enrolment; the study was approved by institutional review boards, independent ethics committees, and competent authorities according to national and international regulations. Throughout this trial, independent data monitoring committee monitored the safety of the patients (every 3 months).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Randomization procedure</title><p>Patients who passed the screening were randomized in a triple-dummy manner to empagliflozin 10 mg (E10), empagliflozin 25 mg (E25), sitagliptin 100 mg (S100), or placebo. All treatments were given once-a-day. Randomization sequence was computer generated, and allocation was performed using interactive voice and internet-bases response systems. Blinding of patients, investigators, and data analysis team was ensured. Access to the randomization code was strictly limited. In case of emergency, code break was available to the investigator through the interactive voice and internet-based response system. Unexpected Suspected Serious Adverse Reactions were according to regulatory requirements for drug safety analyses.</p><p>During extension phase, lifestyle advice to the patients was continued as per local recommendations. Rescue medications administered during initial 24-week randomization period were continued during extension phase if patients were still receiving those treatments. During this phase, rescue drug was allowed if patients had confirmed plasma glucose level after an overnight fast was &#x0003e;10 mmol/L or HbA1c was &#x0003e;8% and the choice was as per the discretion of investigator. DPP-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs were not allowed as rescue medications as sitagliptin was one of the study arms. If control of any hypo- or hyper-glycemia was not achieved in any patient, such patients were discontinued from the trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Efficacy endpoints</title><p>During the initial 24-week randomized trial, the primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c level. No primary efficacy endpoints were defined for extension phase study, but exploratory efficacy endpoints during this phase were change from baseline in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) body weight, SBP, and diastolic BP (DBP) at week 76. Other exploratory endpoints included the percentage of patients with HbA1c &#x0003c;7% and the need of rescue therapy. Baseline was defined as the last observed measurement before the first administration of study drug in the initial trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Reported adverse events (AEs) were assessed for safety. AE of special interest was confirmed hypoglycemia event (plasma glucose &#x02264;3.9 mmol/L and/or requiring assistance). Other AEs such as urinary tract infection (UTI), genital infection, and volume depletion and clinical laboratory values were assessed as change from baseline to week-76.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>There was no estimation of sample size as any eligible patient was allowed to enter the extension phase. Hence, the formal calculations for sample size were not done. Changes from baseline in HbA1c, FPG, weight, SBP, and DBP at 76 were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model in the full analysis set (patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study drug and had a baseline HbA1c measurement in the initial study) with baseline HbA1c and the baseline value of the endpoint in question as linear covariates, and baseline eGFR (MDRD), region (Asia, etc.,) and treatment as fixed effects. Data after rescue therapy were set as missing and all missing data were imputed considering last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach. Percentage of patients achieving HbA1c &#x0003c;7% at week 76 was assessed with a logistic regression model. Treatment, baseline eGFR, region, and baseline HbA1c were parameters considered for logistic regression. Patients who did not complete 76-week were considered failures for this assessment.</p><p>Changes in HbA1c, FPG, weight, SBP, and DBP were analyzed with sensitivity analyses. Restricted maximum likelihood-based mixed model repeated measures approach considering baseline HbA1c and the baseline value of the endpoint in question as linear covariates, and baseline eGFR, region, treatment, visit, and visit by treatment interaction as fixed effects were used for the same. Rescue therapy use was assessed with logistic regression carried with treatment as a factor and baseline HbA1c as a covariate.</p><p>Safety was assessed in the patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study drug.

Significant reductions in HbA1c compared to placebo and in FPG compared placebo as well as sitagliptin suggest sustained glycemic control with both 10 and 25 mg doses of empagliflozin. These results are consistent with the initial 24-week randomized study.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This is also well supported by a finding that a significant number of patients achieved glycemic target of HbA1c &#x0003c;7% at week 76 compared to placebo and though nonsignificantly but numerically higher compared to sitagliptin. Among nonglycemic benefits, weight loss observed with empagliflozin was sustained and was significantly more when compared to placebo but not that of sitagliptin though weight loss was numerically higher. This finding is essential in the context of weight gain being a common side effect with major antidiabetic drugs and maintaining clinically meaningful weight is a challenge in most patients.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Further, weight loss has potential benefits of improvement in insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular (CV) risk profile.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Weight loss due to empagliflozin is due to reduction in fat mass from visceral as well as abdominal subcutaneous adipose fat stores.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In T2DM, obese patients with multiple insulin injections per day, empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg for 52 weeks, resulted in significant glycemic lowering and reduction in weight and had significant reductions in daily insulin requirement as compared to placebo.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Empagliflozin is thus a useful agent for obese, inadequately controlled T2DM receiving multiple daily doses of insulin. This finding is essential to note as Indian diabetics are obese, overweight, and have a high degree of insulin resistance.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Empagliflozin thus seem as a suitable antidiabetic agent in Indian diabetics.</p><p>BP reduction, especially SBP has been reported with empagliflozin as compared to placebo.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In this Indian subgroup, we found no significant reduction in SBP and DBP with either dose of empagliflozin compared to placebo or sitagliptin. Although nonsignificant, the reduction in SBP reached to a magnitude of nearly 4 mmHg with empagliflozin 25 mg in comparison to placebo and sitagliptin which is similar to that observed in other long-term studies with empagliflozin.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Consistent effects on glycemic parameters, body weight, and BP possibly confer benefits in CV outcomes. This was evident in a recent EMPA-REG OUTCOME<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> trial.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In T2DM patients with high CV risk, addition of empagliflozin to standard treatment significantly reduced primary composite outcome (CV death nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke), CV death, heart failure hospitalizations, and overall mortality as compared to placebo.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Although the exact mechanisms by which it conferred CV outcome benefits are not clear, it is argued that effect on glycemia, BP, and weight along with reduction in plasma volume leads to observed effects.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Further, reduction vascular in arterial stiffness and vascular resistance may have contributed to the beneficial outcome.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Tolerability of empagliflozin in both 10 and 25 mg doses was equivalent to that of sitagliptin and placebo. Because of unique mechanism of action reducing glycemic load with no dependence on insulin,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] hypoglycemia is likely to be minimal with empagliflozin. Results in Indian subgroup are consistent with previous reports where empagliflozin monotherapy displayed a lack of hypoglycemia.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Significantly less number of patients required rescue therapy in both doses of empagliflozin compared to placebo supports the fact that no severe hypoglycemia were encountered. Proportion of patients with UTI was similar in placebo, sitagliptin, and empagliflozin treatment groups. This is consistent with previous reports of empagliflozin highlighting no increased risk of UTI with empagliflozin.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Higher frequency in females suggests ascending infection because of short urethra in females. Proportion of genital infections was higher in empagliflozin groups compared to placebo and sitagliptin. This is in-line with previous reports suggesting higher genital infections with SGLT-2 inhibitors.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] A higher frequency of genital infections with empagliflozin has been described previously in a long-term trial.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Importantly, no single AE was responsible for discontinuation of treatment either with empagliflozin or sitagliptin suggesting treatments being well tolerated.</p><p>Strengths of this extension study include continuation of randomized, double-blind treatments over long term, and inclusion of sitagliptin as an active comparator group. Limitation is that the endpoints though prespecified were exploratory and not primary endpoints and data imputation using LOCF approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg are safe and effective treatments for glycemic control in Indian patients with T2DM. Nonglycemic benefits of weight loss and BP reduction can significantly contribute to the improvement of insulin resistance which is a common phenotype in Indian diabetic patients. Sustained glycemic and weight benefits over 76 weeks promise a definite long-term well-tolerated therapy with empagliflozin in Indian T2DM.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was financially supported by the Boehringer Ingelheim India Pvt.
