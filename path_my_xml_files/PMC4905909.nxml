skeletal muscle mass that is based on a sedentary population is applicable to young male
athletes, and 2) to develop a new skeletal muscle mass prediction model for young male
athletes. [Subjects and Methods] The skeletal muscle mass of 61 male athletes was measured
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and estimated using a previous prediction model
(Sanada et al., 2006) with B-mode ultrasonography. The prediction model was not suitable
for young male athletes, as a significant difference was observed between the means of the
estimated and MRI-measured skeletal muscle mass. Next, the same subjects were randomly
assigned to a development or validation group, and a new model specifically relevant to
young male athletes was developed based on MRI and ultrasound data obtained from the
development group. [Results] A strong correlation was observed between the skeletal muscle
mass estimated by the new model and the MRI-measured skeletal muscle mass (r=0.96) in the
validation group, without significant difference between their means. No bias was found in
the new model using Bland-Altman analysis (r=&#x02212;0.25). [Conclusion] These results validate
the new model and suggest that ultrasonography is a reliable method for measuring skeletal
muscle mass in young male athletes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Muscle thickness</kwd><kwd>B-mode ultrasonography</kwd><kwd>Magnetic resonance imaging</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the field of competitive sports, athletes need to be able to regularly evaluate their
whole body skeletal muscle mass (SMM) using a simple method. Some athletes, particularly
those engaged in intense contact sports like rugby and American football, must gain weight
and build a large SMM, which can be achieved through long-term nutritional support and
resistance training. The net effect of nutrition management and training on SMM gain should
be successively evaluated for these athletes as a source of continuous feedback. Thus, a
convenient and reliable method for assessing the SMM of athletes would be useful for both
nutritionists and athletic trainers. There are currently no established methods for
measuring SMM in this manner, although a number of general methods do exist, such as
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and anthropometry<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although MRIs and CTs are able to scan the entire body and are
considered the gold standard for imaging, they are quite expensive to perform and involve
extensive measurements. Another modality is ultrasonography, which has been used for the
accurate measurement of skeletal muscle size in vivo<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. A compact ultrasound
system, which can quantify muscle thickness (MTH), requires very little time to perform the
measurements and would seem optimal for use in the field.</p><p>Previous studies<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> led us to hypothesize
that an ultrasound-based prediction model for SMM could be applied to competitive athletes,
and our first objective was to determine whether the existing prediction model<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> was relevant young male athletes (Study I).
Based on the results of Study I, we developed a new prediction model for estimating SMM
using ultrasonography that specifically targets young male athletes, and verified its
validity (Study II).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 61 healthy Japanese young male athletes engaged in contact sports (rugby,
20; American football, 23; lacrosse, 18; mean age (SD), 20.4 (0.9) years; height, 175.0
(6.4) cm; body mass, 82.5 (15.0)&#x02005;kg). None of the subjects had neurological disorders. This
study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of Ritsumeikan University Biwako-Kusatsu
Campus (BKC-IRB-2012-031). Each subject received an explanation of the nature and purpose of
the study, and provided written informed consent.</p><p>All subjects participated in both Study I and Study II. In Study II, subjects were randomly
assigned to two groups: 40 were involved in tests for developing the new prediction model
for SMM (development group), and 21 were involved in model validation (validation
group).</p><p>All measurements for both studies were completed in one or two visits to the laboratory and
were performed on the same day, except for the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Body mass
and height were measured with a digital weight scale (0.1&#x02005;kg resolution) and a standard
height scale, respectively. Percent body fat and fat-free mass were determined by
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Prodigy, GE, Tokyo). SMM measurements were conducted
by MRI and ultrasonography.</p><p>SMM was directly measured by MRI (Signa HDxt 1.5T, GE) using the following parameters:
repetition time of 600&#x02005;ms, echo time of 10&#x02005;ms, slice thickness of 1.0&#x02005;cm, and inter-slice
gap of 0. During the measurements, the subjects were in the prone position with their hands
placed on their abdomen. Approximately 200 consecutive scanned images were obtained from the
first cervical vertebra to the lateral malleolus. The scanned images were stored on a hard
disk, and the anatomical cross-sectional area was determined using image analysis software
(Slice Omatic Ver.4.3, Tomovision, Inc., Montreal, Canada). Total body skeletal muscle
volume (L) was calculated from the sum of successive anatomical cross-sectional areas and
converted to mass (kg) (i.e., SMM) by multiplying the total skeletal muscle volume (L) by
the assumed constant density for adipose tissue-free skeletal muscle
(1.04&#x02005;kg&#x02022;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>MTH was measured by B-mode ultrasound at nine sites on the anterior and posterior surfaces
of the body. The location of the probe was determined according to a previous study<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, as follows:</p><p>(1) Forearm lateral: on the anterior surface at 30% proximal between the styloid process
and the head of the radius;</p><p>(2, 3) Biceps and triceps brachii: on the anterior and posterior surfaces at 60% distal
between the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and the acromial process of the scapula;</p><p>(4) Abdomen: at a distance of 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;cm to the right of the umbilicus;</p><p>(5) Subscapula: at a distance of 5&#x02005;cm directly below the inferior angle of the scapula;</p><p>(6, 7) Quadriceps and hamstrings: on the anterior and posterior surfaces at midway between
the lateral condyle of the femur and the greater trochanter;</p><p>(8, 9) Gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior: on the anterior and posterior surfaces at 30%
proximal between the lateral malleolus of the fibula and the lateral condyle of the
tibia.</p><p>MTH was visually determined by ultrasonography using on-screen digital calipers. MTH was
defined as the distance between the adipose tissue-muscle interface and the muscle-bone
interface<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and MTH9 was calculated from
measurements at the nine sites described above. Body height was adopted as a measure with
which to estimate skeletal muscle length and was one of the independent variables used for
SMM estimation<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ultrasound
measurements and determinations of muscle thicknesses for all subjects were conducted by a
single observer who was very familiar with these procedures.</p><p>In Study I, since our objective was to determine whether a previously developed prediction
model for SMM<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, which uses ultrasound MTH9
as an independent variable, can be applied to the estimation of SMM in young male athletes,
the MTH9 values of the young male athletes were entered into the previous prediction model.
This allowed for a simultaneous comparison of the SMM values calculated using the model with
the SMM values directly measured by MRI. Differences between the MRI-measured and
ultrasound-predicted SMM values were assessed using a paired t-test. Descriptive statistics
are expressed as means (SD), and p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>In Study II, further analyses were performed using data obtained in Study I to formulate a
new prediction model specific to young male athletes and to verify its efficacy, using the
method described previously<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Briefly, the
new prediction model was a first-order (i.e., linear) function: (SMM(x) = ax + b), wherein
MTH9 (cm) multiplied by body height (m) was used as the explanatory variable x. In order to
determine the proportional constant (a) and intercept (b), a simple linear regression
analysis between the explanatory variable (x) and MRI-measured SMM was performed for the
measured data in the development group (n=40). The validity of the new model was confirmed
in the validation group (n=21) using the measured data (i.e., MRI data and MTH9 &#x000d7; body
height). Linear regression analysis was performed between the MRI-measured SMM value and the
SMM value predicted by the new model. A paired t-test was also performed between the
MRI-measured and predicted SMM values. The validity of the new model was further assessed
using the method suggested by Bland and Altman<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this approach, the differences between the MRI-measured and
predicted SMM values were plotted against the means of the MRI-measured and predicted SMM
values.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The subject characteristics and ultrasound-measured MTH values are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

and validation groups. In Study I, the mean SMM measured by MRI was 35.9 (5.3)&#x02005;kg, which
substantially differed from that predicted by the initial model (31.2 (5.0)&#x02005;kg; p&#x0003c;0.001).
On average, the percent difference between directly measured and estimated SMM values was
13.1% (4.4%). These results suggest that the previously developed prediction model cannot be
applied to young male athletes.</p><p>In Study II, there was a strong correlation between MRI-measured SMM (kg) and the product
of MTH9 (cm) and body height (m) (r=0.94, p&#x0003c;0.001) in the development group (n=40), as
indicated by the following equation (Eq. (1)):<disp-formula>SMM (kg) = 0.645 &#x000d7; (MTH9 (cm) &#x000d7;
Body height (m)) &#x02212; 7.821 (1)</disp-formula></p><p>Eq. (1) is the new prediction model specific to young male athletes. In order to assess the
reliability of the new model, we applied it to the validation group, which consisted of
different subjects than those in the development group. A strong correlation was observed
between the MRI-measured SMM and the SMM values predicted by Eq. (1) (r=0.96, p&#x0003c;0.001).
The mean predicted SMM in the validation group was 38.5 (5.7)&#x02005;kg, which was equal to the
MRI-measured SMM (38.5 (5.8)&#x02005;kg) (p=0.98, paired t-test). Furthermore, the new prediction
model was not biased, as confirmed by Bland-Altman analysis (r=&#x02212;0.25, p=0.23).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Sanada et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> developed and validated an
equation for estimating SMM using ultrasound parameters based on data from a sedentary
Japanese adult population (72 sedentary men and women; age range, 18&#x02013;61 years) [SMM (kg) =
0.687 &#x000d7; (sum of MTHs at nine body sites (MTH9) (cm)) &#x000d7; (body height (m)) &#x02212; 15.122]. That
prediction model allowed for the estimation of total and regional skeletal muscle mass in
field measurements for a large subject group, and was a portable and timesaving method.
Midorikawa et al. then verified the reliability of that SMM prediction model in Japanese
pre-pubertal children and adolescents, suggesting that it could also be used for that
population. More recently, Abe et al. reported on the utility of the model for estimating
SMM in Caucasian adults aged 50&#x02013;78 years. However, no studies to date have determined
whether the model could be used to estimate SMM in young athletes.</p><p>The first goal of this study was therefore to determine whether that existing model could
be applied to young male athletes. We found that the SMM values predicted using the previous
model were significantly lower than those directly measured by MRI, suggesting that the
model underestimates SMM and cannot be applied to this population.</p><p>In a previous study, the muscularity of elite junior weight lifters was compared with that
of non-trained subjects by measuring MTH at 10 sites (anterior forearm, anterior upper arm,
posterior upper arm, chest, abdomen, back, anterior thigh, posterior thigh, anterior lower
leg, and posterior lower leg) using B-mode ultrasonography<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. At six sites (anterior forearm, anterior upper arm, posterior
upper arm, chest, back, and anterior thigh), the weight lifters showed significantly greater
MTH (9&#x02013;24%) than the non-trained subjects, even when MTH was corrected for body mass. The
difference in MTH between groups was largest at the chest. In contrast to that study, we did
not measure chest MTH in Study 1, and the large potential difference in pectoralis major
muscle mass between young male athletes and sedentary individuals may account for the
substantial error in the SMM estimated for young male athletes using the previously
developed model. To address this, we developed a new prediction model specific to young male
athletes. The correlation coefficient (r=0.96) between MRI-measured SMM values and those
predicted using the new model in the validation group was as high as that reported for the
previous prediction model (r=0.97)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
suggests that the new prediction model is highly accurate and thus a possible alternative to
MRI.</p><p>In summary, the existing skeletal muscle mass prediction model<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> was found to underestimate the SMM of young male athletes.
This prompted us to develop and validate a more accurate model specific to this population
that would be convenient for field measurements due to its portability and efficiency.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>ZM</given-names></name><name><surname>Heymsfield</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Skeletal muscle mass and aging: regional and whole-body
