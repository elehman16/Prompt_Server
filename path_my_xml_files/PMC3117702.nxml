SFC produced significant improvements over placebo in all three SGRQ domains during the study: (Symptoms -3.6 [95% CI -4.8, -2.4], Activity -2.8 [95% CI -3.9, -1.6], Impacts -3.2 [95% CI -4.3, -2.1]) but the pattern of change over time differed between domains. SGRQ deteriorated faster in patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages III &#x00026; IV relative to GOLD stage II (p &#x0003c; 0.001). There was no difference in the relationship between deterioration in SGRQ Total score and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) decline (as % predicted) in men and women. Significantly faster deterioration in Total score relative to FEV<sub>1 </sub>% predicted was seen in older patients (&#x02265; 65 years) and there was an age-related change in Total score that was independent of change in FEV<sub>1</sub>. The relationship between deterioration in FEV<sub>1 </sub>and SGRQ did not differ in different world regions, but patients in Asia-Pacific showed a large improvement in score that was unrelated to FEV<sub>1 </sub>change.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In addition to treatment effects, health status changes in clinical trials may be influenced by demographic and disease-related factors.

Disease-specific questionnaires like the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) reflect a wide range of different health impacts in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], are designed to provide an overall measure of impairment, and are now used widely in randomized controlled trials in COPD. A number of relatively small longitudinal observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] have shown that a decline in health status may be seen over time, but there have been relatively few studies of long-term treatment effects on health status decline. The first of these was the Inhaled Steroids in Obstructive Lung Disease (ISOLDE) study, which showed that health status measured using the SGRQ deteriorated progressively over 3 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], an effect that was slowed by the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) fluticasone propionate (FP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The recent 3-year Towards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) and 4-year Understanding Potential Long-term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium (UPLIFT) studies have both reported health status gains that lasted the entire duration of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In view of the pivotal nature of these studies, it is important to understand the nature of these improvements and factors that may influence them. We have used data from the TORCH trial to explore these factors.</p><p>TORCH was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized parallel group study to investigate the benefits of FP and the long-acting beta<sub>2 </sub>agonist salmeterol (SAL) combined in one inhaler (SAL + FP [SFC]) vs. placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Patients were recruited from 42 countries. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 3 years, measured in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Health status, measured using the SGRQ, was a pre-specified secondary endpoint. The results obtained with the total SGRQ score have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In this analysis, we provide data about the effect of therapy on the SGRQ domains, and an analysis of demographic and disease-related factors that may influence long-term changes in health status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Details of the TORCH study design and analysis plan have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The study was approved by local ethics review committees and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients gave written informed consent. Methods pertaining specifically to the current analysis will be described here.</p><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The population for this study (the 'health outcomes population') was a subset of the total efficacy population. It consisted of patients for whom SGRQ questionnaire translations were determined to be linguistically and culturally valid, could potentially have a total SGRQ score calculated, and had completed at least one questionnaire during the study. Suitable translations were not available for five languages at the start of the study. Furthermore, where translations were available, during the years from study inception to conclusion the standards required for linguistic validity had evolved. We wished to ensure that all translations met current standards, so prior to breaking the treatment code, and independently of the sponsor, each country-language combination went through a process of two back translations, pilot testing in COPD patients and developer review. Based on this, one of three actions was taken:</p><p>&#x02022; country-language combination was judged valid (n = 28)</p><p>&#x02022; country-language combination was valid after developer-agreed modification of the scoring algorithm:</p><p>&#x025e6; if there were &#x02264; 2 poorly translated items that could be removed (n = 4)</p><p>&#x025e6; incorrect response ordering that could be corrected when scoring (n = 1)</p><p>&#x02022; country-language combination was excluded - failed to meet current standards (n = 4).</p><p>For the analysis of the relationship between the change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and the change in SGRQ, only patients with measurements of both endpoints during treatment and at the same timepoint were included. Therefore this is a subset of the general health outcomes population.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Missed SGRQ items were handled according to the developers' instructions in the SGRQ manual. Scores were analyzed as change from baseline using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) including treatment, smoking status, age, gender, baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>, body mass index (BMI), region, visit, treatment by visit, baseline SGRQ score, and visit by baseline SGRQ. Estimated treatment differences at each visit were averaged with equal weights to obtain the overall treatment effect over the study period.</p><p>The impact of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage on change in SGRQ score from baseline was assessed using MMRM analysis of the placebo arm employing identical covariates, except that the GOLD stage was incorporated into the model and treatment was not.</p><p>The impact of demographic factors on the relationship between change in SGRQ and change in FEV<sub>1 </sub>over 3 years was tested using analysis of covariance, with and without adjustment for baseline covariates. All treatment arms were combined for this analysis; because of its exploratory nature, significance was accepted at p &#x0003c; 0.01. We tested both the slope of this relationship and the intercept, this being the change in SGRQ associated with no change in FEV<sub>1</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 6112 patients that formed the primary efficacy population, 4951 provided SGRQ data that met the criteria for inclusion in the health outcomes population in 28 of 42 countries that participated in TORCH. Patients were allocated to one of five regions that had been pre-specified (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> for details). Baseline demographics by treatment group are presented in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, along with corresponding data from the patients in the ITT population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Baseline variables were very similar across treatment groups and between the health outcomes and ITT populations. Differences between the two study populations in terms of proportion of patients recruited from different regions were due to the absence of suitably validated questionnaires for some languages in Asia-Pacific and Eastern Europe.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic and baseline characteristics of health outcomes population and all randomized patients (efficacy population)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center">Variable</th><th align="center">Placebo<break/>(n = 1231)</th><th align="center">SAL<break/>(n = 1232)</th><th align="center">FP<break/>(n = 1248)</th><th align="center">SFC<break/>(n = 1240)</th><th align="center">Total HO population<break/>(n = 4951)</th><th align="center">Total population<break/>(n = 6112)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Age at enrollment (years)</td><td align="center">65.0 (8.2)</td><td align="center">65.2 (8.2)</td><td align="center">65.0 (8.5)</td><td align="center">65.0 (8.3)</td><td align="center">65.1 (8.3)</td><td align="center">65.0 (8.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Male gender (%)</td><td align="center">921 (75)</td><td align="center">926 (75)</td><td align="center">923 (74)</td><td align="center">912 (74)</td><td align="center">3682 (74)</td><td align="center">4631 (76)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center">25.8 (5.2)</td><td align="center">25.7 (5.1)</td><td align="center">25.6 (5.2)</td><td align="center">25.6 (5.3)</td><td align="center">25.7 (5.2)</td><td align="center">25.4 (5.18)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Geographical region (%)</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="center">USA</td><td align="center">342 (27.8)</td><td align="center">344 (27.9)</td><td align="center">348 (27.9)</td><td align="center">345 (27.8)</td><td align="center">1379 (27.9)</td><td align="center">1388 (22.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Asia-Pacific</td><td align="center">89 (7.2)</td><td align="center">93 (7.5)</td><td align="center">95 (7.6)</td><td align="center">93 (7.5)</td><td align="center">370 (7.5)</td><td align="center">758 (12.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Eastern Europe</td><td align="center">185 (15)</td><td align="center">186 (15.1)</td><td align="center">185 (14.8)</td><td align="center">184 (14.8)</td><td align="center">740 (14.9)</td><td align="center">1154 (18.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Western Europe</td><td align="center">410 (33.3)</td><td align="center">405 (32.9)</td><td align="center">413 (33.1)</td><td align="center">409 (33)</td><td align="center">1637 (33.1)</td><td align="center">1908 (31.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Other</td><td align="center">205 (16.7)</td><td align="center">204 (16.6)</td><td align="center">207 (16.6)</td><td align="center">209 (16.9)</td><td align="center">825 (16.7)</td><td align="center">935 (15.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Current smoker (%)</td><td align="center">538 (44)</td><td align="center">536 (44)</td><td align="center">543 (44)</td><td align="center">539 (43)</td><td align="center">2156 (44)</td><td align="center">2630 (43)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Pack-years smoked</td><td align="center">49.5 (27.5)</td><td align="center">50.6 (28.6)</td><td align="center">50.0 (28.8)</td><td align="center">47.7 (26.6)</td><td align="center">49.4 (27.9)</td><td align="center">48.5 (27.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>(l)*</td><td align="center">1.24 (0.42)</td><td align="center">1.21 (0.40)</td><td align="center">1.22 (0.42)</td><td align="center">1.24 (0.43)</td><td align="center">1.23 (0.42)</td><td align="center">1.22 (0.42)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1 </sub>(% predicted*)</td><td align="center">44.5 (12.3)</td><td align="center">43.7 (12.4)</td><td align="center">44.3 (12.3)</td><td align="center">44.6 (12.3)</td><td align="center">44.3 (12.3)</td><td align="center">44.0 (12.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Reversibility (% predicted FEV<sub>1</sub>)*</td><td align="center">3.7 (3.8)</td><td align="center">3.7 (4.0)</td><td align="center">3.6 (3.7)</td><td align="center">3.7 (3.6)</td><td align="center">3.7 (3.8)</td><td align="center">3.7 (3.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio*</td><td align="center">48.4 (11.0)</td><td align="center">48.6 (11.0)</td><td align="center">48.1 (10.8)</td><td align="center">48.1 (10.8)</td><td align="center">48.3 (10.9)</td><td align="center">48.6 (10.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Baseline SGRQ total score</td><td align="center">49.0 (17.4)</td><td align="center">49.9 (16.6)</td><td align="center">49.5 (17.1)</td><td align="center">48.9 (17.4)</td><td align="center">49.3 (17.1)</td><td align="center">-</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data are mean (standard deviation) unless otherwise indicated</p><p>*Data are from visit one (screening)</p><p>BMI = body mass index;

There were improvements in all SGRQ domains with all active treatments, but SFC had the greatest effect. Interestingly, the pattern of change in score differed between domains. The Activity and Impact scores behaved similarly to those reported in ISOLDE, another 3-year study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] but the behaviour of the Symptoms domain was clearly different because the initial improvement was maintained for the rest of the study with no apparent deterioration. A similar pattern has been reported with the SGRQ symptoms score in the 3-year Bronchitis Randomized on NAC Cost-Utility Study (BRONCUS) trial of n-acetyl cysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. One possible explanation may be the large and prolonged effect of a single exacerbation on SGRQ score, particularly the Symptoms domain, which may continue for over 3 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In TORCH, patients were excluded only if they had an exacerbation requiring treatment during the 2-week run-in period, so the sustained improvement seen in this domain may have occurred if some patients had an exacerbation in the weeks before run-in. In BRONCUS, exacerbations prior to randomization were not an exclusion criterion. By contrast, in ISOLDE, the patients had a 6-week run-in period and were then given a 2-week course of prednisolone, so effects of any prior exacerbations would have been minimized.</p><p>Our exploratory subgroup analyses provide observations that generate new hypotheses about health status decline in COPD. The rate of deterioration in men and women relative to loss of FEV<sub>1 </sub>appeared to be the same once gender differences in the absolute value of FEV<sub>1 </sub>were taken into account. Patients with severe and very severe airway obstruction at baseline showed significant deterioration in their health status over 3 years, whereas those with moderate obstruction improved. One possible explanation for this difference is the effect of exacerbations on SGRQ scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and the known relationship between FEV<sub>1 </sub>and exacerbation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In TORCH, patients with no exacerbations showed a mean improvement in Total SGRQ score over 3 years, whereas those with &#x0003e; 1 exacerbation per year had a significant worsening of health. A link between SGRQ deterioration and exacerbation rate was reported in ISOLDE, and statistical modelling of those data suggested a causal relationship between a lower rate of exacerbations in patients with FP and a slower rate of worsening of SGRQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These observations from ISOLDE and TORCH suggest that recurrent exacerbations have a cumulative effect on health status similar to that reported for FEV<sub>1 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Older people appeared to have a faster loss of health status than younger people. This was seen after other demographic and disease-related effects such as gender and baseline FEV<sub>1 </sub>had been taken into account, suggesting that health status deterioration in COPD may accelerate with age. This may be related to increasing comorbidity, but another factor may be an age-related increase in frailty and self-reported functional decline, rather than a specific chronic disease effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>There appears to have been a 'trial effect' in Asia-Pacific, where sustained improvements in SGRQ score were seen irrespective of whether patients received active study treatment. One plausible explanation for this is that patients' health in that region, particularly China, may have improved because they received better healthcare by joining a clinical trial (JP Zheng, personal communication). China contributed 65% of the Asia-Pacific patients and a similar SGRQ improvement has been reported in the placebo limb of two large studies from that country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], although this was not seen in a third [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. One of the studies compared SFC with placebo and the active treatment produced a significantly greater effect on SGRQ despite a large effect on placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In TORCH, the relationship between deterioration in SGRQ and decline in FEV<sub>1 </sub>in Asia-Pacific was not different from that seen in the other regions. Taken together, these observations suggest that the SGRQ does measure treatment effects and disease progression in China and Asia-Pacific in a similar way to other countries. However, such instruments also appear to detect health status gains that may occur on recruitment to a clinical trial in developing health economies. In this context, it should be noted that the withdrawal rate in the USA was 56% compared with 29% in Asia-Pacific.</p><p>TORCH extends the observations reported in other studies that patients with poor health at baseline and those that deteriorated faster were more likely to withdraw earlier than others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In TORCH, the only patients who remained in the study for more than 30 months were those in whom there had, on average, been no deterioration in health status compared with baseline. This suggests that patients and their physicians expect the patient's health to improve on entering a study of this kind, and any deterioration may lead to early withdrawal. This will lead to a 'healthy survivor' effect as many of the sickest people withdraw. That effect becomes especially important when there is differential drop-out between treatment arms, as in this study where there was a 10% absolute and 20% relative difference in drop-out rate between the placebo and SFC arms. This 'informative drop-out' process may lead to a biased estimate of treatment efficacy, in this case an underestimate. Health status measurements now form an established assessment of treatment efficacy in COPD because they are a marker of an important clinical outcome (health-related quality of life) and are poorly correlated with FEV<sub>1</sub>. The observations made here were obtained with the SGRQ but are likely to be seen with any validated health status measure in COPD, as a comparison between the SGRQ and a new instrument with a very different structure showed that the two questionnaires appear to be highly correlated and behave in a very similar way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This analysis suggests that studies with a low baseline exacerbation frequency, different drop-out rates, and large Eastern Europe and Asia-Pacific region participation may not give the same results as those involving participants in Western Europe and the USA.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors have completed the Unified Competing Interest form at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf">http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf</ext-link> (available on request from the corresponding author) (URL) and declare; <bold>P.W.J</bold>. has received consulting fees from Almirall, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Roche and Spiration; speaking fees from AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline; and grant support from GlaxoSmithKline. <bold>J.A.A</bold>. is employed by and holds stock in GlaxoSmithKline. <bold>P.M.A.C</bold>. has received consulting fees from AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Nycomed and Pfizer; speaking fees from GlaxoSmithKline and Nycomed; and grant support from Boehringer-Ingelheim and GlaxoSmithKline. <bold>B.R.C</bold>. has received consulting fees from Altana, AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim and GlaxoSmithKline; speaking fees from Altana, AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim and GlaxoSmithKline; and grant support from Boehringer-Ingelheim and GlaxoSmithKline. <bold>G.T.F</bold>. has received consulting fees from Astra Zeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Pearl Therapeutics; speaking fees from Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer; and grant support from Boehringer-Ingelheim, Forest, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis. <bold>C.J</bold>. has received consulting fees from Altana, AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis; speaking fees from Altana, AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis; and grant support from GlaxoSmithKline. <bold>J.C.Y</bold>. is employed by and holds stock in GlaxoSmithKline. <bold>J.V</bold>. has received consulting fees from AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Hoffman-LaRoche and Nycomed; speaking fees from AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim and GlaxoSmithKline; and grant support from GlaxoSmithKline. <bold>M.D.S</bold>. was employed by GlaxoSmithKline when the study was conducted and during manuscript preparation, and holds stock in GlaxoSmithKline, Elan Pharma Ltd and Janssen Cilag Ltd.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PWJ, PMAC, JAA, BRC, GTF, CJ, JCY and JV contributed to the initiation, design, and conduct of the study, the interpretation of data, and manuscript development; MDS contributed to the interpretation of data and manuscript development; JAA designed and performed the statistical analyses.
