<bold>Background:</bold> A key part of the practice of evidence-based medicine (essentially, the appropriate use of current best evidence in determining care of individual patients) involves appraising the quality of individual research papers. This process helps an individual to understand what has been done in a clinical research study, and to decipher the strengths, limitations, and importance of the work. Several tools already exist to help clinicians and researchers to assess the quality of particular types of study, including randomised controlled trials. One of these tools is called CLEAR NPT, which consists of a checklist that helps individuals to evaluate reports of nonpharmacological trials (i.e., trials not evaluating drugs but other types of intervention, such as surgery). The researchers who developed CLEAR NPT also produced an Internet-based computer learning system to help researchers use CLEAR NPT correctly. They wanted to evaluate to what extent this learning system helped people use CLEAR NPT and, therefore, carried out a randomised trial comparing the learning system to no specific training. A total of 78 health researchers were recruited as the &#x0201c;participants&#x0201d; in the trial, and 39 were randomised to each trial arm. Once the participants had received either the Internet training or no specific training, they used CLEAR NPT to evaluate reports of nonpharmacological trials. The primary outcome was the rate of &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d; answers that study participants gave using CLEAR NPT.</p><p>
<bold>What the trial shows:</bold> The researchers found that the results on the primary outcome (rate of correct answers given by study participants) did not differ between the study arms. The rate of correct answers for individual items on the checklist also did not seem to differ between individuals receiving Internet training and those receiving no specific training. When looking at the scores for individual items, combined between the two study arms, participants scored highly on their appraisal of some aspects of trial design (such as generation of randomisation sequences and descriptions of blinding and the intervention) but poorly on other items (such as concealment of the randomisation sequence).</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> Key strengths of this study include the randomised design and that the trial recruited enough participants to test the primary hypothesis. The failure to find a significant difference between study arms in this trial was likely not due to a lack of statistical power. One limitation of the study is that the group of researchers who participated were already fairly experienced in assessing trial quality at the start, and this may explain why no additional effect of the computer-based learning system was seen. It is possible that the training system may have some benefit for individuals who are less experienced in evaluating trials. A further possible limitation may be that there was a small imbalance at randomisation, with slightly more experienced researchers being recruited into the arm receiving no specific training. This imbalance might have underestimated the effect of the training system.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> The researchers here report that this study is the first they are aware of that evaluates a computer-based learning system for improving assessment of the quality of reporting of randomised trials. The results here find that this particular tool did not improve assessment. However, the results emphasise that training should be considered an important part of the development of any critical appraisal tools.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Fourcade L, Boutron I, Moher D, Ronceray L, Baron G, et al.

In fact, evidence suggests that inadequate reporting is associated with biased treatment effect estimates [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The QUOROM (Quality of Reporting of Meta-analysis) Statement [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] recommends reporting the criteria and the process used for quality assessment of trials included in a systematic review or meta-analysis. Similar recommendations can also be found in section 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moja et al. recently reported that the methodological quality of primary studies was assessed in 854 of 965 systematic reviews (88.5%) [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Quality assessment is often achieved by the use of checklists or scales, such as the Veerhagen list or the Jadad scale [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the field of nonpharmacological treatment (NPT), a checklist&#x02014;the checklist to evaluate a report of a nonpharmacological trial (CLEAR NPT)&#x02014;was developed to assess the quality of RCTs included in meta-analysis [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This assessment tool was developed using the Delphi Consensus method, with consensus of 55 international experts (clinicians, methodologists, and members of the Cochrane collaboration). It includes ten items and five subitems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pctr-0020022-sd004">Text S1</xref>) and is published with a user's guide explaining each item in detail (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pctr-0020022-sd005">Text S2</xref>).</p><p>Reproducibility issues have been raised regardless of the chosen quality tool [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], because inconsistently defined items such as blinding [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], dropout and withdrawals [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], or an intention-to-treat analysis [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] are used and are poorly understood by reviewers. To overcome these issues, some authors have developed specific guidelines for some quality tools, which provide detailed explanation on scoring each item [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further, a training session is recommended for all reviewers [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite these recommendations, Clark et al. showed that in a study of reviewers with face-to-face training sessions before scoring reports of RCTs, the interrater agreement for the Jadad scale&#x02014; one of the simplest quality tools&#x02014;was poor (kappa 0.37 to 0.39) [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, other pedagogical tools to improve the understanding and the reproducibility of these scales and checklists are needed.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Objectives</title><p>To improve the understanding of the CLEAR NPT, we developed an Internet-based computer learning system (ICLS). This pedagogical tool offers, through the use of practical examples from RCTs, a problem-based approach to solving the main coding difficulties encountered when using the CLEAR NPT. We chose a Web-based tool as it is more feasible than face-to-face meetings and can be tailored to individuals' answers. To evaluate the impact of the ICLS on proper coding with the CLEAR NPT, we carried out an RCT comparing ICLS to no specific training.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Development of ICLS</title><p>The ICLS was developed in three steps: construction, design, and validation.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Construction of the ICLS database.</title><p>To develop the ICLS, we identified difficulties encountered when using the CLEAR NPT (e.g., lack of comprehension of the items and lack of consistency in the definition of an item) and selected passages from RCTs that could be include in the ICLS.</p><p>For this purpose, we selected a panel of reports of RCTs assessing NPT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pctr-0020022-sd006">Text S3</xref>).</p><p>Two reviewers, one involved in the elaboration of the CLEAR NPT (IB) and one using the CLEAR NPT for the first time (LF), independently assessed these reports using the CLEAR NPT items. A meeting followed in which the ratings were compared. This session allowed for the identification of disagreement and difficulties in understanding CLEAR NPT items. According to the difficulties in understanding CLEAR NPT items for this panel, the two reviewers selected specific passages that were either adequately reported, inadequately reported, or a frequent cause for disagreement.</p><p>Although reviewers can be non-native English speakers, the computer learning system was written in English. In fact, most papers included in systematic reviews and meta-analyses are published in English. Consequently, it seemed logical to use the same language in the learning system.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Designing the ICLS program.</title><p>We designed a computer program following the model of a knowledge-based expert system [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The main principles of this program are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pctr-0020022-sg001">Figure S1</xref>. After proposing a short passage from a clinical trial previously selected for the database, the first item is put forward for participants with its modalities of answers (e.g., yes/no/unclear). Depending on their answers, users are led on different pathways drawn from the CLEAR NPT user's guide: (1) If the answer is correct, users are directed to a Web page confirming the correct answer for this item, which also provides a detailed explanation and computerized version of the user's guide; (2) If the answer is incorrect, participants are asked a list of subquestions to help them determine where they made a mistake. The system is therefore self-correcting and enhances understanding of incorrect participant answers. Each participant has a minimum of two passages to refer to for each item and one last passage if they answered incorrectly for their second passage.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Validation of the ICLS.</title><p>The computer learning system was validated by one of the authors (PR) who confirmed the validity of the answers and pathways of the ICLS. The ICLS was also tested by a group of three people who had never used CLEAR NPT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The RCT: Influence of the ICLS on Coding with the CLEAR NPT</title><p>We designed an RCT comparing two groups of participants receiving either the user's guide and specific training with the ICLS (intervention group) or a user's guide with no specific training (control group) to assess the impact of the ICLS. In France, the submission of a trial to an ethics committee is defined according to the public health law of August 2004, which requires the submission of protocols for review by an ethics committee only if the trial involves patients, and if the treatment is not administered in clinical practice but involves a specific treatment or specific investigation. Trials aimed at educating medical doctors or reviewers are not required to submit the protocol to an ethics committee. Participants in our study were previously informed of the trial, they could withdraw from the trial if they wished, and they were informed of the results of the trial upon completion.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Participants.</title><p>Members from three different categories of participants were invited by e-mail to participate in the RCT: (1) Members of Health Technology Assessment international (HTAi) (<italic>n</italic> = 430) were selected for their knowledge of quality assessment.

Moher et al. reported an annotated bibliography of scales and checklists developed to assess quality [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Only a few quality tools have clear users' guides to standardize the understanding of the items, and none are provided with a specific training program. This computer learning system is Internet-based so it offers greater flexibility in training time and sequencing. We assessed the impact of the ICLS in assessing reports of RCTs of NPTs. Although participants were satisfied with the quality of the computer program (interface, readability of the text, and information delivered), training with the ICLS did not have a significant and relevant impact in terms of rate of correct answers compared with a criterion standard. These results highlight the difficulties in training and are consistent with systematic reviews showing that for peer review, referees' training did not improve the quality of the review [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, in this trial we cannot determine whether the problem was related to the quality instrument or to the teaching tool.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>Some factors can be offered to explain the lack of efficacy of the ICLS. First, most of the participants had been involved in the publication of at least one meta-analysis. Consequently, this population has some level of expertise in quality assessment and probably needs more specific training than na&#x000ef;ve participants. Consequently, we should probably assess the impact of the ICLS on inexperienced participants to determine its effect on the performance of this population.</p><p>Second, the ICLS trained participants similarly for each item of the checklist. However, our results highlighted that lack of reproducibility concerned only some items of the checklist. Items related to the allocation sequence generation, description of interventions, blinding of patients or healthcare providers, and follow-up schedule were well rated, with more than 80% correct answers. These items probably need little or no training for proper scoring. Consequently, the ICLS could be tailored and provide more training on various examples for items with low understanding.</p><p>Third, some examples of RCTs used to question and train a reviewer when using the CLEAR NPT might not be adequate. In fact, some examples with a high rate of correct answers were probably less informative, whereas other examples with a low rate of correct answers were probably more valuable for educating reviewers.</p><p>Finally, because participants were not blinded to the aim of the study, we cannot exclude the risk of bias with participants in the control group relying on the user's guide with more attention than they would do in usual practice.</p><p>Although the ICLS had no significant impact on RCT reviewers' performance, most assessment tools do not have any instructions in how to use the quality assessment scale [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], whereas the training can be viewed as proactive and is recommended as an important component in the presentation of any new instrument development. Our results highlighted the lack of consistent understanding of some items. These results could be linked to: (1) the wording of the items of the checklist that could be slightly modified; (2) a lack of consensus on the definition of some items; and (3) an inadequate reporting of the trial that could have been confusing for reviewers. Lack of adequate understanding concerned items specific to the CLEAR NPT such as co-interventions, specific methods to avoid ascertainment bias, and participant adherence but also items assessed in most quality tools such as allocation concealment, intention-to-treat analysis, and blinding of outcome assessors, which are key weapons in the fight against bias. For example, a debate arose when considering the results of the Balk et al. series, because the authors considered that an opaque sealed envelope was an adequate method of allocation concealment [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These results need to be highlighted, considering the high degree of expertise our participants have in the field of peer review and point out the need for education on these topics among the scientific community.</p><p>The reproducibility of the items specific to the CLEAR NPT could probably be improved upon with a modification of the wording of these items. The item &#x0201c;Was participants adherence assessed quantitatively?&#x0201d; could be clarified with the following wording &#x0201c;Was participants adherence reported quantitatively in the results section?&#x0201d;. Furthermore, the item on co-interventions, which requires that the description of the co-intervention be provided in the results section not only in the methods section, could be modified as follows: &#x0201c;Were all other treatments or care as described in the results section the same in each randomised group?&#x0201d;</p><p>Our results show that the item &#x0201c;Was the treatment allocation concealed?&#x0201d; had fewer than 50% of correct answers. These results are probably linked to the lack of consistency of the definition of allocation concealment. Pildal et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] recognized that, depending on the reviewer, strict or loose criteria could be used to define allocation concealment. According to the definition used, sealed envelopes not reported as opaque would be considered as an adequate or inadequate method of concealment. In our study, we defined allocation concealment according to strict criteria, as Schulz et al. related regarding deciphering the allocation sequence by taking the nonopaque sealed envelopes to a &#x0201c;hot light&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Some reviewers require an even more strict definition of allocation concealment with the need to report who prepared the envelopes. In fact, if the same person prepared the envelopes and recruited the patients, the allocation would not be adequately concealed.</p><p>Blinding of the outcome assessors was also poorly rated. These results concerned mainly trials in which the main outcome was a patient-reported outcome but patients were not reported as blinded. Therefore, the outcome assessor (i.e., the patient) could not be considered as adequately blinded even if the authors mentioned the presence of a blinded data collector who questioned the patients.</p><p>Only 60% of participants were in agreement with the criterion standard for the item related to intention-to-treat analysis. These results are probably linked to the poor reporting of this issue [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Baron et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] showed that, in a panel of 81 reports, 66.7% described an intention-to-treat analysis, but full intention to treat was performed in only 7.4% of the studies.</p><p>These results are consistent with other studies. Maher et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] evaluated the reliability of the ten-item Physiotherapy Evidence-Based Database (PEDro) scales and found kappa scores ranging from 0.12 to 0.73 (0.36 to 0.80 for individual assessors) for items, with low concordance on intention-to-treat analysis and therapist blinding. Clark et al.[<xref rid="pctr-0020022-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed a poor interrater agreement (kappa score range 0.37&#x02013;0.39) for the Jadad scale.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations</title><p>The validity of the criterion standard used to assess raters' performance when using the CLEAR NPT could be a limitation. However, this standard was developed by three reviewers, two of whom were involved in the elaboration of the CLEAR NPT. They evaluated all 39 reports independently and according to the user's guide. They discussed all the discrepancies to come to a consensus.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Generalisability</title><p>Another limitation is related to the rate of participation: 84% of reviewers approached did not participate. The time necessary to participate in this trial could likely explain these results. This may limit the generalisability of the results.</p><p>Finally, the baseline distribution of reviewers was imbalanced, with more experienced meta-analysts randomised to the control group. The effect of this potential baseline imbalance could dilute the intervention effect.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study, we attempted to improve the understanding of a quality checklist that evaluates reports of nonpharmacological trials, the CLEAR NPT, with an ICLS. Although this pedagogical tool did not improve participants' performance in using the checklist, our results highlight the lack of consistent understanding of some of the key weapons in the fight against bias. There is an urgent need for specific training to improve the understanding of such quality tools.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020022-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(48 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020022.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020022-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><caption><title>Original protocol</title><p>(84 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020022.sd002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020022-sd003"><label>Trial Protocol</label><caption><title>Amended protocol</title><p>(28 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020022.sd003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020022-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Main Principles of the ICLS</title><p>(43 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020022.sg001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020022-sd004"><label>Text S1</label><caption><title>CLEAR NPT</title><p>(43 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020022.sd004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020022-sd005"><label>Text S2</label><caption><title>User's Guide for the Checklist of Items Assessing the Quality of Randomised Controlled Trials of NPT</title><p>(82 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020022.sd005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020022-sd006"><label>Text S3</label><caption><title>Panel of Reports Used to Develop the Computer Learning System.</title><p>(50 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020022.sd006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020022-sd007"><label>Text S4</label><caption><title>Panel of Reports Used for the Final Assessment of Participants</title><p>(51 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020022.sd007.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020022-sd008"><label>Text S5</label><caption><title>Description of the ICLS and Panel of Articles Used for Final Assessment</title><p>(102 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020022.sd008.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are very grateful to the following experts for their participation in this survey: P.
