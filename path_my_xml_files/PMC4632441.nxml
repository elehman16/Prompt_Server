Introduction</title><p>There is growing evidence illustrating that increased dietary protein increases weight loss and prevents weight gain, potentially by promoting satiety [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among all the different sources of protein, whey protein has been suggested to be superior to other proteins in promoting satiety [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The mechanism has been proposed to be due to its fast digestion behavior, unique amino acid profile, and stimulation of satiety hormones in the gastrointestinal system [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, there are several factors that may alter the beneficial effects of whey protein, including timing of protein consumption, protein quantity and physical form.</p><p>Food in liquid form is generally considered to elicit weaker appetite response compared to food in solid form [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There is accumulating evidence suggested that liquid carbohydrates commonly produce less satiety than solid ones [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. With respect to whether food form plays a role when consuming protein-rich foods, several studies illustrate reductions in appetite and increases in daily food intake with the consumption of high protein beverages compared to high protein meals [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, it is important to note that protein in a liquid system can vary in structure and physical properties depending on their target functional properties. Likewise, protein gels can be formed with different structure and physicochemical properties depending on protein concentration, pH, and heating conditions [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Differences in the physical form and physicochemical properties of proteins could likely lead to differences in their gastric behavior and thus affect satiety property. Studies using <italic>in vitro</italic> gastric simulation showed that whey protein liquid and/or gel with different structural characteristics changed digestion behavior [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Whey proteins subjected to different thermal treatments result in protein aggregates with different aggregate size, viscosity, surface hydrophobicity, and solubility, which further determine its susceptibility to hydrolysis [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Whey protein liquid heated at neutral pH is found to be more susceptible to proteolysis than that formed at acidic pH [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Whey protein gels formed close to the isoelectric point are more resistant to simulated gastric digestion than gels formed at neutral pH [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Although evidence demonstrates that whey protein in different mediums and with different structures exhibits different <italic>in vitro</italic> gastric behavior, to the best of our knowledge, no study has used clinical trials to test whether such differences exist <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to assess whether the consumption of mid-morning whey protein snacks in different physical forms (beverage <italic>vs.</italic> gel) and with different structure, could influence appetite and subsequent food intake.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-07-05421"><title>2.

Thus, a sample size of <italic>n</italic> = 12 was incorporated. Twelve participants, aged 18&#x02013;30 years, were recruited at the University of Missouri Columbia campus using advertisements and flyers. Eligibility included the following: (1) normal to overweight (BMI: 18&#x02013;28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); no metabolic, psychological, or neurological diseases/conditions; (2) not having been clinically diagnosed with an eating disorder; (3) not currently/previously on a weight loss or other special diet (in the past six months); (4) not a smoker (in the past year); (5) habitually eat breakfast between 6:00&#x02013;9:00 AM and lunch between 11:00 AM&#x02013;2:00 PM; (6) no food allergies or intolerances to dairy products; (7) not pregnant; (8) not taking any medications, or have had no changes in medication within the past six months, that could influence the study outcomes. To minimize variability, all participants were asked to have a standardized breakfast at the same time of day and to refrain from drinking alcohol and undertaking prolonged vigorous physical activity the day before the test visit. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Missouri, and all participants were provided with informed consent. The participants received $150 for completing all study procedures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot2-nutrients-07-05421"><title>2.1.2.

Each participant was asked to complete 5, 3-h testing days. On each testing day, the participants consumed a standardized breakfast at home, and then 2.5 h after breakfast, they were asked to report to our facility to complete the testing day. Standardized breakfast included Smart Ones Morning Express Breakfast Quesadilla (230 kcal, 12 g protein, 29 g carbohydrates and 7 g fat per one quesadilla) and Dole Pinneapple Tidmits in 100% juice (60 kcal, 1 g protein, 15 g carbohydrates, and 0 g fat per one cup).</p><p>Each participant was asked to consume one of the following mid-morning snacks: 0 kcal water (CON) or ~100 kcal whey protein snacks (24 g protein) as beverages with a pH of either 3.0 (Bev-3.0) or 7.0 (Bev-7.0) or gels as acid (Gel-Acid) or heated (Gel-Heated). Perceived appetite questionnaires were completed before and every 20 min after the snack was consumed. At 2 h after the mid-morning snack, the participants were provided with an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch. Participants were given Lean Pockets Chicken Parmesan (270 kcal, 10 g protein, 40 g carbohydrates and 7 g fat per one pocket). The pockets were cut into 4 sections, and the participants were provided with 4 sections on one plate with additional pocket pieces provided as needed. The participants consumed as much or as little of the lunch as they desired until feeling &#x0201c;comfortably full&#x0201d; over a 20 min period.

Discussion</title><p>We demonstrated that the consumption of a 96 kcal mid-morning whey protein snacks containing 24 g of whey protein improved appetite throughout the morning compared to a 0 kcal water drink and led to reductions in energy intake at the subsequent lunch meal. However, when comparing these effects between the whey protein treatments, food form and structure had little to no impact in healthy adults. These results suggest that whey protein, either as a beverage or a gel snack, has beneficial effects on appetite control and energy intake and may be used as equivalents for weight management.</p><p>Although <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion models may not truly represent <italic>in vivo</italic> digestion, they offer a rapid approach to determine the structural changes of protein that occur under simulated GI conditions [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this study, <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion of whey protein snacks was performed using the reciprocating cylinder dissolution apparatus which is commonly used to simulate digestion in drug release studies. Electrophoresis was used to monitor the degradation of protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-07-05421-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The &#x003b2;-lactoglobulin monomers of Bev-3.0 were very resistant to gastric digestion, probably due to the limited unfolding and aggregation during heating, hence, only a small amount of peptides were detected in the early stage of digestion. Bev-7.0 showed much faster degradation rate than Bev-3.0 with &#x003b2;-lactoglobulin monomers being digested within 10 min, and much denser peptide bands were detected. Gel-Heated and Gel-Acid had very similar digestion pattern with all monomers being completely digested at 120 min, though heated gel appeared to be digested slightly faster than acid gel. As mentioned above, Gel-Acid at pH 3 was prepared by the addition of GDL to heated protein solution at pH 7. The slowly-released acid from GDL induced gel formation. Thus, the building blocks of the Gel-Acid were heated protein aggregates similar to Bev-7.0. Since the Bev-3.0 was heated at acidic pH, its protein components remained mostly in their monomeric forms unlike the other three samples. The information obtained from the <italic>in vitro</italic> simulation suggests that the susceptibility of protein in GI tract were largely influenced by the protein in different form.</p><fig id="nutrients-07-05421-f006" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (lane 1, maker; lane 2, whey protein isolate (WPI); lane 3, pepsin; lane 4&#x02013;10, samples being digested for 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min) of <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion of whey protein samples: (<bold>a</bold>) protein liquid at pH 3.0; (<bold>b</bold>) protein liquid at pH 7.0; (<bold>c</bold>) heated protein gel at pH 7.0; (<bold>d</bold>) acid protein gel at pH 5.0.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nutrients-07-05421-g006"/></fig><p>Although <italic>in vitro</italic> simulation showed distinct difference in digestion pattern between Bev-3.0 and Bev-7.0, no significant difference was detected on appetite and satiety response. However, it appears that Bev-3.0 evolved slightly higher response of hunger than Bev-7.0, especially in the first 40 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-07-05421-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). This may be explained by the different digestion patterns of the two beverages in the gastrointestinal tract. It has been reported that mechanisms that may contribute to protein-induced satiety involve increases in concentrations of satiety hormones, concentrations of amino acids, energy expenditure, and the process of gluconeogenesis [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The protein in Bev-3.0 was very resistant to hydrolysis, while the protein in Bev-7.0 was much more susceptible to digestion (as shown by <italic>in vitro</italic> result), hence, the peptides and amino acids could have been generated much faster for protein in Bev-7.0, which might elevate blood amino acid concentration and stimulate satiety hormone release, leading to greater reduction in hunger. However, when protein in Bev-3.0 reaches to the small intestine, it was also quickly degraded into small peptides and amino acids, hence, the hunger response in the later stage was similar between the two snacks.</p><p>The effect of food form on appetite control has recently received much attention due to the difference observed between liquid foods and solid foods. There is strong evidence that liquid foods elicit weaker appetite and satiety responses than solid foods [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, increase in fullness occurs more rapidly and exists for a longer time period following solid food consumption compared to liquid food consumption [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this work, no significant difference of appetite and satiety response was observed between beverage and gel. There are several reasons that may account for this phenomenon. The large differences in the volume and energy density of liquids and solids have been reported as one of the reasons that solids evoked stronger satiety [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Meals with larger volume and lower energy density have faster gastric emptying rate and evoke weaker satiety signals [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the present study, whey protein snack was served in nutritionally identical forms as either beverage or gel. Gel-acid was simply formed by adding GDL to Bev-7.0, so the total volume served was the same as that of the beverages. The serving size of Gel-Heated (formed at 15% protein) was 200 g but additional 100 g of water was also served to control the volume. It is possible that the lack of significant difference among Bev-7.0, Gel-Acid, and Gel-Heated was due to their similarity in digestion pattern and similar volume consumed. The other reason could be due to the softer texture of the gel compared to solid foods in other studies. It has been reported that whether consumed with a meal or alone as a snack, semi-solid food elicited weaker appetitive response than solid food [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The Gel-heated prepared in this study was weaker compared to normal solid foods and its texture was similar to gummy bear though not as elastic. The Gel-Acid was much weaker, thus the two gels did not require a lot of chewing. The mastication process of solid foods has been reported to contribute to satiety [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Whey protein preloads showed much lowered energy intake during lunch compared to water preloads; however, no significant difference was observed between protein snacks. Numerous reports have demonstrated that consumption of whey protein reduces <italic>ad libitum</italic> food intake at the test meal. Pal <italic>et al.</italic> (2010) [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] reported that energy intake following water preload was higher than following whey protein preloads. Akhavan <italic>et al.</italic> (2010) [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] reported that the dose of whey protein required to suppress food intake when consumed 30 min before the meal ranged from 20 to 40 g with a sample size of 16, while only 10 g protein was needed with a sample size of 40. In the present study, 24 g of whey protein was sufficient to suppress food intake 2 h after preloads, despite the form of whey protein. There are few conclusive studies investigating the effect of physical form of protein preload on subsequent food intake. It was reported that solid-meal replacement product had lower hunger, desire to eat, insulin, and ghrelin responses compared to the liquid version, but the effect on energy intake was unclear [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Although other studies reported no difference in energy intakes between a beverage and a solid food, accumulating evidence suggested that liquid carbohydrates generally reduce food intake more than solid forms [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Future studies examining the effect of physical form of different protein on satiety and subsequent food intake are needed.</p><p>One of the limitations of the current study is that we did not monitor the change of postprandial glycemic response and appetite-related hormones after whey protein preload, which may have provided greater insight into the effect of physical form of protein on appetite suppression. It has been reported that consumption of whey protein lowered blood glucose response and fasten postprandial gut hormones release, which contribute to the satiety and food intake regulation [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B36-nutrients-07-05421" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Another limitation of this study is that whey protein gels used as protein solid form are not actual foods that subjects consume in their daily life. This protocol was designed to minimize the effect of other food components on satiety, by matching protein snack for energy, weight, and volume. If using actual protein gel food, such as yogurt or mousse, other food components such as carbohydrate will be incorporated, hence, we cannot rule out that the outcome is only due to the effect of protein. In addition, the gels and beverages were not of the same flavor. Although sensory attributes did not act as covariates on all the study outcomes, it is unclear whether the unconventional protein gel samples would influence the rating of satiety and energy intake. Furthermore, compared to common solid foods, semi-solid protein gel is weaker and easier to be degraded, which might be one of the reasons that no difference was observed between beverage and gel snacks.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-07-05421"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, no significant difference of appetite, satiety response, and energy intake was observed between beverage and gel protein snacks. Food form or physico-chemical properties elicit little to no effect on these outcomes. However, compared to water, the consumption of a 24 g whey protein, mid-morning snack, as a beverage or a gel, improves appetite control and reduces subsequent energy intake in healthy adults. Further work is required to understand the effects of physical form and protein structure on satiety and energy intake after consumption of whey protein. Furthermore, factors in determining appetite and food intake other than the physical state of protein need to be identified.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Davisco Foods International for providing whey protein isolate.
