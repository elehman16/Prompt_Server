We aimed to investigate the metabolic effects, acceptance and tolerance of a follow-on formula containing the low glycaemic and low insulinaemic carbohydrate isomaltulose replacing high glycaemic maltodextrin. Healthy term infants aged 4 to 8 completed months (n = 50) were randomized to receive the intervention follow-on formula (IF, 2.1g isomaltulose (Palatinose&#x02122;)/100mL) or an isocaloric conventional formula (CF) providing 2.1g maltodextrin/100mL for four weeks. Plasma insulinaemia 60min after start of feeding (primary outcome) was not statistically different, while glycaemia adjusted for age and time for drinking/volume of meal 60min after start of feeding was 122(105,140) mg/dL in IF (median, interquartile range) and 111(100,123) in CF (p = 0.01). Urinary c-peptide:creatinine ratio did not differ (IF:81.5(44.7, 96.0) vs. CF:56.8(37.5, 129),p = 0.43). Urinary c-peptide:creatinine ratio was correlated total intake of energy (R = 0.31,p = 0.045), protein (R = 0.42,p = 0.006) and fat (R = 0.40,p = 0.01) but not with carbohydrate intake (R = 0.22,p = 0.16). Both formulae were well accepted without differences in time of crying, flatulence, stool characteristics and the occurrence of adverse events. The expected lower postprandial plasma insulin and blood glucose level due to replacement of high glycaemic maltodextrin by low glycaemic isomaltulose were not observed in the single time-point blood analysis. In infants aged 4 to 8 completed months fed a liquid formula, peak blood glucose might be reached earlier than 60min after start of feeding. Non-invasive urinary c-peptide measurements may be a suitable marker of nutritional intake during the previous four days in infants.</p><p><bold><italic>Trial registration</italic>:</bold> ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01627015">NCT01627015</ext-link></p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was financially supported by BENEO GmbH (Mannheim, Germany), a member of the Suedzucker Group.

Insulin has been related to early weight gain [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and higher insulin levels in formula-fed infants were found to be associated with higher risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in later life compared to breast-fed infants [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Differences in long-term outcomes between breast- and formula-fed infants can be related to e.g. the different protein content [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] but also to the carbohydrate content of human milk and formula and its glycaemic and insulinaemic properties [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A study investigating the glycaemic index (GI) of various commercial infant and follow-on formulae with comparable protein composition in adults showed that the GI was higher in a formula containing high glycaemic maltodextrin in addition to lactose, if compared to a formula containing higher proportions of lactose [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The replacement of conventional higher glycaemic carbohydrates (glycaemic index &#x0003e;70) such as maltodextrins by isomaltulose (Palatinose&#x02122;, glycaemic index = 32, [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) can lead to a follow-on formula with a lower glycaemic and insulinaemic response.</p><p>The disaccharide isomaltulose contains glucose and fructose in a &#x003b1;-1,6 glycosidic linkage is completely digestible in the small intestine [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but due to this glycosidic linkage it is only slowly hydrolyzed by small intestinal disaccharidases. In adults, the resulting postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia following isomaltulose ingestion are lower as compared to usual disaccharides, while a higher blood glucose level is sustained for a longer period of time [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>For these physiological reasons, isomaltulose may be of interest for the use in infant foods to reduce the glycaemic load and plasma insulin response while still providing the full amount of energy. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a follow-on formula with isomaltulose partly replacing conventional higher glycaemic carbohydrates on postprandial insulinaemia and glycaemia in infants at the age of 4 to 8 completed months. These possible effects might have a long-term preventive potential as diet induced enhancement of insulin secretion in infancy associated with increased early weight gain as well as higher long-term risk of obesity and associated disorders.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Randomization and ethical consideration</title><p>Double-blinded randomized allocation of infants to the study formulae was stratified for gender, and a block size of four was applied.

Written informed consent was obtained from all parents prior to study start after the experimental protocol had been explained to them in detail. The study was registered at Clinical Trials.gov prior to study start on 21.06.2012 (NCT01627015, registration name: Safety, Acceptance and Metabolic Effects in Infants Receiving a Novel Low Glycaemic Index Follow-on Formula).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study design</title><p>The randomized, double-blind, controlled study with parallel design was performed with two formula groups (IF, intervention formula, CF, conventional formula). Infants of mothers who chose to formula -feed their infants for reasons not related to this study were recruited from age 4 to 8 completed months and were randomized double-blinded into one of the two formula groups. In European and German legislation and recommendations, the introduction of follow-on formula is recommended when the infant has received complementary feeding (solids). The introduction of complementary feeding is recommended between the beginning of the 5<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> month of life [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Infants fully replaced their usual formula meals by the study formula for 28 days. Dietary intake (4-day food protocol), sleep patterns and tolerance parameters were assessed by questionnaires for four days at study start (first four days when infants were fully fed with study formula) and again for four consecutive days at study end. Food protocols were reviewed by study personal and were discussed with families during the interview. On day 29, spontaneous urine was collected using urine bags for infants (B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany). At the same day, after an at least 3-hour fast, the infants consumed 100 to 120 mL of their assigned formula. At 60 min after start of feeding, a single capillary blood sample was obtained by heel prick.</p><p>A blood sample was not taken at baseline to limit the burden for the participating healthy infants. Given that the amount and the time of the last meal did not differ between the groups, it appears likely that fasting blood values were comparable between both groups.</p><p>Anthropometric measurement was done by experienced study personal with detailed and intensive training in anthropometry and all other procedures both at study start and again on day 29. Weight was determined with a Seca 336 scale (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a measuring rod (Seca 232) for measuring recumbent length. Head circumference was measured with a tape (Seca 212). Skinfolds were measured using a Holtain caliper (Holtain Ltd, Crymych, UK) at the left body axis at four sites (triceps, biceps, subscapular and mid-thigh). All measurements were performed in duplicates and documented with an accuracy of 10 g for weight and 0.1 cm for length and head circumference as well as 0.2 mm for skinfolds. The equipment was regularly checked and calibrated to ensure accuracy of measurements.</p><p>SD scores (z scores) were calculated for the anthropometric results relative to the growth standards of the WHO for breast-fed children [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

The calculated glycaemic index of the study formulae in consideration of specific carbohydrate composition was 48 for IF and 63 for CF [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The glycaemic index of complementary food was categorized into fruit, cereal, cereal plus fruit, potato/rice/noodle with vegetable and meat/fish, vegetable only, potato/rice/noodle with meat/fish, potato/rice/noodle with vegetable, potato/rice/noodle, yogurt, juice, salty snack and sweet snack. The glycemic load of complementary food was calculated by multiplying food category specific glycaemic index [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or calculated glycaemic index according to Dodd et al. 2011 [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the amount of carbohydrate, divided by 100.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Laboratory procedures</title><p>On study day 29, capillary blood samples were obtained by heel prick 60 min after start of feeding of 100 to 120 mL formula.

If interested, they were contacted again after 4 months, shortly before the study age of infants and study procedures were explained; 2.) Parents were informed about the study via letters providing study information and contact data of the principal investigator. If interested, they contacted the study center via phone or e-mail.

Both infant formulae were developed and produced on behalf of BENEO GmbH in accordance with relevant EU directives of 2006 [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The formulae were identical in respect to their composition including energy, protein, carbohydrate and fat content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151614.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The only difference concerns the carbohydrate composition of both formulae, in that maltodextrin (2.1 g/100mL) in the conventional formula was replaced by isomaltulose, while the further carbohydrates contained in the formulae (lactose and starch) were kept unchanged. Isomaltulose has been categorized as &#x0201c;generally recognized as safe&#x0201d; (GRAS) in the USA and has been approved as a food ingredient under the Novel Food regulation in the European Union [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The taste and appearance of isomaltulose are similar to sucrose and the sweetness is about half of that of sucrose [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Maltodextrin is a non-sweet palatable substance [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and a high-glycaemic digestible carbohydrate obtained by the partial hydrolysis of starch.

Group independent spearman rank correlations were used for correlations between c-peptide:creatinine ratio and nutritional intake to identify non-invasive biomarkers for nutrition. Linear regression model was applied to estimate the effect of formula type on the anthropometric outcome and biochemical outcome, including infants age (not z scores), volume and time of test meal (blood results only) and the respective baseline value (anthropometry only). Adjusted parameters are presented as coefficient and 95% confidence interval.</p><p>The primary (insulinaemia at 60 min after start of formula feeding) and secondary (glycaemia at 60 min after start of formula feeding, acceptance, tolerance, anthropometry parameters, urinary C-peptide, glycosylated haemoglobin) outcomes were analyzed for intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. In the intention-to-treat analysis, all randomized subjects that received study formula were considered. In the per-protocol analysis, only data from subjects complying with the predefined conditions were included (formula intake covering more than 75% of energy and carbohydrate intake during whole study period, and who were fasted for more than 3 hours before the test meal).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec009"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 51 infants were recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151614.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

During the intervention period five infants dropped out of the study (10%) because of parental refusal (n = 3: increased amount of flatulence n = 1, increased amount of flatulence plus firmer stool consistency n = 1, firmer stool consistency n = 1) or paediatric recommendation (n = 2: development of a bronchitis n = 1, firmer stool consistency n = 1), which were not statistically different between the groups. Gender ratio, birth order, socioeconomic data, nutritional intake and anthropometry at study entry (except subscapular skinfold thickness) were not significantly different between the randomized formula groups. At birth, small differences were observed for gestational age and anthropometry: IF infants were born at 40.1 weeks of gestation compared to 39.4 weeks for CF infants (p = 0.03). IF infants had mean birth weights and birth lengths of 3547 g and 52.6 cm, respectively, while CF infants had mean birth weights and birth lengths of 3329 g and 51.0 cm, respectively. Differences between the groups were statistically significant (p = 0.01) for birth length.

In contrast, the measurement of postprandial glycaemia at a single time point 60 min after the start of feeding resulted in significantly higher levels in IF than in CF infants. The insulin response is directly related to glucose response [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Other studies [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported reduced postprandial glucose and insulin levels after isomaltulose compared to sucrose administration in human adults and in animals [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. None of these studies was performed in infants or used maltodextrin as control. Our blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were assessed at a single time point only. In published literature, isomaltulose as low glycaemic carbohydrate resulted in a lower blood glucose response, when determined as area under the curve [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Isomaltulose has a lower glycaemic index than maltodextrin. This is on the one hand due to the slower digestion of isomaltulose and on the other hand, due to the monosaccharide composition: isomaltulose (glucose and fructose) <italic>vs</italic>. maltodextrin (glucose only), whereas fructose has a lower glycaemic index than glucose [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The slower release and absorption of the derived monosaccharides lead to lower postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia than after oral sucrose administration, and the blood glucose level is sustained for a longer period of time [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus from about 90 min onwards, slightly enhanced glucose levels were observed in isomaltulose groups [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Most of these studies were performed in adults or animals and sucrose was the control carbohydrate.</p><p>Data on the postprandial blood glucose and insulin responses to formula feeding in infants are limited. Lucas et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] report postprandial insulin values in breast-fed and formula-fed infants peaking at 55 and 90 min, respectively. Similarly, Salmenp&#x000e4;ra et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported in infants aged 9 months glucose and insulin levels that peaked between 55 and 90 min after the beginning of an ad libitum feeding. Practical and ethical issues exist performing feeding tests in infants and collecting frequent capillary blood samples as recently also acknowledged by Wright et al. 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Due to such practical and ethical issues and to minimize the burden and inconvenience to the infants, postprandial blood sampling in our infant trial was limited to a single time point only. Based on the above cited published literature we decided to collect capillary blood samples at 60 min after start of feeding [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus there is the possibility that the chosen time point for postprandial blood glucose measurement at 60 min after start of feeding in our study was in a cross-over period when blood glucose with the IF formula containing low glycaemic isomaltulose was still increasing and levels with the CF formula containing high glycaemic maltodextrin were already decreasing. Early peaks of glycaemia may not have been detected if blood is taken 55 or 60 min after beginning of feeding [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and thus higher glucose levels resulting from delayed digestion of isomaltulose may have been detected. The availability of more data about postprandial glucose response in infants over a longer time is warranted in order to benefit the general understanding of metabolic processes in this age group.</p><p>The glucose and insulin response depend on the composition of the formula, but also on the absolute amount of carbohydrates consumed. Moreover, also the time needed to consume the respective formula volume could influence the postprandial response. The average amount of formula consumed at the study day 60 min before blood sampling was similar with 114&#x000b1;7.61 mL in the IF group and 114&#x000b1;6.15 mL in the CF group (p = 0.78). The average time needed to consume the respective formula portion was 10.1&#x000b1;7.57 min in the IF group and 7.29&#x000b1;4.17 min in the CF group (p = 0.13). To account for different drink volumes and thus carbohydrate amounts consumed as well as for the time infants needed to consume the formula, we adjusted the postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels for volume of formula test meal as well as time needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>HbA1c, c-peptide and nutritional intake</title><p>HbA1c is used for glycaemic control from childhood onwards and reflects mean plasma glucose during the past 1 to 2 months [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In young infants, HbA1c is critically discussed, due to the influence of fetal hemoglobin that falsely increases HbA1c values [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The content of fetal hemoglobin decreases during the first year of life: at birth 80&#x02013;90% accounts for fetal hemoglobin, at the age of 6 months largest proportion of hemoglobin is hemoglobin A (adult hemoglobin) and at the age of 1 year fetal hemoglobin decreases to less than 1% [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. At our study age of about 6 months, HbA1c values did not differ between the formulae groups (4.90% in both groups) after an intervention period of 1 month. These values were within the reference ranges of 6 months and 8 to 12 months old infants [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] of 4.80 to 6.00%.</p><p>Urinary c-peptide as marker of endogenous insulin secretion in adults [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was associated with infant weight gain in our study, which was comparable to the findings of another trial in infants aged 5 to 9 months [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Good correlations were found for urinary c-peptide levels and nutritional intake of the previous four days. The urinary c-peptide measurements might be a suitable and non-invasive marker of insulin secretion [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and of the nutritional intake that can be used to evaluate a metabolic response by especially younger study participants that is further well tolerated. Total energy intake, as well as fat and protein intake were related with urinary c-peptide:creatinine ratio. The carbohydrate intake was not related to c-peptide:creatinine ratio. While higher carbohydrate intake has increased insulin secretion, the lower glycaemic carbohydrate isomaltulose could have lowered the insulin secretion [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and thus both factors might have acted contrary. Strongest correlation was found for protein intake and urinary c-peptide in our study. Similar results were found in a multicenter study in which 577 infants received either a high or a lower protein formula, and serum c-peptide levels were found positively related with protein intake [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. C-peptide as metabolic part of the insulin-IGF-axis has a role for early programming. High insulin-IGF blood concentrations in early infancy, as a result of infant formula composition e.g. higher protein content [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], increase BMI by 0.51 (0.13,0.90; p = 0.009) at school age and increase the risk for obesity [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>In infants aged 4 to 8 completed months, the total energy intake was 634 to 676 kcal per day and complementary feeding covered about 15.6 to 18.2% of total energy intake, which are typical of infants in this age group in Germany [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. No compensatory increase of glycaemic load via complementary feeding was observed in IF group, which ranged between 8.71 and 12.8 and did not differ significantly between the groups. The total numbers of meals per day was about 6.3, with about 4.9 formula meals per day. Although isomaltulose markedly regulate satiety-regulating peptides, when administered alone [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the whole macronutrient composition of a meal might be more important in regulation of satiety response [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Acceptance and tolerance</title><p>This study demonstrated that the acceptance and tolerance of a follow-on formula with isomaltulose was similar to that of conventional follow-on formulae.

The gastrointestinal burden is high due to the ongoing development of the gut being exposed to a variety of different foods for the first time [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Isomaltulose was a well-digestible carbohydrate also for this age group without negatively influencing normal laxation. From literature it is known, that disaccharidase activities in infants aged about 180 days (11.2 units- micromoles of substrate hydrolyzed per minute at 37&#x000b0;C per gram of protein) is similar to that in older children (12.7 units) [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strength of the study was, that stool parameters, flatulence, regurgitation and vomiting, were assessed high frequently (four days in the beginning and four days at the end of the study) which was useful for evaluation of acceptance and tolerance in infants. Further, except for the carbohydrate source that was partly replaced by isomaltulose, all other ingredients and contents remained identical in both formulae. However, we cannot exclude, that the modified carbohydrate composition might have an influence on metabolic processes as fat oxidation, which might influence fat mass deposition [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>A limitation of this study in infants was the blood sampling at a single time point only. Number of blood samplings for each individual was limited to a minimum for ethical reasons. Such ethical and practical constraints of feeding test foods to infants and collecting frequent capillary blood samples have also recently been acknowledged by Wright et al. 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Defining the exact time point for capillary withdrawal at 60 min after start of feeding was based on literature data [<xref rid="pone.0151614.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and might limit the conclusions that can be drawn from this study. Less data were available about postprandial glucose and insulin curves in infants. Only a small amount of markers to evaluate metabolic processes in infants are available. The general markers, require special conditions as a fasting state, are less applicable in this age group. Thus e.g. HOMA index (Homeostasis Model Assessment) to evaluate insulin sensitivity could not be used or connections e.g. between blood insulin and urinary c-peptide were not found in our study. The development of new age-appropriate investigation procedures and the application of new markers to gain further knowledge about infant metabolism and possible later outcomes have to be examined.</p><p>In conclusion, metabolic differences such as the expected reduced postprandial blood glucose and plasma insulin response were not observed. This may be due to the limitations of the trial conditions in this age group (in particular blood collection at a single time point only), rather than the absence of difference in view of the established differences in insulin and glucose response between maltodextrin and isomaltulose. Non-invasive urinary c-peptide measurements might be a suitable marker of nutritional intake during the previous four days in infants aged 4 to 8 completed months. Both follow-on formulae were tolerated well in infants aged 4 to 8 completed months. Follow-on formulae containing isomaltulose was well accepted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151614.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Nutritional composition of study follow-on formulae.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151614.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151614.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Number of infants with respective stool consistency, stool frequency (number of stools per day) and amount of flatulence (hours per day) during a four day period at study start and end.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151614.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151614.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Daily nutritional intake of infants aged 4 to 8 completed months (intention-to-treat population).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151614.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151614.s004"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151614.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151614.s005"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Amendments to the study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151614.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151614.s006"><label>S3 Text</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151614.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>It gives us a great pleasure in acknowledging the support and help of Gudrun Haile and Jeannette Beyer during the recruitment and study performance.
