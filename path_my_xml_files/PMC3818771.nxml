articular angle of the knee joint and on the functioning of patients with hemiplegia
resulting from stroke. [Subjects] The subjects of this study were 30 patients who were
diagnosed with hemiplegia due to stroke. The subjects were randomly assigned to either an
experimental group which received proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation combination
patterns and kinesio taping were applied, or a control group which received
neurodevelopmental treatment. [Methods] Joint angle was measured at the hip and the ankle
for both the paretic and non-paretic sides using a goniometer. Dynamic balance ability was
assessed using the Berg Balance Scale. Gait velocity was measured as the 10-m walking time
using a stopwatch. [Results] Comparative analysis of the experimental group's pre-test and
post-test results showed statistically significant differences in the BBS and 10-m walking
test. There were significant differences between the groups in ankle dorsiflexion, BBS,
and 10-m walking times. [Conclusion] We judge the application of taping on the knee joint
prior to rehabilitation treatment for patients in accordance with nervous system damage
positively influences their functional improvement.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Hemiplegia</kwd><kwd>Kinesio taping</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A stroke blocks the blood supply to brain tissue due to blood flow disturbances in the
vessels and triggers brain damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. About
40% of stroke patients undergo some functional damage, with 15% to 30% having severe
disability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Even though many stroke
patients survive through appropriate emergency care and early treatment after a stroke, they
frequently suffer from motor, sensory, or cognitive disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Clinical aspects of patients who are hemiplegic as a result of stroke vary according to the
damaged region of brain tissue, its size, and the cause of damage; and right and left
asymmetry is common among them<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Impaired
balance resulting from such asymmetry of the body is a very frequent symptom and disrupts
the activities of daily living, delays recovery of mobility, and increases the risk of
falls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, hemiplegic patients
place a load of less than 50% of their whole weight on the lower extremity on the paretic
side when standing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such abnormal weight
support interrupts normal motor patterns the standing position and restricts functional
movements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The incomplete gait of hemiplegic patients has been studied since the development of gait
analysis methods. In particular, one appropriate method for precise analysis of gait
performance, disease characteristics, and patients' compensation is the proprioceptive
neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
PNF is known to stimulate proprioceptive receptors within muscles and tendons, thereby
improving function and increasing muscle strength, flexibility, and balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is also effective for achieving the
maximal response of motor units as it increases coordination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Kinesio taping (KT) uses elastic adhesive tape with an elasticity rate that is similar to
that of the skin to treat all kinds of musculoskeletal pain and functional abnormalities. KT
may either inhibit or promote muscular tension according to the application method to the
relevant muscles, in order to normalize the action of moving protagonists<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. By ultimately adjusting muscle tension when it is mixed with strong
voluntary movement, balance between the protagonists, synergists, and antagonists is
maintained, and physical balance is recovered<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Baek et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that when 10 hemiplegic stroke patients received KT applied to the muscles on the
paretic side four times a week for two weeks, they showed a significant improvement in motor
function on the paretic side. Kim et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup> also noted that KT application to hemiplegic stroke patients at
home resulted in significant improvements in activities of daily living, joint range of
motion (ROM), and hand motions.</p><p>Accordingly, this study investigated the effects of PNF combination patterns and KT on gait
ability, aiming to provide a more effective treatment method for the clinical treatment of
stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of subjects (Mean &#x000b1; SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group<break/>(n=15)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group<break/>(n=15)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yr)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.4 &#x000b1; 9.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.1 &#x000b1; 8.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">174.6 &#x000b1; 12.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">171.3 &#x000b1; 13.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.9 &#x000b1; 7.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.8 &#x000b1; 8.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (M / F)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affected side (L / R)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*p&#x0003c;0.05</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The subjects of this study were 30 patients of C Hospital in Cheong-ju who were diagnosed
with hemiplegia due to stroke. The subjects were randomly assigned to either an
experimental group which received PNF combination patterns and KT, or a control group
which received neurodevelopmental treatment. The experimental groups received three
30-minute PNF treatments per week for four weeks, a total of 12 times (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The subjects had no visual field defects, no abnormalities in the vestibular organs after
they were diagnosed with stroke, did not wear aids, and were able to understand the
experimental content well enough to give their voluntary consent to participation in the
experiment. The criteria for exclusion were having an artificial joint in a lower
extremity, having had a previous fracture, not adopting the proper position when PNF
combination patterns were applied, or having a unique skin disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Elastic Kinesio tape was attached in the following ways.</p><p>1) Patella inferior gliding taping: The subjects lay on a bed in a supine position, and
5-cm wide Kinesio tape was cut in half with scissors and attached from the lateral surface
of the proximal leg to cover the lateral superior surface of the patella across the medial
surface of the patella to the medial surface of the proximal leg. 2) Patella medial
gliding taping: After patella inferior gliding taping, tape was attached from the medial
surface of the proximal leg to cover the lower part of the patella across the upper part
of the patella to the medial surface of the distal leg. 3) Quadriceps femoris muscle
taping: The subjects sat on a bed, and 5-cm wide Kinesio tape was cut into a Y-shape and
attached from the tibial tubercle, the null point of the quadriceps femoris muscle across
the side of the patella to the anterior inferior iliac spine, the origin of the quadriceps
femoris muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The combination patterns of PFN treatment were described by Dietz<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In these patterns, movement of
flexion-adduction-external rotation of the paretic upper extremities and simultaneous
flexion-adduction-external rotation of the non-paretic lower extremities are performed? In
the present syudy, extension-abduction-internal rotation of the non-paretic upper
extremities and simultaneous extension-abduction-internal rotation of the paretic lower
extremities were also performed? All these integrally performed, movements are called PNF
combination patterns. The subjects performed these patterns independently, but when they
could not do so, the therapist aided the movement of the paretic upper extremities and
encouraged the movement of the non-paretic parts with oral instruction.</p><p>In this study, PNF combination patterns were conducted with subjects in a side-lying
position, half-standing position, and modified plantigrade position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the experiment, subjects' trunk alignment
condition and pattern movement were checked continuously, and oral encouragement was given
to the subjects to keep them in the proper position. This intervention was conducted 10
times for 10 seconds after pattern alignment was completed in each position, and 10
seconds was allowed for an interval break time. About 10 minutes was spent performing the
patterns in each position.</p><p>Joint ROM was measured at the hip and the ankle for both the paretic and non-paretic
sides using a goniometer with the method described by Norkin and White<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dynamic balance ability was assessed
using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) which was developed by Berg et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BBS is clinically used for patients with senile
disease or hemiplegia resulting from stroke to evaluate their balance ability during
movement or in a standing position. It consists of 14 items; each has a score from 0 to 4
with a maximum possible score of 56. When the score is less than 45 points, the patient
needs a tool for aiding gait and has a high risk of falls.</p><p>For the ten-meter walking test, 10&#x02005;m were measured on the floor using a tape measure, and
tape was attached to mark the start and end points. In order to provide sufficient
distance for acceleration and deceleration, four meters was added to the 10 meters marked
with tape on the floor, two meters at one end and two at the other<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects were instructed to &#x0201c;walk as usual at a
comfortable speed.&#x0201d; The 10 -m walking time was measured to the nearest one-hundredth of a
second using a stopwatch for the time period from the moment the subjects' feet passed the
starting line to the moment they crossed the finish line. The subjects practiced once, and
all measurements were made three times with the average of the three being used in the
analysis. For the 10-m walking test, test-retest reliability has been reported as 0.95,
and inter-rater reliability as 0.90, which are very high values<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the statistical analysis of this study, means and standard deviations were calculated
using SPSS for Windows (version 20.0). In order to examine the effects of the intervention
in each group, the paired t-test was conducted, and in order to investigate differences
between the groups, the independent t-test was performed. The significance level was
chosen as 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Pre-test and post-test comparison of the experimental group (Mean &#x000b1;

of the top three causes of adult death together with cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke has a high death rate, and in survivors it often causes
permanent disability, despite recovery, due to functional disorders in the central nervous
system. The clinical aspects differ according to the region and size of the brain tissue
damaged, and the cause of the damage, but in general, asymmetric damage to the left and
right sides of the body and hemiplegia occur<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A stoke patient typically undergoes motor and sensory function disorders according to the
area and degree of brain damage; suffers from linguistic, perceptive, and cognitive damage,
accompanied by emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, agitation, and frustration;
and experiences many disabilities in ordinary life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Damage to the central nervous system, articular and muscular
diseases, and disorders of the visual and vestibular organs affect balance performance and
trigger problems with maintenance of stability in a standing position, weight load
adjustment, gait ability, and functional improvement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Brunnstrom<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup> observed hemiplegic gait
and described it as slow and rigid with disharmonious adjustment motions on the affected
side and compensation actions on the non-paretic side. In other words, a deficit in the
motor adjustment of the central nervous system triggers unharmonious motions of the upper
and lower limbs, and according to the degree of neurological recovery of the central nervous
system, aspects of motor adjustment and hemiplegic gait change. As a result, patients with
hemiplegia resulting from a stroke experience many disabilities in activities of daily
living. Gait is a particularly basic element necesary for leading an independent life. It is
considered meaningful to evaluate gait aspects and analyze related elements of gait in
hemiplegic patients.</p><p>PNF applies resistance to one part of the body, indirectly triggering muscle contraction in
other parts, activating them or promoting their functional activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. PNF uses
unique spiral patterns to stimulate proprioceptors and promote normal responses. It adds
stimuli to proprioceptive sensory organs, such as the muscle spindle or tendon spindle,
which trigger concentric excitation in muscle length or tensile force<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. PNF is very important for orthopedic and neurosurgical
patients and essential for subjects whose central nervous system has been damaged such as
stroke patients and those with motor developmental disorders including cerebral palsy
syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>PNF is very effective at increasing patients' consciousness, perception, muscle strength,
coordination, and endurance by repetitively causing maximal responses, thereby improving
neurological function and lowering the muscle contraction threshold, and enhancing or
increasing motor ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dietz<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that simultaneous application of
different patterns exerted more force, and therefore had a greater influence on muscle
strength and stability. In a study that examined muscle activity in the lower extremities
according to PNF combination patterns, Oh et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. reported that muscle activities of the rectus femoris and the
vastus medialis muscles significantly increased.</p><p>Kinesio taping is effective at correcting asymmetries in of the musculoskeletal system. The
application of Kinesio tape may affect the muscle and myofascia functions. An additional
theory is that KT stimulates cutaneous mechanoreceptors at the taped area, and this
stimulation affects ROM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Theory states
is that Kinesio tape and circulatory or neurological activation is rooted in the tape's
elastic properties, which are purported to support and enhance joint functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, there were significant improvements in the BBS and 10-m walking tests
of the experimental group after treatment (p&#x0003c;0.05). This result is consistent with the
results of a study by Jang Ji-hoon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref><sup>)</sup>, who
reported that after KT was applied to the gluteus medius, gluteus maximus, tibialis
anterior, and transversus abdominis muscles of the paretic side of hemiplegic patients,
there were significant improvements in variables related to balance ability such as BBS
(p&#x0003c;0.01), standing on the leg of the paretic side (p&#x0003c;0.01), standing on the leg of the
non-paretic side (p&#x0003c;0.05), 360&#x000b0; rotation on the paretic side (p&#x0003c;0.05), 360&#x000b0; rotation
of the non-paretic side (p&#x0003c;0.01), and raising the legs alternatively. Their results were
due to PNF effects overlapping with the KT effects on muscle function normalization, lymph
and blood circulation improvement, correction of articular misalignment, and proprioceptive
enhancement.</p><p>In a study of eight hemiplegic stroke patients, Song et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the 10-m walking time was 35.44 &#x000b1; 14.25 seconds prior
to the application of KT and significantly decreased to 29.99 &#x000b1; 11.85 seconds after the
application of KT. In the present study, there were differences in treatment effects between
the two groups in the dorsalflexion of the ankle joints, BBS, and 10-m walking times
(p&#x0003c;0.05). The experimental group saw the angle of the dorsalflexion of the ankle joints
and BBS scores increase significantly, and the 10-m time decrease significantly. We consider
this is because PNF combination patterns and tape application enhanced stability of the knee
joints during walking and promoted muscular activity in the surrounding muscles, positively
affecting functional gait.</p><p>The results of this study may not be generalized to stroke patients as a whole because the
number of subjects was not sufficient; there were great differences in the disease period,
age, and the gender of the subjects; and the residence of the subjects was restricted to a
single area.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kolb</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Gibb</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Brain plasticity and recovery from early cortical
