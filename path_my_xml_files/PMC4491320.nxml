Participants from across three sites (London, Glasgow, and Ayrshire/Arran) were randomized equally to CBT for personality disorders (CBTpd) plus Treatment as Usual or to Treatment as Usual.

Those results used intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, recognized as the appropriate methodology for the principal reporting of randomized controlled trials. The additional analyses presented here go beyond these results and utilize information on quantity and quality of therapy received (recording activities and behaviours that took place after randomization), relating this information to two of our primary outcomes, suicidal acts and inpatient hospitalization, using instrumental variable regression modelling. In addition, we investigate any possible delay in the treatment effect manifesting itself, sometimes a feature of complex interventions such as CBT (Medical Research Council, <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). These additional analyses are important to patients and clinicians as they provide an estimate of the benefit CBTpd would give under ideal conditions. They also inform comparisons of different psychological therapies when resources are scarce and may help identify subgroups of patients who may benefit most from therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>The BOSCOT study design (Davidson, Tyrer <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2006b</xref>), results (Davidson, Norrie <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2006a</xref>), and economic implications (Palmer <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) have been reported elsewhere. In brief, patients in both treatment arms showed gradual and sustained improvement in both primary and secondary outcomes, with evidence to show that addition of CBTpd benefited the positive symptom distress index at 1 year, and state anxiety, dysfunctional beliefs, and the quantity of suicidal acts over the 2-year study period. We subsequently reported on the 6-year follow-up of this randomized cohort (Davidson, Tyrer, Norrie, Palmer, &#x00026; Tyrer, <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) &#x02013; the analyses presented here do not include this longer term follow-up as we do not have correspondingly high quality (in terms of completeness and accuracy) of therapy received in the years 3&#x02013;6 after the completion of the randomized trial follow-up.</p><p>Nearly all 106 participants randomized had primary and secondary outcome data at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. These additional analyses on how quantity and quality of CBT might influence behaviour and inpatient hospitalization are therefore not complicated by missing outcome data. In addition, BOSCOT had no &#x02018;treatment crossovers&#x02019;, as the form of CBT for personality disorders specified in the therapy protocol differs considerably from conventional CBT for Axis I disorders (Davidson, <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), and was not available in the NHS during the study period.</p><sec><title>Therapist competence</title><p>Any psychological therapy will have some variability in terms of quality of delivery. CBT therapists vary in their degree of skill, and some will become better (or worse) as they become more experienced. Quality of therapy in CBT trials comprises at least two dimensions: the therapeutic alliance and the competence with which therapy is delivered.</p><p>Therapeutic alliance is the specific working relationship that develops between a patient and therapist. Competence of the therapist in delivering CBTpd is the focus here. A therapist's competence involves his/her understanding of the patient's problems, the appropriateness of an intervention or use of techniques, and the therapist's aptitude at delivering interventions in a skilled manner.</p><p>We measured therapist competence using the BOSCOT Rating Scale (Davidson, <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS; Young &#x00026; Beck, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). All five BOSCOT therapists submitted CBTpd session audiotapes. A random selection of audiotapes from 24 of the 38 patients (73% of the 54 patients randomized to CBTpd), who gave written consent to their sessions being recorded, were rated by two experienced clinical psychologists (KD and AG), both blind to treatment outcome, and established good inter-rater agreement on therapist competence (see Davidson, Norrie <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2006a</xref>). Data on how often and when CBTpd sessions were offered, declined, and attended, were collected, allowing characterization of therapy delivery in terms of therapist competence and frequency and intensity of therapy sessions.</p><p>Is there a time lag for treatment effect on suicidal behaviour? Any intervention may take time for an effect to manifest itself. After randomization to CBTpd, it might take several weeks for the first appointment to be scheduled, due to the practical constraints of delivering the service. It seems reasonable that a &#x02018;treatment effect&#x02019; would not be seen before treatment has been received. In addition, it may also take several sessions to engage patients and develop a collaborative therapeutic relationship, which will permit the implementation of specific cognitive behavioural techniques. Even after therapy commences, it may take several sessions for any therapeutic effect to accumulate as techniques become practised and implemented. We therefore discounted the earliest suicidal acts as being unlikely to have been influenced by therapy, which either was yet to start, or had only recently begun.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>There are three parts to the analyses. (1) time lag of a treatment effect; (2) the inter-relationships between quality (therapist competence) and quantity (number of sessions attended) of therapy, and outcomes; and (3) instrumental variable regression to investigate the influence of quantity and quality of therapy on outcome, for which Stata 10.0SE was used. All other analyses used SAS 9.2 for Windows. No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons as we judged that the risk of making a Type I error was offset by the importance of these post-randomization analyses to the development of improved understanding of the interactions between characteristics of therapy delivered in the context of clinical trials and the primary outcomes of these trials.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The time lag of treatment effect analyses used standard ITT statistical techniques, with the &#x02018;time zero&#x02019; moved forward incrementally by 30, 60, 90, and 180 days, so deleting all suicidal events that happened before these milestones. For the corresponding analysis on inpatient hospitalizations (IPH), we restricted these to the first 6 months as this was most likely to be accurately reported and case notes were checked.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For analyses of associations between intervention characteristics (sessions offered, attended, cancelled, and &#x02018;did not attend&#x02019;, and delay from randomization to first session, duration of sessions [elapsed time from first to last session attended], and intensity of sessions [sessions attended per 3-month period]), we grouped variates above or below their medians and then performed two sample <italic>t</italic>-tests on the other variates of interest. For linear models of predictors of intensity, we used stepwise regression with <italic>p</italic>-to-enter and <italic>p</italic>-to-stay both .10, and indicator variables to adjust for therapist forced into the model.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For the analyses adjusting outcome for quantity and quality of therapy, we used Complier Averaged Causal Effects models, as described by Dunn and Bentall (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), Dunn <italic>et al</italic>.

We present three estimates: (1) unadjusted; (2) adjusted for four baseline factors strongly associated with outcome, which was the number of suicidal acts &#x02013; these baseline factors were number of suicidal acts in the 12 months before randomization, being single, age at first deliberate self-harm, and EQ-5D score at baseline; and (3) the interaction of treatment with each of these four baseline predictors to check whether the exclusion restriction (see below) was likely to hold in this data set.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Outcome of time lag for treatment effects on suicidal behaviour analyses</title><p>From the main results paper, visual examination suggested that the time to first suicidal act curves are initially coincident and only separated and diverged after about 6 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">figure 1</xref>A, Davidson, Norrie <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2006a</xref>). To investigate whether this could indicate a delayed onset of a treatment effect, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref> is the corresponding Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curve after excluding events before 182 days after randomization. There is no support for a delayed treatment effect. To understand this, we observe that approximately half the participants have no event over 24 months, about a quarter have one event, and the other quarter more than one suicidal act. So, the main effect of excluding the first 6 months of follow-up data is to simply delay the time at which a multiple-suicide-act participant will have a first suicidal act In the original analysis; 26 TAU against 23 CBTpd had at least one suicidal act, log-rank <italic>p</italic> = .29. Omitting any events in the first 30 days gives 26 versus 22, log-rank <italic>p</italic> = .33; omitting the first 60 days gives 24 versus 21, log-rank <italic>p</italic> = .46; omitting the first 90 days gives 23 versus 20, <italic>p</italic> = .44; and omitting the first 6 months gives 17 versus 16, log-rank <italic>p</italic> = .97. For suicidal acts, the ITT analysis gave a 24-month mean of 1.73 (<italic>SD</italic> 3.11) on TAU and 0.87 (1.47) on CBTpd + TAU &#x02013; an adjusted difference of &#x02212;0.91 (95% confidence interval &#x02212;1.67 to &#x02212;0.15, <italic>p</italic> = .020). Omitting the first 180 days, the corresponding estimates are 1.31 (2.73) and 0.42 (0.87), with an adjusted difference of &#x02212;0.86 (95% CI &#x02212;1.51 to &#x02212;0.20, <italic>p</italic> = .010).

Interestingly, then, the event rate is much higher in the first 6 months (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>). Therefore, for IPH, the reverse may be true &#x02013; a treatment effect that manifests early and then disappears, which may be a quite common phenomenon seen across a variety of therapeutic interventions.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Time to first Inpatient hospitalization &#x02013; in the first 180 days.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="papt0086-0280-f2"/></fig><p>A <italic>post-hoc</italic> Cox regression analysis for IPH (adjusting for the pre-specified covariates used in the original ITT analyses) shows a significant benefit in favour of CBTpd + TAU over TAU: 18 (37%) on TAU had at least one IPH compared with 12 (24%) on CBTpd + TAU, adjusted hazard ratio 0.41 (95% CI 0.18&#x02013;0.93, <italic>p</italic> = .032).

We have seen that linking measures of quality and quantity of therapy to outcomes is difficult as these are not baseline measures equalized by randomization and temporally measured before any outcomes of interest. Fortunately, there has been much development in the statistical methodology in the last decade to robustly incorporate such post-randomization data assessing the &#x02018;success&#x02019; in delivering intervention and outcomes. Broadly, the idea is to identify participants who, in some sense, had the best chance of responding, and then the magnitude of their response indicates what treatment benefit may be achieved if we were to optimize the delivery of the intervention to the right recipients. The Complier-Average Causal Effect, or CACE estimate, introduced by Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) and discussed by Bellamy, Lin, and Ten Have (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), Dunn and Bentall (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and Dunn <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), is an attractive methodology for this task, identifying a group of &#x02018;compliant&#x02019; participants before randomization, who are then equally distributed by randomization across the groups. The model then compares the observed behaviour of the compliers in the treatment group with what would have been observed if this group had been randomized to the other group. All of these so-called instrumental variable regression models rest heavily on assumptions that cannot be verified objectively.</p><p>For CACE models, an important assumption is the &#x02018;exclusion restriction&#x02019; &#x02013; the assumption that the randomization itself does not influence the outcome: for example, a participant who wanted to get CBTpd and was randomized to TAU does not suffer &#x02018;resentful demoralisation&#x02019;, which then worsens their outcomes (Torgerson &#x00026; Sibbald, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">1998a</xref>, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">1998b</xref>). We tested whether the exclusion restriction held by including the interaction of treatment with each of the important baseline factors strongly associated with outcome (i.e., baseline number of suicidal acts in the previous 12 months, being single, age at first deliberate self-harm, and the EQ-5D score prior to randomization).</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">4</xref> gives the CACE model results for (1) quality of CBTpd therapy (CTRS score &#x02265;60 vs. &#x0003c;60); and (2) quantity of therapy (sessions attended &#x02265;15 vs. &#x0003c;15). In both cases, the treatment effect approximately doubles, with the ITT of &#x02212;0.91 saved suicidal acts becoming &#x02212;1.93 for the high-quality CBTpd and &#x02212;2.17 for the higher number of sessions. Note that the confidence intervals around the estimates are wider, and note further that it is only after adjusting for baseline suicidal acts (in the previous 12 months before randomization), age at first deliberate self-harm, single marital status, and EQ-5D quality of life scores that these estimates reach statistical significance.</p><table-wrap id="tbl4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Results of Complier-Average Causal Effect modelling</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Model</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CBT-TAU (95% CI)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>p</italic>-Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Full (ITT)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Full (ITT)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.91 (&#x02212;1.67, &#x02212;0.15)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">.020</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">More competent (&#x0003e;60)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unadjusted</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1.52 (&#x02212;3.17, 0.13)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">.070</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adjusted<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf4-1">a</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1.93 (&#x02212;3.19, &#x02212;0.67)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">.003</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fully instrumented<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf4-2">b</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;2.05 (&#x02212;3.31, &#x02212;0.80)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Quantity (&#x0003e;15)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unadjusted</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1.63 (&#x02212;3.49, 0.23)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">.085</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adjusted<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf4-1">a</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;2.17 (&#x02212;3.79, &#x02212;0.56)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">.008</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fully instrumented<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf4-2">b</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1.43 (&#x02212;2.85, &#x02212;0.01)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">.048</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">More competent + quantity (&#x0003c;15)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unadjusted</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;2.85 (&#x02212;6.04, 0.34)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">.079</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adjusted<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf4-1">a</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;3.35 (&#x02212;5.64, &#x02212;1.07)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">.004</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fully instrumented<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf4-2">b</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;3.97 (&#x02212;6.12, &#x02212;1.84)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">More competent + quantity (3&#x02013;20)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unadjusted</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;4.14 (&#x02212;9.09, 0.79)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">.10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adjusted<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf4-1">a</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;4.73 (&#x02212;8.25, &#x02212;1.22)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">.008</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fully instrumented<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf4-2">b</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;5.94 (&#x02212;9.28, &#x02212;2.61)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;.001</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><italic>Note</italic>.

The treatment estimate now changes to &#x02212;3.35 suicidal acts averted every 2 years. We went one stage further and redefined the quantity as being between 3 and 20, so removing those who had so little therapy (including none) that it was difficult to see how benefit could have derived, and adding in some participants with a few more sessions (from 16 to 20). The CBTpd treatment estimate now rose to almost five suicidal acts averted.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Suicidal acts by therapist competence and sessions attended.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="papt0086-0280-f7"/></fig><p>For each model, we also give the &#x02018;fully instrumented&#x02019; version, which includes the interaction of quality and quantity of treatment with the four baseline predictors. In all cases, the model holds, indicating that there is little or no evidence that the exclusion restriction is invalid here. By using these additional instruments, the IV estimate of the quantity and quality of therapy increase a bit and are more precisely estimated.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>These further analyses allow some dismantling of the previously reported ITT analyses (Davidson, Norrie <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2006a</xref>) and suggest a relationship between the quantity and quality of therapy received and suicidal behaviour. Specifically, using CACE models, we find the ITT treatment estimate of approximately one suicidal act averted over 2 years approximately doubles when treated by more competent therapists and when in receipt of over 15 therapy sessions. Intriguingly, there was an indication of a qualitative interaction between quantity and quality, with a treatment effect of approximately three suicidal acts averted (over triple the ITT estimate) for those receiving a limited amount of therapy (&#x0003c;15 sessions) from a competent therapist.</p><p>The investigation of a possible time lag in the treatment effect of CBTpd led to discovering an effect for inpatient hospitalization in the first 6 months only. The finding might indicate that because hospitalization often follows severe, acute self-harm behaviour, CBTpd may have a short-term effect in averting such behaviour, but it may not have a longer term effect, in contrast to the hypothesized longer term delayed treatment effect investigated for CBTpd for suicidal behaviour. This finding should be considered cautiously, however, as number of inpatient hospitalizations were low and this was a purely <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis.</p><p>These findings underscore the importance of examining the effect of therapist competence and amount of therapy that may be required to improve adverse outcomes. Therapists competent in CBTpd can deliver change in patient's suicidal behaviour in 20 or fewer sessions over 1 year, and this effect remained throughout the 2-year period. This is in contrast to the majority of studies of psychological therapy that offer highly intensive and lengthy treatment regimens (e.g., Bateman &#x00026; Fonagy, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Giesen-Bloo <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Our findings suggest that the precise length of therapy offered should be evaluated more rigorously.</p><p>These additional analyses raise interesting and complex methodological issues. Intention-to-treat analysis is preferred over other approaches (such as analysing the data by groups defined by what intervention was actually received) for the primary analysis of efficacy outcomes. However, participants do not receive their randomized intervention in a perfectly uniform and prescribed manner, nor do they return perfect data on all outcomes measured at all times and routinely in trials (White, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Such departures from the ideal result in different (statistical) analytic approaches yielding different &#x02013; and sometimes very different &#x02013; estimates of treatment effects. The more non-compliance with randomized intervention, the more major protocol deviation, the more loss to follow-up, and so on, the larger the potential discrepancy between the various analyses might become. As the magnitude of these factors increases, the quality of the evidence decreases, and there is no panacea for the analysis of poor-quality data &#x02013; all the analyses, including ITT, will be potentially misleading given poor data. Fortunately in BOSCOT, the quality of data was high with minimal loss to follow-up, and in addition, no complication of treatment crossovers. Also, we measured several &#x02018;process variables&#x02019; related to the quality and quantity of therapy, and in this study, having explored the associations between these process variables and both baseline and outcome data, we then used formal CACE modelling to investigate what treatment effect appears to have been enjoyed by those that received the more competently delivered therapy in the appropriate quantity.</p><p>The ITT analysis addresses the issue of what benefit might accrue from the offer of one type of management over another, whereas the instrumental variables analysis tries to assess what the benefit for a subgroup who actually receive, in some sense, &#x02018;optimized therapy&#x02019;. Both analyses are therefore of value &#x02013; the ITT analysis gives unbiased, rigorous scientific evidence of whether the intervention is likely to be of benefit. If the ITT analysis indicates likely benefit, then the instrumental variable regression analysis can estimate this benefit under ideal conditions, which is of interest to clinicians and patients and in addition can be helpful when comparing different psychological therapies when resources are scarce and for identifying subgroups of patients who may benefit most.</p><p>There are, however, some limitations. First, despite the high-quality data, at 106 participants, this trial is quite small, albeit large for a study of borderline personality disorder. Furthermore, our estimates of therapist competence were based on only a subset of all the sessions undertaken, and on a random sample of only 24 of the 54 patients randomized to CBTpd. Not all patients agreed to have their CBT sessions recorded, and not all of the sessions taped were sufficiently audible to rate. In addition, participants were not randomly allocated to therapists, which would have made many of the analyses we have undertaken conceptually easier. Although all therapists were trained in CBTpd for borderline personality disorder and received weekly supervision, the robustness of the trial would have been enhanced if they had been trained and then evaluated as being at or above a threshold of competency before the trial began. In a pragmatic trial, we accepted that therapists would vary in their degree of competence in delivering CBTpd. As well as having competence ratings for all the trial sessions (albeit a prohibitive amount of work), it may have been useful to have additional competence ratings for each therapist presented with the same clients (who were not randomized into the study). Such measures of competence could have then been considered as genuine baseline covariates.</p><p>In conclusion, we have supplemented the reporting of the BOSCOT trial with this article, following the design and baseline characteristics (Davidson, Tyrer <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2006b</xref>), the ITT results (Davidson, Norrie <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2006a</xref>), and the economic evaluation (Palmer <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and the 6-year follow-up analyses (Davidson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). We have shown that if competently delivered therapy is given in the right quantity, patients can derive substantial benefit. Future trials of CBT should explore the effect of quantity and of quality of therapy on outcome.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>&#x02020;</label><p>Suicidal act: A suicidal act meets all three of the following criteria: (1) Deliberate (i.e., not be construed as an accident, planning involved, and the individual accepts ownership of the act); (2) life threatening, in that the individual's life was deemed to be seriously at risk, or he or she thought it to be at risk, as a consequence of the act; and (3) the act resulted in medical intervention or intervention would have been warranted.
