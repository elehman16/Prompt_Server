Social and healthcare perspectives after 2&#x000a0;years are reported. In all, 152 patients were randomized to either TDR (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;80) or lumbar FUS (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;72). Cost to society (total mean cost/patient, Swedish kronor&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;SEK, standard deviation) for TDR was SEK 599,560 (400,272), and for lumbar FUS SEK 685,919 (422,903) (ns). The difference was not significant: SEK 86,359 (&#x02212;45,605 to 214,332). TDR was significantly less costly from a healthcare perspective, SEK 22,996 (1,202 to 43,055). Number of days on sick leave among those who returned to work was 185 (146) in the TDR group, and 252 (189) in the FUS group (ns). Using EQ-5D, the total gain in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over 2&#x000a0;years was 0.41 units for TDR and 0.40 units for FUS (ns). Based on EQ-5D, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of using TDR instead of FUS was difficult to analyze due to the &#x0201c;non-difference&#x0201d; in treatment outcome, which is why cost/QALY was not meaningful to define. Using cost-effectiveness probabilistic analysis, the net benefit (with CI) was found to be SEK 91,359 (&#x02212;73,643 to 249,114) (ns). We used the currency of 2006 where 1 EURO&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9.26 SEK and 1 USD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7.38 SEK. It was not possible to state whether TDR or FUS is more cost-effective after 2&#x000a0;years. Since disc replacement and lumbar fusion are based on different conceptual approaches, it is important to follow these results over time.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Disc prosthesis</kwd><kwd>Lumbar fusion</kwd><kwd>Cost-effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Cost-utility</kwd><kwd>Health economic evaluation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In Sweden, as in many other European countries, total healthcare costs for society are reported to be approximately 8% of gross national product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and the total costs for low back pain and also chronic low back pain have been reported to be substantial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Approximately 80% of costs attributable to back pain are reportedly indirect costs while 10&#x02013;20% can be attributed to direct medical care, and up to 75% of all costs have been ascribed to those still on sick leave after 3&#x000a0;months chronic low back pain (CLBP) due to loss of productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Inpatient treatment for back pain in Sweden has been reported to account for 17% of total healthcare costs to society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Surgery for back pain accounts for a relatively small but rising part of total hospital costs, and thereby also health care costs, for back pain, which may be attributed to expanded indications for surgery and new surgical techniques.</p><p>The gold standard for selected patients today is lumbar fusion (FUS), aimed at reducing pain, decreasing disability (including returning to work), and increasing quality of life. A variety of techniques can be used to perform fusion surgery; so far no specific technique has proven to be superior in a randomly assigned patient population. It has been reported in several reviews, and also in the comprehensive Swedish spine register (&#x0201c;SweSpine&#x0201d;: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.4s.nu">http://www.4s.nu</ext-link>), that average patient satisfaction after fusion surgery is approximately 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is therefore not surprising that new surgical procedures are introduced almost yearly, and that patient selection prior to undertaking any type of lumbar surgery is stressed in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Total disc replacement has gained in popularity in recent years, although the technique has been known since the early 1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. One potential advantage of TDR may be the removal of a possibly painful disc. Also, restoring and preserving mobility in the motion segment(s) could theoretically minimize risk of future discomfort caused by progressive degenerative changes in adjacent motion segments, which in theory may result from unfavorable altered biomechanics due to fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>When new technologies like TDR are introduced to the market, it should be in the interest of all parties to evaluate whether they are cost-effective&#x02014;do they provide more value compared with today&#x02019;s gold standard? Cost differences and clinical differences should be compared, as well as cost-effectiveness/utility, which is often expressed as cost/quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>This health economic RCT with 2-year follow-up was conducted at Study Center, the most productive spine surgery department in Sweden with more than 1,200 elective procedures performed annually for various degenerative spine disorders. The economic perspectives addressed were those of society and the healthcare sector. Clinical results were presented in a recent article in the ESJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>&#x0201d;. Follow-up was 2&#x000a0;years. Neither the study secretary (CB) nor the first author of this paper (PF), were associated with the study department, Stockholm Spine Center.</p><p>The aims of the study were to:</p><p>1. Define and compare costs associated with TDR in the lumbar spine, and instrumented lumbar FUS.</p><p>2. Compare cost-effectiveness/utility using the quality of life instrument EQ-5D.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Patients had suffered at least 12&#x000a0;months from what was understood to be discogenic low back pain in one or two motion segments between L3 and S1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

When TDR was performed, a vascular surgeon prepared the anterior retroperitoneal approach, and the spine surgeon removed the disc, mobilized the segment, and inserted the disc prosthesis. Of the 72 fusion procedures, 44 were performed as an instrumented posterior lumbar fusion (PLF) and 28 as an instrumented posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), according to the preference of the surgeon. Instruments used were the Monarch for PLF, supplemented with Brantigan cages in case of a PLIF (both implants DePuySpine, Raynham, MA, USA). Approximately 80% (118/152) of all procedures were performed by one surgeon (SB). In the current study we compared the &#x0201c;concepts&#x0201d; of prosthesis and fusion, why we did not compare costs or cost-effectiveness with regard to the specific implants/procedures used. This was because we did not consider it probable that any procedure would produce relevantly different results in a 2-year period.</p><p>Directly after the &#x0201c;index procedure&#x0201d; (TDR or FUS), patients in both groups were instructed to be as active and mobile as possible. A soft orthosis was used for 6&#x000a0;weeks in the TDR group as it was generally recommended in the literature at the time of the study. An orthosis was not considered relevant in the FUS group since all patients were stabilized using instrumentation. Discharge from the hospital was determined based on the patient&#x02019;s ability to ambulate independently, under oral pain management. After this &#x0201c;index episode&#x0201d; (index procedure plus inpatient stay), the operating surgeon standardized the sick leave period to 2&#x000a0;months for all patients, with 50% leave for an additional month. After this 3-month period, the patients had the option to contact either the operating surgeon or the primary care doctor to assess need for additional sick leave.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cost data</title><p>Direct and indirect costs were identified, measured, and valued.

All patients were also seen for clinical follow-up by one of the authors (SR), although no data were recorded at these visits. Health economic evaluations commonly use the EQ-5D as the main clinical outcome measure (0&#x02013;1-graded scale, all minus values were transferred to zero, where 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x0201c;death&#x0201d;, and 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;perfect quality of life).

WTP is associated with the value a purchaser (e.g., the healthcare system) puts on a QALY. The threshold for WTP for a QALY is not established and differs from country to country. In Sweden, a usually referred range for the value of a QALY is SEK 500,000&#x02013;700,000 (LFN <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tlv.se">http://www.tlv.se</ext-link>). This WTP for a QALY can be derived from the value of a statistical life as measured in a contingent valuation on road safety in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Because of potential problems with interpreting cost-effectiveness ratios in probabilistic analysis, net benefits (NBs) were used to analyze the results. For example, if both incremental values are negative, the ICER is positive, but the interpretation of results would be the opposite if incremental values were positive. Using NBs avoids this ambiguity.

A positive NB suggests treatment is cost-effective (depending on uncertainty, here confidence intervals), while a negative NB suggests the opposite. To assess NB, a value must be placed on a QALY; and a WTP for a QALY of SEK 500,000 (about EURO 54,000; USD 67,750) was assumed for this study.</p><p>The &#x0201c;intention-to-treat principle&#x0201d; was used to guide statistical analysis, but analysis in this study, with no crossovers, was equivalent to &#x0201c;per protocol&#x0201d; analysis.</p><p>Results after 2&#x000a0;years were reported from the perspective of cost to society, including both direct costs (healthcare sector) and indirect costs (loss of productivity due to sick leave).

In a previous study by Berg et al. (the current study uses the clinical data reported in that study), the authors could not demonstrate clinical superiority with regard to any of the two procedures using pain (VAS), Function (ODI and SF36), and patient satisfaction, although significantly more patients in the TDR group reported to be totally pain free after 2&#x000a0;years (30 vs. 15%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>From the Societal perspective we found no significant differences in costs after 2&#x000a0;years. From the healthcare perspective there was a significant cost difference in favor of TDR, mainly due to a higher reoperation rate in the FUS group (see below). No concept could be demonstrated to be cost-effective on behalf of the other.</p><p>Several studies report that TDR and FUS provide approximately the same clinical outcome over 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, some authors express serious concerns about using this procedure except in scientific trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but others are more optimistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The &#x0201c;non-inferiority trial&#x0201d; comparing Charit&#x000e9; with anterior standalone BAK instrumentation, reports superior outcome both clinically and economically in the disc prosthesis group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], but this comparison could be questioned because of the use in the control group of stand-alone BAK cages, now recognized as an inferior fusion technique.</p><p>We used the EQ-5D instrument to assess QALYs. This instrument has been shown to be satisfactory for analyzing health-related quality of life in the field of spine surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and to be a useful tool for analyzing cost-effectiveness. In the current study, the minimal gain of 0.01 EQ-5D units (on a one-point scale) after 2&#x000a0;years make it practically impossible to conclude that TDR was associated with a higher gain in QALYs (diff. in costs/diff. in effects gained&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;time) compared with FUS, even though there was also a nonsignificant cost difference in favor of TDR. The point estimate of the ICER was located in the southeast quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> indicating a possible advantage for TDR, but the probabilistic analysis using bootstrapping showed widespread distribution of the ICERs in all four quadrants why it therefore not significantly favored either procedure.</p><p>Cost diaries were used to estimate resource utilization, including number of sick leave days after the index episode. One reason we did not use information from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency was a controversy over principals among the authorities during the study period as to how the central registers documenting length of sick leave and other reimbursement systems could be made available to researchers. However, this was a randomly controlled trial for which high internal validity can be assumed, in which we used patient based &#x0201c;cost diaries&#x0201d; on six different occasions with secretarial back up when needed, and in addition interviews by a study nurse also on six different occasions over the 2-year follow-up period, for which reason we consider the cost comparison between the two study groups to be valid.</p><p>The threshold of SEK 500,000 (EURO 54,000; USD 67,750) for WTP for an extra QALY gained used in the current study can be debated. Most commonly used WTP thresholds for a QALY vary between EURO 40,000 and 80,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The UK has often used a threshold of GBP 30,000 (EURO 39,000) in health technology appraisals (here synonymous with health economic evaluations) conducted by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, the WTP for a QALY was not crucial for interpretation of results in this study since no difference in QALY gain was found between TDR and FUS.</p><p>According to the scientific literature, the cost-effectiveness of TDR when compared with FUS after 2&#x000a0;years is not yet established. Guyer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] tried to assess this issue using an economic model developed by DePuy Spine, where lumbar disc prosthesis (Charit&#x000e9;, DePuy Spine) on one level was compared with instrumented fusion at unspecified levels. They conclude that the disc prosthesis procedure was probably cost-effective from a hospital perspective. These results could possibly be considered in light of the current study, where hospital costs were significantly higher in the fusion group, however, mainly due to more reoperations in the FUS group, which was not the case in the Guyer study.</p><p>Our pre-study power calculation estimates the 2-year cost to society for FUS at SEK 700,000 (EURO 75,600; USD 94,850), and 20% less for TDR, or SEK 575,000 (EURO 62,100; USD 77,900). The discrepancy was primarily based on the assumption that patients receiving disc prosthesis would return to work earlier than fusion patients. The power calculation proved to be fairly accurate with a total cost to society of approximately SEK 686,000 for the FUS group and SEK 600,000 for the TDR group, a difference of about 13% (ns). In addition, number of sick leave days (according to cost diaries) was approximately 60&#x000a0;days less in the TDR group (ns). The uncertainty reflected by wide confidence intervals and large standard deviations, hampered conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness in favor of either treatment strategy from a societal perspective. Also, this study was not powered to detect differences in number of sick leave days (post-study analysis power was found to be 0.54, compared with the pre assumed and relevant 0.8).</p><p>Our results do not provide any information concerning the cost-effectiveness of spinal surgery as a procedure per se, i.e., comparison of cost-effectiveness of surgery versus no surgery in this patient population, using the procedures addressed in this article. However, the collective data allow us to estimate potential QALY gain from the data derived in this study. Assuming that patients remain at the same QoL level without surgery, the QALY gain over 2&#x000a0;years after surgery can be estimated at approximately 0.45 (on a one-point EQ-5D scale). This gain is similar to the QALY gain that has been estimated for total hip arthroplasty in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Cost-effectiveness can be roughly estimated by conservatively assuming that initial hospitalization costs are the only extra cost of surgery (about SEK 140,000). The ICER of surgery when compared with no surgery would then be about SEK 340,000. If WTP for a QALY is assumed to be approximately SEK 500,000 (as in this study), this estimate can be considered cost-effective and possibly represents an underestimate of real cost-effectiveness since it does not consider issues such as fewer days of sick leave. However, if patients who do not undergo surgery improve due to natural course of disease, this assumption may be erroneous.</p><p>The current study focused on evaluating the cost-effectiveness of TDR versus FUS. Another interesting issue to consider is the economic value of spinal surgery as a procedure per se. One way to address this issue, based on the information collected for this study, may be to elaborate on potential cost reduction from patients returning to work after surgery. At baseline about 70% of patients were not working, while 2&#x000a0;years post-surgery 40% (TDR and FUS patients combined) of the patients had returned to work (full- or part-time). Assuming that the patient sample contains an equal proportion of part- and full-time workers, average productivity loss for these patients, had they not been operated, can be calculated as follows: 500 working days during 2&#x000a0;years *0.7*SEK 1,700&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;SEK 595,000. The average cost over 2&#x000a0;years related to sick leave for the operated patients in this study was SEK 467,142. Potential productivity gain from operating would then be SEK 127,858 per operated patient. By multiplying this figure with the number of patients in the study (152), the total estimated value of the productivity gain would be about SEK 19 million. From this perspective spine surgery could provide considerable value in terms of productivity gain. This is a rough calculation based on 2-year data and a number of assumptions, but we find it interesting and believe it could be further addressed in a separate study that would also include reimbursement data from the social insurance agency covering both surgical patients and nonsurgical patients suffering from the same disorder. Moreover, others have come up with similar estimates for back pain patients awaiting surgery and reached the same interesting hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Potential problems with the current study</title><p>This was a single center study conducted at the most productive spine unit in Sweden with over 1,200 procedures for degenerative disc disorders performed annually. One surgeon (SB) performed the index operation in 80% of the patients, and it is possible that patient selection, although there were strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to balance this, and surgical skills play a role, for which reasons the results achieved in this study therefore may not be generally replicable elsewhere. However, when comparing patient demographics, baseline values and clinical outcome with other studies and also with national registers, this seems to be less of a concern.</p><p>Although the index episode was equally costly for both TDR and FUS, total hospital costs after 2&#x000a0;years, as well as total costs to the healthcare sector, were significantly greater in the FUS group. This difference can be ascribed to a high reoperation rate, 36% in the FUS group (of which 28% was attributed to implant removal as the implant was diagnosed by the surgeon as a pain generator), when compared with 10% in the TDR group. In most cases the indication for reoperation was determined by one surgeon (SB), who also performed 90% of these procedures. Obviously, a certain reoperation rate must be expected after any surgical procedure but considering the single center perspective, meaning that the external validity of the decision to reoperate may be called into question; we performed a sensitivity analysis where all costs for reoperation were removed from both groups. The result was that the cost difference from the perspective of both the hospital and the healthcare sector disappeared. It is possible that there is, in general, a higher reoperation rate after instrumented lumbar FUS when compared with after total disc prosthesis, but this cannot be finally concluded from this study.</p><p>The current study compares the conceptual approach using disc prosthesis (Charit&#x000e9;, Prodisc and Maverick) with that of instrumented fusion (PLF and PLIF). The same costs were assumed for the three prostheses, and a mean cost was calculated for the two fusion techniques. It is possible that from a longer perspective, one of these procedures, and indeed one of these approaches (motion preservation vs. fusion), will turn out to be superior from the perspective of cost-effectiveness. This remains to be seen and is an important reason to continue to follow these patients for 5, 10, and 15&#x000a0;years, since 2&#x000a0;years may be considered a short time frame. The two most important variables with future potential to influence cost-effectiveness, as outlined in this study, may be differences in work capacity, and the need within any group or subgroup for additional back surgery.</p><p>Health economic comparisons between fusion and non-surgical treatment in patients suffering from CLBP have been published with somewhat different results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and it should be important to evaluate whether TDR could have advantages/disadvantages from a cost-effectiveness perspective in this patient population. We therefore consider this RCT-based health economic evaluation with relevant follow up and no cross-over, comparing the concepts of TDR and FUS, as important. Although cost-effectiveness could not be demonstrated with regard to any concept, after 2&#x000a0;years we found no economic argument against using TDR in selected patients suffering from CLBP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Societal costs showed no significant difference when compared with TDR and instrumented lumbar FUS after 2&#x000a0;years.
