<italic>Aim</italic>. To investigate the combination effects and mechanisms of valsartan (angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker) and LAF237 (DPP-IV inhibitor) on prevention against oxidative stress and inflammation injury in db/db mice aorta. <italic>Methods</italic>. Db/db mice (<italic>n</italic> = 40) were randomized to receive valsartan, LAF237, valsartan plus LAF237, or saline. Oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction in diabetic mice aorta were examined. <italic>Results</italic>. Valsartan or LAF237 pretreatment significantly increased plasma GLP-1 expression, reduced apoptosis of endothelial cells isolated from diabetic mice aorta. The expression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits also significantly decreased resulting in decreased superoxide production and ICAM-1 (fold change: valsartan : 7.5 &#x000b1; 0.7, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; LAF237: 10.2 &#x000b1; 1.7, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), VCAM-1 (fold change: valsartan : 5.2 &#x000b1; 1.2, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; LAF237: 4.8 &#x000b1; 0.6, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and MCP-1 (fold change: valsartan: 3.2 &#x000b1; 0.6, LAF237: 4.7 &#x000b1; 0.8; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) expression. Moreover, the combination treatment with valsartan and LAF237 resulted in a more significant increase of GLP-1 expression. The decrease of the vascular oxidative stress and inflammation reaction was also higher than monotherapy with valsartan or LAF237. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. These data indicated that combination treatment with LAF237 and valsartan acts in a synergistic manner on vascular oxidative stress and inflammation in type 2 diabetic mice.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Diabetes mellitus is responsible for a host of vascular deterioration such as heart disease, nephropathy, and retinopathy. The key roles that hyperglycemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress play in the progression of diabetes vascular complications are well recognized. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;<sup>&#x02212;</sup></sup>), have been shown to initiate several processes involved in diabetes vascular complications, resulting in increased endothelial cells apoptosis and increased expression of adhesion molecules which include intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and monocyte/macrophage chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1).</p><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (7&#x02013;36) amide (GLP-1) is a gut hormone released postprandially that increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon secretion, and delays gastric emptying [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. GLP-1 receptors were expressed in the human pancreas, lung, brain, stomach, kidney, and heart [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It has been shown that GLP-1 could protect against endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary heart disease [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, GLP-1 was not employed for therapeutic use since it is rapidly cleared from the circulation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). Thus, DPP-IV inhibitor could serve as a promising potent therapeutic target for diabetic vascular deterioration. It has been well recognized that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) could alleviate endothelial dysfunction in diabetic patients. However, whether DPP-IV inhibitor (LAF237) and valsartan have synergistic effect of on vascular oxidative stress and inflammation in type 2 diabetic mice is still not well understood.</p><p> Therefore, the aims of the present study were (1) to identify the expression of GLP-1 receptor in the diabetic mice aorta and the effects of valsartan (angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker) and LAF237 (DPP-IV inhibitor) on plasma GLP-1 expression; (2) to investigate the synergistic effect of valsartan and LAF237 on vascular oxidative stress and inflammation in type 2 diabetic mice.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Mice were treated with valsartan and LAF237 for 8 weeks. Blood from the tip of the tail was used to measure blood glucose concentration by using a reflectance meter (Accu-Chek, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, LDL, and HDL were measured spectrophotometrically by an automated system (Dade Behring RxL Max). The mice were fasted overnight before the last day of valsartan or LAF237 treatment. One hour after the last dose of valsartan or LAF237 was given, an oral glucose tolerance test (2&#x02009;g/kg) was performed. The plasma active GLP-1 was measured with a commercial assay (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO) 5&#x02009;min after glucose loading.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2.

The aortic segments were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m thickness were deparaffinized and rehydrated through graded alcohols to water. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 20&#x02009;min.

Discussion</title><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), the most potent insulinotropic hormone known, increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon secretion and delays gastric emptying [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, therapeutic use of GLP-1 itself is severely compromised by its lack of oral activity and rapid degradation by plasma dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). Compelling studies have shown that inhibition of DPP-IV was effective in improving glucose tolerance in diabetic patients in human clinical trials since DPP-IV inhibition could extend the duration of GLP-1 action and prolong its beneficial effects [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, DPP-IV inhibitor (LAF237) offers a new strategy for treating type 2 diabetes. Several studies have explored the expression of GLP-1 receptor in pancreatic islet cells, gastrointestinal tract, heart, lung, and so forth [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the present study, we also demonstrated that GLP-1 receptor is expressed on diabetic mice aorta as evidenced by RT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry staining.</p><p>Endothelial dysfunction can be improved by inhibition of rennin-angiotensin system using ACEI or ARB, not only in patients with coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic heart failure, but also in patients with diabetes [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Angiotensin II could interact with oxygen radicals and stimulates the generation of oxygen radicals by increasing the expression of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate via activation of the AT1 receptor. Previous studies indicated that LAF237 (inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV) and valsartan (antagonist of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor) have significant beneficial additive effects on pancreatic <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-cell structure and function compared with their respective monotherapeutic effects [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The aim of the present study is to investigate the combination effects of valsartan and LAF237 on vascular oxidative stress and inflammation in db/db mice.</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrated that both of valsartan and LAF237 increased plasma GLP-1 expression compared with the vehicle-treated group. Furthermore, combination treatment with valsartan and LAF237 showed more effective increase than that of single-treated group. We also explored the antiapoptotic effects of valsartan and LAF237 on endothelial cells of diabetic mice aorta. Both of them reduced endothelial cells apoptosis. Moreover, the combination therapy of valsartan and LAF237 induced a significantly lower apoptosis rate compared with monotherapy.</p><p>Diabetes is associated with an increased risk for vascular deterioration. Endothelial cells regulate basal vascular tone and vascular reactivity with the release of a variety of contracting and relaxing factors. It has been shown that diabetes can cause endothelial cell damage by several mechanisms, including apoptosis and increased oxidative stress. Oxidative stress implies a loss of redox homeostasis with an excess of ROS production by singular process of oxidation. ROS include free radicals such as superoxide anion, peroxynitrite, hydroxyl, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Loss of the modulatory role of the endothelium may play a key role in the development of diabetic vascular dysfunction [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Here, we used dihydroethidium staining to localize <italic>in situ </italic>O<sub>2</sub>

<sup>&#x02022;<sup>&#x02212;</sup></sup>and is converted to the red fluorescent compound ethidium. DHE red fluorescence was localized mainly in endothelial cells and smooth muscle layers according to the production profile of O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;<sup>&#x02212;</sup></sup> within the arteries. In the present study, we found that fluorescence intensity in the aorta isolated from nontreated db/db mouse was about 2 times higher than that of the m+/db mice, indicating an increase in O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;<sup>&#x02212;</sup></sup>formation. After treated with valsartan or LAF237 for 8 weeks, O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;<sup>&#x02212;</sup></sup>production was significantly decreased. Meanwhile, combo-treated mouse showed further more reduced O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;<sup>&#x02212;</sup></sup>formation.</p><p>NAD(P)H oxidase, which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of oxygen to form superoxide, is one of the most important sources of superoxide production in vascular tissue. Vascular NAD(P)H oxidase is a multimeric protein complex that consists of plasma membrane-bound subunits (gp91phox/Nox2 and p22phox) and cytosolic subunits (p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, and small GTPase Rac1). A strong correlation between p22<sup>phox</sup> expression and superoxide production in human coronary artery disease (CAD) has been reported [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. NAD(P)H oxidase activity in CAD was associated with elevated expression levels of p22<sup>phox</sup> and gp91<sup>phox</sup> [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Roberts et al. demonstrated that NAD(P)H oxidases were strongly involved in impaired vascular function in the thoracic aorta of rats fed a diet enriched with sugar and fat [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we have explored the role of NAD(P)H oxidase gp91<sup>phox</sup> and&#x02009;&#x02009;p22<sup>phox</sup> subunits as modulators of ROS production in diabetic mice. The mRNA expression of gp91<sup>phox</sup> and p22<sup>phox</sup> subunits of NAD(P)H oxidase was significantly increased in the diabetic mice aortic. Valsartan and LAF237 pretreatment significantly decreased NAD(P)H oxidase gp91<sup>phox</sup> and p22<sup>phox</sup> subunits expression. The combo treatment with valsartan and LAF237 could further reduce the mRNA expression of the above units, indicating a synergistic effect of valsartan and LAF237 on vascular oxidative stress in diabetic mice.</p><p>During the development of diabetes, a number of biochemical and mechanical factors converge on the endothelium, resulting in endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation. The inflammatory site in endothelial dysfunction may be where the process of inflammation in type 2 diabetes begins. An increased adhesion of leukocytes (especially monocytes) to the endothelium followed by transmigration into the subendothelial space is a crucial early event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and certain inflammation disorders. It has been well recognized that increased levels of ROS activate signal transduction processes leading to expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-8, as well as adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in endothelial cells, microglia, and astrocytes [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Hyperglycemia could also increase the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MCP-1 release [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p> The present data demonstrated that mRNA expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in db/db mouse was much higher than in m+/db mouse, after treated with valsartan or LAF237, and the expression of these adhesion molecules was decreased. Furthermore, the combo treatment induced a more significant decrease compared with the single-treated group. In db/db mouse, MCP-1 release was significantly increased as evidenced by staining with monoclonal antibody against MCP-1 and real-time PCR. The combo treatment with valsartan and LAF237 also had a more significant decrease of MCP-1 compared with single treatment using either valsartan or LAF237.</p><p> In conclusion, these results indicated that oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction were evident in db/db mice aorta. NADPH oxidase played a pivotal role in ROS production, resulting in increased expression of adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and MCP-1. Valsartan or LAF237 significantly reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction in diabetic mice aorta as evidenced by reduced apoptosis and reduced expression of NAD(P)H oxidase submits, ROS production, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MCP-1 expression. Furthermore, LAF237 and valsartan act in a synergistic manner on vascular oxidative stress and inflammation in type 2 diabetic mice. The possible mechanism responsible for the effects of valsartan and LAF237 is associated, at least in part, with the upregulation of plasma GLP-1 expression.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5.
