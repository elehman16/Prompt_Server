This study was performed to assess and compare the effects of Pilates exercise on flexibility and lumbo-pelvic movement control between the Pilates training and control groups.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>A randomized single-blinded controlled design was utilized in the study. Forty healthy male and female volunteers (mean age 31.65&#x000b1;6.21 years) were randomly divided into Pilates-based training (20 subjects) and the control groups (20 subjects). The Pilates group attended 45-minute training sessions, 2 times per week, for a period of 8 weeks. Flexibility and lumbo-pelvic stability tests were determined as outcome measures using a standard &#x0201c;sit and reach test&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pressure biofeedback&#x0201d; respectively at 0, 4 and 8 weeks of the study.

The results showed that the Pilates training group improved flexibility significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) during time intervals. This effect was also significantly greater than the control group for both 4 weeks and 8 weeks of the training period (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). There were 65% and 85% of the subjects from Pilates group passing the lumbo-pelvic stability test at 4 and 8 weeks of training periods respectively.

Improper activation and poor control of deep trunk muscles (i.e., TrA, MF) exist in asymptomatic individuals showing inability to control lumbo-pelvic stability, which is the early detecting sign for the back problems<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]</sup>. Remarkably, the dysfunction and delayed onset of TrA<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]</sup> and atrophy of MF<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]</sup> appear in people with low back pain. Consequently, CNS is not able to control these muscles in feed-forward manner. These changes cause instability of the spine. In addition to repetitive contraction, muscles will generate pulling stress upon the proximal attachments during movement which affects directly joints and soft tissues surrounding the spine as a result of strain and degeneration<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Flexibility is a crucial element of fitness to gain optimal musculoskeletal function enhancing peak performance<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]</sup>. Forward bending is a combination of lumbar flexion and pelvic tilting<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]</sup>. Tightness of hamstring muscles may restrict pelvic tilting due to their attachment to the ischial tuberosity on pelvis<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]</sup>. Hamstrings tightness and low back flexibility are also associated with low back pain<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Pilates is an exercise program as a core stability approach to augment the neuromuscular system to control and protect the core body or spine. This method is a comprehensive body-mind conditioning, which coordinates core stabilizing exercise with mind and breath control challenging by flowing movement of the whole body<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]</sup>. Since a Pilates approach focuses on core body exercise and breath control, it facilitates activation of transversus abdominis, diaphragm, multifidus and pelvic floor muscles. Incorporation of these muscles contributes to stability of the lumbopelvic region. Pilates exercise has been claimed to be a successful program for health promotion, rehabilitation and athletic training. The study by Harrington and Davies supported that Pilates method improved trunk control<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]</sup>. Regarding the benefits of Pilates for flexibility, the study by Kish<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]</sup> indicated that Pilates-based method significantly improved functional flexibility of the adductors and hip flexor muscles. However, the study by Wimer<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]</sup> showed that there was no change of flexibility after Pilates training in older adults. These study's findings require further investigation into its effective implication.</p><p>So far, there have been limited reports on the therapeutic effects of Pilates training on lumbo-pelvic control and flexibility outcomes. Many studies have been poorly controlled and relatively small in sample size.

The results of the present study demonstrated that the lumbo-pelvic stability and flexibility of the Pilates group significantly improved in comparison with the control group. These results are coterminous with previous studies<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]</sup>.</p><sec id="S20011"><title>Lumbo-pelvic stability</title><p>Logical explanations for improvement of lumbo-pelvic control are relevant to specific concepts of Pialtes-exercise in terms of the role and neural control mechanism of local muscles, motor learning and physiological response to specific volume of Pilates program. The concept of Pilates exercise focuses on core or powerhouse and breath control that activates local muscles, especially transversus abdominis, internal oblique, diaphragm, lumbar multifidus and pelvic floor muscles. Currently, scientific data show that these muscles have primary role in stabilizing the lumbo-pelvic system<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]</sup>. The stability of lumbo-pelvic system is also dependent on the central nervous system to determine the requirements of stability by pre-programmed TrA contraction to stabilize the spine prior to trunk perturbation from limbs movement and external load to the body's parts<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]</sup>. By the Pilates method, CNS may enhance the control of the spine when the trunk is challenged by internal and external forces (e.g., as a result of the reactive forces from moving upper and lower limbs during each position of exercise).</p><p>Considering motor leaning described by Magill<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]</sup>, it can be implied into: 1) Cognitive stage; the participants paid attention to cognitive oriented problem needed high awareness in order to isolate TrA contraction during each position of practices, using the verbal cues including internal and external feedback to detect errors, and followed the instructor step by step. 2) Associative stage; participants learned to associate some environmental cues with the movements by minimizing errors and perform consistently control contraction of TrA when the movement is challenged. Participants could detect errors and correct them themselves. Once association took place, the new movement sequence might become automatic.</p><p>The volume of Pilates exercise in this study was specific to cause physiological effects. Prolonged exercise (approximately 45 minutes) with low to moderate intensity is specific to promote strength, endurance, and neuromuscular control of the local muscles (i.e., transversus abdominis, pelvic floor and multifidus muscles)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]</sup>. The local muscle largely consists of type I or slow-twist skeletal muscles. Type I fibers contain plentiful mitochondria, high amount of oxidative enzymes and high density of capillaries. These characteristics make them well adapted for endurance activities over 30 minutes such as Pilates exercise prescription in this trial. Size or cross-sectional area of type I muscles increase as a result of increasing mitochondria, membranous and muscle filaments within the fibers<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]</sup>. Thereby, the strength and endurance of type I fibers occur showing improvement of lumbo-pelvic stability. Improved recruitment and synchronous stimulation of these motor units also account for increased muscle strength<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The result of this study is in agreement with the previous study by Harrington and Davies<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]</sup>. Interestingly, there were no participants passing lumbo-pelvic stability test in any of Pilates and control groups. It shows that asymptomatic individuals present inability of transversus abdominis to control the lumbo-pelvic stability. Lack of transversus abdominis activation for maintaining lumbo-pelvic stability in normal subjects was also reported in the study of Harrington and Davies<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]</sup>. The authors suggested that it might be due to improper TrA recruitment to stabilize the lumbar system, which can cause lumbar problems in the future (e.g., instability, pain).</p></sec><sec id="S20012"><title>Flexibility</title><p>This study provides remarkable insight into the potential benefits of Pilates exercise for flexibility. The Pilates exercise prescription in this study was successful to enhance flexibility component in agreement with flexibility exercise prescription by ACSM<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]</sup>. This effect can be explained by specific concept of Pilates approach, mechanical response of both contractile and non-contractile tissues and neurophysiological response to specific volumes of Pilates exercise prescription in current study.</p><p>The concepts of Pilates exercise focus on flowing movement throughout the whole body. The intensity of movement is the final range of motion at a tightness point without discomfort. The frequency of practice is twice a week with 5 repetitions per position. These dosages of exercise are appropriated to promote flexibility according to many researches that suggest that 2-10 repetitions of stretching exercise for 10-15 seconds during a 4-10-week period of training contributes to developing flexibility<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]</sup>. Pilates method is a combination of static and dynamic stretching exercises which are proper and safe to provide an increasing flexibility<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]</sup>. Improving back and legs flexibility in this study is supported by the Pilates studies of Segal et al<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]</sup> and Kish<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]</sup>. Kish's study<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]</sup> indicated the effects of Pilates exercise on improving hip adductors and flexors flexibility. Notwithstanding available evidences flavoring in benefits of Pilates exercise on flexibility, the study by Wimer<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]</sup> demonstrated unclear effects of Pilates training on flexibility in elder subjects. The unchanged flexibility after 10 weeks of Pilates training may be due to the factor of aging.</p><p>Neurophysiological properties of contractile tissues response to stretching exercise. When Pilates stretching position is applied, slow stretch to soft tissues (i.e., skin, tendon, joint capsule) and muscles activates Golgi tendon organ. This sensory receptor detects differences in the tension generated by either passive stretch or active muscle contraction. Golgi tendon organ inhibits alpha motor neuron activity as a result of decreased tension in muscles, permitting sarcomeres to lengthen<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Besides the change of mechanical characteristics of contractile and non-contractile tissues during slow stretch, the effect can be explained by stress-strain curve, when gentle force is applied perpendicular to the cross-sectional area of the tissues. Initially, the wave collagen fibers are straightened. With additional tension stress, recoverable deformation occurs in the elastic range. Reaching the elastic limits results in heat release (hysteresis) and new length. Additionally, the creep phenomenon can occur with low-magnitude and repetition of Pilates exercise in 45-minute sessions, twice a week, for 8 weeks. Repetitive stress will increase the plastic deformation of tissues usually in the elastic range, allowing a gradual rearrangement of collagen fibers and ground substance. The stretching positions applied after warm-up phase to raise the soft tissues temperature emphasize the creep effect and lengthen the soft tissues<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]</sup>. Another explanation of these changes is associated with viscoelastic properties. Shrier and Gossal<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]</sup> postulated that the effects of stretching exercise increased range of motion owning to either a decrease in viscoelasticity or an increase in stretch tolerance. Kubo et al. also supported this view with showing static stretching affected the viscoelasticity of tendon structures<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Some limitations of the study should be noted. This study determined only the short-term effects of the Pilates training program on lumbo-pelvic stability and flexibility in healthy subjects. Effects on other outcome measures, long-term follow up, and other populations such as musculoskeletal conditions warrant further investigations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0013"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results of this study indicate the specificity of Pilate-based exercise as an appropriate volume to contribute to physiological benefits which occur after 4 weeks of training as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Enhances lumbo-pelvic stability</p></list-item><list-item><p>Improves flexibility of lower back and legs</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The results of this study suggest that Pilates method can be used as an adjunctive exercise program for improving flexibility, encouraging control-mobility of trunk and pelvic segments. It may also help in preventing and attenuating the injury and dysfunction of musculoskeletal system.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We would like to express our gratitude to participants of the study and the Thai Health Promotion Foundation for supporting the grant for this study.</p></ack><sec id="S0014"><title/><p>
