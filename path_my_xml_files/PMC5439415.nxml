They recorded their driving mishaps over the next 12 months. Questionnaire items that uniquely discriminated drivers who did and did not have subsequent driving mishaps were assembled into the Risk Assessment of Diabetic Drivers (RADD) scale. In study 2, 1,737 drivers with type 1 diabetes from all 50 states completed the RADD online. Among these, 118 low-risk (LR) and 372 high-risk (HR) drivers qualified for and consented to participate in a 2-month treatment period followed by 12 monthly recordings of driving mishaps. To address aim B, HR participants were randomized to receive either routine care (RC) or the online intervention &#x0201c;DiabetesDriving.com&#x0201d; (DD.com). Half of the DD.com participants received a motivational interview (MI) at the beginning and end of the treatment period to boost participation and efficacy. All of the LR participants were assigned to RC. In both studies, the primary outcome variable was driving mishaps.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Related to aim A, in study 1, the RADD demonstrated 61% sensitivity and 75% specificity. Participants in the upper third of the RADD distribution (HR), compared with those in the lower third (LR), reported 3.03 vs. 0.87 mishaps/driver/year, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). In study 2, HR and LR participants receiving RC reported 4.3 and 1.6 mishaps/driver/year, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Related to aim B, in study 2, MIs did not enhance participation or efficacy, so the DD.com and DD.com + MI groups were combined. DD.com participants reported fewer hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps than HR participants receiving RC (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01), but more than LR participants receiving RC, reducing the difference between the HR and LR participants receiving RC by 63%. HR drivers differed from LR drivers at baseline across a variety of hypoglycemia and driving parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The RADD identified higher-risk drivers, and identification seemed relatively stable across time, samples, and procedures. This 11-item questionnaire could inform patients at higher risk, and their clinicians, that they should take preventive steps to reduce driving mishaps, which was accomplished in aim B using DD.com.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="sp1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">R01 28288</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group id="sp2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LifeScan</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004719</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group id="sp3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Abbott Laboratories</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001316</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group id="sp4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MyGlu.com</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI"/></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group id="sp5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>dLife.com</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI"/></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group id="sp6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dex4.com</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI"/></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="34"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vehicular collisions are the eighth leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 1.24 million deaths in 2010. They are projected to be the fifth leading cause of death by 2030 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In the U.S., 35,092 fatalities and an estimated 2.44 million nonfatal injuries occurred in 2015, costing the U.S. economy more than $99 billion (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Compared with spouses without diabetes, drivers with type 1 diabetes have greater risk of vehicular collisions (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), possibly because of the acute disruptive effects on cognitive-motor abilities during periods of extreme blood glucose (BG) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and chronic complications such as retinopathy and neuropathy that can interfere with safe motor vehicle operation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, not all drivers with type 1 diabetes are at an elevated risk of driving mishaps. Research demonstrates that compared with those without driving mishaps, drivers with two or more mishaps in the previous 12 months had greater insulin sensitivity, released less epinephrine during hypoglycemia, had fewer hypoglycemia-specific symptoms (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), performed worse on neuropsychological tests during hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and drove more poorly in a driving simulator during hypoglycemia (but not euglycemia) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). When examining drivers who documented driving mishaps prospectively over 12 months, mishaps were not related to age, sex, duration of disease, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, or awareness of self-reported hypoglycemia. Instead, future mishaps corresponded to the use of insulin pumps, a history of collisions, severe hypoglycemia, and hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>In recognition of this increased rate of mishaps among drivers with type 1 diabetes, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) released a position statement on diabetes and driving (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), which recommends that clinicians should screen for elevated risk and intervene to reduce it. However, no specific screening tool or intervention is available. To address this gap, we developed and tested a brief questionnaire that would allow a clinician to screen drivers with type 1 diabetes for a high risk of driving mishaps (aim A). Further, we developed an Internet intervention (DD.com) intended to assist high-risk individuals to better anticipate, prevent, detect, and treat hypoglycemia while driving in order to avoid future driving mishaps (aim B).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aim A: Development and Validation of the Risk Assessment of Drivers With Type 1 Diabetes</title><sec id="s3"><title>Overview</title><p>A screening questionnaire was created in two phases: development (study 1) and validation (study 2). In study 1, driving-relevant psychometrically sound questionnaires were administered to drivers with type 1 diabetes, who were then followed monthly for a year to document the occurrence of driving mishaps. Post hoc analyses selected 11 items that predicted drivers who would subsequently experience driving mishaps. These items were then used to create the Risk Assessment of Diabetic Drivers (RADD) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://professional.diabetes.org/radd">professional.diabetes.org/radd</ext-link>). Study 2 measured the validity of the RADD by comparing screening categorizations to rates of mishaps over a prospective 12-month observation period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Study 1: RADD Development</title><sec id="s5"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>It was hypothesized that more driving mishaps would be reported by individuals who <italic>1</italic>) have a reduced concern for hypoglycemia (Hypoglycemic Fear Survey [HFS] [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]), <italic>2</italic>) mismanage hypoglycemia (Risk Assessment of Severe Hypoglycemia [RASH] [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), <italic>3</italic>) have significant concerns about hyperglycemia (Hyperglycemia Avoidance Scale [HAS] [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]), <italic>4</italic>) have a history of driving mishaps, <italic>5</italic>) drive extensively, <italic>6</italic>) report impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and <italic>7</italic>) have retinopathy and/or neuropathy.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s7"><title>Participants</title><p>The study sample and methods have been presented in detail elsewhere (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Participants were 536 active drivers with type 1 diabetes recruited from Boston, MA (Joslin Diabetes Center), central Virginia (University of Virginia), and Minneapolis, MN (International Diabetes Center), as part of a year-long study of driving performance. Participants were recruited through newspaper, radio, and diabetes media ads, and were eligible if they <italic>1</italic>) had type 1 diabetes for at least 12 months, <italic>2</italic>) performed self-measurement of BG at least two times daily, <italic>3</italic>) had a valid driver&#x02019;s license, and <italic>4</italic>) drove at least 5,000 miles/year. After excluding individuals with incomplete data, the remaining sample consisted of 371 drivers with the following characteristics: mean age, 42.5 &#x000b1; 12.5 years; 48% male; mean diabetes duration, 24.5 &#x000b1; 12.9 years; and an estimated HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7.8 &#x000b1; 0.8% (62 mmol/mol &#x000b1; 8.7) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The median range of miles driven was 12,000&#x02013;14,000 miles/year.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants completed the HFS (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), RASH (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and HAS (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); a hypoglycemia awareness scale (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>); a questionnaire assessing demographics, driving history, and diagnoses of retinopathy, neuropathy, or cardiovascular disease; and both visual acuity and peripheral vision screening using the Department of Motor Vehicle&#x02019;s Titmus 2n Vision Screener. Subsequently, participants were followed monthly with e-mail messages asking them to report the number of driving mishaps they had in that month&#x02014;the primary outcome variable. The driving mishaps selected for inclusion in these monthly diaries were based on focus groups and our past research (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and represented dangerous driving situations that either involved a collision or could have resulted in a collision. Driving mishaps were defined as collisions, moving vehicle violations, episodes of severe hypoglycemia while driving, loss of vehicle control, automatic driving (finding themselves at a destination with no awareness of the drive), and instances of impaired driving in which someone else took over driving (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>To maximize precision of the measurements, item response modeling techniques (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) estimated latent trait scores for subscales or individual items of the scales administered. These scores became indicators in a logistic regression model (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) predicting low risk (LR; no or one mishap) versus high risk (HR; more than one mishap) for driving mishaps. The best-fitting model was established, retaining the significant predictors. This model was then compared, using the Vuong closeness test (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), with an identical model (same predictors) in which the item response modeling technique scores were replaced by summed raw scores. Findings indicated no significant difference between the two models (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Therefore, we used the simpler model using the summed raw score for all further classification analyses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for RADD items and scoring). Finally, a receiver operating characteristic curve based on the summed raw scores model was constructed and examined to establish a cut point for classification into the HR group.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>RADD items, response options, and scoring for study 1</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Questions</th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Response options</th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Scoring</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">In the past 2 years, because of low BG (hypoglycemia), how many times did you:</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;1.

Participants were compensated $10 for each month of driving mishap data they provided.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Results</title><p>The distribution of RADD scores from the Internet-based study 2 had a slightly lower mean (0.30 vs. 0.34; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), median (0.97 vs. 0.99; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), and maximum (2.50 vs. 2.99; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) than in the face-to-face study 1. These differences in scores were not related to sex or age. Using the criterion established for HR driving in study 1 (RADD score &#x02265;0.339), the percentage of participants assigned to the HR category in study 2 was 35.3%, compared with 37.5% in study 1.</p><p>To examine driving mishaps in study 2, negative binomial regression (a model of count data that controls for overdispersion in participant responses [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) was used to compare the number of self-reported driving mishaps that occurred prospectively over 12 months for the HR and LR groups. The post hoc Tukey test assessed whether significant differences existed between groups.

As was hypothesized and observed in study 1, participants in the LR group reported significantly fewer average mishaps (1.65) than those in the HR group (4.26; <italic>z</italic> = 4.82; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The model was then adjusted to control for age (higher risk being &#x02264;25 years of age), sex (higher risk being male), insulin delivery (higher risk using insulin pump delivery), and hypoglycemia awareness (higher risk with reduced awareness on the measure developed by Clarke et al. [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). The controlled model also fit well (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 239.58; df = 227; <italic>P</italic> = 0.271), with group placement as a statistically significant predictor of total mishaps (likelihood ratio = 26.12; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

Younger drivers (&#x0003c;25 years old; <italic>z</italic> = 3.186; <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and participants with impaired awareness (<italic>z</italic> = 2.378; <italic>P</italic> = 0.017) reported significantly more mishaps than older and hypoglycemia-aware drivers when accounting for all other variables in the model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Aim A Discussion</title><p>In response to the ADA position statement, a brief psychometric questionnaire was developed from questionnaire items in study 1 to empirically identify drivers with type 1 diabetes who are at elevated risk of being involved in future driving mishaps. Consistent with laboratory studies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and a multinational survey (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), the RADD identifies a subset of individuals at elevated risk of driving mishaps. The weights of the logistic regression equation indicate the relative contribution of the factors, which are (in order of importance) peripheral neuropathy (0.74), driving exposure (miles driven; 0.58), problems with hypoglycemia in general (RASH; 0.24), and a history of hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps (0.08). Factors in study 1 that did not account for the unique variance of future driving mishaps in this equation were fear of hypoglycemia, concerns with hyperglycemia, other diabetic complications (e.g., retinopathy, cardiovascular disease), impaired hypoglycemia awareness, duration of disease, vision, sex, and age. Age and impaired hypoglycemia awareness were significant covariates only in study 2. This does not mean that such factors as fear of hypoglycemia do not relate to driving mishaps for an individual driver, only that in combination with the other variables they do not add to the predictive model.</p><p>A strength of this 11-item scale is its brevity. In study 2 we attempted to augment the RADD by replacing the single neuropathy item with a neuropathy questionnaire (Neuropathy-Specific Quality of Life scale [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). This did not improve the sensitivity or specificity of the scale, so the simpler version of the RADD was retained.</p><p>The RADD is a psychometrically sound instrument. Using two different samples and methods of administration, the distributions of RADD scores were similar. In both samples, the RADD identified approximately a third of the drivers with type 1 diabetes as being at elevated risk of future driving mishaps. The slightly higher mean, median, and maximum RADD scores in study 1 may be attributed to the longer period of recent driving mishaps considered (2 years vs. 1 year). More importantly, using the cutoff criteria from study 1 on a different sample, obtained using a different method of administration, again showed that those identified as being at HR for future driving mishaps did, in fact, report significantly more mishaps in the subsequent 12 months. This resulted even when traditional risk factors of driving mishaps, such as age and impaired hypoglycemia awareness, were controlled. Further external validation comes from the mishap item, &#x0201c;Did you require assistance from someone else while driving due to your extreme BG?&#x0201d; In study 2, participants in the HR group reported that their passengers intervened 111 times because they perceived that the driver was impaired. This only occurred 27 times in the LR group.</p><p>A limitation to the routine use of the RADD in a paper-and-pencil format is its complicated scoring formula. However, this barrier can be eliminated by making the RADD available online, where automatic scoring and confidential feedback can be provided to users at any time and location. The ADA will soon make the RADD freely and publicly available on their website. Another limitation is that the RADD was not tested with adolescents, so the above results cannot be extrapolated to this already HR population. This limitation is significant because driving safety is a major concern of parents of novice drivers trying to negotiate driving challenges and their diabetes (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Further, it may be that the RADD could be made more comprehensive by incorporating the disruptive effects of extreme hyperglycemia (e.g., &#x0003e;250 mg/dL or 13.9 mmol/L), which has been associated with cognitive symptoms (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), cognitive impairments (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and driving mishaps (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>The RADD had a false-negative rate of 24%, classifying people as LR drivers when they reported more than one driving mishap during the subsequent 12 months. This illustrates that any driver has a risk of being involved in a collision or receiving a citation, and any driver with type 1 diabetes has the additional risk of experiencing disruptive extreme BG that can result in a mishap while driving. While ideally all drivers with type 1 diabetes should measure their BG before driving, they should at least be counseled that whenever they take more insulin, eat fewer carbohydrates, or engage in more physical activity than usual, they should measure their BG before driving. If their glucose is between 70 and 90 mg/dL (3.9 and 5 mmol/L), they should eat carbohydrates as a preventive measure. If their BG is &#x0003c;70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), they should eat carbohydrates immediately and not start driving until their glucose is above 90 mg/dL (5 mmol/L) and their cognitive and motor functioning has normalized (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Because driving has a metabolic demand (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), drivers should be further counseled to measure their glucose periodically during long drives.</p><p>As with any risk profile (such as the ADA&#x02019;s Type 2 Diabetes Risk Test [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]), an elevated RADD score does not definitively mean that the driver will have driving mishaps in the next 12 months. In fact, study 2 found a 36% false-positive rate among HR participants receiving RC. However, a RADD score classified as HR does mean that the potential for a diabetes-related mishap should be considered and that it would be prudent to diminish the risk. This could involve educating patients and assisting them in taking steps that will allow them to better anticipate and prevent hypoglycemia while driving. Efforts to reduce risk should also involve better detection and treatment of mild hypoglycemia (70&#x02013;55 mg/dL or 3.9&#x02013;2.8 mmol/L [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]) while driving in order to halt progression toward disruptive hypoglycemia.

It is also important to note that DD.com only affected hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps, not hyperglycemia- or non-diabetes-related mishaps. Together, these data suggest that DD.com had the specific effect intended: reducing the occurrence of hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps. The results also suggest that the HR group receiving RC derived some psychological and behavioral benefits from participating in this study, perhaps by completing questionnaires that raised their level of awareness regarding their own driving risk.</p><p>Like the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), which relied on participant self-report of severe hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), this randomized clinical trial relied on self-report of driving mishaps and causal attributions. Concern about participant response bias is lessened by the fact that HR participants receiving RC reported a higher incidence of driving mishaps than LR participants receiving RC, and that all groups reported a similar number of hyperglycemia- and non-diabetes-related driving mishaps. It may be that individuals who devoted the time and effort to complete this program had a differential bias in not reporting driving mishaps. This seems unlikely, however, given that the number of driving mishaps in the two DD.com groups was similar, whereas the number of mishaps reported in the two RC groups differed.</p><p>Other methodological limitations exist, which should be noted. <italic>1</italic>) This design did not allow us to determine whether a simpler, shorter intervention could have been as effective as this five-unit program. It may be that just giving HR drivers the tool kit and simple instructions concerning how to anticipate, prevent, detect, and treat hypoglycemia would have yielded similar results. <italic>2</italic>) Because we did not test DD.com with LR or intermediate-risk drivers, we cannot determine the effect of the intervention on those samples of drivers. <italic>3</italic>) Because DD.com<sup>All</sup> participants attributed 25% of their driving mishaps to hyperglycemia, this intervention could possibly be enhanced by also focusing on anticipating, preventing, detecting, and treating driving-related hyperglycemia. <italic>4</italic>) Given that the participant sample was recruited via the Internet, results from this selective sample may not generalize to all drivers with type 1 diabetes. <italic>5</italic>) An additional limitation is that only 70% of the participants eventually completed the intervention, regardless of whether they received MIs. This is unlikely to be a consequence of the online study format, since both RC groups had a higher rate of monthly diary completion (96%) than either of the intervention groups. Noteworthy is that the highest dropout rate coincided with the completion of unit 3, in which there was the highest demand for &#x0201c;homework&#x0201d; activities (i.e., extensive reporting of driving diary activities).Nonetheless, in this large-scale, national, randomized trial with a 12-month follow-up, DD.com significantly reduced the risk of future driving mishaps among HR drivers with type 1 diabetes. This demonstrates that driving risk can be reduced in those drivers who are more vulnerable to hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s30"><title>General Conclusions</title><p>This series of studies demonstrates that some drivers with type 1 diabetes are at greater risk of driving mishaps. These HR drivers can be identified using the RADD, a brief, psychometrically sound questionnaire that the ADA will soon host on their website. Finally, the incidence of future driving mishaps among HR drivers can be reduced via the DD.com Internet intervention, which helps drivers with type 1 diabetes to better anticipate, prevent, detect, and treat hypoglycemia while driving.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no NCT01563887, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn2" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc16-0995/-/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc16-0995/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Article Information</title><p><bold>Acknowledgments.</bold> The authors acknowledge, with gratitude, Derek Ford, PhD (Department of Psychology, University of Virginia), for his major contributions to the data analyses and for making the RADD a reality.</p><p><bold>Funding.</bold> This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases grant no.
