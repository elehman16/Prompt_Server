Of the 195 patients included, 134 (68.7%) completed the study. At baseline the two groups were similar, except there was a higher proportion of patients whose episode was severe-DSM IV in the milnacipran group (63.3% versus 54.0% in the venlafaxine group). The initial MADRS score (mean 31.0) decreased progressively during the study, and this decrease was in the two treatment groups (n = 177: 90 milnacipran; 87 venlafaxine) at week 24 (observed case/OC, mean change &#x02212;23.1 milnacipran; &#x02212;22.4 venlafaxine). The rate of MADRS response (reduction &#x02265; 50%) at week 8 and week 24-last observation carried forward/LOCF was similar in the two groups (week 8: 64.4% milnacipran; 65.5% venlafaxine; week 24: 70% milnacipran; 77% venlafaxine), as was the rate of MADRS remission (score &#x02264; 10) (week 8: 42.2% milnacipran; 42.5% venlafaxine; week 24: 52.2% milnacipran; 62.1% venlafaxine). In both groups, the most common adverse events were: nausea, dizziness, headache, hyperhidrosis and, in males, genito-urinary problems. The overall safety/tolerability and efficacy profiles of milnacipran and venlafaxine administered at flexible dosages (up to 200 mg/day) were similar in the long term treatment of adults during episodes of MDD in an outpatient setting.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>major depressive episode</kwd><kwd>adult</kwd><kwd>serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</kwd><kwd>milnacipran</kwd><kwd>venlafaxine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>With a prevalence of around 10% in the general population, major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common psychiatric problem.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ndt-6-071">1</xref> Strongly associated with general and psychiatric co-morbidity (anxiety problems and addictions),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ndt-6-071">2</xref> it is the primary cause of physical and mental incapacity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ndt-6-071">3</xref> Suicide risk is a characteristic of this disorder, and 5% of cases of severe depression result in suicide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ndt-6-071">4</xref> Despite its prevalence and detrimental consequences for both individuals and society in general, depression is only diagnosed in one in two cases, and it is particularly poorly managed, with less than 10% of patients with depression benefiting from antidepressant treatment which is appropriate in terms of dose and duration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ndt-6-071">5</xref> Although it is now recognized that the minimum duration of treatment with antidepressants necessary in order to prevent relapse of a current depressive episode is 6 months, only a few randomized, double-blind clinical studies investigating the treatment of major depression over this period have been carried out.</p><p>The antidepressant activity of a molecule is linked to its capacity to increase the synaptic concentration of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE), generally by inhibiting the reuptake of one or both of these neurotransmitters. The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have, for a long time, been the cornerstone of treatment for major depression, but their safety/tolerability profile is poor due to the fact that their pharmacological action is not limited to those two neurotransmitters. They have been succeeded first by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are slightly less effective, but much better tolerated, and then by the serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which combine the efficacy of the TCAs with the tolerability of the SSRIs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ndt-6-071">6</xref> Milnacipran (Ixel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and venlafaxine (Effexor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) are both SNRIs, which differ in the ratio of potential reuptake inhibition of NE:5-HT (estimated to be 1:1 and 1:30 respectively).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ndt-6-071">7</xref></p><p>The recommended dose of milnacipran in major depression is 100 mg/day.

To ensure the data collected were homogeneous, all investigators were trained at study set-up in the standardized use of evaluation scales in the study. After a washout period of 4 to 21 days (depending on ongoing treatments), eligible patients were randomized to either milnacipran or venlafaxine according to a pre-established randomization list.

There were 4 cases of worsening depression (3 with venlafaxine and 1 with milnacipran), all of which led to hospitalization and had favorable outcome. The three treatment-emergent cases (2 with venlafaxine and 1 with milnacipran) all occurred in males and were severe.

The rates of responders and remissions showed no relevant differences between groups at all evaluation time-points, from 8 weeks to 6 months. In clinical practice, achieving a long-lasting remission remains the major objective; after 6 months of treatment, the rate of remission in the two treatments groups (&#x0003e;50%) was greater than that normally reported in the literature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ndt-6-071">18</xref> The similarity of the efficacy profiles of these two dual-aminergic antidepressants in this long term study indicates the strength of action of milnacipran in MDD. In addition, milnacipran has been shown to have comparable efficacy to clomipramine, another reference treatment for major depression, when given at equivalent doses during a period of 6 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ndt-6-071">19</xref></p><p>Regarding safety/tolerability, the similar incidence in both groups of symptoms related to the serotonergic and noradrenergic modes of action of the two molecules suggests that milnacipran and venlafaxine, at the doses administered (mainly 150 or 200 mg/day) have similar selectivity at NA and 5-HT receptors. It was noted that in men, orgasmic disorders were more frequent with venlafaxine, while urinary symptoms were more frequent with milnacipran.</p><p>The statistical power required to carry out a non-inferiority analysis was not achieved. However, when considering this limitation, it should be noted that the level of recruitment required to reach this statistical power proved to be unfeasible for a double-blind trial over this study duration (6 months). The statistical comparisons of efficacy presented here must therefore be considered to be exploratory. This does not affect the interest and the originality of this study, the sample size of which is still considerable clinically.</p><p>One of the strengths of this study was the total length of the protocol, which had the objective to evaluate the two treatments over a long period whilst maintaining the double-blind control for 6 months of follow-up. For the outpatient follow-up period, the rate of study withdrawal was reasonable (more than two-thirds of patients finished the study), taking into account the fact that similar withdrawal rates have been reported in the literature for follow-up periods which were often considerably shorter.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ndt-6-071">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ndt-6-071">21</xref> In addition, the conditions in which this study was carried out are similar to real-life practice; outpatient follow-up of patients, use of flexible doses and moderate and severe forms of the disorder.</p><p>Overall, the results of this study show that milnacipran and venlafaxine have similar efficacy and safety profiles when administered at flexible doses of up to 200 mg/day. As suggested by a recent meta-analysis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ndt-6-071">16</xref> this study confirms milnacipran&#x02019;s place among the most effective antidepressant molecules.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the investigating psychiatrists:</p><p>M Abbar (30006 N&#x000ee;mes), I Amado (75074 Paris), J Audet* (16000
