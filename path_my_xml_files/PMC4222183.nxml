The main aim of this study was to verify whether the combined use of amplification and sound generator is more effective than conventional amplification alone in reducing tinnitus annoyance by means of the use of a new hearing aid with an integrated sound generator. A total of 49 patients underwent a blind randomized clinical trial. Tinnitus annoyance was measured by Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and numerical scales, and psychoacoustic measures of tinnitus were also performed. The sound generator was set at the lowest intensity capable of providing relief from tinnitus. Results showed that 62.5% of the patients presented a reduction in tinnitus annoyance in the combined fitting group and in the group with amplification alone, 78% showed a reduction. This difference between the groups was not statistically significant.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tinnitus</kwd><kwd>hearing aids</kwd><kwd>sound generator</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January - December 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-2331216514542657"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent research shows that tinnitus is a disorder that originates in the brain but has its trigger in the peripheral region. This is because the damage caused by the loss of hearing in the inner hair cells causes a loss of normal auditory nerve function (<xref rid="bibr9-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Herraiz, Diges, Cobo, &#x00026; Aparicio, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr14-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Kaltembach, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Moffat et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr19-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Norena, 2009</xref>), which in turn leads to a reduction in afferent nerve fibers throughout the auditory system. This lack of afferents creates a change in the neuronal activity, which is thought to be responsible for causing tinnitus (<xref rid="bibr14-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Kaltembach, 2009</xref>).</p><p>For patients with tinnitus and hearing loss, the use of a hearing aid is recommended. This not only improves hearing (<xref rid="bibr3-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Ferrari, Sanchez, &#x00026; Pedalini, 2007</xref>) but also stimulates the auditory cortex, which leads to permanent reductions in the neural activity responsible for causing the sensation of tinnitus (<xref rid="bibr27-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Searchfield, 2006</xref>). However, despite the hearing aid having been used as a tool for controlling tinnitus over the past 60 years (<xref rid="bibr24-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Saltzman &#x00026; Ersner, 1947</xref>), a recent finding showed that the majority of people with tinnitus do not regard the hearing aid as a treatment strategy (<xref rid="bibr15-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Kochkin, Tyler, &#x00026; Born, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Over the past few decades, hearing aids have been developed with an integrated sound generator as an alternative to enhance the treatment of tinnitus in patients with associated hearing loss (<xref rid="bibr8-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Henry, Zaugg, &#x00026; Schechter, 2005</xref>). However, neither a well-established protocol nor sufficient scientific evidence exists to support the superiority of the combined use of tools over conventional amplification.</p><p>The main aim of this study was to verify whether the combined use of amplification and sound generator is more effective than amplification alone in reducing the discomfort of tinnitus in patients with tinnitus and a mild to moderate bilaterally symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss, by means of the use of a new hearing aid with an integrated sound generator developed by the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo. We also wanted to check whether there was a correlation between the reduction in discomfort and the psychoacoustic measures of tinnitus.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2331216514542657"><title>Materials and Method</title><p>This study was developed in the form of a blind randomized clinical trial. It was approved by the Committee for Analysis of Research Projects of the Hospital das Cl&#x000ed;nicas and received financial support in the form of Research Grants by the Foundation for Research Support of S&#x000e3;o Paulo state. This study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01857661).</p><p>To determine the sample size, the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) was considered the primary dependent variable. Based on the study of <xref rid="bibr4-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira, Cunha, Onishi, Branco-Barreiro, and Ganan&#x000e7;a (2005)</xref>, a standard deviation of about 25 points on the THI scale was expected. A power analysis (<xref rid="bibr1-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Armitage &#x00026; Berry, 1987</xref>) revealed that to achieve 80% power to detect a minimum difference of 20 points between the groups at a two-tailed significance level of 5%, 24 subjects were required per group, totaling 48 individuals.</p><p>The sample composed of 49 patients with mild to moderate bilateral symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss, with complaints of constant tinnitus for at least 6 months, with THI score more than 20 points, and without prior experience with hearing aids or any other type of sound therapy.</p><p>The patients were initially assessed by a <italic>blind</italic> evaluator, who performed a specific anamnesis, psychoacoustic evaluation of the tinnitus (tinnitus pitch, loudness, and minimum masking level [MML]), numeric scale measuring tinnitus discomfort from 0 to 10, and the THI. After this stage, the patients were randomly assigned into two groups: a combined fitting group and an amplification alone group.</p><p>The combined fitting group received bilateral fitting of hearing aids with an integrated sound generator developed by the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (<xref rid="bibr22-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Penteado, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Penteado &#x00026; Bento, 2008</xref>), in combined mode or, in other words, with the combined use of amplification and sound generator. The amplification alone group received binaural fitting of the same hearing aid, but in simple mode, meaning amplification alone. This is a behind-the-ear (BTE) digital hearing aid with 16 channels of gain adjustments. It is equipped with an integrated white noise that can be used together with the amplification mode or not.</p><p>The hearing aid fitting was done by the researcher audiologist, and the individual needs, audiometric thresholds, discomfort, and observations of the patient were taken into account. Hearing aids were fitted using a modified strategy based on the NAL-NL1 rule from the software EasyFit, developed by the same University group.</p><p>In the combined fitting group, the sound generator was set at the lowest intensity capable of providing relief from tinnitus (<xref rid="bibr30-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Tyler, 2006</xref>). The level produced by the sound generator was initially very low and was adjusted upward until the patient indicated that the sound from the generator was audible. At this point, the level of the sound generator was increased further until the patient indicated some relief from tinnitus. If the patient reported any discomfort, the level from the sound generator was reduced again until a comfortable level was achieved. The noise reduction was not activated in any of the cases. Both groups received the same specific counseling about the aspects relevant to tinnitus.</p><p>The patients were advised to use the hearing aids for at least 8&#x02009;hr per day, and the final evaluation, composed of the psychoacoustic measures of tinnitus (tinnitus pitch, loudness, and MML), numeric scale, and THI, was carried out after 3 months of hearing aid use, by the same blind evaluator who performed the initial evaluation and who did not know which group each patient belonged to.</p><p>For the pitch matches, patients were instructed to match to the most troublesome tinnitus percept. In cases where the tinnitus was asymmetric, the contralateral ear was used as the reference ear; in cases where the tinnitus was equal across the two ears or heard in the center of the head, the right ear was used as the reference. A pure tone was used unless a patient&#x02019;s description of the tinnitus suggested otherwise. The reference tone was presented at a level 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;dB above the hearing threshold. It began at 1000&#x02009;Hz and was increased or decreased in frequency according to the patient&#x02019;s instruction until a match was indicated.</p><p>For loudness matches, the same ear was used as a reference as for the pitch matches, and the frequency of the tone was set at the frequency obtained from the pitch matches. The level of the tone was initially below the hearing threshold and was increased in level in 2-dB steps until the patient reported that the stimulus was equal in loudness to the tinnitus.</p><p>The MML test was designed to determine whether the tinnitus could be masked by another sound. Broadband white noise was initially presented below the hearing threshold and was increased in level in 5-dB steps, while the patient was asked to indicate whether the tinnitus was masked, partially masked, or unchanged. The procedure was stopped if the patient reported discomfort, even if no change in tinnitus was reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-2331216514542657"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 49 patients who took part in the study, two did not attend the final evaluation. One of them was not located, and the other suffered a heart attack which made it impossible to attend. They were both therefore excluded from the statistical analysis for missing the follow-up.</p><p>The sample was made up of 25 women and 22 men, with a mean age of 72.1 years (26&#x02013;91 years) and standard deviation of 12.6 years. The most common types of tinnitus were whistling (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9), roaring (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7), and buzzing (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6), and the most frequent location was in both ears (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18), followed by the head (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) and in only one ear (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14). With regard to hearing loss, 26 presented a mild degree of hearing loss and 21&#x02009;a moderate degree of hearing loss. A sloping hearing loss was the most frequent (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;36), followed by a flat loss (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11). The most frequent diagnostic hypothesis was presbycusis (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20), followed by unknown etiology (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14), hearing loss caused by high levels of sound pressure (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7), traumatic brain injury (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), ototoxicity (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), hypertension (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), stroke (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), and radiotherapy (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1).</p><sec id="sec4-2331216514542657"><title>Comparison of Groups Before Intervention</title><p>To check whether the study groups were homogenous, the means and standard deviations of variables in the preintervention period were calculated for each of the evaluated groups, and later the difference between the means of the groups was evaluated by means of the Wilcoxon nonparametric test (<xref rid="bibr10-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Hollander &#x00026; Wolfe, 1973</xref>).</p><p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2331216514542657">Table 1</xref>, there is homogeneity between the study groups, with only the means of the duration of tinnitus variable showing differences, the duration of tinnitus being greater for the group submitted to the combined fitting.

The only variable that showed a difference between the groups was the duration of tinnitus, which was significantly higher in the combined fitting group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.02). However, this fact did not interfere with the results of the study, as this variable was controlled in a multiple linear regression model, and the results were still similar in both groups. In addition, the two groups used the same hearing aid, received the same type of counseling, and were assessed by a blind evaluator, which reduces the chance of bias.</p><p>Another fact that should be mentioned relates to the type of stimulus generated by the combined hearing aid (white noise). Despite being well established in the literature that broadband noise is more effective than narrowband noise used in the past to mask tinnitus (<xref rid="bibr7-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Henry et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), some authors have suggested using other types of noise, such as speech-shaped noise, which besides accelerating the improvement of tinnitus, is better tolerated by patients (<xref rid="bibr11-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Ito, Keiko, &#x00026; Reiko, 2009</xref>).

The scores of numeric scale varied from 7.8 to 5.3 in the combined fitting group and from 7.8 to 3.8 in the amplification alone group, with no significant difference between the groups.

Perhaps this finding indicates that despite the combined and conventional fittings provide the same reduction in the discomfort resulting from tinnitus, it could be that the combined use is more effective in reducing the magnitude of tinnitus, in respect of the loudness. We believe that further studies are required to prove this hypothesis, as in general the tinnitus loudness varies between 5 and 10&#x02009;dB and does not correlate with the degree of discomfort (<xref rid="bibr16-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Landgrebe et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>).

Some studies ended up seeing a reduction of discomfort after 1 month of using the hearing aid (<xref rid="bibr3-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Ferrari et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr6-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). However, <xref rid="bibr11-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Ito et&#x000a0;al. (2009)</xref> observed that the improvement of tinnitus occurred more quickly with speech noise (after 1 month of use) than with white noise (after 6 months of use). However, the group exposed to white noise had a higher degree of hearing loss and greater tinnitus than the group exposed to speech noise, introducing a potential confound.</p><p>In contrast, <xref rid="bibr20-2331216514542657" ref-type="bibr">Parazzini et&#x000a0;al. (2011)</xref> compared the effect of using hearing aids and sound generators to reduce the long-term discomfort of tinnitus (3, 6, and 12 months) and noticed that the tinnitus improved progressively from the third month, with no difference, however, between the groups. Therefore, we do not believe that additional time is required to show the superiority of combined use compared to the amplification alone. However, our patients continue to be monitored so that observations about the long-term effects of hearing aids can be made.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the combined use of amplification and sound generator and the use of conventional amplification alone were equally effective in reducing the discomfort caused by tinnitus in patients with tinnitus and mild to moderate bilaterally symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss. Additionally, a correlation was observed between MML and the THI, numerical scale and tinnitus loudness, suggesting that higher values of MML are associated with a greater discomfort and higher tinnitus loudness.</p><p>Some caution is required in interpreting these results, based on the relatively small number of subjects. However, as the sample size should have been sufficient to detect a large effect, any difference (if it exists) is likely to be small.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec9-2331216514542657"><title>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</title><p>The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></sec><sec id="sec10-2331216514542657"><title>Funding</title><p>The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was financially supported in the form of Research Grants by the Foundation for Research Support of S&#x000e3;o Paulo state.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2331216514542657"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Armitage</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1987</year>) <article-title>The planning of statistical investigations</article-title>.
