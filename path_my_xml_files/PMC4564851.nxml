The rapidly rising rates of complex, chronic disease are creating an unsustainable burden on the national economy in both direct (e.g. treatment) and indirect (e.g. lost productivity) costs.</p><p>These chronic and degenerative diseases cannot be effectively treated with drugs alone. As a matter of fact, chronic drug use for these conditions is not only costly but often has serious side-effects. Popular analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as celecoxib, diclofenac, ibobrufen, naproxen and aspirin have confirmed risk for heart disease and internal bleeding.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>,<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Paracetamol can damage the liver. Allopathic medicines often do not cure these diseases, but rather mask the symptoms.</p><p>The incidence of OA increases with age, and ageing patients present with comorbidities that add to the complexity of&#x000a0;treatment. Degeneration of joint cartilage is still the most important pathophysiological feature of OA. Tissues surrounding the joints, such as muscles, bones, tendons and ligaments, are also involved in the disease process. Recommendations for management of OA comprise non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches. Non-pharmacological interventions include education and self-management, referral to a physical therapist, aerobic muscle-strengthening and water-based exercises, weight reduction, diet interventions, walking aids, knee braces, therapeutic footwear and insoles, thermal modalities, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture. Pharmacological treatments consist of paracetamol, systemic and topical cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) non-selective and selective inhibitors, classified as NSAIDs, topical capsaicin, intra-articular corticosteroids and hyaluronates, glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulphate and diacerin for possible structure-modifying effects, and use of opioid analgesics and tramadol for the treatment of refractory pain.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>,<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Methotrexate, which has immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects, is promising, but this drug may have serious side-effects, including liver disease, lung inflammation, increased susceptibility to infection, and suppression of blood cell production in the bone marrow. Studies with disease-modifying drugs in management of OA, such as bisphosphonates with the aim of inhibiting increased bone turnover, did not produce positive results.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Long-term use of systemic NSAIDs to relieve OA symptoms could cause serious adverse events, such as gastro-intestinal bleeding, renal damage, and induction or aggravation of bronchial asthma and cardiovascular complications.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The effect of COX-2 inhibitors on renal function is still tenuous. Of great concern has been the voluntary withdrawal of rofecoxib (Vioxx<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) from the market in 2004 because of an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events, including heart attacks and stroke amongst patients taking Vioxx<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> compared to patients receiving placebo.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><sec id="s2002"><title>Dietary considerations</title><p>The typical &#x02018;Western diet&#x02019; is considered acidogenic due to the greater acid load contained in animal products, and is low in fruit and vegetables, resulting in&#x000a0;a state of overlooked low-grade chronic, compensated metabolic acidosis.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The ensuing acidotic stress and hypoxia may play a role in the pathophysiology of OA.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In response to states of diet-derived metabolic acidosis, the kidney implements compensating mechanisms to restore the acid-base balance.</p><p>In South Africa there is compelling anecdotal evidence that an alkaline diet supplement, Multiforce<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (MF) Alkaline Powder, has beneficial effects in patients with primary OA prompted this research to objectively explore the influence of&#x000a0;dietary supplementation with MF on symptoms and signs of OA.</p></sec><sec id="s2003"><title>Aim</title><p>The aim of the study was to test, by means of a randomised controlled trial, the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with MF relieves clinical signs and symptoms of OA of the hands.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0004"><title>Research methods and design</title><p>The research comprised two stages, a pilot study and the main study.</p><p>In the pilot, a single-centre, open study of the efficacy and safety of MF in participants (<italic>n</italic> = 40) with OA&#x000a0;revealed significant improvements (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005) in all parameters assessed.

The median value for hs-CRP at baseline was 2.9 mg/dL (25th &#x02013; 75th percentile 0.3&#x02013;23). Traditionally CRP has been used to distinguish systemic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis from OA. However, multiple studies have demonstrated that hs-CRP is modestly elevated in the plasma of patients with OA compared to age-matched controls. Whilst hs-CRP levels in rheumatoid arthritis are typically &#x0003e; 15 mg/L, levels in OA typically range from 3 to 8 mg/L.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This may indicate that the preparation does not influence inflammation, or it may be that the volume of the synovium in longstanding OA is too small to influence it.</p></sec><sec id="s2027"><title>Rescue medication</title><p>We investigated the use of the rescue medication and it was found not to be different in the placebo and verum groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0028"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this randomised placebo-controlled study involving 98 participants corroborate the findings of the pilot study, namely that the dietary supplement MF, at a dose of 7.5 g twice daily, reduces signs and symptoms of OA in hands significantly, and that ingestion of MF in this manner is associated with alkalinisation of urine. It is thus a tenable deduction that the pilot study was devoid of a placebo effect.</p><p>Efficacy of MF reached significance within two weeks and was sustained over the four weeks of treatment, regardless of the order of randomisation. It is also apparent that efficacy levels had not reached steady state after four weeks, which suggests that MF could provide even more pronounced relief if used continuously. This theory is supported by the observation that MF treatment appeared to result in a &#x02018;carry-over&#x02019; effect, deduced from the finding that improvement in signs and symptoms of OA was sustained even after crossover from verum to placebo.</p><p>A limitation of the study is the short intervention time, and that we did not do a diet recall during the study. Dietary restrictions and modifications were not enforced in this study. Therefore it is reasonable to deduce that alterations in the OA signs and symptoms and urine pH were induced by dietary supplementation with MF, which is rich in organic anions, notably citrate salts, which are converted into bicarbonate systemically. Although the mechanism(s) whereby MF supplementation provided clinical relief of OA of the hands is not clear, the acidic extracellular environment may lead to increased intracellular acid loads experienced by chondrocytes. Extracellular factors such as acidosis may affect articular chondrocytes and this may have implications for disease progression and potential therapeutic intervention. Articular cartilage is a highly specialised tissue designed to allow pain-free, friction-less movement across joints. Mature cartilage is avascular, relatively hypoxic and acidic and thus provides an unusual and challenging environment to the resident cell, the chondrocyte.</p><p>In joint diseases such as OA and rheumatoid arthritis oxygen levels are reduced further from increased consumption by inflammatory cells, and reduced delivery of oxygen to synovial fluid due to joint capsule fibrosis and subchondral bone sclerosis. Alteration in the physical environment and release of inflammatory mediators by articular cells (under disease conditions) leads to acidosis. Cartilage matrix synthesis has a bimodal response to alterations in extracellular pH with optimal synthesis occurring between pH 7.0&#x02013;7.2, and synovial fluid acidosis occurs in OA and rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that pH and hypoxia may have an important role in maintaining cartilage integrity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> It is possible that &#x02018;correction&#x02019; of underlying systemic metabolic acidosis resulting from &#x02018;Western-style&#x02019; eating habits may play a role.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>,<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>,<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s0029"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dietary supplementation with MF, which contains organic anions in the form of citrate salts, significantly relieved the symptoms and signs of OA of the hands. Based on the study outcome, MF&#x000a0;may be considered a safe and effective, non-allopathic therapeutic modality, alone or as an adjunct to other interventions, in the management of this common degenerative disease. Further research based on comorbidity factors might be warranted. These are short-term findings, and long-term studies are required to evaluate the influence of MF on bone and joint physiology and pathology.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This was a contract research project conducted on behalf of South Africa Natural Products and supported by&#x000a0;Bioforce (Pty) Ltd.
