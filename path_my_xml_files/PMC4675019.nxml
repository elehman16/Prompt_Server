Self-regulation processes, such as goal-setting, may become disordered after traumatic brain injury, particularly when the frontal regions of the brain and their connections are involved. Such impairments reduce injured veterans&#x02019; ability to return to work or school and to regain satisfactory personal lives. Understanding the neurologically disabling effects of brain injury on executive function is necessary for both the accurate diagnosis of impairment and the individual tailoring of rehabilitation processes to help returning service members recover independent function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The COMPASS<sup>goal</sup> (Community Participation through Self-Efficacy Skills Development) program develops and tests a novel patient-centered intervention framework for community re-integration psychosocial research in veterans with mild traumatic brain injury. COMPASS<sup>goal</sup> integrates the principles and best practices of goal self-management. Goal setting is a core skill in self-management training by which persons with chronic health conditions learn to improve their status and decrease symptom effects. Over a three-year period, COMPASS<sup>goal</sup> will recruit 110 participants with residual executive dysfunction three months or more post-injury. Inclusion criteria combine both clinical diagnosis and standardized scores that are &#x0003e;1 SD from the normative score on the Frontal Systems Rating Scale. Participants are randomized into two groups: goal-management (intervention) and supported discharge (control). The intervention is administered in eight consecutive, weekly sessions. Assessments occur at enrollment, post-intervention/supported discharge, and three months post-treatment follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Goal management is part of the &#x0201c;natural language&#x0201d; of rehabilitation. However, collaborative goal-setting between clinicians/case managers and clients can be hindered by the cognitive deficits that follow brain injury. Re-training returning veterans with brain injury in goal management, with appropriate help and support, would essentially treat deficits in executive function. A structured approach to goal self-management may foster greater independence and self-efficacy, help veterans gain insight into goals that are realistic for them at a given time, and help clinicians and veterans to work more effectively as true collaborators.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Executive function</kwd><kwd>Traumatic brain injury</kwd><kwd>Goal-setting</kwd><kwd>Community re-integration</kwd><kwd>Veterans</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Manualized psychosocial intervention</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>VA ORD RR&#x00026;D</institution></funding-source><award-id>1I01RX000637-01A3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Libin</surname><given-names>Alexander V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Trial registry</title><p><italic>Registry:</italic> ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier - NCT01816061.</p><p><italic>Dataset:</italic> See Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for items from the World Health Organization Trial Registration Data Set.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Trial registration data set</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Data category</th><th>Information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Primary registry and trial identifying number</td><td>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01816061</td></tr><tr><td>Date of registration in primary registry</td><td>March 19, 2013</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary identifying numbers</td><td>I01RX000637-01A3 D0637-R</td></tr><tr><td>Source(s) of monetary or material support</td><td>United States Department of Veterans Affairs Rehabilitation Research and Development Service</td></tr><tr><td>Primary sponsor</td><td>United States Department of Veterans Affairs Rehabilitation Research and Development Service</td></tr><tr><td>Contact for public queries</td><td>AVL [Alexander.Libin2@va.gov], ED [Ellen.Danford@va.gov]</td></tr><tr><td>Contact for scientific queries</td><td>AVL [Alexander.Libin2@va.gov]</td></tr><tr><td>Public title</td><td>Executive Functioning in TBI from Rehabilitation to Social Reintegration: COMPASS</td></tr><tr><td>Scientific title</td><td>Executive Functioning in TBI from Rehabilitation to Social Reintegration: COMPASS</td></tr><tr><td>Countries of recruitment</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Health condition(s) or problem(s) studied</td><td>TBI</td></tr><tr><td>Intervention(s)</td><td>Experimental&#x02014;Fifty-five participants in the intervention group will receive eight goal self-management sessions.

TBI is also an established risk factor for psychological health and community re-integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Studies emphasize the dramatic effects of neurological injuries among active duty troops serving in conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Given the necessity for operational effectiveness in the battlefield environment, executive function symptoms become significant for the military because they jeopardize active duty troops&#x02019; capacity for crucial decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. At the same time, while remaining undetected, neurological problems cause poor self-management skills, resulting in maladjustment and a low quality of life in returning military veterans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this study, we employ the definition of TBI by the U.S. Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, i.e., &#x0201c;&#x02026;an acquired injury to the brain caused by an external physical force, resulting in total or partial functional disability or psychosocial impairment, or both, that adversely affects a person&#x02019;s professional and educational performance in one or more areas, such as cognition; language; memory; attention; reasoning; abstract thinking; judgment; problem-solving; sensory, perceptual, and motor abilities; physical functions; information processing; and speech. The term does not apply to brain injuries that are congenital or degenerative, or to brain injuries induced by birth trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].&#x0201d; The exposure to stressors from combat, including explosive blasts and loss or injury to the self or to comrades, can lead to significant problems when transitioning back to civilian life post-combat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Due to advances in medicine and body armor, soldiers are surviving blasts or explosions that may have previously resulted in severe injury or death during combat. Following the U.S. defense causality report in November 2009, the Institute of Medicine updated its statistics to show that &#x0201c;fatality-to-wounded ratios have been 1:5.0 for&#x02026; [conflict in Afghanistan] and 1:7.2 for&#x02026;[conflict in Iraq] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] compared with 1:2.6 in Vietnam and 1:1.7 in World War II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].&#x0201d;</p><p>Many veterans returning from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq may have experienced TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the significance of which is underscored by a national study undertaken by the RAND (Research ANd Development) Corporation commissioned by the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to gauge the effect of TBI on the lives of veterans and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Even if there are no other co-existing physical impairments, TBI and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are enough to significantly hinder a veteran&#x02019;s successful progression into active community participation and employment. Physical factors affecting community re-integration in veterans with polytrauma and TBI include pain, PTSD-related anger, and depression. Among the psychosocial factors that affect community functioning in returning veterans are social isolation, poor problem-solving of everyday difficulties, and a lack of motivation to change.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Executive functioning system in TBI: a multifactorial model</title><p>Executive dysfunction is the core condition underlying neurologic impairments resulting from CNS insult, such as TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], dual TBI-spinal cord injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and it is a distinct feature of CNS degenerative disorders such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As a central clinical syndrome, executive functioning is defined as a network of processes that are responsible for initiating, guiding, and regulating psychomotor, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functions, particularly during active and novel problem-solving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Executive processes are thought of as part of the system that acts in a supervisory capacity in the overall brain hierarchy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and provides for purposeful, goal-directed behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A plethora of neurologic and behavioral data demonstrates that individual performance processes are deeply involved with changes in what can be called the executive functional system (EFS) (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref><italic>)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Central-peripheral dysregulation in Executive Functional System(EFS)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40779_2015_61_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>Recent studies emphasize that executive processes do not have a single neuroanatomical representation in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; rather, they present as patterns that merge different brain structures (e.g., the brain&#x02019;s prefrontal zone and limbic system) and their peripheral counterparts (e.g., motor apparatus). Existing interlinkages in the brain-peripheral system are currently explored by measuring various aspects of executive functioning through standardized neuropsychological assessments, magnetic-resonance imaging and a more precise assessment, diffusion tensor imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The conceptual definition of the EFS proposes two major subsystems: the <italic>central executive subsystem</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which includes higher-level processes, such as selective attention, working memory, and decision-making capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and the <italic>peripheral executive subsystem</italic>, composed primarily of psychomotor processes associated with central executive performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Executive functioning can break down at any stage in the behavioral sequence, be it volition control, planning, purposeful behavior, or effective performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Deficiencies in self-initiated behaviors may result from neurological damage to the frontal-subcortical or fronto-limbic circuitry (see areas C and D, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], to the right hemisphere, or in diffuse neurologic conditions (see area A, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The dorsal prefrontal cortex is critical to allocating attentional resources involved with working memory tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] or to the attentional controller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] &#x02013; a system responsible for maintaining and switching attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>Motor performance is an instrumental component of the EFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In the classic methodology of motor examination tasks developed by Luria and his successors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], the ability to copy hand movements paced by a metronome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] was found to be sensitive to frontal damage and to temporal lesions (see area C, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The inability to move rapidly through a repetitive or mixed-movement sequence, combined with errors and perseverations, was found to be characteristic of patients with left hemisphere lesions (see area B, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Motor regulation deficits are often associated with withholding responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], based on a &#x0201c;go/no-go&#x0201d; rule, in which a subject should respond to only one of two presented signals (see area A, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Patients with subcortical involvement display executive dysfunction that includes impairments in cognitive flexibility, memory recall, and psychomotor slowing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Impairment of executive processes often presents a major challenge in an individual&#x02019;s ability to perform activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], to manage their disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and to reintegrate into the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Executive System: TBI, PTSD and community re-integration</title><p>There is an overlap of symptoms between TBI and PTSD. This issue is most pertinent in the chronic TBI population, where there are higher rates of PTSD. Sustaining any type of physical injury is known to increase a person&#x02019;s risk for PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. There are several symptoms that are found in <italic>both</italic> PTSD and TBI, such as deficits in attention and memory, irritability, and sleep disturbance. However, in the acute assessment of TBI, distinguishing symptoms such as headache, dizziness, balance problems, and nausea/vomiting may help distinguish TBI from PTSD. Another distinguishing factor is the history that is obtained from patients about the course of events before, during, and after the traumatic event. Loss of consciousness and post-traumatic amnesia are less common in PTSD and is the distinguishing historical factor to diagnose mild and moderate TBI.</p><p>Research has suggested a range of post-injury cognitive, somatic, and behavioral symptoms, including headache, anxiety, dizziness, and memory difficulties immediately following TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and decreased educational attainment and limitations in work performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The effects of cognitive and behavioral impairment on independence and societal participation following TBI are well established. At the same time, the gaps between research and everyday life continue to exist. A U.S. Institute of Medicine report on the needs of veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq indicates, &#x0201c;little research has been conducted to evaluate whether service members who undergo third location decompression (that is, for service members to have time with their comrades and peers in a restful situation and prepare themselves for going back to their families and communities) have better outcomes than those who do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].&#x0201d;</p><p>Strengthening the community integration of veterans with TBI requires a collaborative effort bringing together veterans and their families, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) case managers and social workers, and the broader research community to address barriers that prevent veterans with serious injures such as TBI from effectively pursuing life opportunities that are available to others. In one of the first national surveys of veterans in Afghanistan and Iraq enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system who saw combat, Sayer and colleagues (2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] explored the prevalence and types of community re-integration problems veterans faced and assessed preferences for interventions to promote adaptation to civilian life. Stratified Poisson regression was used to determine whether the number of community reintegration problems and the number of services of interest were associated with the presence of probable PTSD, gender, or race. An estimated 25&#x000a0;% to 56&#x000a0;% of the population had some difficulty to extreme difficulty in the social functioning, productivity, community involvement, and self-care domains. At least one third reported divorce, dangerous driving, increased substance use, and anger control problems since returning from deployment. An estimated 41&#x000a0;% had probable PTSD, and each type of reintegration problem was more prevalent among veterans with probable PTSD. The vast majority (96&#x000a0;%) of Afghanistan/Iraq veterans expressed interest in services to help them readjust to civilian life. The most commonly preferred ways to receive reintegration service or information was at a VA facility, through the mail, and over the internet. Interest in self-help techniques and yoga/meditation was particularly common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Penk and colleagues (2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], in their VHA comparative effectiveness study, discussed the need for research that identifies ways to aid veterans with dual diagnoses attain competitive jobs.

All participating veterans undergo a battery of tests measuring executive function, real-world performance, TBI self-efficacy, emotional status and PTSD, community integration, and quality of life. Each potential participant receives additional screening of TBI and executive dysfunction to determine intervention eligibility. Each participant also receives a neuropsychological interview, and COMPASS<sup>goal</sup> investigators discuss each participating veteran with his/her VA case manager, as applicable. Subsequently, veterans are randomized to intervention and control groups.

The primary outcome is a change in the three major types of parameters from pre- to post-intervention. Depending upon the hypothesis being tested (see Background: Objective, Specific Aim, and Hypotheses), participants are stratified according to their level of executive functioning, their severity of conditions secondary to TBI (e.g., PTSD, emotional status), or their degree of social participation. Dependent variables include TBI-self-efficacy, community integration indices, educational or work attainment as defined by the ICF qualifiers, and life satisfaction. Both objective (e.g., executive performance) and subjective (e.g., perceived TBI self-efficacy) data are then obtained based on repeated measures over the enrollment period. Multiple regression models will be fitted to explore continuous primary and secondary outcomes differentiating groups at each time point and changes at the intra-individual and inter-individual levels over time. For categorical outcomes (e.g., low/high executive performance or work status, such as unemployed/employed or part-time/full-time), unconditional logistic and/or multinomial regression models will be implemented.</p><p>The basic testing of the hypotheses will involve an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test and a repeated-measures ANOVA test.

The following will be considered for the analytical strategy:</p></sec><sec id="FPar15"><title>ANOVA</title><p>Repeated-measures ANOVA and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) will be used to compare the effect of the COMPASS<sup>goal</sup> intervention versus the supported discharge group, as determined by baseline assessment. ANOVA will be used to compare the change pre- to post-intervention between the two groups. Furthermore, to analyze the main effect of the COMPASS<sup>goal</sup> intervention over time, a two-way repeated measures parametric ANOVA and a non-parametric repeated measures Friedman ANOVA will be performed using the baseline time point, levels of TBI self-efficacy, or real-world task performance as the dependent variables. The levels of the repeated-measures factor correspond to the number of assessments: baseline/pre-intervention, post-intervention/supported discharge, and at three months post-treatment follow-up. The between-groups factor will be the intervention group versus the supported discharge group.</p><p>The MANCOVA analysis will focus on the contrast in TBI self-efficacy between the intervention and supported discharge groups while accounting for a specified covariate: level of executive impairment, as defined by FrSBe. In the case of non-normal residuals, we will use a nonparametric repeated-measures approach. In the case of missing data, an LMM, which uses a maximum likelihood estimate to correct for an unequal number of measures per subject, will be employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar16"><title>Hypothesis 2: psychosocial profile as a mediator of the responsiveness to the intervention over the time course</title><p>To explore Hypothesis 2, we will utilize a multistage analytic strategy. Because of the possibility of missing data due to non-responses, missed visits, attrition, and mortality over the course of the study, the statistical analysis presents certain challenges. At the first stage, an LMM will be used to incorporate all available data, to evaluate trends, and to estimate changes in outcome variables without discarding cases that have missing data points. Furthermore, an LMM controls for confounding effects of other repeatedly measured covariates while accounting for the correlations among repeatedly measured outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. SAS PROC MIXED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>] will be used to estimate an LMM for each outcome of interest. For categorical outcomes, generalized estimating equations (GEEs) will be used to evaluate trends over time while accounting for the dependency among the repeatedly measured outcomes.

At the second stage, we will construct a model that includes only the repeated-measures variables to obtain means, variances, and covariances. At stage three, we will add time-invariant variables such as age, gender, and education into the model to predict change over time in executive function and real- world performance. We will also be able to refine our model at any level by assessing the fit after additional variables are inserted. The covariance structure obtained will allow us to draw inferences with regards to linear increases or decreases in executive dysfunction and real-world performance over time. This method will allow us to address individual growth, to identify latent trajectories of growth, and finally, to relate the observed changes to pre-existing differences between study participants.</p></sec><sec id="FPar17"><title>Additional analyses</title><p>We will use an LMM to control for potential confounding variables, and baseline values will be utilized as a covariate. These models will allow for the additional control of potential variance within subject clusters from variables, such as intervention modality.

As in many studies with vulnerable populations, participant dropout or censoring may be informative.

If missing data are judged as <italic>missing completely at random</italic>, the typical strategy will be to conduct a complete case analysis, recognizing a loss of precision. The exception to this strategy will be when considerable data (i.e., &#x0003e;15&#x000a0;%) are missing on a particular covariate that is judged to be critical for inclusion in the analysis. In this instance, imputation by unconditional or conditional mean imputation will be used; these simple approaches perform well when the overall percentage of missing data is low. In rare instances when the percentage of missing data is not low (i.e., &#x0003e;15&#x000a0;%), more sophisticated multiple imputation methods may be employed.

The next phase, which will follow this study, would involve the development of several projects aimed at exploring the mechanisms underlying the successful vs. non-successful adaptation of veterans to everyday life and routes for transferring the ongoing delivery of intervention to the daily routine of community-dwelling veterans with TBI.</p><p>The study will prepare the field of creating supportive care environments for necessary future studies on the utilization of best clinical practice guidelines for the everyday life of veterans and their families. Clinical and applied research will concentrate on the utility of goal self-management interventions in routine care in both home and institutional settings, such as VA hospitals and community centers. These studies will also examine the cost benefits of this approach, which are expected to be substantial because the approach will lessen the time health service providers (e.g., TBI case managers or TBI social workers) must devote to their clients. In the basic research venue, studies need to explore the links between neuroanatomical structure, executive function, and everyday problem-solving in the context of psychosocial interventional research. This research would not only help improve the quality of life for veterans with TBI and other neurological deficits but also have important social benefits, such as training relatives and immediate caregivers on how to engage their loved ones in meaningful, healthy, and productive activities. The methodology proposed could be utilized with technology-based and other non-pharmacological interventions to better understand the needs and preferences of different clinical populations with chronic illnesses, or physical, cognitive, and behavioral disabilities (i.e., persons with PTSD, substance abuse, disturbing behaviors, and suicidal ideation). This particular extension may elucidate the commonalities and differences among various clinical groups and provide additional tools to improve the individual care of returning veterans.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>B-IPF</term><def><p>Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSI-18</term><def><p>Brief Symptom Inventory-18</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDE</term><def><p>common data elements</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNS</term><def><p>central nervous system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COMPASS<sup>goal</sup></term><def><p>Community Participation through Self-Efficacy Skills Development</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COWAT</term><def><p>Controlled Oral World Association Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRIS</term><def><p>Community Reintegration of Service Members</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DC VAMC</term><def><p>Washington DC VA Medical Center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EFPT</term><def><p>Executive Function Performance Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EFS</term><def><p>executive functional system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FrSBe</term><def><p>Frontal Systems Behavior Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GEE</term><def><p>generalized estimating equation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICF</term><def><p>International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIPAA</term><def><p>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p>Institutional Review Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LIS</term><def><p>Libin Verbal-Pictorial Association Standardized Personality Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LMM</term><def><p>linear mixed model</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>M2PI</term><def><p>Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory &#x02013; 4, Participation Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MANCOVA</term><def><p>multivariate analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MEME</term><def><p>multi-level model</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>M.I.N.I.</term><def><p>M.I.N.I.
