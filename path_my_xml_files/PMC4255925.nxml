Diabetic macular oedema (DMO), characterised by leakage of fluid from compromised blood vessels in the central retina, is the most frequent cause of visual impairment in people with diabetes. DMO may be central or non-central oedema. Non-central oedema does not usually affect visual acuity. When it affects the central 1&#x000a0;mm of the macula, it causes visual impairment. Over 30% of eyes with untreated centre-involving macular oedema lose 3 or more lines of vision by 5&#x000a0;years
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Patients with non-central DMO are monitored with slit-lamp biomicroscopy and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) every 4 to 6&#x000a0;months for progression to centre-involving DMO. SD-OCT provides information on the changes in the retinal thickness and morphology of the retina due to DMO. Approximately 30% of these patients progress to centre-involving macular oedema by 12&#x000a0;months
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Treatment is available only when the DMO becomes clinically significant or shows progression to the centre. Laser treatment is the standard of care when the DMO becomes clinically significant. Although laser treatment reduces the risk of moderate visual loss by 50% at this stage, it is not effective in restoring visual acuity and has significant side effects that impact on the quality of life of these people
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Newer treatment options of injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors are also available but only for centre-involving DMO. These treatments are costly and cause significant burden to the patient, their caregivers and the healthcare system
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>There are no treatment options for non-clinically significant DMO except optimal control of diabetes and hypertension. Laser photocoagulation may be performed for non-central clinically significant macular oedema. The natural history of the disease is to progress from non-central to centre-involving DMO
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, there is a substantial unmet need for both treatment and prevention of progression of non-centre-involving DMO.</p><p>The exact pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy and DMO is uncertain. The rationale for this study is that increased glucose is associated in various ways with a decrease in oxygen supply to the retina, and an increase in oxygen demand
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This leads to increased hypoxia, and an overproduction of VEGF, which damages the circulation, and in doing so will further decrease retinal oxygen supply in a vicious circle. Only at such a stage will all the other known mechanisms that contribute to retinal vascular damage operate and contribute to the various clinical features of diabetic retinopathy. Rods use more oxygen than any other cell in the body
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Oxygen is required to support the extreme sensitivity to light that develops during dark-adaptation. As a result, the oxygen tension in the mitochondrial region of the rods in darkness falls to zero. The exact mechanism is that in darkness the rod outer segment membrane becomes extremely permeable to ions and water, which enter the cell and are pumped out in the inner segment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The resulting &#x02018;dark current&#x02019; is large and requires all the oxygen available in the normal eye
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. If retinal circulation is compromised in any way, the hypoxia present in the outer retina increases and spreads into the inner part.</p><p>Arden hypothesized that if dark-adaptation was prevented, the rod dark current would never become maximal and diabetic retinopathy would be alleviated by decreasing the oxygen demand
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Since people only dark-adapt at night during sleep, sleeping in an illuminated environment should prevent or reverse the condition. In clinical trials it is important to provide uniform illumination to each patient, so we have made &#x02018;light-masks&#x02019; containing organic light emitting diodes to illuminate the closed eyelids during sleep. Sufficient low intensity light is transmitted by the lids to reduce the dark current allowing the quantity of light can be measured. It is also important that the masks are comfortable to wear and do not disturb sleep.</p><p>The relationship of these SD-OCT changes in retinal morphology and thickness to hypoxia has not been determined. Similarly, the relation of the visual function to hypoxia also remains unclear. This is the subject of the mechanistic investigation.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of the study is to explore whether wearing light-masks during sleep at night reduces, relative to the control masks, the maximal zone macular thickness at baseline as measured by SD-OCT in the study eye of patients with non-centre-involving DMO at 24&#x000a0;months.</p><p>Secondary objectives include whether the effect of light-masks, relative to control masks, can prevent the progression of non-centre-involving DMO by assessing the changes in retinal thickness in each region of the macula, macular volume, macular morphology, retinopathy status, visual acuity and proportion of patients requiring rescue laser or anti-VEGF treatment at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months. The safety and tolerability of the masks will be assessed and will include measures of compliance and questionnaires to assess the effect of the masks on sleep.</p><p>The mechanistic evaluation will explore and compare the changes in retinal function induced by supplemental oxygen and light-mask on multifocal ERG (inner retina) and scotopic microperimetry (outer retina) at 12&#x000a0;months. The changes in oxygen saturation in the retinal vessels will be assessed by retinal oximetry using the Oxymap T1 Retinal Oximeter (Oxymap Analyzer v.2.4.2, Reykjavik, Iceland</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a phase III randomised controlled single-masked clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of light-masks in treating and preventing the progression of non-centre-involving DMO. Three hundred patients with non-centre-involving DMO in at least one eye will be randomised 1:1 to light-masks and control masks (with no light) to be used during sleep at night for a period of 24&#x000a0;months. This basic study design and the associated clinical measurements are well-established, having been successfully used in numerous previous clinical trials of DMO.

The light-mask comes in two parts, a fabric mask and a light emitting unit, or &#x02018;Pod&#x02019;. When worn, the Pod is inserted into the fabric mask and placed over the patient&#x02019;s eyes and attached using an adjustable Velcro strap. The Pod contains two Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs), which will be located over the eyes of the patent when the light-mask is being worn. The fabric mask is made of nylon, polyurethane and polyester. These materials are non-toxic and are commonly used in a wide variety of skin-contacting apparel. The Pod is made from medical grade low-density polyethylene, which has been tested and passed the relevant physiochemical and <italic>in vivo</italic> biological reactivity tests required for the USP &#x0003c; 88&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;Class VI requirements. The Pod and fabric mask have been designed to be thin and flexible and contoured to compliment the face and improve comfort for the wearer.</p><p>The OLEDs are powered by two 3&#x000a0;V (CR2450) batteries which power the device without the need for an external power source or recharging. At the end of the mask&#x02019;s lifetime a replacement light-mask is required. A new fabric mask will be provided with each mask to minimise contamination resulting from continued use. The mask is time, date and touch sensitive. The mask will only &#x02018;work&#x02019; between pre-determined operational windows - typically 8&#x000a0;pm to 10&#x000a0;am during the light-mask&#x02019;s lifetime. Within these times the mask can be activated by a light touch. If worn within 3&#x000a0;minutes of activation, sensors on the Pod will keep the mask illuminated for the night&#x02019;s therapy. The times for which the mask is worn will be logged for compliance analysis. The light-mask has CE certification as a Class 2a device and its design and manufacture meet the standards of ISO13485.</p><p>The design must permit the mask to be worn by people with different head shapes and deliver rod excitation efficiently. The spectral output is important and should be matched as closely as possible to the response spectrum of the rod cells. This has been tested in two clinical trials. The first was a proof of concept study, in which 12 patients slept in a mask containing a chemoluminescent source which exposed one eye only to light. The trial lasted 3&#x000a0;months. All found the masks comfortable and the method of treatment acceptable. There were no reports of adverse effects. Measurements of colour contrast sensitivity and examination of standard fundus photographs showed that in the ten for whom complete records were available, colour vision improved and the area of retina covered by microaneurysms and small dot haemorrhages decreased. These results were significant even though the trial was very short and the numbers treated were so few
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>A second study was carried out using electronic sources of light - blue-green light emitting diodes (LEDs) to illuminate one eye. The electrical power of the system was &#x0003c; 3&#x000a0;mW. Forty patients were recruited and follow-up visits were at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months. All patients had early DMO in one eye and the other eye was used as control. A total of 34 (85%) out of 40 patients completed the study. Twenty-eight study eyes showed intraretinal cysts compared with nine in the fellow eyes. At 6&#x000a0;months, only 19 study eyes had cysts while cysts were seen in 20 fellow eyes. The zone of maximum thickness showed a reduction of retinal thickness by 12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m (95% CI 3 to 21, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01). The secondary outcomes of change in visual acuity, achromatic contrast sensitivity, and microperimetric thresholds improved significantly in study eyes and deteriorated in fellow eyes

<disp-formula id="Equa"><graphic xlink:href="13063_2014_2325_Equa_HTML.gif" position="anchor"/></disp-formula></p><p>This is well below toxic levels of luminosity but of sufficient scotopic intensity to prevent dark-adaption. Emission below 470&#x000a0;nm is less than 3% of total output posing little or no risk of harm.</p><p>Every mask is capable of recording precisely when and for how long it has been used, thus providing a very accurate measure of compliance. Each mask will have a predetermined lifetime and will need returning and replacing when this time expires. On the return of each mask the compliance data can be downloaded and analysed. Patients will receive phone reminders and/or counselling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Control masks</title><p>The control masks will consist of the CE marked device with all internal electronics and functionality removed and it is worn in the same way as the CE marked device.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Blinding</title><p>Control participants will be provided with identical dummy masks with no active light. However, it is likely that patients in the control arm may not wear these masks without illumination for a period of two years as they are not masked to treatment allocation but all efforts will be taken to ensure compliance. Primary outcome assessors (optometrists and SD-OCT technicians) will remain masked to treatment allocation. The optometrists are the visual acuity examiners and OCT technicians do the SD-OCT scans at all visits and both will be masked to the participant study arm. The visual acuity examiners will receive the participants into the visual acuity lanes with a visual acuity case report form, study number and detail of study eye and non-study eye to be refracted, but with no previous subject records or case report forms by which the subject treatment arm could be identified. Similarly, the SD-OCT technicians will receive the subjects into the SD-OCT room on a specific case report form that provides details of subject study number and eye to be examined. The subjects will be advised at enrolment that they must not discuss the study arm they are in with the SD-OCT or Visual Acuity examiner. The retinal photographs will be graded by masked graders in the independent Reading Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital. This will avoid performance and detection bias. We will describe the completeness of outcome data for each outcome, including reasons for attrition and exclusions from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Safety concerns</title><p>All adverse events and side effects will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) throughout the study regardless of their severity or relation to study participation. The light-masks are CE marked but the definitions of adverse events related to a non-CE marked device will be used to classify and report the adverse events in this study. No serious adverse events (SAEs) are expected. The PI will submit an annual report of all SAEs (expected and unexpected) to the Sponsor, and the Research Ethics Committee. The Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) will be provided with listings of all SAEs on an on-going basis. The study may be prematurely discontinued on the basis of new safety information, or for other reasons given by the DMEC and/or Trial Steering Committee (TSC), Sponsor, or Research Ethics Committee concerned. Following 6&#x000a0;months of recruitment, initial rates of recruitment will be used to project total recruitment to ensure sufficient participants to power the study. The TSC will advise on whether to continue or discontinue the study and make a recommendation to the Sponsor. If the study is prematurely discontinued, active participants will be informed and no further participant data will be collected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary efficacy measure is the difference between arms in the change from baseline in absolute retinal thickness at the zone of maximum thickness as determined by OCT at 24&#x000a0;months.</p><p>The secondary efficacy parameters at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months are:</p><p>Efficacy parameters:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>I.</label><p>Difference between arms in the change from baseline in absolute thickness at the zone of maximum thickness as determined by OCT at 12&#x000a0;months.</p></list-item><list-item><label>II.</label><p>Other measures include: <list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Difference between arms in the change in retinal thickness in the 9 ETDRS zones (parafoveal zones 2-5 and perifoveal zones 6-9) and macular volume.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Difference between arm in morphological characteristics of macular thickness</p></list-item><list-item><p>Difference between arms in the mean change in visual acuity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Difference between arms in the proportion of centre-involving macular oedema within 24&#x000a0;months.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Difference between arms in the time to occurrence of centre-involving macular oedema.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Difference between arms in the proportion requiring macular laser or antiVEGF treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Difference between arms in the proportion of participants that show progression of retinopathy as measured by the ETDRS severity levels and microaneurysm turnover.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Compliance rates in the light mask arm.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p><p>II.

All baseline and follow-up data will be entered on the online InferMed MACRO electronic data capture (EDC) system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.infermed.com">http://www.infermed.com</ext-link>). This system is regulatory compliant (Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the EC Clinical Trial Directive). An eCRF using the MACRO EDC will be programmed by KCTU in collaboration with the Trial Manager, and Trial Statistician and hosted on a dedicated secure server within King&#x02019;s College London. The eCRF system will have full audit trail, data discrepancy functionality, database lock functionality, and supports real time data cleaning and reporting.</p><p>The KCTU will provide training, essential documentation, and user support to the study centres, and on-site audit and monitoring. A detailed Standard Operating Procedure will cover data recording, online entry, checking, central backup and storage. A regularly updated coding manual will be developed to accompany the study database. Each authorised research worker and PI at each centre will have a unique username and password provided by the KCTU for the eCRF. The Trial Manager will provide usernames and passwords to any new researchers. Only those authorised by the Trial Manager will be able to use the system.</p><p>Baseline data will be collected and entered by researchers in each study site prior to randomisation. Each participant will be assigned a unique trial identification number at the start of the assessment process. This number will be written on all clinical assessment forms, datasheets and databases used to record participant data. Trial data will be first entered on to paper source datasheets provided to each centre during the preparation phase. The datasheets will be immediately checked for completeness and accuracy. If data queries arise, these will be logged and followed up locally before data are entered online. A hard copy of a record sheet linking patient identity, contact details and trial ID number for all participants will be kept at each site. All data will be kept secure at all times and maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act and archived locally according to clinical trial GCP regulations and the host institutions additional procedures.</p><p>The study incorporates a range of data management quality assurance functions. After written recording, each research worker will transcribe data onto the eCRF within one working week of a participant assessment. After completion of all follow-ups and prompt entry of data, the Trial Manager will review the data and issue queries to be answered by the research worker. At the end of the trial, the centre PI will review all the data for each participant and provide electronic sign-off to verify that all the data are complete and correct. At this point, all data will be formally locked for analysis. At the end of the trial, each centre will be supplied with a CD-ROM containing the eCRF data for their centre. This will be filed locally for any future regulatory or internal audit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary outcome will be analysed using a two-sided test from a linear mixed effect model for repeated measures across visits, which will enable a comparison between participants receiving light-masks (active) and control masks, with covariates for each follow-up visit of baseline, randomisation stratifier and arm, and with a random participant effect at each visit with unstructured covariance matrix. The primary time-point will be 24&#x000a0;months. The 20% allowance for dropout (trial withdrawal) is based on 18% early non-compliance observed in the pilot study and we would expect a reasonable proportion of non-compliers to provide primary time-point and intermediate visit outcome information for this analysis.</p><p>We expect the DMEC would want to monitor study power and we would regularly provide information such as non-compliance, withdrawal, and variability of the primary outcome with increasing certainty as increasing proportions of the participants pass each of the 4-monthly measurement points.</p><p>The detailed statistical analysis plan will include an additional sensitivity analysis involving all randomised participants (intention to treat strategy) examining the influence on the primary outcome analysis of opposing optimistic and pessimistic scenarios for the intervention effect in those withdrawing in each arm. We will adopt the complier average causal effects (CACE) analysis (under a missing at random assumption) as recommended and outlined by Dunn <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Linear mixed effect models for repeated measures (as specified above for the primary outcome), logistic regression, and stratified Cox regression, will also be undertaken to analyse secondary and mechanistic outcomes of continuous, binary and time to occurrence type respectively. Differences will be considered significant at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. Differences between the groups will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals. Repeated measure analyses (linear mixed effects models) will be used to document trends over time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>With 300 patients (150 in each arm), we anticipate 240 to be followed up (20% dropout). This is sufficient to provide 90% power to detect 15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in mean change of retinal thickness at the zone of maximal thickness between arms using a 2-sided test, adjusting for baseline, at the 5% level of significance, assuming a standard deviation of 35.7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m. The chosen detectable effect size (retinal thickness of 15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) is both plausible, in terms of being consistent with a confidence interval estimate for this intervention in preceding research (Ruboxistaurin trial protocol: B7A-MC-MBCU), and also minimally detectable in terms of being distinguishable from test-retest variation [25]. Detectable effect sizes for secondary outcomes based on 240 followed up (for 90% power with 5% significance level) would be a between-arm difference in mean outcome of a size that is equivalent to 0.42 of a standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Ethical issues</title><p>The conduct of this study will be in accordance with the recommendations for physicians involved in research on human subjects adopted by the 18th World Medical Assembly, Helsinki 1964 and later revisions. This protocol and related documents have been approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee London - Dulwich. Local approval will be sought before recruitment may commence at the site. The Study Coordination Centre will require a written copy of local approval documentation before initiating each centre and accepting participants into the study.</p><p>The main ethical issues in relation to this study are the use of the light-masks. There are three visits that the participants need to undergo in excess of standard of care. Standard care of laser or anti-VEGF injections will be given to all those who require it. The precise risks and benefits of participating in the study will be outlined in patient information sheets, to be formulated with service user involvement.</p><p>The patients who participate in the mechanistic tests have to undergo non-invasive tests of oximetry, multifocal ERG and microperimetry. There are no known risks with these tests.</p><p>All participants will be made aware of the results of the study. If the study successfully establishes efficacy, the participants will be informed that these light-masks can be purchased but will not automatically be available in the National Health Service (NHS), though the treatment will be submitted for technology appraisal by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) if deemed appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Time frame</title><p>We will recruit patients over 12&#x000a0;months and each participant will be followed up over 24&#x000a0;months. The total study period is 42&#x000a0;months.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial is essential to confirm the role of hypoxia in the pathogenesis of DMO. The importance of publishing this extensive protocol is that it addresses a novel approach to the management of non-central DMO. If proven efficacious and safe, a light-mask is a simple non-invasive device that can help prevent the most common cause of blindness during working life that is now being managed by treatment options that have high direct and indirect costs to individuals and to the state.</p><p>Recent trials on the treatment of DMO have all focussed on centre-involving DMO and do not relate to any questions about prophylactic treatment. The prevention of any damage is obviously desirable and would lead to considerable savings in treatment costs. Additionally light-masks are simple devices, suitable for home use, and could be provided even in remote areas where there is no electricity supply. The benefit to those who cannot obtain, or pay for, present high-technology treatments is immense.</p><p>The strengths of the study are an appropriate design and sample size and to achieve measureable outcomes. The study is based on two proof-of-concept studies. The control arm will provide new information on the natural history of non-centre-involving DMO monitored using SD-OCT over 24&#x000a0;months. This study on light-masks is the first of its kind in the world. The limitation of the study is the inability to design a double-masked study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial has started recruiting.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>BP</term><def><p>blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HbA1c</term><def><p>glycated haemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD-OCT</term><def><p>spectral domain - optical coherence tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mfERG</term><def><p>multifocal electroretinogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ETDRS</term><def><p>Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMEC</term><def><p>DataMmanagement Ethic Committee KCTU</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSC</term><def><p>Trial Steering Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OLED</term><def><p>Organic Light Emitting Diode</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMO</term><def><p>Diabetic Macular Oedema</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KHP</term><def><p>King&#x02019;s Health Partners.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SS: grant holder, Chief Investigator, design and conduct of study, wrote the protocol and manuscript; PH: co-lead investigator, design and conduct of study, CM and JK: study design, CRF design, conduct of study; HH: study conduct and management; TP and JV: statistical input, study design, statistical analysis plan; RCN, GR and GA: mechanistic evaluation.
