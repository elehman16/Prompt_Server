Current general understanding among both clinicians working in the field and within the research community is that surgical exposure of the implants and removal of the granulation tissue seem to be necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A surgical strategy with or without bone recontouring to accomplish pocket elimination to optimize infection control seems to work in many cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">In some selected cases with peri-implant bone loss, it may be considered to reconstruct the lost osseous lesion. The current scientific evidence available in the literature for the efficacy of reconstructive and surgical strategies in treating peri-implantitis is, however, limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Porous titanium granules (PTGs, Natix&#x000ae;, Tigran Technologies AB, Malm&#x000f6;, Sweden) were initially used in orthopaedics for stabilization of hip prostheses to enhance bone regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Regarding oral and maxillofacial surgery, PTG was introduced as a bone graft substitute for use in sinus lifts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">A porous titanium granule is 700&#x02013;1000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in diameter.

No clinical differences between groups were found after 12&#x000a0;months, but a better defect fill was seen on radiographs in the PTG group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

In brief, 32 subjects diagnosed with peri-implantitis, fulfilling the inclusion criteria of having an implant demonstrating an intrabony component &#x02265;&#x02009;4&#x000a0;mm, probing pocket depth (PPD) of at least 5&#x000a0;mm at one site with bleeding on probing (BoP) and/or suppuration were included, randomized to either the case or control group, treated accordingly and followed for 12&#x000a0;months. The prosthetic supraconstruction was removed and evaluated with respect to occlusal adjustments; in some cases, renewal was performed. Access for oral hygiene was evaluated and corrected if necessary. After the oral hygiene phase and any necessary active periodontal treatment, the study participants received surgical therapy. Sixteen individuals were randomly assigned to the case group and received reconstructive treatment of one implant each with PTG additional to surgical open flap mechanical and chemical debridement with titanium curettes and EDTA gel (PrefGel, Straumann Inc., Basel, Switzerland). The other 16 individuals were treated with open flap debridement alone. Implants were submerged for 6&#x000a0;months; thereafter, the prosthetic supraconstructions were repositioned. Results from the evaluation at 12&#x000a0;months were presented in a publication by Wohlfahrt et al. in 2012. Thereafter, the patients were discharged from the university clinic and maintenance, and follow-ups were handled by the referring dentists.</p><p id="Par23">After 7&#x000a0;years (7.3&#x000a0;years [6.7&#x02013;8]), all patients who completed the original study were invited for a re-examination.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par53">The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term clinical and radiographic results from a study on peri-implant osseous defect reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Minimal differences were observed when comparing the two groups at baseline, 12-month and the 7-year examinations, but the power to detect a true difference at the 7-year examination was small due to the low number of patients finally re-examined.</p><p id="Par55">Most of the implants had a deeper radiographic defect depth after 7&#x000a0;years compared to the 12-month examination, and minimal differences were seen when comparing with baseline measurements. It is therefore important to consider the original osseous defect depth around treated implants when aiming to diagnose stable peri-implant conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, three of the implants in the test group had lost all bony attachment and had been explanted. However based on the evaluation presented here, it was not possible to clarify if differences in patient-related factors such as the original defect depth or treatment modality were causative for this outcome.</p><p id="Par56">Few studies report long-term results after treatment of peri-implantitis. In this context, it is important to remember that the only true end point for such therapies will be the loss of implants, but most studies solely report clinical and subclinical parameters which are only surrogate markers for the disease state and true result of the performed therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">In a meta-analysis by Khoskham et al., they report a mean radiographic defect fill of 2.41&#x000a0;mm after regenerative treatment of peri-implant osseous defects and a minimum healing time of 36&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">Recently, Schwarz et al. reported on a 7-year follow-up on a peri-implantitis surgical treatment procedure including access flap surgery, granulation tissue removal and implantoplasty combined with two different decontamination protocols and a regenerative procedure including a natural bone mineral and GTR with a collagen membrane. These authors reported clinical attachment level gains between 2.06 and 2.76&#x000a0;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Mean PPD values, at the deepest site per implant, were reduced in both groups during the study period. This finding is in agreement with other studies evaluating long-term outcome of surgical peri-implantitis treatment and peri-implant defect reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">One implant in the PTG group, with initial, severe bone loss had a progressive radiographic bone defect after 7&#x000a0;years compared to baseline. The PPD registered at this site did, however, not reflect the radiographic defect depth measured, probably due to heavy calculus deposits on the implant body, which potentially may have hindered a correct probing.</p><p id="Par61">Due to the removal of the prosthetic supraconstruction, access for the clinical examinations was easy at all implants. A pressure sensitive power probe was used. This resulted in minimal traumatizing of the tissue. Half of the treated implants were identified with good plaque control, which is essential for a favourable outcome.</p><p id="Par62">In a study, the prognostic value of BoP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] was evaluated related to peri-implant mucosal tissue conditions during supportive periodontal therapy. Disease progression was identified when any site bled at more than half of the recall visits over a period of 2&#x000a0;years. The positive predictive value for disease progression was 100% when BoP was recorded at more than 50% of recall visits. BoP was a common finding at the 7-year evaluation, and it may well be that the patients should have been followed even closer after the surgeries, and it is clearly shown that regular maintenance care is a crucial factor for lowering the risk of developing peri-implantitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">A strict maintenance program every 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months followed by a high standard of oral hygiene may hold a stable peri-implant condition after peri-implantitis surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">In the present study, access to perform sufficient plaque control at the treated implants was considered acceptable due to previous corrections of the prostheses. The frequency of supportive periodontal care (SPT) was reported to be between 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. Based on BoP recordings, this may not have been a sufficient regime for many of the patients in this cohort.</p><p id="Par65">The patients&#x02019; general health, oral hygiene habits and compliance to the maintenance program may also affect the treatment outcome. Smoking may be a negative factor regarding complications following implant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the present study, most participants were smokers or former smokers and had a history of periodontitis. No difference was noted in the number of implants with progressive bone loss versus stable conditions or between smokers and former smoker/non-smokers. This may be due to the small sample size.</p><p id="Par66">In a study by Leonhardt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], nine subjects with a history of periodontitis had 26 implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis. During the 5-year follow-up after treatment, smokers with severe peri-implantitis had a less favourable treatment outcome. Another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] reported no difference in result between smokers and non-smokers after 2&#x000a0;years of follow-up.</p><p id="Par67">Radiographic bone level changes for assessing the implant&#x02019;s stability or progression of disease following treatment is used in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A composite outcome regarding resolution of peri-implantitis was recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">The limitations regarding the non-standardized radiographs at the final examinations in the present study imply that results must be interpreted with care. Also, the radiopaque PTG granules were easily seen, and thereby, the cases were easily distinguished from the controls.</p><p id="Par69">It has been stated that regenerative procedures do not address disease resolution but aim to fill the osseous defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Bone grafts of various materials have been used. This has classically been divided into autogenous, allogenic, xenogenic and synthetic or alloplastic materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par70">The present study used a non-resorbable, alloplastic material (PTG) in intra-osseous defects as a reconstructed material. This technique attempts to fill the osseous defect and not solve the disease. With regard to defect fill, it is very important to keep in mind that a non-resorbable graft material such as PTG will be left unresorbed. In this study, PTG graft particles were easily seen on radiographs 7&#x000a0;years after therapy. Many of the particles were however scattered in the tissues around the defect. Due to the radiopaque appearance of PTG, they were easily recognized. One must in this context remember that other non-resorbable bone substitutes may also have a similar outcome but will not be as easily found and thus mistakenly considered resorbed.</p><p id="Par71">Comparing the radiographs after 7&#x000a0;years, the extent of granules left in the osseous defects had a great variety, and two cases provided extensive loss of material. This may be explained by defect configuration, recognized at the time of surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The inclusion of one to two walled defects may explain the absence of PTG at some sites. The PTG granules in the osseous defects may not have been well integrated with the bone, or some granules were left encapsulated in the connective tissue. Smoking habits may also have affected the reconstructive treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] due to the participants who were smokers or former smokers.</p><p id="Par72">None of the included subjects reported an experience of adverse effects, such as pain, discoloration of the surrounding mucosa or loose particles in conjunction with the grafting material. This is in agreement with a multicentre trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par73">The clinical examination did not reveal any differences between the reconstructed versus non-reconstructed osseous defects related to signs of inflammation or plaque accumulations.</p><p id="Par74">The present study confirmed the results from the previous study by Wohlfahrt et al.
