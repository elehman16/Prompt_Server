The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of glycopyrrolate versus placebo in terms of forced expiratory volume in 1 second area under the curve between 0 and 12 hours post morning dose at week 12. Other outcomes included additional spirometric end points, transition dyspnea index, St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire, COPD Assessment Test, rescue medication use, and symptoms reported by patients via electronic diary. Safety was also assessed during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 441 patients randomized (glycopyrrolate, n=222; placebo, n=219), 96% of patients completed the planned treatment phase. Glycopyrrolate demonstrated statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) improvements in lung function versus placebo. Glycopyrrolate showed statistically significant improvement in the transition dyspnea index focal score, St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire total score, COPD Assessment Test score, rescue medication use, and daily total symptom score versus placebo at week 12. Safety was comparable between the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Significant improvement in lung function, dyspnea, COPD symptoms, health status, and rescue medication use suggests that glycopyrrolate is a safe and effective treatment option as maintenance bronchodilator in patients with stable, symptomatic COPD with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>glycopyrronium</kwd><kwd>glycopyrrolate</kwd><kwd>lung function</kwd><kwd>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd>long-acting muscarinic antagonist</kwd><kwd>bronchodilator</kwd><kwd>twice daily</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major chronic respiratory disease that currently affects more than 400 million people and is one of the major causes of poor health and death worldwide.<xref rid="b1-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> As per the survey conducted in 2010, in the United States, COPD affects nearly 27 million individuals (14.8 million diagnosed and an estimated 12 million undiagnosed). The prevalence of COPD is lower among those aged 18&#x02013;44 years (3.2%) than those aged 45&#x02013;64 years (6.4%) and &#x02265;65 years (9.8%).<xref rid="b2-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> COPD is characterized by partially reversible airflow limitation, which is usually progressive and debilitating in nature. Airflow limitation in patients with COPD causes breathlessness, which ultimately affects the quality of life.<xref rid="b3-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The current GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) strategy recommends focusing on improvement in health status, in addition to bronchodilation, as a therapeutic goal of symptomatic management in patients with COPD of different severities.<xref rid="b4-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) are well placed in the current GOLD strategy and recommended for the management of COPD, either alone or in combination with long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists (LABA) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for patients at high risk of exacerbations.<xref rid="b4-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Glycopyrrolate, also known as glycopyrronium bromide, is an inhaled LAMA, developed for maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients with COPD.<xref rid="b5-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The bronchodilatory effect of glycopyrrolate results from blockade of muscarinic M<sub>3</sub> receptor, inhibiting parasympathetically mediated bronchoconstriction and indirectly inducing bronchodilation. Increase in the airway tone is exerted by activation of M<sub>3</sub> muscarinic cholinergic receptors, whereas their blockade improves lung function, dyspnea, and health-related quality of life in patients with COPD.<xref rid="b6-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Glycopyrrolate 63 &#x000b5;g (equivalent to glycopyrronium 50 &#x000b5;g) administered once daily in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD provides significant improvement in lung function, breathlessness, health status, and reduction in rescue medication use versus placebo, with a comparable safety profile.<xref rid="b7-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The efficacy and safety of glycopyrronium, once daily, has been shown to be comparable to tiotropium.<xref rid="b8-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> It is approved for maintenance bronchodilator treatment in adult patients with COPD in more than 80 countries, including countries within the EU and Latin America, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, and Australia.</p><p>In the US, a separate Phase III clinical trial program was developed with glycopyrrolate 15.6 &#x000b5;g administered twice daily. A dose-ranging study demonstrated that glycopyrrolate 15.6 &#x000b5;g (equivalent to 12.5 &#x000b5;g glycopyrronium), twice daily (bid), also resulted in statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) versus placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.<xref rid="b10-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In addition, the study also showed that for total daily doses in the range of 25&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;g, compared to once daily dosing, mean trough FEV<sub>1</sub> dose&#x02013;response curves favored the twice-daily regimen. On the basis of this data, the US Food and Drug Administration considered glycopyrrolate 15.6 &#x000b5;g bid as a suitable dose to progress to Phase III studies in the US.

Adjudicated MACE were reported at a higher rate with placebo (2.3%) compared with glycopyrrolate (0.9%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-copd-11-1233">Table 3</xref>). Atrial fibrillation/flutter was reported in six patients (2.7%) in the glycopyrrolate group and three patients (1.4%) in the placebo group. Of these, new-onset atrial fibrillation/flutter occurred in two patients (0.9%) treated with glycopyrrolate and one patient (0.5%) treated with placebo. The proportion of patients with newly occurring or worsening clinically notable QTcF (Fridericia&#x02019;s corrected QT interval) values was similar between the treatment groups. One patient from each treatment group had QTcF values &#x0003e;480 ms. Laboratory parameters and clinically notable vital sign findings were generally similar between the treatment groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>LAMAs either alone or in combination with LABA are now recommended as first choice for maintenance treatment of COPD. In this GEM1 clinical study in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, glycopyrrolate, a LAMA, monotherapy showed significant improvements in lung function, dyspnea, and health status over 12 weeks&#x02019; treatment versus placebo. The primary end point of superiority in terms of improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12 h</sub> with glycopyrrolate versus placebo at week 12 was met. Glycopyrrolate 15.6 &#x000b5;g bid showed a superior and clinically meaningful improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12 h</sub> at both day 1 and week 12, which supports its therapeutic efficacy in patients with COPD. This therapeutic efficacy is further supported by statistically and clinically significant improvements in all the lung function parameters assessed on day 1 and at week 12 versus placebo. The improvement in lung function in this study is in concordance with earlier GLOW1<xref rid="b7-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and GLOW2<xref rid="b9-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> studies where glycopyrronium 50 &#x000b5;g once daily showed an improvement of 108 and 97 mL in trough FEV<sub>1</sub>, respectively, at week 12 compared to 115 mL seen in this study. Glycopyrrolate 15.6 &#x000b5;g bid dose was selected for this study based on the findings of a dose-ranging study in which glycopyrrolate 15.6 &#x000b5;g bid showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> versus placebo in patients with COPD<xref rid="b10-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and was considered a reasonable dose for a twice-daily regimen following regulatory interactions for advancement to Phase III to support registration in the United States.</p><p>The goal of COPD management is to improve a patient&#x02019;s functional status and quality of life by maintaining the optimal lung function, improving symptoms and health status.<xref rid="b4-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Glycopyrronium 50 &#x000b5;g once daily has been shown to improve lung function in moderate-to-very-severe COPD patients who were predominantly Caucasians<xref rid="b7-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b9-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and also in a Chinese population.<xref rid="b13-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The overall results of this study are also in agreement with the earlier studies in terms of efficacy and safety parameters. Onset of action is an important criterion for choosing bronchodilators for patients requiring rapid bronchodilation, preferably in the morning. Patients with COPD struggle with the morning symptoms, particularly dyspnea and activity limitation.<xref rid="b14-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The onset of action of glycopyrrolate observed in this study (18.8 minutes on day 1) was comparable with that observed in other studies.<xref rid="b7-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Rapid-acting bronchodilators could be more effective than the relatively slow-onset bronchodilators in providing rapid relief of symptoms after morning dosing.<xref rid="b15-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition, prompt symptom relief could be a key factor in patient compliance; medication that does not have an immediate effect on symptoms might reduce the chance of a patient continuing with treatment.<xref rid="b16-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Hence, symptomatic patients could benefit more from glycopyrrolate therapy.</p><p>The current GOLD strategy classifies severity of COPD based on airflow limitation, symptoms, and rate of exacerbations.<xref rid="b4-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In this study, patients with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation (GOLD 2 and GOLD 3) were included. As per the current GOLD strategy, patients of both GOLD B (61.9%) and GOLD D (37.4%) groups were enrolled in this study. Glycopyrrolate showed improvement in lung function irrespective of disease severity. However, in patients with moderate COPD (GOLD 2), the improvement in lung function was more pronounced than in those with severe COPD (GOLD 3). Small sample size in GOLD 3 group limits interpretation of these findings. COPD is a progressive disease, and lung function deteriorates rapidly in patients with moderate COPD, if not treated.<xref rid="b17-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Prior to enrollment in this study, approximately 80% of all patients took COPD-related medications. Early treatment with a rapid-acting and sustained-duration long-acting bronchodilator such as glycopyrrolate can maintain optimal lung function.</p><p>Improvement in symptoms, in addition to bronchodilation, is also an important goal for effective management of COPD. In this study, glycopyrrolate significantly improved the SGRQ total score and the TDI focal score at week 12. Although there was &#x02265;4 unit improvement from baseline in the SGRQ total score (&#x02212;4.4 units) and &#x02265;1 unit improvement in the TDI focal score (1.46 units) in patients treated with glycopyrrolate, the treatment differences versus placebo did not reach the MCID. This might be due to improvement in change from baseline in SGRQ total score (&#x02212;1.7 units) and in TDI focal score (0.54 units) in placebo-treated patients. Similar unexpected improvement in the health status scores in placebo-treated patients was observed in another clinical trial conducted with a LAMA.<xref rid="b18-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This may be, in part, due to closer patient follow-up and monitoring during clinical study participation.</p><p>The proportion of patients who achieved the MCID in SGRQ total score and TDI focal score was higher with glycopyrrolate versus placebo in this study. Furthermore, (CAT, which was an exploratory objective in the study to evaluate the improvement in health status), glycopyrrolate showed significant improvement in the CAT score compared with placebo at week 12. The daily total symptom score was significantly improved, and rescue medication use was significantly reduced compared to baseline with glycopyrrolate versus placebo. Improvement in the symptom score with glycopyrrolate translated into an increase in the number of symptom free days for the patients where they were able to perform usual daily activities. These results support the therapeutic benefit of glycopyrrolate in improving health status and quality of life in patients with COPD.</p><p>In this study, the safety profile of glycopyrrolate was comparable to that of placebo. One death was reported during the study in the placebo group due to congestive heart failure. AEs were comparable between the groups, with COPD (including exacerbation) being the most frequently reported AE. The safety profile of glycopyrrolate was similar to that observed in other studies.<xref rid="b7-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-copd-11-1233" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> There were no new or unexpected safety findings in this study. Incidence of anticholinergic AEs such as dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary tract infections were comparable between the groups in this study. There was no imbalance in MACE between the treatment groups based on the adjudication of serious CCV AEs. Overall, the results of this study support the efficacy and safety of glycopyrrolate 15.6 &#x000b5;g bid as an additional dosage regimen for glycopyrrolate in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.</p><p>Some of the study limitations are the duration of study (12 weeks) and sample size, which limit the power to perform analysis on some endpoints such as exacerbations and patient-reported outcomes. Another limitation was that no active comparator was included in this study. Hence, long-term studies and studies with active comparators would be needed to assess the long-term safety of glycopyrrolate 15.6 &#x000b5;g twice daily and to assess its safety and efficacy compared to other LAMAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The early onset of bronchodilation and the sustained bronchodilatory effect of glycopyrrolate demonstrated in this study provides evidence of its therapeutic efficacy, with a safety profile comparable to placebo. The efficacy and safety profile of glycopyrrolate 15.6 &#x000b5;g twice daily are generally similar with that observed with glycopyrronium 50 &#x000b5;g once daily in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Improvement in symptoms and health status with glycopyrrolate is consistent with the current GOLD focus in terms of management of patients with COPD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Novartis Pharma AG.
