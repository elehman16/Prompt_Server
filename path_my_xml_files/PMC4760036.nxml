The idea of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is to anesthetize part of &#x02014; or the entire &#x02014; abdominal wall instead of using intrathecal or epidural techniques. Since the first description of the TAP block technique, this block has been increasingly used to provide somatic anesthesia of the antero-lateral abdominal wall.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Hebbard <italic>et al</italic>. described the US-guided continuous oblique subcostal TAP block.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Each can be done as a single shot or continuous catheter infusion technique, as well a combination of one or more can be done on a single side or both hemi-abdomens. The bilateral dual TAP (BD-TAP) block based on four single shot injections, aiming to anesthetize the entire abdominal wall.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The four injections of BD-TAP are; the epigastric area just below the xiphoid process medially to the costal curvature (subcostal) block, and the lateral classic TAP block in the lower abdomen on both hemi-abdomens. In our study, we replaced the subcostal TAP block by rectus sheath (RS) block. The central portion of the anterior abdominal wall is innervated by the ventral branches of the thoracolumbar nerves (Th6-L1). The ventral branches lie deep to the RA muscle but ventral to the posterior RS. The RS block has been utilized to provide analgesia for midline incisions and laparoscopic procedures.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] RS block may also be effective in reducing postoperative pain in upper abdominal surgery as an alternative method of epidural analgesia in anticoagulated patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Therefore, in our study, we combined RS and TAP blocks for possible better perioperative analgesia in upper abdominal surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>After Local Medical Ethics Review Board approval, 40 patients scheduled for major upper abdominal surgery were enrolled in this study. This is a prospective; observer-blinded, randomized clinical study, conducted at King Fahd Specialist Hospital. Eligible patients were recruited after getting written, informed consents. Patients were excluded if they had any contraindication for RS or TAP blocks, any known allergy for bupivacaine, physical or mental conditions which may vague measuring postoperative pain following surgery. Patients with morbid obesity (body mass index &#x02265;40) were also excluded. Patients were randomized allocated into one of the two groups; block group (group 1) or local infiltration group (group 2). All patients received a standardized anesthetic technique for induction with 100-200 mcg fentanyl, 2-3 mg/kg propofol, and 0.15 mg/kg cisatracurium. Maintenance was achieved with oxygen/air sevoflurane, and intraoperative titration of intravenous (IV) fentanyl. Group 1 received preincisional ultrasound (US)-guided Bilateral RS and TAP blocks using 20-ml volume of bupivacaine 0.25% for each, and group 2 received local wound infiltration of 40 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% at end of surgery. Preincisional US-guided RS and TAP blocks were done by one of the authors with significant previous experience in US-guided techniques and after that not involved in the collection of the studied data. The surgeon and operating room staff (anesthesiologists and nurses) were not blinded to the treatment group. However, the patient and family, recovery room nurses, and study coordinator who collected the data were blinded. After aseptic preparation of the injection sites, a US transducer (linear 6-13 MHz, SonoSite M-Turbo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Brothell, WA) (covered with sterile sheath) was used. A 22-gauge 10 mm insulated needle (Stimuplex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> A, B-Braun Medical, Melsungen, Germany) is inserted in-plane to the transducer in a medial to lateral direction with the endpoint in the fascial plane between the rectus muscle and posterior RS or between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles (TAP block). After negative aspiration, 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% was injected. The spread of the injectate should be observed to be distributed within these planes. The type of skin incisions included extended right subcostal incision which is appropriate for different operations on the liver, gallbladder and biliary tract and transverse incision for pancreatic surgery as Whipple's procedure, total pancreatectomy, and distal pancreatectomy. Antiemetic regimen consisted of 8 mg dexamethasone (IV) administered at induction and 4 mg ondansetron (IV) administered at the completion of surgery. All patients were managed in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) where, 2 mg boluses of IV morphine were given if needed every 5 min if pain score was equal or more than 5, with maximum dose of 10 mg. In ward, postoperative analgesic regimen composed of six hourly IV paracetamol (1 g) and patient-controlled analgesia morphine delivering a bolus of 1 mg, 6-min lockout, and maximum 4 h dose limit of 25 mg. The use of intraoperative fentanyl, PACU morphine boluses, and number of patients&#x02019; experienced postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), as well as pain scores at 6 and 24 h following completion of surgery were recorded. Patient-reported pain scores were assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10 with 0 denoting no pain and 10 denoting the maximal pain imaginable.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistics</title><p>Categorical data were expressed as numbers (%) and compared using a Chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate.

Regional analgesia of the abdominal wall can provide good analgesia for a variety of surgical operations especially when used as part of a multimodal technique. Between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles lies a plane that contains the anterior rami of the lower six thoracic nerves (T7 to T12) and first lumbar nerve (L1), supplying the skin, muscles, and parietal peritoneum, this study was based on our experience with TAP block that proposed the technique was effective analgesic intervention for kidney transplant recipients. The clinical importance of our findings is the significant opioid-sparing effects of bilateral RS and TAP blocks both in the intraoperative as well as the postoperative period. Opioids, though very effective in perioperative pain management, may be associated with nausea-vomiting, pruritus, and respiratory depression. Moreover, some patients who are morbidly obese or having obstructive sleep apnea will be maximally benefitted from bilateral RS and TAP blocks through the opioid-sparing effects. Besides this, bilateral RS and TAP blocks also prevent the hemodynamic responses of surgical incision, so patients having ischemic heart disease or stenotic valvular lesion like mitral or aortic stenosis, where tachycardia is undesirable, will also be benefitted from preincisional bilateral RS and TAP blocks. These blocks may be a relatively safer alternative to neuraxial block for perioperative analgesia in patients having coagulopathy as it would occur in our cases of liver resections.</p><p>Our study has a few limitations. First, it is tricky to recognize insufficient analgesia intraoperatively. Though we controlled the depth of anesthesia by BIS monitoring, ensured adequate muscle relaxation, prevented hypovolemia, indirect assessment of intraoperative pain by hemodynamic parameters may be imperfect. Second, we evaluated the postoperative pain at only 2 time periods (6 and 24 h) and only at rest, which is NOT the optimal, we would recommend for further comparative studies to increase the frequency and measure the VAS both at rest and on coughing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combination of bilateral US-guided RS and TAP blocks provide excellent perioperative analgesia for major upper abdominal surgery.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rozen</surname><given-names>WM</given-names></name><name><surname>Tran</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name><name><surname>Ashton</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name><name><surname>Barrington</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ivanusic</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>GI</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Refining the course of the thoracolumbar nerves: A new understanding of the innervation of the anterior abdominal wall</article-title><source>Clin Anat</source><year>2008</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>325</fpage><lpage>33</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18428988</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Chandy</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Srinivas</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Ladak</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Okubo</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitsakakis</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Epidural analgesia provides better pain management after live liver donation: A retrospective study</article-title><source>Liver Transpl</source><year>2011</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>315</fpage><lpage>23</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21384514</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Horlocker</surname><given-names>TT</given-names></name><name><surname>McGregor</surname><given-names>DG</given-names></name><name><surname>Matsushige</surname><given-names>DK</given-names></name><name><surname>Schroeder</surname><given-names>DR</given-names></name><name><surname>Besse</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A retrospective review of 4767 consecutive spinal anesthetics: Central nervous system complications.
