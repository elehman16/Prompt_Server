Trials were reviewed independently by each author for eligibility. Data were extracted separately by each author, and then compared and any differences resolved.</p><p>Results for outcomes requiring survival to a given age are reported with survivors as the denominator (IPPV, CLD). Survival was used, as the denominator for ROP, where the number examined was not given.</p><p>The standard method of the CNRG was used to analyze the data. Treatment effects were expressed using relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD). From 1/RD the number needed to treat (NNT) to produce one outcome was calculated. For each measure the 95% confidence intervals (CI) are routinely given. In subgroup analyses, the 99% CIs are also given for summary RRs in the text.</p><p>Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effects model. Where heterogeneity was over 50%, the random effect RR is also given.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Population</title><p>All preterm or low birth weight infants; with pulmonary dysfunction, mainly due to RDS, who required intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Seventeen eligible studies of 3652 infants were included. Meta-analysis comparing HFOV with CV revealed no evidence of effect on mortality at 28 to 30 days of age or at approximately term equivalent age. These results were consistent across studies and in subgroup analyses. The effect of HFOV on CLD in survivors at term equivalent gestational age was inconsistent across studies and the reduction was of borderline significance overall. The effect was similar in trials with a high lung volume strategy for HFOV targeting at very low FiO<sub>2</sub> and trials with a high lung volume strategy with somewhat higher or unspecified target FiO<sub>2</sub>. Subgroups of trials showed a significant reduction in CLD with HFOV when no surfactant was used, when piston oscillators were used for HFOV, when lung protective strategies for CV were not used, when randomization occurred at 2 to 6 hours of age, and when inspiratory: Expiratory ratio of 1:2 was used for HFOV. In the meta-analysis of all trials, pulmonary air leaks occurred more frequently in the HFOV group.</p><p>In some studies, short-term neurological morbidity with HFOV was found, but this effect was not statistically significant overall. The subgroup of two trials not using a high volume strategy with HFOV found increased rates of Grade 3 or 4 IVH and of PVL. An adverse effect of HFOV on long-term neurodevelopment was found in one large trial but not in the five other trials that reported this outcome. The rate of retinopathy of prematurity is reduced overall in the HFOV group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>There is no clear evidence that elective HFOV offers important advantages over CV when used as the initial ventilation strategy to treat preterm infants with acute pulmonary dysfunction. There may be a small reduction in the rate of CLD with HFOV use, but the evidence is weakened by the inconsistency of this effect across trials and the overall borderline significance. Future trials on elective HFOV should target those infants who are at most risk of CLD (extremely preterm infants), compare different strategies for generating HFOV and CV, and report important long-term neuro-developmental outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>COMMENTARY</title><p>This evidence is supporting most of clinical human studies&#x02019; conclusions that there are no substantial advantages or harms of elective HFOV (started early in the course of RDS or at the most beginning of ventilation) compared to CV especially when the lung protection strategy is used. The existing evidence to support the routine use of elective HFOV is week.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Abstracted from</title><p>Cools F, Henderson-Smart DJ, Offringa M, Askie LM.
