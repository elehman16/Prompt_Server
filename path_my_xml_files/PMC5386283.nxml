In each experiment, one of the 12 participants was equipped with eye-tracking glasses. The experiment was conducted in three stages: an anonymous Individual Game stage against a randomly chosen partner (one of the 12 other participants of the experiment); a Socialization stage, in which the participants were divided into two groups; and a Group Game stage, in which the participants played with partners in the groups. After each round, the respondent received information about his or her personal score in the last round and the overall winner of the game at the moment. The study proves that eye-tracking systems can be used for studying the process of decision making and forecasting. The total viewing time and the time of fixation on areas corresponding to noncooperative decisions is related to the participants&#x02019; overall level of cooperation. The increase in the total viewing time and the time of fixation on the areas of noncooperative choice is due to a preference for noncooperative decisions and a decrease in the overall level of cooperation. The number of fixations on the group attributes is associated with group identity, but does not necessarily lead to cooperative behavior.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>The Tomsk State University Academic D.I.

The oculomotor activity of the eyes is a correlate of certain brain processes [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Eye-tracking offers significant opportunities for the study of decision making because it allows us to access the hidden internal forms of activity that we normally cannot observe and allows us to examine the both the results and the procedural characteristics of the decision making process. Recent works have investigated cooperation in evolutionary social dilemmas set factors that affect cooperation among agents, such as probabilistic participation and inactivity [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], reputation assortment [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and coupling of utility assessment [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Studies on network structures are focused on such characteristics as the synchronization behavior of networks [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], attack vulnerability [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], controllability and network size [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], neighborhood size [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and heterogeneous coupling between interdependent lattices [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which are important for consideration in the complete description of real-world complex systems. These works provide significant advancement of our understanding of cooperation. At the same time, eye-tracking allows us to build behavioral models that consider the cognitive component, to make them more accurate.</p><p>Researchers in the field of experimental economics [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] apply eye-tracking methods to explore the strategic component of the behavior of the players, as well as various individual psychological characteristics that lead to certain decisions, rather than the output feedback of the results of each round. Studies that exclude feedback show that two decision making strategies can be identified that correspond to different levels of a level-k model [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] it was noted that some results of applying eye-tracking methods in one-shot games could not be fully explained by level-k models (the models are described in [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or cognitive hierarchy [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). In [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] potential explanations for those results were shown in diffusal drift models, which allow one to analyze procedural data such as decision making time and eye movement characteristics. The general thrust of these studies is to explore the possibility of forecasting a player&#x02019;s decision by tracking his or her eye movements, followed by verification and generalization of the results in various spheres of human interaction. However, the exclusion of output results makes researchers work exclusively with the pure strategic behavior of participants when they take into account their opponent's action only on the basis of their forecasts, while economic agents whose behavior is modeled in such experiments see the consequences of their behavior. Therefore, we believe it is important to include research feedback, otherwise the results obtained in laboratory experiments may not be able to interpret the real processes that they are intended to explain.</p><p>Today all experimental economics studies are conducted in computer classes. Our study of the characteristics of eye movements in the decision making process was also carried out in a computer class. The Prisoner's Dilemma game has been used as a research tool [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>This study is part of a series of experiments whose main is to study the impact of socialization and social interaction on cooperation. It is known that people, being social animals, try to cooperate with each other because our survival depends on common goals and interactions within the group [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It was shown experimentally that a person within the group seeks cooperation and reciprocity, thereby improving his or her reputation [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Prosocial behavior can be generated through social interaction between members of the group, accompanied by identification with the group, which leads to the appearance of added value of collective interaction, as well as a sense of in-group favoritism and the positive emotions of being in a particular group [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, sociality becomes a mechanism for boosting cooperation. Sociality serves as one more component in the utility function, responsible for the group result and group cohesion, and comes from a sense of social identity [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>In the experiment, sociality is formed through social interaction or socialization, that is, through the familiarization of participants and their division into groups. This laboratory model combines the classic social psychology minimal group paradigm with group manipulations that cause a sense of social attachment [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The use of this model in the experiments revealed that socialization leads to higher levels of cooperation and its persistence in participants within social groups, compared to the initial level of cooperation in a random group of strangers [<xref rid="pone.0175492.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>In a series of experiments conducted at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and Tomsk State University, the effect of socialization on cooperation was studied. The mobile eye-tracking system was used in nine experiments to find answers to the following questions:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>How are decision making process data, obtained via a mobile eye-tracking system related to the level of cooperation?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are there any differences between visual perception features before socialization and after it?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Which areas of a payoff matrix show the greatest difference in visual perception before and after socialization?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Nine experiments were conducted.

The results can be summed up as follows: The process of payoff matrix analysis before Socialization is characterized by a higher concentration of attention by participants, which is expressed by their considering the options offered to them for a longer time. During the Group Game stage (after Socialization), the analysis of the Prisoner's Dilemma was faster. As we compared eye movements during different stages, we were inclined to believe that these results were because the participants saw each round as a new task during the Individual Game stage. After Socialization, they acquired certain ideas that they followed, and particular strategies were formed and used by participants, which led to a change in the nature of their perception of conditions in the subsequent rounds.</p><p>This conclusion is confirmed by the participants&#x02019; self-reports. Four of nine participants with ETG said that after Socialization they tried to behave more cooperatively, that is, they tried to use a cooperative strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec009"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We used eye-tracking to study and forecast the decision making process in social interaction in the Prisoners&#x02019; Dilemma game. Results showed that during the Individual Game stage, participants explore the payoff matrix in every new trial and so every trial is perceived as a new challenge. During the Group Game stage, participants perceive the rounds as a series and spend less time making decisions. Their analysis of the payoff matrix at the stage of the Group Game is more thorough: The decision making process is accompanied by an increase in Fixation Frequency and reduction of Fixation Duration, greater Saccade Frequency, and a smaller Scanpath Length. This analysis of the payoff matrix is in accordance with a particular strategy formed under the influence of sociality on the basis of group identity.</p><p>Socialization promotes group identity development through interaction with other and affects cooperation during the Group Game stage. Introduction of the Socialization stage allows tracking changes in the characteristics of oculomotor activity in areas corresponding to choices to cooperate or defect, depending on the level of cooperation and its dynamics. Thus, the increase in Dwell Time and Fixation Time for noncooperative gains is associated with a preference for noncooperative choices and a decline in the overall level of cooperation.</p><p>A greater number of fixations on the group name corresponds to a strong group identity, but it is not related to a decision defect or cooperate.</p><p>This study demonstrates that eye-tracking systems can be used in group experiments. We suggest further development of eye-tracking study of the influence of social factors on decision making, to expand the subject matter from the visual perception of elements of the payoff matrix to the attention paid by participants to other players. The ability to manipulate the size of the room, the location of the computers, and other aspects of the physical space will enable closer investigation of the effect of social factors on cooperation and the effect of the organization of space on decision making.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec010"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0175492.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Participant&#x02019;s choices during Individual Game (before Socialization stage) in the Prisoner&#x02019;s Dilemma game.</title><p>c&#x02013;cooperative choice, n&#x02013;noncooperative choice.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0175492.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0175492.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Participant&#x02019;s choices during Group Game (after Socialization stage) in the Prisoner&#x02019;s Dilemma game.</title><p>c&#x02013;cooperative choice, n&#x02013;noncooperative choice.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0175492.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0175492.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Differences in Dwell Time (%) for AOI 4.</title><p>The differences in Dwell Time between Cooperators and Defectors according to the behavior data from the Prisoners&#x02019;
