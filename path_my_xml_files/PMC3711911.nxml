There has been an emergence for seeking an understanding of factors which determine variations in SedT, LIPA, and PAEE. Sedentary behavior and physical activity are relatively resistant to change by experimental dietary treatments and significant body weight changes. Although caffeine (Caf) is by far the most heavily used nutritional agent ingested to promote a sense of vigor/alertness, it is still unknown if Caf is effective in increasing PAEE and physical activity. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that 2 daily doses of Caf (as a capsule to blind the treatment and divided equally during breakfast and lunch) increase PAEE and TEE, and it would do so through increasing the frequent and brief bouts of physical activity (~1-5 min long) through the day as measured by accelerometry. In 21 low Caf users (&#x0003c;100 mg day<sup>-1</sup>), we used a double-blind crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.govID;NCT01477294) with two conditions (4-day each with a 3-day washout period) randomly ordered as 5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> of Caf and maltodextrin as placebo (Plc). Resting energy expenditure (REE) by indirect calorimetry, total energy expenditure (TEE) from doubly labeled water, PAEE calculated as TEE-(REE+0.1TEE), and accelerometry measurements of both LIPA and MVPA were not different between conditions. However, regardless of caffeine or placebo, there were several significant relationships between brief bouts of LIPA and MVPA with PAEE. In conclusion, this double-blind study found that low and moderate-vigorous activity as well as the total volume of PAEE in free-living conditions is resistant to dietary caffeine intake that was equivalent to 5 cups of espresso or 7 cups of tea.</p><sec sec-type="headed"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01477294">NCT01477294</ext-link>

It has been considered as a thermogenic agent [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] that could help in preventing a positive energy balance and obesity [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although the effect of caffeine on energy expenditure (EE) has been the subject of numerous investigations [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], its effects on daily free living physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and physical activity patterns, specifically the frequency of short bouts of low intensity physical activity (LIPA) or moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) have not hitherto been studied.</p><p>Current PA guidelines for adults are focused on increasing MVPA levels. However, recent data indicate that only about 4-6% of the Portuguese adult population meet these recommendations [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] which is in accordance with the results from the US adult population (5%) [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A recent operational definition [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] defined sedentary behavior as any waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure &#x02264;1.5 METs while in a sitting or reclining posture. Sedentary behavior may be one of the causes of many modern day chronic diseases including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and occupation-related sedentary behavior may account for a significant portion of the increase in mean body weight for women and men [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recommending the accumulation of enough time in multiple short bouts of PA, at a low intensity (i.e., LIPA) distributed throughout the day may be an effective alternative for the reduction of sedentary behavior [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It was hypothesized by Hamilton et al. in 2007 [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] &#x0201c;that any type of brief, yet frequent, muscular contractions throughout the day may be necessary to short-circuit unhealthy molecular signals causing metabolic diseases&#x0201d;. Experimental [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and observational [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] studies have only begun to suggest indirectly that interrupting sedentary behavior with short bouts of LIPA or MVPA may be positively associated with relevant health outcomes such as blood lipids, glycemic levels, insulin resistance and systolic blood pressure. However, changing human behavior to become more physically active in free-living conditions is very difficult to do, and the simple fact that caffeine is so widely used in all cultures is intriguing to consider if it provides enough of a stimulus to effect a more active behavioral change. Nevertheless, research studies are still lacking regarding the effective contribution of short bouts frequency on PAEE assessed by double labeled water under free-living conditions. In fact, only one study has investigated the relationship between PA short bouts lasting less than 10-min with EE [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in laboratorial conditions using indirect calorimetry.</p><p>Taken together, the absence of published studies concerning the role of caffeine on PA patterns and the contribution of short bouts frequency of LIPA or MVPA to free-living PAEE led us to conduct this investigation with two purposes: a) To evaluate the impact of a moderate dose of caffeine during a 4-day period on PAEE and daily number of short bouts of at least 1 up to 5-min of either LIPA or MVPA in non-obese, physically active males under free-living conditions; b) to analyze, either under caffeine or placebo treatments, the associations between short bouts lasting 1 up to 5-min of LIPA and MVPA with PAEE assessed from doubly labeled water in combination with indirect calorimetry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Ethics Statement and Participants</title><p>This research has been approved by the ethics Committee of the Faculty of Human Kinetics, Technical University of Lisbon and were conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki for human studies [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

Moreover, to reduce the variability of individual PA patterns during the week, both conditions were performed on the same weekdays while the washout period always included the weekend days.

These associations remained significant when adjusted for sedentary time (&#x0003c;100 cpm).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present investigation examined the effect of a moderate dose of caffeine on PAEE and the frequency of short bouts of both LIPA and MVPA, on real life settings and using objective methods such as DLW and accelerometry, respectively.</p><p>It is well known that caffeine works as an ergogenic substance for the central nervous system [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], then it would be expected an increase on daily PA, specifically the daily low intensity activities [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Unexpectedly, our novel finding revealed that a moderate dose of caffeine ingestion, corresponding to approximately 5 espresso cups of coffee (30 mL each) or 7 servings of tea, with each containing nearly 75 mg of caffeine had no effect on PAEE, the time spent in LIPA and MVPA, and the daily number of short bouts of both LIPA and MVPA intensities.</p><p>Previous studies indicated wide intra-individual variation in sedentary behavior and physical activity making it necessary to pay close attention to results <italic>within</italic> studies rather than comparing results between studies. Also, accelerometers in theory fail to record activity counts during certain very low intensity activities (LIPA) and thereby may underestimate the time spent in some activities [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We used a reliable type of accelerometer frequently used in the literature. Based on accelerometry data our participants performed approximately 2.5 hours of LIPA which is somewhat below the typical values presented for the Portuguese male population on this age range (3.3 hours) [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, sedentary time (700 min) was also higher than the reference value (594 min). The high PAEE and other modest step count and MVPA suggest, that a large amount of energy expenditure occurs in LIPA and therefore the lack of change in PAEE (from DLW) confirms our findings that caffeine did not reduce the high amount of sedentary time in our participants because a shift toward more LIPA.</p><p>There is also some confusion concerning the best cutoff value to distinguish sedentary behavior and LIPA. The most commonly used is the 100 counts min<sup>-1</sup>, however based on a previous investigation it seems that this value is more accurate only when sedentary time is lower, while the 150 count min<sup>-1</sup> is more accurate when sedentary time is higher. Despite participants being active, they also spent a major part of their waking day in sedentary behavior, therefore it could have been used the 150 cutoff value [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Two studies investigated the effects of caffeine on TEE in a metabolic chamber during 1-day [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Berube-Parent et al found an increase of 179 kcal in TEE considering a 600 mg day<sup>-1</sup> caffeine dosage whereas the later investigation, using a lower caffeine dose (150 mg day<sup>-1</sup>) did not present significant differences between caffeine and placebo [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Though our mean caffeine dose administration was considerable higher than that reported by Dulloo et al [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], we also found non-significant effects of caffeine on TEE, over a 4-day period. Accordingly, the most likely explanation for these findings is probably related to the mean dosage used (~360 mg day<sup>-1</sup>), which is below the threshold for stimulating thermogenesis, i.e., 600&#x02013;1000 mg caffeine day<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, a possible tolerance to caffeine effects [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] during the 4-day period may also explain these results. A previous investigation found significant effects of caffeine on increasing REE [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], even when participants were moderate caffeine consumers [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Although no study considered a period longer than 24 h, we were expecting that our low-caffeine users (&#x0003c;100 mg day<sup>-1</sup>) would increase REE under a 4-day caffeine intake. However, the results from the present investigation showed no significant increase in daily REE (13.6 kcal day<sup>-1</sup>; p=0.689).</p><p>It has been speculated that the contradictory results for all the EE components might be explained by the great variability on the individual response to caffeine due to body composition and dietary intake variables [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, our findings did not confirm that fat-free mass or dietary intake mediated the effect of caffeine on PAEE, TEE, REE, and the frequencies of short bouts of both LIPA and MVPA.</p><p>There is still some uncertainty regarding the role of caffeine intake on both sedentary behavior and interruptions of sedentary time. Caffeine intake has been associated with lower sleep time and higher screen time, which are major sedentary behavior promoters [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Another investigation found small but statistically significant differences in spontaneous PA between catechins/caffeine treatment compared with the caffeine-only treatment, but no differences between caffeine-only and placebo conditions [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Recent research has focused on the detrimental effects of a sedentary lifestyle [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Researchers have hypothesized that breaking up sedentary behavior with LIPA and MVPA short bouts will improve the health of sedentary individuals, independently of PA levels [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, to our knowledge only one study [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] investigated the acute contribution of PA short bouts of LIPA and MVPA to PAEE using direct calorimetry in laboratorial settings. We also found no significant contribution of short bouts of LIPA lasting less than 4-min to PAEE, which is also in agreement with previous findings [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The compendium of physical activities [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] documented &#x0201c;walking when gathering things at work ready to leave&#x0201d; has a metabolic equivalent of 3.0 METS or 10.5 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>, &#x0201c;walking less than 3.2 km on a firm surface&#x0201d; has 2.0 METS or 7.0 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>. Accordingly [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], observed that short bouts, with an intensity of 5.0 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup> were in the LIPA spectrum. This level of EE may possibly have an important impact on weight maintenance, or even possibly weight loss. Experimental studies should be conducted to test the effects of increasing PA short bouts on weight loss or maintenance.</p><p>It is important to mention some limitations and strengths of the current investigation. Our participants were already physically active at baseline which may have hindered or reduced the potentiating effect of caffeine on increasing PA levels. However, considering their low level of caffeine habituation we were not expecting increases in MVPA but in spontaneous LIPA. Still, these participants had about 700 min/day of sedentary time as measured with our accelerometers and thus ample time for caffeine to cause individuals to &#x0201c;get up and move&#x0201d; if caffeine were to stimulate more LIPA or some other kind of activity.</p><p>Hip-worn accelerometers have been used to estimate sedentary time from total body movement. While accelerometers function well for many purposes, most models are not designed to accurately measure postures like sitting and standing. Therefore, as presented earlier in this section, the use of an accelerometer to measure sedentary time and LIPA transitions may be less sensitive and somehow underestimated LIPA.</p><p>We did not assess hormonal changes that, in fact, could vary under caffeine intake, which would likely affect EE, specifically during rest. Studies indicated that caffeine increases catecholamine production [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] however, we did not find significant differences between REE values assessed at baseline and at the end of each condition. Our findings are only generalized to non-obese physically active males, low-caffeine users, and for a 4-day period. Further research should be conducted with a higher caffeine dose and in a population that vary in age, body mass index, gender, and activity levels. The major strengths of this study include the study design with double-blind randomized crossover trial and state-of-the-art methods for assessing PAEE, specifically the DLW technique for TEE in combination with indirect calorimetry for REE in free living conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings revealed that resting, total, and physical activity EE, and accelerometry measurements of both LIPA and MVPA were not affected by the ingestion of a moderate dose of caffeine. Also, a significant contribution to PAEE was observed in males that increased short bouts frequency of at least 1 up to 4-min of MVPA and at least 4-min of LIPA. Regardless of sedentary time, shifting sedentary behavior to LIPA through bouts of at least 4-min can markedly increase PAEE in healthy males.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0068936.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0068936.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0068936.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><title>Trial protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0068936.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our gratitude to the participants for their time and effort.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
