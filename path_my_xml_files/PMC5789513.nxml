It is considered to be one of the most common health care-associated infections arising in the ICU.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] About 10% of ventilated patients will develop the disease, with the risk of VAP rising as the durations of mechanical ventilation increase, reaching a maximum on day 5 postintubation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Further, VAP is associated with a significant morbidity as it increases the length of stay in the ICU, duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital stay.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>VAP caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) is associated with much more mortality.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Potential MDROs include <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> spp., <italic>Klebsiella</italic>-producing carbapenemase strains, ESBL-producing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>, and methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Diagnosing VAP requires combined assessment of clinical data, microbiological results, and radiological findings. There are no simple and easy methods to determine that a patient has VAP. When there is a high clinical suspicion of VAP, empirical therapy with antimicrobial must be started immediately because both delayed management and inadequate treatment are associated with an increased incidence of morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Recommendations of the current guidelines include coverage of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) empirically with a carbapenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, in combination with an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, there will be a problem when a high proportion of the GNB are not sensitive to these antibiotics. One of the sequelae of a greater prevalence of resistance to antimicrobials is an increased realization of inadequate treatment of infection. Alternatives available for the treatment of Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacilli are few.</p><p>The administration of inhaled antibiotics offers the possibility of providing high drug levels in the lung tissue and reduction of the systemic toxicity that occur with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. The concentration of the inhaled antibiotics in the respiratory secretion may be 20 to 100 folds higher than <italic>in vitro</italic> minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the organisms being treated.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>An increased resistance to antimicrobials and the shortage of new antimicrobial development necessitate new dosing strategies to optimize the pharmacodynamics of the existing antimicrobials. This can aid in preserving antibiotic efficacy, impede the emergence of resistance, and provide a pharmaco-economic benefit. Meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam both exhibit time-dependent killing and are used in the treatment of infections caused by MDR bacteria. Prolonged infusions of these antimicrobials increase the time of exposure above the MIC and should as a result improve their efficacy.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methodology</title><p>This study was a prospective, randomized, nonblinded, controlled, single-center trial performed at the ICU of Ain Shams University Hospitals, a 42-bed medical-surgical ICU, from October 2015 to December 2016.</p><p>Patients requiring mechanical ventilation were candidates for the study if they met the following inclusion criteria: 18 years old or greater and patients having ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with positive sputum culture showing Gram-negative MDRO. VAP was considered if the onset occurred following intubation of the trachea for 48 h and the infection was absent before starting mechanical ventilation.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Diagnosis of pneumonia was based on radiographic finding of pulmonary infiltrate; findings should be new and progressive and at least should satisfy two clinical criteria of the following: body temperature &#x0003e;38&#x000b0;C or &#x0003c;35.5&#x000b0;C; leukocyte count &#x0003e;12,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or &#x0003c;4000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; and clinical evidence of pneumonia, such as purulent secretions and a decrease in oxygenation.</p><p>Diagnosis of VAP was confirmed microbiologically by positive bronchial secretion cultures.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, use of immunosuppressive agents except for steroids, neutropenia (white blood cell count &#x02264;1000/mL), history of allergy to the study drugs, patients whose primary diagnosis was community-acquired pneumonia, or patients with renal impairment necessitating dose adjustment of any of the study drugs.</p><p>After obtaining approval from Ain Shams University Hospital's Ethical Committee and obtaining informed consent from patients&#x02019; first-degree relatives, ninety patients were randomized into three groups. Patient recruitment, enrollment, and analysis were depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Randomization was performed using a sealed envelope design.

Clinical outcome was classified as: clinical cure (i.e., resolution of infection symptoms and signs by the end of antibiotic treatment) and clinical improvement (i.e., partial resolution of infection symptoms and signs). Clinical cure or clinical improvement was considered as the clinical success. As secondary outcomes, VAP-related mortality, microbiological outcome, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and the incidence of adverse events during treatment were evaluated.</p><p>The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score at the time of randomization defined as clinical severity of illness, Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), and adverse events were monitored on a daily basis.</p><p>Microbiological outcome was categorized as eradication of the pathogen (i.e., no growth in the final culture during hospitalization) and persistence of pathogen (i.e., persistent growth of the pathogen regardless of the clinical outcome).</p><p>The definition of VAP-related mortality was considered if death occurred during the treatment period due to septic shock and signs of pneumonia remained.</p><p>Nephrotoxicity was defined as a value of serum creatinine &#x0003e;2 mg/dL; as a decline in creatinine clearance of 50%, in comparison to the baseline value; or as a reduction in renal function that necessitated renal replacement therapy.</p><p>Adverse effects related to nebulized amikacin use, such as cough, bronchoconstriction, chest tightness or apnea, and arterial hypoxemia, were recorded.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Nebulization technique</title><p>Nebulization was performed with an ultrasound nebulizer positioned on the inspiratory limb proximal to the Y-piece. To reduce flow turbulences and extrapulmonary deposition, specific ventilator settings were used during the nebulization period. They included removal of the humidifier (heat and moisture exchanger), volume-controlled mode, constant inspiratory flow, respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min, inspiratory: expiratory ratio of 1&#x02013;2, tidal volume of 8 ml/kg, and an end-inspiratory pause representing 20% of the duty cycle. Synchrony between the patient and the ventilator was guaranteed by deepening the level of sedation to avoid inspiratory turbulences and optimize distal lung deposition of nebulized particles.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Before the study, a power analysis was performed to determine the minimal acceptable number of patients in each group on the basis of the expected clinical outcome. The minimal sample number was 27 participants for each group with type I &#x003b1;-error of 0.05 and type II &#x003b2;-error of 0.1, with the power of the test at 90%; so, we set the group number at 30 for compensation of any possible dropouts.</p><p>Data were collected, revised, coded, and entered into the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 computer software (IBM Corp. 2011.
