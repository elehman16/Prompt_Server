Currently, targeted temperature management (TTM) is the only treatment that has both laboratory and clinical supportive data and is used to improve outcomes in patients with post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although the optimum protocol for TTM has yet to be established, maintaining the body temperature between 32&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 36&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, rather than not treating the fever, is now implemented as the gold standard for improving outcomes in patients with PCAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Several drugs that block toxic metabolite production have shown promise in mitigating anoxic neurological injuries in animal PCAS models. However, these drugs have not been demonstrated to improve outcomes in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, a medical breakthrough is warranted in post-CA care, and we are in pursuit of a novel and simple therapeutic approach.</p><p id="Par40">The unique antioxidative and antiapoptotic properties, as well as the potential therapeutic applications, of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) were first reported in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since then, the efficacy of H<sub>2</sub> has been extensively studied in various animal models and preliminary clinical studies. In addition to its radical-scavenging effect, H<sub>2</sub> has been reported to regulate gene expression and various signal transduction pathways by modifying the free radical chain reaction-dependent generation of oxidized phospholipid mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although the specific mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects demonstrated by H<sub>2</sub> in various animal models have not been fully elucidated, the clinical translation of H<sub>2</sub> is now attracting positive attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Improved survival rates, better neurological outcomes, and attenuated histological damage have been reported with hydrogen gas inhalation (HI) in a PCAS rat model. The salutary effect of H<sub>2</sub> was comparable to that of TTM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. With the unique features of H<sub>2</sub>, specifically its pleiotropic effects, high permeability, convenient administration, and lack of obvious adverse effects, HI has the potential to improve survival and neurological outcomes in patients with PCAS. Recently, we reported that HI is a feasible and safe approach for selected comatose post-CA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, in this trial, we will evaluate whether HI is effective, compared with conventional oxygen inhalation, in improving 90-day neurological outcomes in comatose patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) of a presumed cardiac cause.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par41">The Efficacy of inhaled HYdrogen on neurological outcome following BRain Ischemia During post-cardiac arrest care (HYBRID II) trial is an investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicenter superiority trial (RCT) with two parallel groups.

Thus, cylinders will be sequentially numbered from 1 to 360, and each of the 180 pairs (e.g., 1 and 2, 3 and 4,&#x02026;) will be transported simultaneously from a storage center to a facility upon request. One of each pair of gas cylinders will contain hydrogen gas, and the other will contain a control gas. Because two cylinders will be used per patient, each pairwise shipment will contain four cylinders. Which of the gas cylinders of each pair contains hydrogen or control gas will be determined by selecting a random binary number generated by the Bernoulli distribution (probability 0.5) using a computer, and this information will be entered into an allocation table. The allocation table will be kept secret by the assignment manager until the time of the key opening. Before a pair of gas cylinders is transported from a storage center, the gas cylinders will be covered by cylindrical covers so that the contents of the cylinders (hydrogen or control gas) cannot be recognized. Every set of two patients at each center will be randomly allocated 1:1 to the hydrogen and control groups while maintaining blindedness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study intervention</title><p id="Par46">The intervention is the inhalation of the blinded trial gas, which will be initiated upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and will be continued for 18&#x000a0;h, along with TTM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The study gas will be supplied from a cylinder with constant flow and will be mixed with oxygen from the mechanical ventilator (SERVO-s&#x000ae;; MAQUET Critical Care AB, Solna, Sweden) at the inspiratory duct. The cylinder is filled with 4%&#x000a0;H<sub>2</sub> and 96% nitrogen for the HI group and with 100% nitrogen for the control group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Thus, the maximum O<sub>2</sub> concentration is limited to 50% with our current HI system because prefilled 4%&#x000a0;H<sub>2</sub> in N<sub>2</sub> is mixed with oxygen to obtain 2%&#x000a0;H<sub>2</sub> containing O<sub>2</sub>. The optimum combination values of tidal volume, respiratory rate, fraction of inspired oxygen, and trial gas flow rate, which are common for both groups, have been predetermined to obtain the above-mentioned gas composition. In our HI system, there is a discrepancy in both volume and composition between the gas emitted from the ventilator and the gas inhaled by the patient. To overcome this phenomenon, we need to deactivate the alarm on the ventilator, which works as a fail-safe under ordinary circumstances. Alternatively, we will install extra devices to monitor the tidal volume and O<sub>2</sub> concentration throughout the intervention to ensure safety.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>System of trial gas inhalation.

Therefore, persistent disability/incapacity or a life-threatening condition may not necessarily indicate a serious adverse event (SAE) if it was predictable from the patient&#x02019;s clinical condition. No exceptional rules exist for defining or reporting adverse events (AEs) in studies on patients with PCAS. Therefore, in order to proceed with the study smoothly while fully considering safety, we need to define AEs and establish a reporting rule whereby any newly emergent conditions and clinically significant worsening of the patient&#x02019;s underlying condition, including death, should be recorded in all circumstances. Thus, we defined an AE as any unfavorable medical occurrence that is temporally associated with the participant&#x02019;s involvement in the research, regardless of whether it is considered to be related to participating in the study after HI initiation until the end of the 90-day follow-up period. A clinically unfavorable medical occurrence is defined as death, life-threatening worsening of conditions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), permanent or severe organ dysfunction (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1), laboratory abnormalities (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2), seizure, and any other condition that the investigators judge as representing a significant hazard. Considering the above-referenced characteristics of patients with PCAS, an SAE is defined as an AE that occurs within 72&#x000a0;h after the initiation of the intervention or death during the follow-up period.

All analyses will be performed on a full-analysis basis. Baseline characteristics by group will be compared using descriptive analyses. The proportion of patients achieving good neurological outcomes at the end of the follow-up will be compared using the Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, which will be the primary result of the trial. With regard to the secondary outcomes, the 90-day survival rate will be compared using the Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test; the duration of survival will be analyzed using Cox regression analysis; and other neurological outcomes, such as mRS, GCS, and MMSE scores, will be compared using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. All tests will be two-tailed, and a <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All data analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Interim analysis</title><p id="Par56">The interim analysis of safety will be conducted by the data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC) to determine whether to continue the study after the first 100 patients have been followed for 90&#x000a0;days.

In the interim analysis, we will make a statistical estimate comparing mortality between the hydrogen and control groups. For each group, an independent beta distribution [&#x003b2;(1,1)] will be used as a prior distribution, and the posterior distribution of the mortality rate of each group will be estimated on the basis of number of deaths observed. Based on the aforementioned distribution, the criteria for the discontinuation of the study will be met when the probability that the mortality rate of the hydrogen group is higher than that of the control group is&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.9875.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Data and safety monitoring committee</title><p id="Par57">The DSMC is an independent group consisting of clinicians who have experience in the management of ICU patients and a statistician who has experience in the execution, monitoring, and analysis of clinical trials.

Because PCAS is observed in a unique group of patients and has a serious and urgent nature, it is rarely studied in double-blind RCTs. The HYBRID II trial will be the first randomized double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy of HI.</p><p id="Par60">Animal experimental data support the benefits of HI for PCAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therapeutic effects of HI at concentrations ranging from 1.3% to 3% have been reported in various models. We have chosen an H<sub>2</sub> concentration of 2% because the protective effect against acute oxidative stress plateaued at over 2% in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Synergistic effects of TTM and HI have been reported in rodent PCAS models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. TTM and HI may share the same theoretical neuroprotective mechanisms. However, other yet to be defined mechanisms are speculated to exist.</p><p id="Par61">Although H<sub>2</sub> gas is flammable, concentrations&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;4% together with oxygen at room temperature are incombustible. As indicated by the second law of thermodynamics, although several physical processes that satisfy the first law are possible, the only processes that occur in nature are those for which the entropy of the system either remains constant or increases. Thus, exhaled H<sub>2</sub> diffuses instantly, not accumulating or resulting in an increased concentration exceeding that of the inspiratory H<sub>2</sub> concentration. Therefore, 2%&#x000a0;H<sub>2</sub> gas can be solicitously administered in a hospital.</p><p id="Par62">HI at a therapeutic dose has been reported to have no adverse effects on vital signs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. No unfavorable effects have been reported with the prolonged repetitive inhalation of H<sub>2</sub> to prevent decompression sickness in healthy deep-sea divers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">Comatose post-CA patients generally require mechanical ventilation. Therefore, H<sub>2</sub> must be administered through a mechanical ventilator circuit. We have successfully devised a ventilator system that enables simultaneous administration of titrated H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) using a clinically available ventilator. A significant point to emphasize is that platinum is a catalyst for the oxidation reaction of H<sub>2</sub>. Thus, even if H<sub>2</sub> itself is incombustible under 4% concentration at room temperature, the platinum surface may be overheated in the presence of H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, eventually leading to mechanical failure. This is essential because most of the current clinically available ventilators are equipped with a platinum hot manometer as a flow sensor, thereby limiting ventilator options for the administration of H<sub>2</sub> gas. We chose an existing ventilator equipped with an ultrasonic flow sensor (Servo-s&#x000ae;). The feasibility and safety of HI using this system was confirmed in a small sample size of subjects with PCAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of HI for PCAS is eagerly anticipated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">Our HI system has several limitations. First, the maximum O<sub>2</sub> concentration is limited to 50%. Although PEEP will be tailored to maintain sufficient oxygenation, patients requiring&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50% O<sub>2</sub> must be excluded. Second, HI is limited to 18&#x000a0;h because of space limitations for the installation of cylinders in the Japanese ICU. The gas cylinder that will be used in this trial is capable of providing gas for approximately 10 to 12&#x000a0;h, depending on the flow rate. Considering the space limitation, two cylinders per patient is the maximum. Thus, the trial gas inhalation duration was set for 18&#x000a0;h. There are no conclusive studies on the optimal duration of HI after CA, even in animal models; thus, 18&#x000a0;h might be short for some patients. Third, a time lag between ROSC and HI initiation is inevitable because the HI system will need to be installed in the ICU. H<sub>2</sub> has been reported to ameliorate ischemia-reperfusion injury in part by radical-scavenging effects; it is easily assumed that earlier initiation of HI after ROSC in the ER may demonstrate better results. However, our results derived from animal experiments revealed that the benefit of HI is similar, even when it is initiated following ROSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The time delay for obtaining consent is minimal because consent is usually obtained from a proxy while the patient is sent for emergent revascularization. A deferred consent approach was not chosen, because consent from a proxy was mandated by the Japanese government for approval of this trial as an advanced medicine clinical trial. Based on the abovementioned reasons, a time lag&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;h between starting HI after ROSC is considered realistic. According to our previous experience, it is expected that the refusal rate will not be sufficient to produce a selection bias.</p><p id="Par65">We have designed a pragmatic randomized trial with wide inclusion criteria after taking previous trials, clinical guidelines, and current clinical practices into consideration. Wide inclusion criteria will strengthen the generalizability of our results.</p><p id="Par66">In this trial, we will arrange randomization and blinding in a unique way by using ingredient-concealed, prerandomized cylinders. It is practically impossible to stock certain sets of large cylinders at each hospital and choose them according to central computer-based randomization. The blinding and 1:1 allocation will be maintained without confusion by simply using the delivered cylinders in numerical order at each site. Scrupulous trial design, including monitoring and auditing by external contract research organizations, is planned to maintain compliance and eventually to obtain high-quality evidence. Moreover, this trial has been approved as an advanced medicine clinical trial whose aim is to obtain future regulatory approval by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of the Japanese government.</p><p id="Par67">H<sub>2</sub> is one of the most abundant substances in the universe, and it is far less expensive and is effective at lower concentrations than other noble gases that have been studied for PCAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The unique features of HI include a less invasive nature, easy and safe administration, and no obvious known adverse effects. Therefore, our expectation is that once H<sub>2</sub> is demonstrated to be effective, HI will have the potential to be widely applied to patients with PCAS.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status and time line</title><p id="Par68">As of 19 October 2017, 2 patients were enrolled and recruitment is ongoing.
