Common mental disorders (CMDs, i.e. depressive, anxiety and adjustment disorders), as opposed to severe mental disorders, account for the majority of costs related to mental ill-health [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, evidence for work-related interventions is much more established for severe mental disorders, such as supported employment programs [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the last decade, several studies have focused on workers suffering from CMDs and have evaluated interventions to enhance return to work (RTW) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In these studies, RTW has been defined as endpoint while recent research has shown that 20% to 30% of the workers who returned to work after sickness absence due to CMDs experience recurrent sickness absence [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, recurrent sickness absence is often more serious and long-lasting than the initial sickness episode due to CMDs [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, more attention is needed for enhancing sustainable RTW of workers with CMDs by preventing recurrent sickness absence.</p><p>The SHARP-at work intervention is developed to prevent recurrent sickness absence in workers who returned to work after sickness absence due to CMDs [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The intervention consists of problem-solving treatment provided by occupational physicians (OPs). OPs guide workers through a problem-solving process focused on establishing solutions for problems and opportunities encountered when back at work. Furthermore, consultations between the worker and the supervisor are stimulated by the OP to achieve solutions that can be readily implemented. The intervention was compared to care as usual (CAU) in a cluster-randomised controlled trial (cluster-RCT) and has shown to be effective in reducing recurrent sickness absence (Arends et al., submitted).</p><p>Before implementing the SHARP-at work intervention in the occupational health care practice, insight is needed in the relationship between intervention costs and benefits compared to CAU [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform an economic evaluation of the SHARP-at work intervention compared to CAU. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from the societal perspective and cost-benefit from the societal and employer perspective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Study design</title><p>An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a cluster-RCT. OPs, who conducted the intervention, were recruited through 365/ArboNed, one of the largest Occupational Health Services in the Netherlands. The Medical Ethical Board of the University Medical Center Groningen provided approval for the study design, the research protocol, questionnaires, information letters and the informed consent. The trial was registered in the Dutch Trial Register (NTR) with registration number NTR1963. More detailed information on the study design and procedure of the cluster-RCT has been presented elsewhere [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Study setting</title><p>In the Netherlands, the employer pays sickness absence benefits to the sick-listed worker for two years. During these two years, both the employer and sick-listed worker are responsible for RTW. The employer is obliged to contract an OP to help guiding the RTW process. If RTW has not been accomplished after two years, the Social Security Agency (SSA) evaluates if sufficient RTW efforts have been made by the employer and worker and decides on the percentage of work disability for which the worker will be compensated by the SSA. Costs for treatment and work accommodations are the responsibility of the employer, but compensation can be requested from the SSA for work accommodations.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Study population</title><p>Participants were recruited by OPs between January 2010 and June 2011. Eligible participants were workers between 18 and 63 years, had to be diagnosed with a CMD by their OP at the start of sickness absence and had to be ready to (partially or fully) RTW. A detailed overview of all inclusion and exclusion criteria has been presented elsewhere [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2.4"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>OPs were randomised to the intervention or control group based on a computer-generated random allocation sequence because workers could not be randomly allocated to OPs as OPs are bound to companies. Since a worker&#x02019;s allocation was predefined based on the OP&#x02019;s allocation, we only provided information on the treatment the worker would receive and blinded the worker for study design and comparison group. OPs were not blinded for study design and allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2.5"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="s2.5.1"><title>SHARP-at work intervention</title><p>A detailed description of the intervention has been provided elsewhere (Arends et al., submitted for publication). In brief, the SHARP-at work intervention was developed to prevent recurrent sickness absence by structured OP guidance after RTW. The intervention was started by OPs when participants on sickness absence due to CMDs were ready to RTW. Five steps had to be followed by the participant when RTW was started. The OP monitored that all steps were taken and activated the participant when needed. For each step, facilitating assignments for the worker were at the OP&#x02019;s disposal. The five steps comprised: (1) making an inventory of problems and/or opportunities encountered at work after RTW, (2) brainstorming about solutions/realisations, (3) writing down solutions/realisations and the support needed and assessing the applicability of these solutions, (4) discussing solutions/realisations and making an action plan with the supervisor, and (5) evaluating the action plan/implementation of solutions. Two to five consultations, of 30 minutes each, were recommended to OPs. The first of five assignments (i.e. making an inventory of problems and opportunities and assessing the help needed to solve them) instigated the problem solving process and was therefore a key element. OPs received a two-day training in the SHARP-at work intervention and had three feedback moments to discuss their experiences with conducting the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2.5.2"><title>Care as usual</title><p>All participating OPs were already trained in the evidence-based guideline of the Netherlands Society of Occupational Medicine &#x0201c;The treatment of workers with mental health problems by the OP&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The guideline is primarily directed at structuring OP&#x02019;s treatment to help sick-listed workers with mental health problems to RTW. Though one consultation has to take place after RTW to address relapse prevention, limited attention is given to a structured follow-up of OP&#x02019;s treatment after RTW has been accomplished.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2.6"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>An economic evaluation was performed from the societal and employer perspective. The evaluation from the societal perspective consisted of a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) with the difference in incidence of recurrent sickness absence and time to recurrent sickness absence between the two study groups as the outcomes. Costs associated with health care utilisation (including the costs for the intervention or CAU) were included in the CEA. From the employer perspective, a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was performed comparing the two study groups regarding costs associated with health care utilisation (including the costs for the intervention or CAU) and the monetary value of differences in productivity.</p><sec id="s2.6.1"><title>Effects</title><p>The effect measures for the CEA were incidence of recurrent sickness absence and time to recurrent sickness absence during 12 months follow-up. Recurrent sickness absence was defined as &#x02265; 30% decrease in working days per week due to sickness absence, regardless of partial or full RTW. Recurrent sickness absence days were corrected for partial RTW by dividing the sickness absence days by 1/RTW percentage.</p></sec><sec id="s2.6.2"><title>Health care costs</title><p>Data were collected using the Trimbos/iMTA questionnaire for Costs associated with Psychiatric Illness (TiC&#x02013;P) with a 4-week recall period at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. The data were linearly interpolated over 12 months. The unit prices used for valuing resource utilisation are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. The study&#x02019;s index year was 2009. The Dutch Manual for Costing was used for calculating standard prices [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Costs for alternative care were based on real costs reported by the participants. Medication costs were valued with cost prices of the Royal Dutch Society for Pharmacy [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Two questions on number of consultations with the OP and company social worker were added to the Tic-P to collect data on use of occupational health services. For the calculation of costs from the societal perspective, the OP consultations were valued using the cost level for general practitioners, and consultations with the company social worker were valued using the cost level for social workers. For the calculation of costs from the employer perspective real employer prices for OPs and company social workers were used which were provided by the Occupational Health Service.</p><table-wrap id="tab1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Unit prices used and mean (SD) total costs per study group.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"/><th colspan="2" rowspan="1">

To measure sickness absence costs, administrative data were collected on cumulative number of days of sickness absence over a period of 12 months. Calendar days of sickness absence were corrected for part-time sickness absence and converted to number of working hours based on participants&#x02019;' work contract. For the calculation of productivity loss costs, we assumed that participants were 100% productive during the hours of work resumption. At-work productivity loss was assessed with one question of the TiC&#x02013;P stating: "How many extra hours would you have to work to catch up on tasks you were unable to complete in normal working hours due to health problems over the past two weeks?" Sickness absence costs and costs for at-work productivity loss were calculated by multiplying the number of sickness absence hours by the estimated cost of production loss for a worker per hour of absence, differentiating between costs for men and women. We used the Human Capital Approach (HCA) and the Friction Cost Approach (FCA) to calculate the total costs of production loss. A friction period of 154 days and an elasticity of 0.8 were applied in the FCA [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2.7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The economic evaluation was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Discounting of costs was not applied because the follow-up was limited to one year. Sickness absence data were collected for 145 (92%) participants and a complete follow-up on self-reported data was available for 99 (63%) participants.</p><p>For the CEA, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated by dividing the incremental costs by the incremental effects. The incremental costs consisted of the difference in all health care utilisation costs (including the intervention costs) between the intervention and control group. Two incremental effect measures were calculated: (1) the difference in incidence of recurrent sickness absence and (2) the difference in time (measured in days) to recurrent sickness absence between the intervention and control group. The ICER represents the additional investments needed to prevent one case of recurrent sickness absence or to prevent one day of recurrent sickness absence. For the CBA from the employer&#x02019;s perspective, the net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated by subtracting the difference in costs for occupational health services (including the intervention costs) between the intervention and control group from the difference in costs of productivity loss between the two groups. Total costs of productivity loss was calculated with and without costs due lost productivity at work, next to costs of sickness absence, as data on lost productivity at work were only available for 51% of the study sample. The CBA was performed using both the HCA and FCA. The mean difference in costs and benefits between the intervention and control group and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with multilevel regression analysis to account for the study&#x02019;s multilevel design (i.e. adjusting for the influence at the OP-level as participants were nested in OPs).</p><p>The 95% CIs for the incremental costs were estimated using a bias corrected and accelerated bootstrapping procedure with 5000 replications [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Bootstrapped cost-effect pairs were plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated if the ICER was located in the north-east quadrant [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Sensitivity analysis for the CEA was conducted to assess the effect of one extreme outlier. Sensitivity analyses for the CEA and CBA were conducted to assess the effect of reducing the intervention costs to &#x020ac;30 per participant. This reduction in costs was calculated under the assumption that, in practice, OPs will treat more workers according to the intervention than the 80 workers that were included in the intervention group of the present study. In this way, the training costs of the intervention could be divided over more workers causing a reduction in intervention costs per worker. Based on the OHS&#x02019;s data, every OP treats 2500 to 3000 workers of which 32 to 39 experience sickness absence due to CMDs within one year [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Taking the conservative assumption that OPs can treat 24 of the 32 to 39 workers according to the intervention per year, the intervention training costs for the 73 OPs that participated in the study can be divided over 1752 (73 x 24) workers, leading to a total amount of &#x020ac;30 per worker instead of &#x020ac;661 (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>).

From a societal perspective, there were no significant differences in health care costs between the SHARP group and CAU group. Employer costs for occupational health care were significantly higher in the SHARP group compared to CAU. Costs due to lost productivity did not significantly differ between the two study groups. Thus, to realise the effect on recurrent sickness absence, additional monetary investments in the SHARP-at work intervention were needed. Even though an economic benefit of the intervention was not found, a societal benefit may be realised when the reduction in recurrent sickness absence results in more stable work participation.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses for the CEA excluding one major outlier changed the direction of the primary CEA results. Excluding the outlier, the SHARP-at work intervention was cost-effective in preventing the incidence of recurrent sickness absence and increasing time to recurrent sickness absence.</p><p>Although the SHARP-at work intervention was effective in reducing the incidence of recurrent sickness absence and increased the time to recurrent sickness absence, the CBA showed no effect on reduced costs of productivity loss. This result might be counterintuitive as a reduced incidence of recurrent sickness absence would be expected to result in reduced sickness absence days and, thus, reduced costs due to productivity loss. However, costs due to productivity loss were found to be somewhat higher for the SHARP group, meaning that the SHARP group had more sickness absence days. This result may be partly explained by the fact that the CAU group had a shorter duration of sickness absence and a higher RTW percentage at baseline, resulting in less sickness absence days. Possibly, the study&#x02019;s one-year follow-up timeframe was too short to pick up long-term effects on sickness absence.</p><p>No previous studies have been published on an economic evaluation of an intervention to prevent recurrent sickness absence in workers who returned to work after sickness absence due to CMDs. Recently, several studies were published on economic evaluations of RTW interventions for workers with mental health problems [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Comparing our study results with these RTW studies is complicated as the study populations and the effect measures differ. The participants in the RTW studies were still off work and the interventions aimed to facilitate RTW. Effect measures in the economic evaluations of these RTW studies are focused on days to first or full RTW. Most of the RTW studies showed no economic benefit of the RTW intervention under investigation [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><sec id="s4.1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of this study are the pragmatic design, data collection on productivity loss and the use of a societal and employer perspective for the economic evaluation. Firstly, the pragmatic study design enabled an economic evaluation of the SHARP-at work intervention in a real life situation and in a heterogeneous study population. Participants lived in different parts of the Netherlands, worked for small and large companies in different branches and occupied various job positions. This increased the external validity of the study results. Secondly, data on productivity loss included costs due to self-reported lost productivity at work, i.e. presenteeism, next to costs due to sickness absence. Even though information on productivity loss at work was only collected for 51% of the study sample, the CBA including this information gives a clear indication of the underestimation of productivity loss costs when only using sickness absence data and assuming that participants are 100% productive when at work. As presenteeism seems to be an important contributor to productivity loss among workers with mental health problems, this is an important variable to include in economic evaluations [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, previous studies on the economic benefit of occupational health care interventions for workers with mental health problems often missed information on presenteeism [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Lastly, the cost-effectiveness evaluation from the broad societal perspective increased the generalisability of the results, while the cost-benefit analysis from the employer perspective provided a realistic perspective on the distribution of costs and benefits of the SHARP-at work intervention within the Dutch social security context.</p><p>Some methodological limitations need to be considered. Data on health care utilisation were collected based on retrospective, self-reported questionnaires which may have biased the results. Although participants received diaries to keep track of health care utilisation to improve the reliability of the self-reported questionnaires, these diaries were sent for participants&#x02019; own convenience and not recollected. Thus, we were not able to check whether the diaries were used. Furthermore, data on health care utilisation during the past month were only collected at four measurement points and were linearly interpolated to 12 months, assuming a linear time trend in health care utilisation. Health care costs may have been overestimated or underestimated if health care utilisation between two time measurements was not linear over time. However, this probably will not have affected the direction of our results, as the health care costs only presented a small proportion of the total costs and data were linearly interpolated for both study groups. Another limitation is the missing data due to loss to follow-up: 62% of the participants had complete cost data. By using a bootstrap procedure with 5000 replications for the CEA, the problem of missing data was partly averted. Furthermore, we chose to conduct complete case analysis because we assumed that the data was missing completely at random: no significant differences were found between participants who were lost to follow-up and those who completed the study (Arends et al., submitted for publication). One exception might have been the data collected on productivity loss at work. Many participants responded to this question with a question mark, indicating that participants had trouble understanding this item. Therefore, we decided to also conduct the CBA excluding the information on lost productivity at work. As 62% of the data could be used for the CEA and CBA and no power calculation was conducted for the economic evaluation, it could be possible that the study was underpowered. For example, sensitivity analyses excluding one major outlier in the intervention group showed that the CEA results were strongly influenced by this outlier as the direction of the results changed after excluding the outlier. It should also be acknowledged that using the wage costs of hours off work and hours not being productive while at work may not be the best measures for assessing productivity loss. Productivity loss also depends on the level of teamwork, the time sensitivity of output and the replaceability of a worker. Finally, no information was collected on the costs of workplace adaptations that possibly resulted from the SHARP-at work intervention. This might have caused an underestimation of the intervention costs. However, costs due to possible workplace adaptations would be difficult to measure in a population of workers with CMDs. These workers do not so much require adaptations in workplace equipment or design but are more in need of, for example, frequent/longer breaks, lower work pace or other job content [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] of which the costs are hard to estimate. Comparable workplace adaptations could also have been introduced in the CAU group, as participants in this group also had consultations with their OPs. Thus, differences in total health care costs between the two study groups would probably not drastically increase by including costs related to workplace adaptations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The SHARP-at work intervention is effective in reducing recurrent sickness absence and in increasing time to recurrent sickness absence but is associated with higher costs compared to CAU. Bearing in mind the study&#x02019;s limitations, future research needs to confirm that the SHARP-at work intervention is not cost-effective and cost-beneficial. As implementation of the SHARP-at work intervention might require additional investments, health care policy makers need to decide if these investments are worthwhile considering the results that can be accomplished in reducing recurrent sickness absence.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank 365/ArboNed and the OPs that participated in the study for their collaboration.
