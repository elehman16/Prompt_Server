Non-inferiority of CDA versus AL for efficacy was evaluated in the Day 28 per-protocol (PP) population using parasitological cure (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-corrected). Cure rates were 94.1&#x00025; (703/747) for CDA and 97.4&#x00025; (369/379) for AL (treatment difference &#x02013;3.3&#x00025;, 95&#x00025;CI &#x02013;5.6, &#x02212;0.9). CDA was non-inferior to AL, but there was simultaneous superiority of AL (upper 95&#x00025;CI limit &#x0003c;0). Adequate clinical and parasitological response at Day 28 (uncorrected for reinfection) was 79&#x00025; (604/765) with CDA and 83&#x00025; (315/381) with AL. In patients with a G6PD-deficient genotype (94/603 [16&#x00025;] hemizygous males, 22/598 [4&#x00025;] homozygous females), CDA had the propensity to cause severe and clinically concerning hemoglobin decreases: the mean hemoglobin nadir was 75 g/L (95&#x00025;CI 71, 79) at Day 7 versus 97 g/L (95&#x00025;CI 91, 102) for AL.

Early treatment failure is the development of severe malaria by Day 3 with parasitemia, or parasitemia on Day 2 higher than on Day 0, or parasitemia on Day 3 with fever, or Day 3 parasitemia &#x02265;25&#x00025; of Day 0 count. Late clinical failure is the development of severe malaria after Day 3 with parasitemia, or parasitemia and fever from Day 4&#x02212;28, without previous early treatment failure. Late parasitological failure is parasitemia on Day 7&#x02212;28 with fever, without previous early treatment failure or late clinical failure.</p><p>Other secondary outcomes included: asexual parasite and gametocyte counts; mean parasite clearance time (time at which asexual parasites became undetectable and remained so for &#x02265;48 h); and mean fever clearance time (time at which temperature normalized and remained so for &#x02265;48 h).</p><p>Adverse events were defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory test result), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Adverse events were recorded at all clinic visits and coded using MedDRA (Version 10.1).

For the PP population, a logistic regression model was fitted to estimate treatment effect adjusted for country, age (&#x0003c;5 years, 5&#x02013;&#x0003c;15 years), and baseline parasitemia (categorized by &#x02264;33&#x00025;, &#x0003e;33&#x02013;&#x0003c;67&#x00025;, and &#x02265;67&#x00025; quantile). Descriptive statistics were provided for secondary endpoints (PP and ITT populations) and safety outcomes (ITT population).</p><p>For patients who were failures owing to new infections (determined using PCR), both PP and ITT analyses deemed these subjects to be successes at that time point. However, at subsequent time points, the PP analyses considered these patients as missing and the ITT analysis assumed that they were failures.</p><p>Patients with missing data at the relevant time point were excluded from PP analyses of efficacy data (PCR-adjusted parasitological cure and ACPR). In the ITT analyses, treatment failure was imputed for missing data. For example, a patient with no Day 28 parasite count would be excluded from the primary endpoint and ACPR PP analyses but included as a treatment failure in the supporting ITT analyses. If a patient was missing a parasite assessment before Day 28, this would not affect assessment of Day 28 parasitological cure, whereas for ACPR, treatment failure could not be assessed and the patient would be excluded from the PP analysis with an imputation of failure in the corresponding ITT analysis.</p><p>Comparisons of CDA and AL for the hemoglobin safety composite endpoint and changes in hemoglobin versus baseline were analyzed by the following G6PD genotype categories: G6PD normal, G6PD heterozygous females, and G6PD deficient (hemizygous A&#x02212; males and homozygous A&#x02212;/A&#x02212; females). Logistic regression modeling was used to quantify the impact of G6PD genotype, weight, age, baseline hemoglobin, baseline parasitemia, and treatment on hemoglobin safety endpoints.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participant flow</title><p>Participant flow is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006682-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

CDA was non-inferior to AL, but AL was simultaneously superior to CDA. An adjusted logistic regression analysis (PP population) also showed AL superiority. Non-inferiority of CDA to AL for the primary efficacy endpoint was not maintained at Day 42.

Thus, the drugs are potentially pharmacodynamically more similar than their pharmacokinetics would suggest.</p><p>Although this study was designed primarily to assess efficacy, the most clinically important findings relate to safety, specifically G6PD-related hemolysis in the CDA group. The 2&#x02236;1 CDA:AL randomization schedule was chosen to provide adequate data for a meaningful analysis of CDA safety. Also, we defined a composite hemoglobin safety endpoint based on laboratory data for hemoglobin declines of clinical concern and blood transfusion events. Overall, the main risk factors associated with the composite endpoint were G6PD deficiency versus G6PD normal (OR 16.3, 95&#x00025;CI 8.6, 31.2) and CDA treatment versus AL (OR 5.1, 95&#x00025;CI 2.1, 12.4). In G6PD-deficient patients (hemizygous males and homozygous females), 35&#x00025; met the composite endpoint criteria with CDA versus none with AL. Of particular concern was that 12/15 patients requiring blood transfusion were G6PD-deficient, and all in the CDA group.</p><p>This study was not powered to detect a difference in hematological safety in G6PD-deficient patients between treatment groups. However, subjects meeting the composite hemoglobin safety endpoint would clearly require hospital-based interventions. These are often difficult to access for the majority of malaria patients in sub-Saharan Africa. Based on the composite endpoint data, CDA has an unacceptable risk:benefit profile versus AL for the treatment of malaria in G6PD-deficient patients. Consequently, this population should not be exposed to CDA.</p><p>The prevalence of G6PD deficiency in this study was 16&#x00025; hemizygous males and 4&#x00025; homozygous females; a substantial sub-population. The lowest prevalence of G6PD deficiency was 7.7&#x00025; in Ibadan, though this is considerably lower than previous estimates, generally in excess of 20&#x00025; <xref rid="pone.0006682-Ademowo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Additionally, 14&#x00025; of patients were heterozygous females, only identifiable by genotyping.</p><p>G6PD phenotyping and genotyping are not generally available in Africa. Even if G6PD-deficient patients could be excluded, post-hoc regression analysis found that in G6PD-normal patients, the risk of a &#x02265;20 g/L hemoglobin decrease versus baseline was slightly increased with CDA versus AL (OR 1.4, 95&#x00025;CI 1.01, 1.96). The clinical relevance of this small difference is debatable, but further undermines CDA utility, given the availability of alternative agents. CDA was developed for use in Africa as a safe, affordable, effective and simple antimalarial. As these conditions cannot be met, the Joint Development Team decided to terminate CDA development and withdraw CPG&#x02212;DDS licenses.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Overall evidence</title><p>Although we knew that there would be some hemolytic effect of dapsone, the magnitude of the difference in this effect between CDA and AL in G6PD-deficient patients was unexpected <xref rid="pone.0006682-Beutler2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Phase II studies with CDA in children of unknown G6PD status had been encouraging, with decreases in hemoglobin until Day 3 but with recovery by Day 7, surpassing baseline values by Day 14 <xref rid="pone.0006682-Wootton1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. There was also marginally better hemoglobin recovery in the 4 mg/kg artesunate-containing arm versus CPG&#x02212;DDS alone, suggesting that the majority of the hemolysis was due to sub-optimal antimalarial therapy <xref rid="pone.0006682-Wootton1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, comparison of the timecourse for hemoglobin decline with CDA and AL is instructive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006682-g002">Figure 2</xref>). For AL, regardless of G6PD status, the nadir in hemoglobin concentration occurred at or before Day 3. With CDA, for G6PD normal and female heterozygotes, hemoglobin was significantly lower than with AL at Day 7 only. This was probably caused by dapsone-related shortening of erythrocyte lifespan. However, in G6PD-deficient patients, the decrease in hemoglobin with CDA was more marked, with a nadir at Day 7, and was significantly different from AL from Day 3 until Day 30. This clearly shows the effect of G6PD deficiency when oxidative and potentially hemolytic drugs are administered.</p><p>Dapsone had been used in malaria and leprosy for many years with no major safety concerns <xref rid="pone.0006682-World5" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0006682-Greenwood1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Thus, previous studies of CPG&#x02212;DDS without artesunate did not prospectively include G6PD genotyping or phenotyping. Also, concerns on frequent blood sampling in young children led to less comprehensive hemoglobin assessments than in the current study. Comparison of our data with CPG&#x02212;DDS clinical trials is, therefore, problematic.</p><p>In the CPG&#x02212;DDS safety study by Alloueche <italic>et al</italic>., Day 3 and Day 14 data were sparse, but at Day 7 there was a significantly larger decrease in mean hemoglobin with CPG&#x02212;DDS than for the comparator sulfadoxine&#x02212;pyrimethamine (SP): treatment difference &#x02212;4 g/L (95&#x00025;CI &#x02212;6, &#x02212;2) <xref rid="pone.0006682-Alloueche1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In the current trial, the difference between CDA and AL for Day 7 mean hemoglobin was not greatly dissimilar when considering the overlap in 95&#x00025;CIs: &#x02212;7 g/L (95&#x00025;CI &#x02212;9, &#x02212;4). However, the effect of the sparse hemoglobin sampling in the Alloueche <italic>et al</italic>. study becomes evident when the proportion of patients with hemoglobin decreases of &#x02265;20 g/L at any time point is examined; this was 16&#x00025; for both CPG&#x02212;DDS and SP <xref rid="pone.0006682-Alloueche1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We know that both CPG&#x02212;DDS and SP cause hemolysis, and yet the proportion of patients in the current study with hemoglobin decreases of &#x02265;20 g/L was 33&#x00025; for CDA and 24&#x00025; for AL. If the data sets were comparable, we would expect CPG&#x02212;DDS and SP to have results approximating those for CDA, or at least a greater proportion of clinically important hemoglobin decreases than with AL.</p><p>The position becomes even more complicated when the limited analysis of hemoglobin declines by G6PD genotype in the Alloueche <italic>et al</italic>. study is considered. G6PD status was assessed retrospectively and only in a subset of patients, i.e. some patients with a &#x02265;20 g/L hemoglobin drop and matched controls (by age and sex). There was no excess risk for a &#x02265;20 g/L hemoglobin drop with CPG&#x02212;DDS versus SP in G6PD-normal or G6PD-deficient patients (classified as A&#x02212; or A&#x02212;/A&#x02212;). However, for female heterozygotes, there was an excess risk with CD versus SP <xref rid="pone.0006682-Alloueche1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Although this analysis can provide an idea of the risk of haemolysis for CD relative to SP, it cannot give a true odds ratio for the risk of haemolysis for G6PD-deficient relative to G6PD-normal patients. Moreover, the Alloueche <italic>et al</italic>. results are in direct contrast to all of the G6PD-based analyses reported here, where G6PD-deficient patients were at greater risk of hemolytic events versus G6PD-normal and female heterozygote patients. Our study indicates that frequent hemoglobin assessment plus comprehensive G6PD genotype data are required for an adequate analysis of hemolytic potential in the G6PD-deficient sub-population.</p><p>A recently published study conducted in Rwanda comparing CDA versus amodiaquine (AQ) plus SP for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria is also informative <xref rid="pone.0006682-Fanello1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006682-Fanello2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In this study, G6PD genotyping was available for the majority of patients. Packed cell volume (hematocrit) was evaluated, so direct comparison to our results is not possible. Although both CDA and AQ&#x0002b;SP caused mild hemolysis in G6PD-normal patients, hemolysis was more profound in G6PD-deficient patients with CDA, but not AQ&#x0002b;SP. However, in light of its continued widespread use, the risk:benefit of SP with regard to hematological safety in G6PD-normal and -deficient malaria patients needs to be properly investigated versus a non-hemolytic comparator, such as AL.</p><p>One important question is whether the hemolysis observed here is new to CDA or would have been seen with CPG&#x02212;DDS versus AL. Preliminary results from a second Phase III clinical trial of similar design indicate no major differences in hematological safety between CDA and CPG&#x02212;DDS (personal communication P. Winstanley).</p><p>There were some limitations in the hematological data collected in this study. A validated methemoglobin test, suitable for clinic use, was only available towards the end of the study. Consequently, only 32 patients from two centers (Eldoret and Calabar) had screening and post-baseline methemoglobin data. Collection of reticulocyte data was not automated and there was no quality control process. On examination, reticulocyte percent and absolute data could not be interpreted and the results are not presented. G6PD phenotypic data were only available for 632/1372 (46&#x00025;) patients because of logistical problems in transporting samples to a central laboratory within a narrow time window and data are not presented. The difficulties in obtaining sufficient G6PD phenotype data quickly hampered assessment of safety within the G6PD-deficient population by the IDMC during the recruitment phase. For the limited data available, concordance of a G6PD-deficient phenotype with genotype in hemizygous males was 271/313 (87&#x00025;), and phenotype findings supported genotype findings with respect to both G6PD-deficiency prevalence and hemoglobin safety.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled clinical Phase III multi-centre study to include a component investigating the relationship between hematological safety and G6PD deficiency. There is no accepted in vitro test or in vivo model to determine the potential for G6PD-related hemolysis. G6PD genotyping and separate analysis of hemizygous males/homozygous females versus heterozygote females and G6PD-normal patients was necessary to show the clinical importance of the interaction between CDA and G6PD deficiency for hematological safety. Our results highlight that new antimalarials, such as AL, may have significant safety as well as efficacy benefits over older therapies, illustrating the need to conduct comprehensive Phase III trials of antimalarial combination therapies against relevant comparators, even when the components are already approved individually. It also highlights the challenges of developing therapies for populations harboring G6PD deficiency and possibly other polymorphisms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006682.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist</p><p>(0.07 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006682.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006682.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.44 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006682.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Professor Lucio Luzzatto for his review of the manuscript and helpful comments.
