Manual physical therapy (MPT) offers a non-invasive approach with negligible risk for managing SIS. There is limited evidence to suggest significant long-term improvements in pain, strength and disability with the use of MPT, and there are conflicting reports from systematic reviews that question the long-term efficacy of CSI. Specifically, the primary objective is to compare the effect of CSI and MPT on pain and disability in subjects with SIS at 12&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>This pragmatic randomised clinical trial will be a mixed-model 2&#x000d7;5 factorial design. The independent variables are treatment (MPT and CSI) and time with five levels from baseline to 1&#x02005;year. The primary dependent variable is the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, and the secondary outcome measures are the Global Rating of Change and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. For each ANOVA, the hypothesis of interest will be the two-way group-by-time interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The authors plan to recruit 104 participants meeting established impingement criteria. Following examination and enrolment, eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receive a pragmatic approach of either CSI or MPT. The MPT intervention will consist of six sessions, and the CSI intervention will consist of one to three sessions. All subjects will continue to receive usual care. Subjects will be followed for 12&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Dissemination and ethics</title><p>The protocol was approved by the Madigan Army Medical Center Institutional Review Board. The results may have an impact on clinical practice guidelines.

Individual randomisation assignments will be concealed according to the following procedure. The group assignment will be recorded on a label that is affixed to a 3.5&#x000d7;5&#x02005;inch index card. This card will be folded in half such that the label with the patient's group assignment will be on the inside of the fold.

The goal of MPT is to improve the quality of motion and decrease the pain associated with motion at the target joint and soft tissue. For our purposes, we define our MPT as the combination of manual techniques to include joint mobilisations (both thrust and non-thrust techniques), soft-tissue mobilisations, manual stretches and contract&#x02013;relax techniques, along with the exercises that help reinforce those techniques. We feel this is consistent not only with other shoulder trials, but also with other MPT trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33 b34 b35">33&#x02013;35</xref> The application of techniques will not be based on a regimented protocol that is identical for each patient, but rather tailored specifically to the impairments identified during the clinical examination. We feel this approach is pragmatic and consistent with the actual delivery of MPT in the clinical setting.</p><p>The examiner will provide an initial intervention of MPT that is targeted to impairments found during the initial clinical examination (the patient will return for a maximum total of six treatment sessions over the following 3&#x02005;weeks). Each session will last approximately 30&#x02005;min. The subjects will receive some of the protocol exercises (appendix 2) to augment the joint mobilisations, which will collectively make up the MPT intervention.</p><p>The clinicians providing the MPT are two fellowship-trained orthopaedic manual physical therapists, who both received training in the same 18-month programme, to ensure consistency with delivery of this intervention approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Corticosteroid injection</title><p>The examiner will perform a standardised clinical examination and health screening in order to confirm the absence of contraindications to steroid injection. The subject will then receive an injection in the subacromial space of the symptomatic shoulder by a senior Sports Medicine Fellowship Trained Family Physician (appendix 3). The subject will also receive a handout explaining the effects of the steroid injection and how to manage any potential flare-ups or ensuing pain, and a handout describing pendulum exercises for the subject to perform. The physician will spend approximately 30&#x02005;min with each subject explaining the rationale for the injection, relevant anatomy, performing the procedure and reviewing the pendulum exercises.</p><p>The subject can receive up to a total of two shoulder injections with a minimum of 1&#x02005;month between injections if they are not getting relief of symptoms with the initial injection. This will be dictated by patient preference and the approval/recommendation of the physician performing the injection procedure, as this would represent a pragmatic approach commensurate with standard practice.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary DV will be the SPADI, and the secondary DVs will be the GRC and the NPRS.</p><sec><title>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index</title><p>SPADI is a 100-point, 13-item self-administered questionnaire, divided into two subscales: a five-item pain subscale and an eight-item disability subscale. Williams <italic>et al</italic> have shown that the SPADI is responsive to change and accurately discriminates between patients who are improving or worsening.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> A high test&#x02013;retest reliability and internal consistency for this instrument has been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> A recent systematic review identified a minimal detectable change of 18 points and a minimally clinically important difference (MCID) of 8&#x02013;13 points.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> The validity and responsiveness to change of SPADI have been described in physical therapy, as well as primary- and secondary-care settings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref></p><p>Because disability will be used as an outcome of interest, it is important to ensure a moderate level of disability will be present at the inception of the treatment. Thus, patients will be required to have at least a baseline SPADI score of 20 points (average of pain and disability subscales). A score of 0 indicates no pain or functional limitation with the described activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Global Rating of Change questionnaire</title><p>The GRC questionnaire is an instrument that measures overall changes in the quality of life of the subject.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> The use of a GRC is a common, feasible and useful method for assessing outcome,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> and has been shown to be a valid measurement of change in patient status in other pain populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> A change in score of three rating points (+3) has been established as clinically significant in the patients perception of quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> The GRC has 15 possible choices, with 0 being equal to no change, &#x02212;1 to &#x02212;7 indicating a negative change and +1 to +7 indicating a positive change.</p></sec><sec><title>Numeric Pain-Rating Scale</title><p>An 11-point pain-rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) will be used to assess pain intensity in the shoulder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> This scale has been demonstrated to be reliable and generalisable, and to have internal consistency in measures of clinical and experimental pain sensation intensity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> A change of at least three points has been suggested as the MCID for the NPRS in patients with shoulder pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Justification of sample size</title><p>The calculations were based on detecting a 12-point (or 9.2% change&#x02014;based on reported MCID range of 8&#x02013;13 points)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> difference in the SPADI with a standard deviation of 10 points, a two-tailed test and an &#x003b1; level =0.05. This generates a sample size of 43 subjects per group. Allowing for a conservative dropout or loss to follow-up rate of approximately 20%, we will recruit 104 subjects into the study. Planning for a larger loss to follow-up rate is deemed necessary in this military population where follow-up at 1&#x02005;year can be challenging with multiple deployments and changes in duty station around the world. This sample size will yield greater than 80% power to detect both statistically significant and clinically meaningful changes in the other outcome variables. Sample-size estimation was performed with G*Power software, V 3.1.2.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics will be run on the demographic data (age, gender, race, etc) and health characteristics of the study population to include measures of central tendency (means, medians other percentiles) and dispersion (standard deviations, ranges) which will be computed for continuous data for summary. Frequency distributions will be estimated for categorical data. Graphical displays including histograms and box plots will be produced. Transformations will be sought for variables to be included in further analyses to ensure distributional assumptions are met.</p><p>We will examine the primary aim using a linear mixed model with repeated measures to account for the correlation among repeated observations from the same patient. Time (baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months) and treatment group (MPT and CSI) will be modelled as fixed effects, with the SPADI questionnaire as the primary dependent variable. A separate model will be constructed in a similar fashion with pain (NPRS) and the GRC as the DV. The hypothesis of interest will be the group-by-time interaction. Treatment effects will be calculated from the between-group differences in change score from baseline to 1, 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months. No patients will be removed from the analysis for lack of adherence to treatment procedures. Missing data points will be estimated in the mixed model analyses using restricted maximum likelihood ratio estimation with 100 iterations. If one treatment is shown to be superior to the other, supplemental analyses will be performed by dichotomising groups based on minimal clinically important differences of 13% for the SPADI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> This will allow computation of absolute risk reduction, relative risk reduction and number needed to treat (with associated 95% CIs) using failure to obtain clinically meaningful benefit as the event of interest. The level of significance for all analyses will be a priori established at 0.05 using a two-tailed test.</p><p>Because of potential crossover between groups, data will be analysed using both per-protocol and intention-to-treat principles. The per-protocol analyses will only include patients who completed the study in the group to which they were randomly assigned. The intention-to-treat analyses will include all patients who were randomised at baseline regardless if they crossed over. Data analysis will be conducted using SPSS for Windows V 16.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial organisation and monitoring</title><p>The investigative team includes the authors listed in this protocol, in addition to three other licensed physical therapists who will assist with subject screening, data collection, subject follow-up and data entry. The principal investigator will manage data flow and perform audits of the procedures, enrolment and treatment throughout the entire process of the study. The associate investigators will monitor the data-collection process and data integrity with periodic evaluation performed continually during the course of the data-collection phase.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomised clinical trial will be the first study that directly compares the short- and long-term effects of an impairment-based MPT approach and CSI for patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. The results of this study may help to establish best clinical practice guidelines for this patient population.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations and dissemination</title><p>All interventions provided in this study are considered standard of care and could be given to a patient as part of their treatment plan even if they were not part of this study. An ethics review will be conducted by Madigan Army Medical Center and monitored by the US Army Medical Department Clinical Investigation Regulatory Office to ensure compliance with federal regulations for protection of human medical research subjects.
