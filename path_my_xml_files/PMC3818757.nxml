strengthening the hip flexor and extensor muscles on functional gait of stroke patients.
[Subjects and Methods] Twenty patients were randomized into two groups. Both groups
performed conventional physical therapy for six weeks. The experimental group also
performed isokinetic eccentric resistance exercises for the hip flexor and extensor
muscles. The hip muscle strength, stair up and down time, TUG time(timed up and go test),
and 10&#x02005;m gait velocity were measured at the baseline, and after 3 weeks, and 6 weeks of
treatment. [Results] The experimental showed significant improvements compared to the
baseline in hip muscle strength, stair up and down time, TUG time and 10&#x02005;m gait velocity
after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. After 3 and 6 weeks of treatment, there were gains in
hip muscle strength and 10&#x02005;m gait velocity. The control group showed no significant
increase in hip muscle strength, stair up and down time, TUG time or 10&#x02005;m gait velocity.
[Conclusion] We consider that conventional physical therapy contributes to the improvement
of functional gait of stroke patients. However, it is more desirable to perform isokinetic
eccentric resistance exercises for hip flexor and extensor muscles combined with
conventional physical therapy for the improvement of hip muscle strength, stair up and
down time, TUG time and 10&#x02005;m gait velocity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Functional gait</kwd><kwd>Isokinetic exercise</kwd><kwd>Stroke patients</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Muscle weakness in the affected lower limb of stroke patients is a major factor inhibiting
gait ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Isometric exercise,
isotonic exercise, and isokinetic exercise are used as resistance exercises to increase
muscle strength<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Isokinetic exercise is a method that enables the muscle to exert
maximum strength within the exercise range of all joints at a constant speed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various exercise methods are performed with
the purpose of strengthening the muscles in the affected lower limb of stroke patients, and
isokinetic exercise has been proposed as an effective exercise method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that eccentric isokinetic exercise is
effective at muscle strengthening of stroke patients, and includes eccentric contraction
which is used in our daily lives, as well as providing more independent and economic
movement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In 1988, Dean proposed that
eccentric exercise is a better exercise treatment for patients with limited exercise ability
then concentric exercise. This is because it is more effective at muscle strengthening, yet
requires low oxygen consumption<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
advantage of isokinetic eccentric resistance exercise for stroke patients lies in the
improvement in muscle strength of weak muscles, and the fact that isokinetic contraction is
widely used for in movement in our daily lives<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, it has been suggested that the muscle strengths of the hip
joint flexor and plantar flexor muscles determine the gait velocity of stroke patients, and
muscle strength of the knee extensor and stability of gait are highly related to one
another<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscles surrounding the hip
joint play a role in maintaining the stability of the trunk in the stance phase and control
the lower limb in the swing phase. Therefore, the weakening of these muscles may become a
main cause of abnormal gait<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Particularly, hip joint extensor strength is related to gait velocity and is the dominant
muscle in stability control and posture maintenance of the knee joint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, when the extensor of the hip joint is weakened,
anterior weight shift of the lower limb becomes difficult and the flexor of the hip joint is
used to increase the velocity of the lower limb in gait initiation and the stance phase.
However, it is a small muscle compared to the extensor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hip joint extensors and flexors are considered to be very important
muscles throughout the stance phase and they are essential for safe and functional gait.
Previous studies have only focused on the knee joint, and there is a lack of understanding
about improvement of muscle strength and function of stroke patients form a broader
perspective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Characteristics</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group (n=10)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=10)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="top" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Age (yr)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.40&#x000b1;9.71</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.86&#x000b1;10.56</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Diagnosis</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Infarction</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemorrhage</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Sex</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Affected Side </td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p> (Mean&#x000b1;SD)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Twenty in-patients of J general hospital, Gyeonggi-do, were selected as subjects.

living. Particularly, gait is essential for leading an independent life. Thus, it is
important to analyze the gait of hemiplegic patients and related aspects. The main causes of
abnormal gait in hemiplegic patients are decreases in muscle activity, decrease in weight
support ability and lack of balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, in order to resolve the problem of abnormal gait, we conducted muscle
strengthening exercises and examined their influence on balance and gait velocity which were
evaluated using functional tests.</p><p>In this study, the experimental group showed significant increases compared to before the
experiment in muscle strength, gait velocity, and TUG and stair up and down times after 3
and 6 weeks of treatment.</p><p>These results agree with the result of Seo et al., who showed that the maximum couple force
of the knee joint flexor and extensor muscles and the total amount of work were
significantly correlated with angular velocity, gait velocity, and stair up and down and sit
and stand times<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Seo et al. also found
a statistically significant improvement the modified Rankin scale after 6 weeks execution of
isokinetic eccentric exercises for the affected lower limb of chronic hemiplegic
patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Chon et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a comparative
analysis with an isokinetic exercise treatment group that performed isokinetic exercise in
addition to normal exercise treatment, and a control group that performed only normal
exercise treatment. The maximum couple force, total amount of work, gait velocity and the
circumference of the thigh had significantly increased in the isokinetic exercise treatment
group after 6 weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. From the above
results, we infer that the addition of isokinetic exercise treatment to normal exercise
treatment is of great help in the functional recovery of stroke patients. Reviewing the
results of isokinetic exercise reported in previous studies, we found that better results
were displayed with changes in angular velocity as it motivated subjects or provided an
environment facilitating the efficient improvement of muscle strength.</p><p>However, in a study that examined the effects of 6 weeks of muscle strengthening by
isokinetic resitance exercise on the functional improvement of the knee joint of chronic
stroke patients, no significant differences were displayed in stair up and down and TUG
times even though there were improvements in muscle strength and gait velocity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study examined the effect of
isokinetic exercise on the improvement of gait, muscle strength, and quality of life of 20
chronic stroke patients. The results showed there was no significant functional improvement,
even though there was improvement in muscle strength. In that study, isokinetic resistance
exercise was performed by the flexor and extensor muscles of the hip, knee, and ankle joints
for 45 minutes per day, 3 days per week for 6 weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The recovery of motor control ability normally occurs within 3
months after stroke onset<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and we
consider that the improvement in motor control was rather small because the subjects of
preceding studies were chronic stroke patients more than 6 months from stroke onset.
Therefore, it is necessary to reset the intervention period for qualitative improvement. In
order to promote improvement in the function of chronic stroke patients, the results of
previous studies suggest that more treatment time is required considering the fact that the
duration since stroke onset was longer. Also, it can be considered that sufficient treatment
time and period is necessary for the recovery of motor functions. With regard to the
exercise type, the common factor in preceding studies that accelerated improvement in the
function of stroke patients, through additional exercise, was the provision of task-oriented
and multidimensional exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
means that additional application of comprehensive exercise tasks is necessary since not
one, but several motor abilities are impaired by stroke. In conclusion, the present study
revealed that not only sufficient treatment time and muscle strengthening exercises for the
hip joint are required, but also muscle strengthening exercises for the knee and ankle
joints are necessary for the functional improvement of chronic stroke patients. Future
studies should investigate treatment methods that may be of great help in the improvement of
not only muscle strength but also various functions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Namseoul University Research Fund.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Engardt</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Knutsson</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Jonsson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal> et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Dynamic muscle strength training in stroke patients:
