All OCT devices have an in-built Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid with nine zones (subfields) centred on the fovea (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Centre-involving diabetic macular oedema is defined as presence of oedema in zone 1. Non-centre-involving diabetic macular oedema is oedema restricted to one or more of zones 2&#x02013;9. The zone of maximum retinal thickness can be monitored over time to assess the course of disease. However, diabetic macular oedema can appear and disappear at any zone and might represent worsening of disease despite resolution of oedema at the zone of maximum retinal thickness. Therefore, response to treatment must be assessed objectively by looking at several variables, including change in retinal thickness in all nine zones as well as total macular volume.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Not all patients with centre-involving diabetic macular oedema have impaired vision.

We identified no randomised trials. Non-centre-involving diabetic macular oedema can progress to the centre of the macula and cause visual impairment. Standard treatment for centre-involving diabetic macular oedema with visual impairment is repeated intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents. Other treatment options include macular laser and intravitreal steroids. Many investigators have evaluated less invasive treatment options for non-centre-involving macular oedema to delay or prevent disease progression but have been unsuccessful. Rod photoreceptors in the retina consume a maximum amount of oxygen during dark adaptation. In diabetes, the resultant hypoxia can contribute to development and progression of diabetic macular oedema and diabetic retinopathy. Two short-term clinical trials showed that wearing light masks emitting 500&#x02013;505 nm light through the eyelids to decrease dark adaptation reduced the rate of progression of diabetic retinopathy and early diabetic macular oedema, respectively. In an abstract, 45 healthy volunteers wore an organic light-emitting sleep mask to prevent dark adaptation and showed no safety concerns at 4 months. 24% withdrew from the intervention before 1 month because of light intolerance and sleep disturbance. In another abstract, a light-emitting sleep mask to prevent dark adaptation in six patients with refractory clinically significant diabetic macular oedema showed good acceptability and tolerance for five patients at 6 months. As far as we know, no randomised controlled trials have been done to assess the role of light masks during sleep as a novel treatment for patients with non-central diabetic macular oedema. A study assessing the safety and acceptability of an organic light-emitting sleep mask (Noctura 400 Sleep Mask, PolyPhotonix Medical, Sedgefield, UK) in healthy volunteers (n=45) and patients with diabetic macular oedema (n=15) reported no clinically relevant safety issues at 4 months. 16 withdrew from the study, eight before month 1. The mean change in maximum retinal thickness in eyes with diabetic macular oedema at 4 months was &#x02212;12&#x000b7;00 &#x003bc;m (range &#x02212;28&#x000b7;80 to 4&#x000b7;80). A recent publication also showed good compliance with the light masks in diabetic macular oedema at 6 months.</p><p id="para60"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para70">The CLEOPATRA trial is, to our knowledge, the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of an organic light-emitting sleep mask as a treatment option for non-centre-involving diabetic macular oedema. The 24-month follow-up period provides data for efficacy, safety, and compliance of wearing these light masks for this condition. The results show that the light masks as used in this study did not provide any discernible clinical benefit. No differences were recorded between wearing and not wearing these light masks in the change in thickness in the zone of maximum retinal thickness, total macular volume, progression of the oedema to the centre, proportion of patients requiring standard treatment for diabetic macular oedema, and progression of diabetic retinopathy. The analysis of compliance highlighted that wearing these light masks over 24 months might also not be a sustainable option, as compliance decreased over time. The results of the study were not accounted for by non-compliance of wearing the light masks. No light mask-related serious adverse events were recorded.</p><p id="para80"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para90">The CLEOPATRA study provides evidence that the light mask offered to prevent dark adaptation is not recommended as a treatment option for non-centre-involving diabetic macular oedema. Although earlier studies showed short-term improvement in diabetic oedema and diabetic retinopathy using 505 nm light masks, our study shows that compliance wearing the light masks during sleep is challenging and is therefore not a sustainable option. Since laboratory-based evidence of the role of photoreceptors in diabetic retinopathy is increasing, there remains an unmet need to translate this idea into interventions in patients.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para100">During dark adaptation, normal rod photoreceptors in the retina consume nearly all the oxygen available to the eye.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> In patients with diabetes the retinal oxygen supply is compromised and the hypoxic status during dark periods might exacerbate microvascular changes.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> This idea has been substantiated by the fact that oxygen supplementation alleviates diabetic macular oedema in the short term.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Sivaprasad and Arden<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> postulated that if dark adaptation could be prevented, diabetic macular oedema and diabetic retinopathy might be alleviated by decreasing the oxygen demand. Since dark adaptation in man only happens at night during sleep, sleeping in an environment illuminated with 500&#x02013;505 nm light should suppress rods and prevent or reverse diabetic macular oedema. A proof-of-concept study in 12 patients who slept at night using a mask containing a chemiluminescent source that exposed one eye only to light for 3 months showed that the treatment had no safety issues, was acceptable to patients, and both colour vision and microaneurysm count improved.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> A second study used light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to illuminate one eye with 505 nm light during sleep in 40 patients with bilateral diabetic macular oedema.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> 34 patients completed the study and an improvement in retinal function and a decrease in retinal thickness at 6 months was noted. Based on these observations, the Noctura 400 Sleep Mask (PolyPhotonix Medical, Sedgefield, UK) was CE-approved for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. The long-term effectiveness, compliance, and safety of light masks are unknown. We did a phase 3 clinical trial (CLEOPATRA) to investigate whether offering the light mask to wear over closed eyelids during sleep at night for 24 months could treat and prevent the progression of non-centre-involving diabetic macular oedema.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and patients</title><p id="para110">The CLEOPATRA study is a phase 3, multicentre, single-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial.

We also excluded eyes with active proliferative diabetic retinopathy or that were treated previously with panretinal photocoagulation. Systemic exclusion criteria included history of insomnia or any other sleep disturbances.</p><p id="para130">The study was granted approval by the National Research Ethics Committee Service London&#x02014;Dulwich (13/LO/0145). Trial Steering and Data Monitoring Committees provided independent oversight. A representative of the manufacturer was a non-voting member of the Trial Steering Committee. All eligible patients gave written informed consent before study participation.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p id="para140">We randomly allocated eligible patients (1:1) to wear during sleep either a light mask or a sham (non-light) mask, using the method of minimisation, concealed before allocation, stratified by HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x0003c;8% [63&#x000b7;89 mmol/mol] or &#x02265;8% [63&#x000b7;90 mmol/mol]), perifoveal (ETDRS zones 6&#x02013;9) versus parafoveal (ETDRS zones 2&#x02013;5) baseline thickness in excess of 320 &#x003bc;m in the perifoveal or parafoveal zones, and study site. For patients with the same baseline thickness in excess of 320 &#x003bc;m in the perifoveal or parafoveal zones, the parafoveal zone was chosen. Randomisation was done by collaborating site investigators via the King's Clinical Trials Unit web-based randomisation service. Patients and examining clinicians were aware of the study allocation because of the nature of the intervention. Patients assigned the sham mask had the option of not using it because it became apparent early in the study that many patients were not using it. Outcome assessors including OCT technicians, optometrists, and graders at the independent reading centre based at the Gloucestershire Eye Unit (Gloucester, UK) were unaware of treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p id="para150">The light mask used in the intervention arm was the Noctura 400 Sleep Mask (PolyPhotonix Medical). This CE-certified class 2a device is designed to deliver blue-green light through closed eyelids. The light mask consists of two battery-operated organic LEDs inserted within a fabric mask and placed over the patients' eyes using an adjustable velcro strap. It is operational for a maximum of 8 h therapy per night. The lifetime of the light mask is 84 days, after which time a replacement mask is required. Based on calculations done by the manufacturer, the light mask provides a luminance of 75 photopic cd/m<sup>2</sup> (&#x000b1;&#x02008;10%), equating to 186 scotopic cd/m<sup>2</sup>. After considering light attenuation through closed eyelids and pupillary diameter, these light masks are expected to cause 40% reduction in rod-circulating current. The decay of mask output over its lifetime is also maintained within 10% of the desired output. The light intensity we used is approximately six orders of magnitude less than for threshold toxicity and two orders below that which causes a 1% change in the melatonin cycle that drives circadian rhythms.</p><p id="para160">The light mask records automatically when it is being worn, providing an accurate measure of compliance. These data were downloaded by study sites when masks were returned. The manufacturer was also sent anonymised data from every returned light mask to measure compliance. We took the pragmatic decision that 6 h/day (4380 h over 2 years) was sufficient to represent 100% compliance and, therefore, represented the level at and above which maximum benefit would be derived. We defined compliance as patients who wore the masks 70% of the time (3066 h, counting time truncated to 6 h/day). If compliance data were missing for a day then we assumed no compliance (ie, the mask had not been worn that night).</p><p id="para170">The trial manager contacted study sites to request they take steps to maximise the rate of mask return, to ensure availability of compliance data. The trial manager followed the trial monitoring plan by undertaking off-site monitoring on a monthly basis. This process included contacting sites at which patients' compliance was less than 40%. The manufacturer also alerted the trial manager when patients had poor compliance. Moreover, during every on-site monitoring visit, sites were asked to reinforce with patients the importance of wearing the masks every night during sleep, and specific patients with issues of compliance were discussed. The Data Monitoring Committee, in closed meetings, reviewed the accumulating compliance data and concluded that a dose-effect of the light masks should also be evaluated by comparing the effect of the light masks at three levels of compliance (50%, 60%, and 70%). The protocol was amended to this effect and approved by the Trial Steering Committee, the sponsor, and the Research Ethics Committee.</p><p id="para180">The clinical assessments schedule is detailed in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 1)</xref> and in the published protocol.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> We recorded HbA<sub>1c</sub> at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. Patients had OCT assessments every 4 months, and these assessments were done twice at 12 months and 24 months to ensure that the treatment effect was distinguished from the test-retest variability. We recorded concomitant diabetic medications, anti-VEGF agents, steroids, and laser treatment throughout the study. We measured refracted best-corrected visual acuity at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months using validated ETDRS visual acuity charts, and we repeated these measurements at baseline to assess test-retest variability. We did three-field colour fundus photography at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months to grade the severity of diabetic retinopathy. Both the examining clinician and graders at the independent reading centre graded anatomical characteristics of the diabetic macular oedema and severity of diabetic retinopathy.

Assuming patients with unobserved outcome data in one or both treatment groups would take values as much as a prespecified 20 &#x003bc;m either side of the adjusted observed effect, all 95% CIs included 0 and excluded &#x02212;15, thus confirming that the absence of a clinically important light mask effect is robust to missing data (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 11</xref>). In the sensitivity analysis for non-compliance, the CACE estimate for compliers defined by 70% compliance was &#x02212;4&#x000b7;2 (95% CI &#x02212;44&#x000b7;6 to 36&#x000b7;1), 60% compliance was &#x02212;3&#x000b7;1 (&#x02212;32&#x000b7;4 to 26&#x000b7;3), and 50% compliance was &#x02212;2&#x000b7;5 (&#x02212;26&#x000b7;7 to 21&#x000b7;7). Across these three definitions of compliers, the results were consistent in estimating a small non-significant intervention effect, which was not close to the detectable effect of 15 &#x003bc;m retinal thickness.</p><p id="para350">In the sensitivity analysis of patients who met the requirement for treatment of centre-involving diabetic macular oedema (ie, retinal thickness reached 400 &#x003bc;m before the 24-month endpoint), the retinal thickness measurement taken just after the participant first reached 400 &#x003bc;m was carried forward to be their final measurement. Nine patients achieved 400 &#x003bc;m in central macula, of whom three had been assigned the sham mask (all achieved this point at 24 months) and six had been allocated the light mask (two achieved this point at 24 months, two at 20 months, and two at 12 months). 161 patients were included in this linear mixed-effects model and the adjusted difference between treatment groups was &#x02212;0&#x000b7;22 &#x003bc;m (95% CI &#x02212;8&#x000b7;36 to 7&#x000b7;92; p=0&#x000b7;96). 259 patients were included in the Cox proportional hazards regression time-to-event analysis (ie, time to reaching 400 &#x003bc;m), which was stratified by HbA<sub>1c</sub> (hazard ratio 2&#x000b7;0, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;5&#x02013;8&#x000b7;0; p=0&#x000b7;33). For the sensitivity analysis of potential differential variability between the light mask and sham mask over time in the zone of maximum baseline retinal thickness, which was done in 246 patients, the difference between treatment groups was not significant from baseline to 24 months (p=0&#x000b7;38). A sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome in patients who had OCT measurements taken with Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering) at baseline showed no difference between treatment groups (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 12</xref>).</p><p id="para360">In the secondary analyses of retinal thickness and volume, no significant differences were noted between the light mask and sham mask in change from baseline in central subfield thickness, total thickness of central and parafoveal zones, total retinal thickness measured over all nine zones, and total macular volume at 12 months and 24 months (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 13, 14</xref>). Analysis of secondary morphological outcomes showed that significantly more patients assigned the light mask had resolution of diffuse diabetic macular oedema at 12 months (difference between groups in change from baseline, &#x02212;13%, 95% CI &#x02212;23 to &#x02212;2; p=0&#x000b7;0246), but this effect was lost at 24 months (2%, &#x02212;10 to 14; p=0&#x000b7;75). Foveal cysts were somewhat reduced at 12 months (&#x02212;12%, 95% CI &#x02212;25 to 0&#x000b7;1; p=0&#x000b7;052) and 24 months (&#x02212;14%, &#x02212;27 to 0&#x000b7;3; p=0&#x000b7;054) in patients assigned the light mask compared with those allocated the sham mask.

Our results show that the light mask as offered in this study is not an effective option in the treatment or prevention of progression of non-central diabetic macular oedema. Although objective assessment of the reduction of maximum retinal thickness was our primary outcome, we have made our conclusion based on the primary outcome, per-protocol secondary analysis, and five prespecified sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome, and none of these analyses showed any therapeutic benefit of wearing these light masks. Moreover, because of the dynamic nature of diabetic macular oedema, we considered several secondary outcomes, including reduction in total retinal thickness, macular volume, progression of central subfield thickness to 300 &#x003bc;m or more, and the proportions of patients requiring treatment for new onset centre-involving diabetic macular oedema and of those treated with standard therapy during the trial due to worsening of diabetic macular oedema. None of the changes in these variables was significant between treatment groups, substantiating the results of the primary outcome. Furthermore, no treatment effect was noted in severity of diabetic retinopathy with these light masks. However, the light masks did significantly reduce diffuse diabetic macular oedema and visible cysts in outer ETDRS zones at 12 months, but this effect did not translate to a significant change in retinal thickness and the effect was not sustained at 24 months, suggesting that any positive morphological effects of these light masks on diabetic macular oedema is transient and minimal.</p><p id="para410">We expected compliance with light masks to be an issue based on findings of the phase 2 study<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and because non-centre-involving diabetic macular oedema is asymptomatic. Therefore, we made several efforts to tackle compliance-related issues in this study. First, we calculated the sample size with a 20% attrition rate, which is higher than most ophthalmic trials. Furthermore, we allowed for OCT measurements from clinic appointments to be used when patients attended the clinic visit and not a clinical trial visit appointment. We had also carefully considered the effect of non-compliance on the potential therapeutic effect of the light masks by incorporating a predefined CACE analysis for non-compliance at three levels&#x02014;70%, 60%, and 50%. Non-compliance was noted as early as 4 months into the trial and across all three definitions of compliance.</p><p id="para420">Compliance with use of light masks has varied between studies and can be partly explained by the differences in definitions used in determining compliance levels.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, this study is the first randomised trial evaluating the use of a light mask during sleep at night over 24 months and shows that compliance reduces over time in keeping with the adherence patterns of self-management strategies in asymptomatic diabetes.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Decline in adherence is rapid after the first 6 months of therapy in chronic diseases.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> The compliance levels observed in our study are in keeping with the WHO report<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> that shows that the mean adherence to long-term therapy in patients with chronic diseases is approximately 50%. Therefore, further studies should include additional interventions to increase patient engagement in wearing the light masks to evaluate whether this intervention is sustainable over the lifetime of their diabetic eye disease.</p><p id="para430">Both treatment groups showed a gradual mean reduction in the zone of maximum retinal thickness over 24 months. The reduction is within the SD that we used for the sample size calculation. The event rate of progression to centre-involving diabetic macular oedema was also similar to findings of previous reports.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p id="para440">The main strength of our study was that we ensured that the primary outcome was corroborated by a predefined sensitivity analysis and secondary analysis to reduce potential systemic biases in this dynamic condition. Other strengths included clear definition of objective endpoints, publication of the protocol, substantial public and patient involvement throughout the study, and strict assessment-assured high-quality data and preplanned analysis for expected non-compliance. The baseline characteristics of the trial population were typical for the intended patient population. The representative multiethnic patient population, together with the multicentre trial design, permit wide generalisability of our results.</p><p id="para450">Nevertheless, some limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. First, the study only shows that offering the light mask as per this study protocol to suppress rod function is not an effective option to treat non-central diabetic macular oedema. It is possible that the retinal illumination achieved with these devices did not reduce the dark current sufficiently to alter the hypoxic state. Therefore, it is worth evaluating other techniques of rod suppression in diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema since there is a growing body of scientific evidence that supports the role of photoreceptors in retinal vascular permeability and angiogenesis.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Other clinical trials of light masks to prevent dark adaptation in diabetic retinopathy are ongoing. The Lahey Light II trial<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> (LCID Study Number 2015-020) is evaluating a modified 520 &#x003bc;m LED light mask to prevent dark adaptation in refractory diabetic macular oedema. Two other clinical trials (ISRCTN82148651 and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT02207712" id="interrefs30">NCT02207712</ext-link>) are ongoing for age-related macular degeneration. However, it is important that studies with long-term follow-up are conducted in these chronic conditions to provide further insight into this intervention. Second, it could be argued that hypoxia might not be a contributing factor in early diabetic macular oedema and that patients with early signs of this disorder might not be the ideal target population. However, oxygen therapy has been shown to ameliorate early diabetic macular oedema, reinforcing the role of hypoxia in this condition.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> A third limitation is that we defined non-centre-involving diabetic macular oedema as a zone of retinal thickness above 320 &#x003bc;m. Although the normative data of some zones on Spectralis OCT could in fact be above 320 &#x003bc;m, we only included eyes with clinical evidence of diabetic macular oedema causing the retinal thickness to be greater than 320 &#x003bc;m. Therefore, we believe that our patient population is representative of early non-central diabetic macular oedema. In our study, there was no discernible treatment effect in favour of the light mask at 4 months and 8 months when compliance was highest; in fact, any effect was in the opposite direction, which was maintained at 12 months, suggesting that low compliance did not contribute significantly to the overall study result.</p><p id="para460">In conclusion, the light mask as offered in this study is not an effective intervention to prevent or treat patients with non-centre-involving diabetic macular oedema. Future trials should aim to identify better ways of rod suppression to assess the role of rods in diabetic macular oedema and diabetic retinopathy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
