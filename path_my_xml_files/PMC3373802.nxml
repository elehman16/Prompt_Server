Previous studies described differences in UV transmission between homeopathic preparations of CuSO<sub>4</sub> and controls. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether statistically significant differences can be found between homeopathic verum and placebo globules by UV spectroscopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Verum (aconitum 30c, calcium carbonate/quercus e cortice) and placebo globules used in two previous clinical trials were dissolved in distilled water at 10mg/ml 20-23 hours prior to the measurements. Absorbance was measured at 190 &#x02013; 340nm with a Shimadzu UV-1800 double beam spectrophotometer. Duplicates of each sample were measured in a randomized order 4 times on each of the 5 measurement days. To correct for differences between measurement days, average absorbance of all samples on one day was deduced from absorbance of the individual samples. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine group differences between the samples, and finally the coding of the samples was revealed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>First analysis showed significant differences (p&#x02264;0.05) in average UV absorbance at 200 &#x02013; 290nm between the samples and a tendency of a correlation (p&#x02264;0.1) between absorbance and globule weight. More results will be presented at the conference.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Since the absorbance of the samples at the wavelengths between 200 and 290nm was small, a number of aspects had to be considered and should be corrected for if they are present when performing UV spectroscopy on homeopathic globules: (1) Exact weighing of the globules; (2) Measurement error of the spectrophotometer at small absorbances; (3) Drift of the spectrophotometer during a measurement day; (4) Differences between measurement days.</p><p>The question remains what caused the differences in absorbance found in these experiments; the use of the original material for the production of the verum globules, differences in the production of verum and placebo globules, or other context factors.</p></sec></body></article>
