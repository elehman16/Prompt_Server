The individual risk of unexpectedly high disease activity post-study drug discontinuation (SDD) is addressed using data from two similarly designed Phase III clinical trials: FREEDOMS<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2055217317730096" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and FREEDOMS II.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2055217317730096" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The identification of individuals with higher-than-expected post-SDD disease activity is based on specific criteria relating to clinical (severe relapses) and MRI measures. For the purpose of this analysis, patients meeting these criteria were referred to as &#x0201c;outliers.&#x0201d; This outlier analysis allows a scientifically robust comparison of unexpectedly high disease activity following withdrawal of fingolimod vs withdrawal of placebo within each clinical trial and at the individual patient level.</p><p>Group-level relapse rates and MRI measures following discontinuation of fingolimod vs placebo will also be presented to support and complement these individual-patient-level results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2-2055217317730096"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS II had very similar placebo-controlled study designs and inclusion criteria. This allowed the exploration of two aspects of disease activity following treatment withdrawal: (a) the frequency and severity of higher-than-expected disease activity within each treatment group of FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS II, and (b) the consistency of the pattern of any higher-than-expected disease activity across the two studies.</p><p>Both studies were conducted in compliance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approvals were obtained from the independent ethics committees or institutional review boards and all patients provided written informed consent before enrollment into the trials.</p><p>In both FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS II, disease activity data, including relapses and MRI scans, were collected for at least three months after withdrawal (follow-up data at three-month follow-up visit, with a visit window of Day 46 to Day 104) and were collected beyond this point in time and up to seven months (210 days) after SDD when available. The number of patients available for follow-up at 90 days and 210 days in each study are outlined in Supplementary Table e1.</p><sec id="sec3-2055217317730096"><title>MRI analysis</title><p>To analyze and compare MRI disease activity following SDD at the individual patient level, baseline gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing T1-lesion volume data from each study were used to generate prediction intervals assuming a normal distribution, and were derived as: mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;<italic>z</italic>(&#x003b1;/2)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;standard deviation (SD). An outlier was defined as a patient with an increase in Gd-enhancing T1-lesion volume outside the upper boundary of the modeled 95% (two-sided) prediction limits. In this way, individual patients with MRI disease activity after SDD that exceeded that predicted from (unbiased) baseline data and the degree to which disease activity exceeded that predicted within each study could be identified. Outliers&#x02019; rates and characteristics were also assessed at baseline and at end of treatment as a comparison.</p><p>Gd-enhancing volume, rather than number of Gd-enhancing lesions, was used in this analysis for both clinical and methodological reasons. On the clinical side, this approach accounts for the possibility that overall volume, and therefore inflammatory disease activity, may vary for any given number of lesions. In particular, large lesions that coalesce would actually lead to a reduction in lesion count, making lesion volume potentially more indicative of disease progression than count. Increased activity due to multiple lesions, which will lead to a large accumulated volume, can still be captured by this method. On the methodological side, using Gd-enhancing volume allows for a more robust analysis due to more homogenously distributed data, with confidence intervals that make the identification of outliers possible.</p><p>The number of outliers, based on the next available MRI scan following SDD, was assessed in the MRI analysis set of both studies. This analysis set included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one valid post-baseline MRI scan at Month 3 or later. It should be noted that among all patients included in our analyses, only very few had received the study drug treatment for a very short course. There were two, three and six patients in FREEDOMS and one, one, and seven patients in FREEDOMS II who received placebo, fingolimod 0.5&#x02009;mg and 1.25&#x02009;mg, respectively, for seven days or less. While it could be argued that a potential rebound effect after fingolimod discontinuation in this subgroup is unlikely to occur, the inclusion of these patients on short exposure was not considered to have the potential to affect the overall conclusion of this study, given the small numbers and balanced distribution.</p><p>Since the elimination of fingolimod may take up to two months, and typically normal peripheral lymphocyte counts are reached within one to two months,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2055217317730096" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> all data up to 30 days after SDD are considered to be on treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2055217317730096"><title>Clinical analysis</title><p>For clinical outcomes, an outlier was defined as a patient who experienced one or more severe relapses defined as one of the following: any hospitalization due to a relapse, any relapse assessed as &#x0201c;severe&#x0201d; by the study investigator, any relapse with incomplete recovery or unusual increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score compared to prior EDSS score (defined as &#x02265;3 for patients with a prior EDSS score of 0; &#x02265;2 for patients with a prior EDSS score from 1 to 5; and &#x02265;1 for patients with a prior EDSS score &#x0003e;5) with &#x0201c;prior&#x0201d; defined as the latest EDSS measure on treatment&#x02014;i.e. around SDD and up to 30 days after SDD.

However, the present study demonstrates that the number of outliers (individuals with higher-than-expected recurrence of disease activity after SDD) was small across all treatment groups in both of these large, placebo-controlled studies. Overall, the individual risk of unexpectedly high recurrence of clinical or MRI disease activity after SDD was similar between placebo- and fingolimod-treated patients. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2055217317730096">Figure 1</xref> for MRI outliers and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2055217317730096">Figure 2</xref> for severe relapses, there was no discernable pattern in terms of frequency, treatment arm, association with dose, or consistency across two large clinical trials of similar design. For example, the small numerical increase observed for the number of severe relapses post-SDD in the fingolimod 1.25&#x02009;mg group compared to the other groups in the FREEDOMS trial was not replicated in the FREEDOMS II trial. In fact, while numbers were higher for fingolimod 1.25&#x02009;mg group for MRI outliers and clinical outliers in the FREEDOMS trial as compared to placebo and the 0.5&#x02009;mg group, the exact opposite was true for the FREEDOMS II trial, where the numbers in the fingolimod 1.25&#x02009;mg group were smaller for both instances as compared to placebo. This absence of any dose-dependent pattern across the two similar studies suggests that these observations are rather reflective of the underlying variability of disease activity, as opposed to being reflective of any &#x0201c;rebound effect.&#x0201d;</p><p>Such variability is further illustrated by the similar range of disease activity observed after drug cessation compared to the existing range at baseline. In fact, the highest activity levels for patients in the fingolimod 1.25&#x02009;mg or 0.5&#x02009;mg group were observed at baseline, both in FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS II (which was actually not always the case in the placebo group, since in FREEDOMS the highest level of disease activity was observed after placebo discontinuation). Altogether these findings support the notion that individual cases of &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; disease activity are to be expected as part of the natural unpredictability of the disease course regardless of treatment history.</p><p>Finally, the individual-patient-level data presented here are in line and complement results from the group-level analysis, which demonstrate that annual relapse rates and Gd-enhancing lesion counts were similar in post-SDD patients from the fingolimod groups compared to those from the placebo group.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2055217317730096" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Of note, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2055217317730096">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2055217317730096">3</xref>, baseline disease characteristics varied widely among the individuals with MRI disease activity outside the predicted limits. This was the same for individuals experiencing severe relapse (&#x0201c;clinical outliers,&#x0201d; see Supplementary Tables e1 and e2). Therefore, this analysis suggests limited ability of baseline disease characteristics to predict future individual episodes of more severe disease activity following discontinuation of fingolimod or placebo for that matter.</p><p>The recurrence of high disease activity after discontinuation of immunomodulatory agents for MS is a topic of ongoing debate, which entails a number of challenges. Firstly, it is accepted that MS is characterized by extreme variability in disease course and progression and that relapses occur unpredictably with a frequency that varies both within and between individuals.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2055217317730096" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Therefore, a key point about referring to the recurrence of any disease activity after discontinuation as high disease activity or even &#x0201c;rebound effect&#x0201d; is to define it appropriately. While some correctly use the term &#x0201c;rebound effect&#x0201d; only for a recurrence of disease activity that substantially exceeds the level of prior to treatment (baseline) or that of a control group, depending on setup, others use the term rebound effect or rebound syndrome to refer to the expected recurrence of any disease activity. Secondly, it is often impossible to define the true underlying individual baseline, as the natural disease course in the individual patient is usually already influenced (reduced) by other treatments before switching to a new drug. Only in exceptional cases will an observational baseline of a long enough untreated period be available for an unbiased comparison. Simply comparing the recurring disease activity after discontinuation of an effective drug (and during a time frame when the patient is left completely untreated) to the last clinical or MRI observational time point (&#x0201c;snapshot&#x0201d;) prior to that treatment (while the patient was still receiving alternative treatment) certainly does not constitute a meaningful assessment.</p><p>This is the strength of the methodological approach presented here: (1) We use the baseline activity of the patients building the entire cohort to model boundaries of what can be expected as a typical (i.e. within limits) disease activity of patients constituting this cohort; (2) we then compare the likelihood of participants falling out of these limits between the treatment groups. This approach allows us to delineate in a scientifically robust way true outliers, namely patients with disease activity substantially exceeding the disease activity of what could have been expected. This should lead to a more reliable estimate than assessing individual disease activity changes based on an arbitrarily chosen time point. The fact that there is no difference in that regard between the treatment arms (i.e. placebo and fingolimod), along with the lack of any discernible pattern, or dose-response relationship within- and between-study analyses, provides solid evidence that isolated cases of high disease activity after fingolimod treatment discontinuation are likely to be attributable to the natural MS disease course.</p><p>This interpretation is illustrated by the fact that the individual with the largest increase in post-discontinuation Gd-enhancing T1 volume for both trials (i.e. the pooled group) was a placebo-treated patient (increase from 163.1&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup> to 6103.1&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup>; Gd-enhancing T1-lesion number increasing from 4 at baseline to 41 after discontinuation; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2055217317730096">Table 3</xref>, FREEDOMS). This individual, along with the placebo-treated patient ranking second in the FREEDOMS II trial in regard to the measured disease activity after discontinuation (number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions at baseline was 0 as compared to 33 after discontinuation, and Gd-enhancing T1 volume was 0.0&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup> at baseline as compared to 2543.6&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup> after discontinuation from placebo) also contradicts the idea that there would be a simple correlation between baseline disease activity and disease activity after discontinuation in individual patients.</p><p>The clinical experience with fingolimod is approximately 453,000 patient-years exposure as of July 17, 2017.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2055217317730096" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Random episodes of &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;unusual&#x0201d; activity have been shown to be part of the natural multiple sclerosis disease course which can occur at any time and independent of any prior withdrawal.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2055217317730096" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> This analysis strengthens the evidence that any episodes of unexpectedly high disease activity following the discontinuation of fingolimod are more likely to reflect the variable disease course of RRMS rather than a systematic risk of a true &#x0201c;rebound effect.&#x0201d;</p><sec id="sec10-2055217317730096"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>While the pooled data from the Phase II and Phase III clinical development program exploring group-level results in terms of ARR and Gd-enhancing T1-lesion count post-SDD were a pre-planned prospective analysis (which was included in the original submission documents for Gilenya), the findings related to the individual &#x0201c;outliers&#x0201d; have been added post hoc. They however followed a very rigorous pre-specified analysis planning using placebo-controlled clinical trial data in a very large patient cohort.

However, the fact remains that a control group should still be included to be able to differentiate potential compound-specific effects from the natural disease course and avoid observational bias.</p><p>Finally, we acknowledge that in the absence of any clearly defined parameters for identifying clinical outliers, the criteria used in this study have a degree of subjectivity. We however feel that they are conservative and the identified threshold would overestimate rather than underestimate the number of patients with a high level of disease activity following SDD. Furthermore, the same criteria were used for all treatment groups and across both studies, and therefore, were deemed useful for the purpose of this analysis.</p><p>Based on this evaluation there is no suggestion of an increased risk of high disease activity after fingolimod discontinuation vs placebo.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank patients from whom data were taken for analysis.
