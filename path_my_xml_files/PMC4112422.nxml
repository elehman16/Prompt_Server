The hypothesis was that benefits would be neighbourhood-wide, and not restricted to intervention participants. The trial was part of a multicomponent process/outcome evaluation which included non-experimental components (self-reported behaviour change amongst participants, case studies and evaluations of individual projects) which suggested health, well-being and social benefits to participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty matched pairs of neighbourhoods in London were randomised to intervention/control condition. Primary outcomes (five portions fruit/vegetables/day; 5&#x000d7;30&#x02005;m of moderate intensity physical activity/week, abnormal General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-12 score and Warwick&#x02013;Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) score) were measured by postintervention questionnaire survey, among 3986 adults in a random sample of households across neighbourhoods.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no evidence of impact on primary outcomes: healthy eating (relative risk [RR] 1.04, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.17); physical activity (RR:1.01, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.16); abnormal GHQ12 (RR:1.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.61); WEMWBS (mean difference [MD]: &#x02212;1.52, 95% CI &#x02212;3.93 to 0.88). There was evidence of impact on some secondary outcomes: reducing unhealthy eating-score (MD: &#x02212;0.14, 95% CI &#x02212;0.02 to 0.27) and increased perception that people in the neighbourhood pulled together (RR: 1.92, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.29).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The trial findings do not provide evidence supporting the conclusion of non-experimental components of the evaluation that intervention improved health behaviours, well-being and social outcomes. Low participation rates and population churn likely compromised any impact of the intervention. Imprecise estimation of outcomes and sampling bias may also have influenced findings. There is a need for greater investment in refining such programmes before implementation; new methods to understand, longitudinally different pathways residents take through such interventions and their outcomes, and new theories of change that apply to each pathway.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RANDOMISED TRIALS</kwd><kwd>DEPRIVATION</kwd><kwd>DIET</kwd><kwd>EXERCISE</kwd><kwd>HEALTH PROMOTION</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>The persistence of stark health inequalities linked to levels of social disadvantage in high-income countries is well recognised.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Many structural drivers, such as employment, education and income distribution lie in the field of macroeconomic and social policy.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, interventions which seek to act on the local social context of disadvantage have become more widespread,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;10</xref> driven by the neighbourhood renewal policies popular since the late 1990s.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This has paralleled a move in broader public service delivery from using needs-assessments to design and target professionally delivered services, towards highlighting and harnessing the skills, knowledge and resources of individuals and communities in coproducing and delivering services.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced guidance on the use of community engagement for delivering health services and preventive interventions.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This, together with a new systematic review, suggest that coproduced interventions impact health beyond the direct effects of their health content, through: (1) enhancing social support networks<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> which provide a buffer against macrolevel structural drivers of poor health<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and (2) increasing the control people have over their local environments.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;22</xref></p><p>Despite this increase in coproduction interventions in public health, evidence for their effectiveness remains limited, and there have been repeated calls to improve the quantity and quality of evaluation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref> However, such interventions are not usually delivered in ways that are amenable to the use of randomised experimental designs for assessing effectiveness, and some have questioned whether trials are appropriate to these interventions.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;27</xref> In this paper, we present findings, among adults, from a cluster-randomised trial (CRT) of a community engagement intervention to promote health and well-being, delivered in deprived neighbourhoods in London: the <italic>Well London</italic> Programme. The trial was conducted as part of a wider evaluation which included collecting information on participation levels, and self-reported behaviour change among participants, as well as interviews with residents and local stakeholders and independent evaluations of individual projects. Findings of the wider non-experimental evaluation suggested health and other benefits from participation, as well as improved social cohesion, interagency collaboration and relationships between communities, decision makers and service providers.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>The CRT sought to determine the effectiveness of the <italic>Well London</italic> programme in improving healthy eating, physical activity and mental well-being in adults and adolescents, and enhancing the social characteristics, structure and function of the target communities, which are hypothesised to underpin changes in well-being and health behaviour outcomes.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> We sought evidence of neighbourhood-wide impact on residents, irrespective of their levels of engagement/exposure with the programme.

<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Phase 1 of the programme comprised 14 interlinked projects developed and delivered in 20 deprived neighbourhoods in London, using a coproduction approach. Some projects focussed on the main outcomes, using traditional health behaviour change activities, while others sought to improve the local environment (eg, green spaces), provide cultural activities, and improve employment and training opportunities. A core group of volunteers (modelled on the UK National Health Service Health Trainers<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<italic>Well-London</italic> Delivery-Teams) in each neighbourhood, supported residents to participate in <italic>Well London</italic>, access services and improve health behaviours.

<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Our findings do not provide evidence that the improvements in well-being and social outcomes identified by the non-experimental components of the <italic>Well London</italic> evaluation<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> were achieved neighbourhood-wide. Primary outcomes were not significantly different between intervention and control neighbourhoods. Although there was evidence in intervention neighbourhoods of lower unhealthy eating scores, and higher proportions agreeing that their community pulled together, the public health relevance of these findings is unclear, particularly given the number of outcomes examined and the lack of change in other similar outcome measures.</p><p>We should consider potential explanations for these findings, including aspects of study design, population churn and levels of exposure to the intervention. First, there is recognised imprecision in questionnaire-based measurement of healthy eating and physical activity.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> This may have generated significant levels of non-differential outcome misclassification, leading in turn to underestimation of true effects, although we cannot exclude the possibility of differential misclassification across study arms. Second, there is potential for sampling bias, given the disappointingly low household response rate of 28%, and this could have acted to obscure either real benefits or non-benefits. Third, population churn in the intervention neighbourhoods was high (40% of follow-up respondents moved in since the start of <italic>Well London</italic>). There is evidence that coproduced interventions impact health beyond the direct effects of their health content, through enhancing social support networks<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> and increasing people's control over local environments.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;22</xref> Although exclusion of these in-migrants from analysis made no difference to effect-estimates, there remains the possibility that population churn reduced any indirect effects of the intervention or that those with more positive outcomes (whether directly or indirectly generated) moved out. But even if this were the case, the implication is that such interventions have less chance of success in neighbourhoods with high levels of population churn and, in practice, many deprived neighbourhoods experience similar levels of population churn.</p><p>Levels of participation in <italic>Well London</italic> in intervention neighbourhoods, estimated directly among follow-up questionnaire respondents, were lower than those estimated from the process evaluation.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Possible explanations include poor recall and brand recognition and higher out-migration among participants. There is evidence that only those individuals who choose actively to engage with a programme experience the processes of personal and social change implied by the underlying theory of empowerment and transformation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The findings reported here as well as those from the accompanying paper,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and the qualitative component of this trial<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> (which demonstrated the reported beneficial effects of active engagement and participation in contrast to a lack of effect among self-identified &#x02018;non-participants&#x02019;), are consistent with this evidence. It is, therefore, a significant limitation of this study that there was no longitudinal quantitative follow-up of individuals participating in the programmes.</p><p>Participation data from the process evaluation<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> showed significant participation by residents of areas surrounding the trial neighbourhoods, with two-thirds of participants living outside the defined intervention LSOAs. This highlights a tension in the evaluation of community-level programmes that use the area-based approach to community definition and programme delivery (eg, The New Deal<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and the Big Local). Trials are advocated as the most robust evidence of effectiveness,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> but CRTs require that communities be defined in advance. However, our findings suggest that it may be difficult for the geographical limits of the communities engaged by the intervention to be predicted in advance. It is therefore possible that the geographical &#x02018;communities&#x02019; in which effects were measured do not correspond closely to the &#x02018;communities&#x02019; engaged, which may help to explain our negative findings.</p><p>Furthermore, in a highly complex programme, such as <italic>Well London</italic>, which pragmatically mixes different models of community engagement and health improvement strategies, it is unclear what level and type of &#x02018;participation&#x02019; could be expected to impact on which health and social outcomes and to what degree. All <italic>Well London</italic> activities had the potential to increase individual social networks and support, which could impact on mental well-being. However, only individuals participating in the more traditional health improvement activities would be likely to potentially change their diet and physical activity levels, and spaces on some of these projects were limited in comparison to the size of the populations living in the target neighbourhoods.</p><p>Using a CRT, we have asked the &#x02018;simple&#x02019;<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> question &#x02018;did <italic>Well London</italic> bring about neighbourhood-wide change in the outcomes?&#x02019; The balance of the results presented here provide no evidence of this. Low participation rates and population churn likely compromised any impact of the intervention. Given that this trial did not demonstrate that the <italic>Well London</italic> intervention had any important impact on outcomes, does this suggest that the approach was wrong, or that the implementation of the approach was not good enough? Certainly, the constraints of the funding provided by the Lottery limited the extent to which coproduction could be achieved and delays in implementing the core <italic>Well-London</italic> Delivery-Team components meant that delivery in many areas was over 2.5 rather than 3.5&#x02005;years (see online supplementary file 2). Had more time and resources been available for coproduction and intervention development, it may be that the interventions could have been refined to deliver important effects. We believe that we need to establish better development pathways for health improvement interventions and proper investment in these ahead of trialling, if we are to meet the challenges of developing effective interventions for the prevention of chronic illness in the future.

<boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>What this study adds?</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study reports the findings, among adults, of a cluster randomised trial (part of a wider evaluation) of the <italic>Well London</italic> programme which delivered a multicomponent intervention based on community engagement, coproduction and place-making principles in 20 multiply deprived communities over a 3.5-year period. The findings do not provide evidence supporting the conclusion of non-experimental components of the evaluation that intervention improved health behaviours and social outcomes. Low levels of participation and high levels of population churn may have compromised effectiveness. Imprecision in measurement of health behaviours and well-being, as well as sampling bias may have influenced findings. The paper highlights the inherent tensions in the use of cluster-randomised trials to measure the effects of &#x02018;community&#x02019;-level interventions since clusters are geographically defined, whereas natural communities may not be. Greater investment in refining such programmes before implementation and trialling will be desirable in the future.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web 1</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jech-2013-202505-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1677" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web 2</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jech-2013-202505-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1682" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><caption><title>Web 3</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jech-2013-202505-s3.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1687" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><caption><title>Web 4</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jech-2013-202505-s4.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1692" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><caption><title>Web 5</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jech-2013-202505-s5.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1697" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><caption><title>Web 6</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jech-2013-202505-s6.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1702" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><caption><title>Web 7</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jech-2013-202505-s7.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1707" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><caption><title>Web 8</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jech-2013-202505-s8.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1712" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> The study was designed by AR, RH, AD, MP and DM and GP, CB and RH designed the analysis strategy.
