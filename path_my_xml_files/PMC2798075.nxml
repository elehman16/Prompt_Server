Exclusion criteria included an eating disorder (non-BED) within the previous 6 months, current use of psychoactive or weight loss agents or of medications potentially interfering with drug absorption, current insulin use, a history of alcohol or drug abuse (previous 12 months), a current psychiatric condition being treated with a psychoactive agent, major depressive disorder, and history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or suicide attempts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref></p><p>Classification of placebo response occurred after 4 weeks of single-blind placebo administration. Individuals who continued to meet BED diagnostic criteria and who did not experience marked decreases in binge eating were included in the sibutramine trial.

Participants who no longer met BED diagnostic criteria or who experienced a marked reduction in binge eating (total number of binge episodes for the previous week was 25% of that for the week preceding the beginning of the placebo run-in phase) were classified as PRs and were excluded from the sibutramine trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>Eating disorder symptomatology was assessed at screening and FU using the BED diagnostic version of the EDE,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> an investigator-based, semi-structured interview designed to provide a complete assessment of BED.

Occasions of eating unambiguously large amounts of food without a loss of control are classified as objective overeating (OO).

The five significant predictors of PR were the OBE days, OBE episodes, 6-month OBE average, SBE episodes, and importance of shape. For OBE days, OBE episodes, 6-month OBE average, and importance of weight, increasing values were associated with lower odds of PR, whereas with SBE episodes, an increasing value was associated with higher odds of PR. Specifically, for each 1 SD unit increase in the value of the predictor, the OR (95% confidence interval; P-value) for PR was: 0.75 (0.60&#x02013;0.92; 0.006) for OBE days; 0.68 (0.54&#x02013;0.86; 0.001) for OBE episodes; 0.69 (0.56&#x02013;0.85; &#x0003c; 0.001) for 6-month OBE average; 1.30 (1.1&#x02013;1.6; 0.012) for SBE episodes; and 0.76 (0.62&#x02013;0.92; 0.007) for the importance of shape.

Comparisons between PRs participating in the FU study (n = 33) and nonparticipating PRs (n = 133) indicate that the groups did not significantly differ with respect to any predictors of PR status (i.e., OBE days/episodes, 6-month OBE average, SBE episodes and importance of shape). The groups did differ, however, with respect to importance of weight. At study entry, the FU sample reported significantly lower importance of weight than the nonparticipating PRs. (mean [SD] of 3.8 [1.6] versus 4.1 [1.2], respectively; p = 0.001).

With respect to eating disorder symptomatology and quality of life, PRs exhibited significantly less severe pathology than NRs. Nevertheless, within the time period between BL and FU, most of those PRs assessed at FU reported binge eating symptoms; more than one third met the BED diagnosis. PRs cited varied reasons for changes in their binge eating.</p><p>The 32.6% placebo response rate in this study is similar to mean placebo response rates reported in the treatment phases of trials involving other major psychiatric illnesses, including major depressive disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and bipolar disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> It is also consistent with the placebo response rate recently reported in the treatment phase of another trial investigating the use of sibutramine for BED<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>and to other placebo controlled trials for BED.</p><p>Comparisons between PRs and NRs reveal a consistent pattern of differences in eating disorder symptoms. NRs demonstrated significantly greater frequency and severity of OBEs than PRs and significantly more concerns about shape.</p><p>The importance of binge size with respect to the diagnosis of BED has been debated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> PRs were significantly more likely to experience SBEs than NRs, but significantly less likely to have OBEs days or episodes. Binge size thus appears to discriminate participants who respond to placebo from those who do not. Logistic regression results suggest that a pattern of greater OBE days, OBE episodes, and 6-month OBE average, as well as a lower number of SBEs and higher importance of shape may reduce the odds of placebo response.</p><p>Obesity is highly prevalent among individuals with BED, affecting approximately 65% of individuals with BED.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>Despite similar levels of obesity, the groups demonstrated significant differences with respect to its impact on quality of life. The data suggest that the deleterious impact of binge eating on quality of life in obese individuals is significantly greater than the negative impact of weight alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>The poorer quality of life among NRs may be related to greater severity of their binge eating symptoms.</p><p>Although slightly more than one half of the FU sample reported no OBEs in the month immediately before the FU assessment, nearly 70% did report a loss of control over their eating. The significance of loss of control experiences among obese individuals with a history of BED requires further investigation.</p><p>With respect to the diagnostic status of the FU sample, approximately 35% of the participants experienced binge eating consistent with a BED diagnosis (2 OBE days/week for 6 months). Fifty-six percent of the participants experienced OBEs an average of at least 4 days per month over 6 months. Although this does not meet the diagnostic threshold for BED, data suggest that individuals with subthreshold BED (those whose binge size and/or frequency is below the diagnostic threshold) experience weight and shape concerns, psychiatric distress, and seek treatment for their eating and weight problems at rates similar to those of individuals diagnosed with BED.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref></p><p>Potentially indicative of participants&#x02019; continued distress over their eating is the considerable percentage (61%) that obtained additional treatment. The treatments most frequently obtained were behaviorally-based weight loss treatment and pharmacotherapy (e.g., sibutramine).</p><p>Participants retrospectively attributed their placebo response to personal factors (such as increased awareness of their eating behavior, self-monitoring, increased motivation to change their eating behavior) and interpersonal factors (having to be accountable to others, social support). The most commonly cited reasons for the resumption of binge eating were environmental (e.g., stress) and personal (such as depressed mood, decreased motivation, sense of personal failing, decreased awareness of eating behavior, habit). Reasons cited for continued improvement following the initial placebo response were largely environmental (e.g., obtaining additional treatment, participating in other activities) and personal (i.e., health concerns, self monitoring, positive affect, high motivation, appearance concerns).</p><p>Several limitations of the present study should be considered. Nonspecific treatment effects (i.e., contact with study personnel) potentially confound the measurement of placebo response,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> as do other factors, such as natural course of illness, expectation effects, and regression to the mean.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> Similar to other pharmacological studies of BED, the study protocol asked all participants to monitor their eating behavior during the study. The self-monitoring component of the present study was designed to reduce reactivity (e.g., both groups self-monitored); nevertheless, the act of self-monitoring may have affected participants&#x02019; eating behavior. These data may also have been in&#x0fb02;uenced by selection bias; all participants sought treatment and consented to participate in a placebo-controlled trial, potentially indicating expectation effects regarding placebo. Because the assessment of initial PR was coded categorically (PR or not PR), no data on percentage reduction in binge eating following initial PR are available. FU participants consented to be reinter-viewed and may have experienced superior outcomes compared with PRs who were not available for follow-up assessment. The entry criteria for the study (BMI &#x0003c;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, no comorbid disorders) may have excluded participants with more severe psychopathology and poorer prognoses. Finally, additional participants may have responded to placebo during the subsequent double-blind phase; examination of these individuals could potentially elucidate the fuller range of placebo response in BED. Although the FU sample appears representative with respect to predictors of placebo response, a larger sample assessed at discrete intervals is required to increase the inferential power of these findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Use of a placebo control has become the sine qua non of the randomized controlled trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> Individuals with BED who respond to placebo appear to demonstrate less severe eating disorder psychopathology and less impairment in quality of life than do nonresponders (NRs) and may potentially benefit from briefer, less intensive interventions than NRs. Short-term intervention with a placebo, however, appears of little value with respect to the long-term management of these binge eating problems. Even among individuals with fewer complications related to obesity and comorbid psychopathology, BED may be a refractory condition.</p><p>The authors are grateful to Therese Gregory-Bills for her
