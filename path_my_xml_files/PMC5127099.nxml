The CPR tool was recreated by participants using common household items (towel, toilet paper roll, and t-shirt), provided to participants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Our goal was to evaluate whether participants would be able to recreate and use a homemade CPR tool along with video instruction to improve CPR skills, rather than to extensively evaluate the CPR tool itself. Materials for the homemade CPR tool were chosen after subjectively evaluating several other commonly available items, including pillows and plastic bottles. We compared our homemade CPR tool to the CPR Anytime kit (AHA, Dallas, TX), which required approximately 35.5&#x000a0;kg of force to cause a &#x0201c;click&#x0201d; signaling adequate depth. With this compressive force on our homemade mannequin, an average of 46.6&#x000a0;mm of depth was attained during compressions.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>

Additionally, two blinded CPR-experts (emergency physicians, one current and one former CPR instructor) viewed videos of participants performing CPR. The video viewing order was randomized, blinding the CPR experts to the group (untrained versus CPR certified) and also blinding to the pre or post-training status of study participants. The CPR experts observed for appropriately performed skills (compression rate, depth, and recoil), similarly to a traditional CPR class; however, the sensor-equipped mannequin&#x02019;s objective data was used for data analysis. Primary outcome measures included compression rate, compression depth, correct hand position, correct release, and total hands-off time during the 1-min testing period. Secondary outcome measures included participants&#x02019; opinions about their willingness to perform compressions.

Our 6-min training video, production of homemade mannequin, and practice with this tool resulted in improvement in several aspects of CPR performance in both the untrained group and trained/certified group. We noted improvements in compression rate, hand position, recoil, and hands-off time&#x02014;especially in untrained participants&#x02014;but difficulties with adequate depth in both groups. These results are similar to prior studies of brief CPR training, including brief classroom courses and video-based training lasting between 60&#x000a0;s and 22&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our study appears to be the first to include a homemade CPR mannequin with a self-directed instructional video; successfully adding a tactile component to home-based training. Additionally, participants&#x02019; self-perceived abilities improved after training, but their willingness to perform compressions did not significantly change.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Limitations</title><p>Demographic differences were present between the two testing groups, including notable differences in gender, status (student, employee, visitor), and age ranges. It is unclear if these differences may have influenced our results. We did not evaluate CPR skill retention, however prior studies have suggested adequate retention after brief training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Participants performed identical testing scenarios before and after training, increasing familiarity with the testing mannequin, and potentially influencing results. The trained/certified group was included to help control for this effect, as this group has had prior experience with CPR and mannequin use, allowing a better understanding of the true effect of training on previously untrained participants. The inter-rater agreement between the two CPR experts was fairly low overall, highlighting the possible limitations of human graders&#x02019; evaluations. To reduce potential for subjectivity, the objective data obtained from the sensor-equipped CPR mannequin was used for statistical analysis; as was planned in the study design. The homemade mannequin/CPR tool was observed to be easily recreated by participants, however we did not formally evaluate participants&#x02019; opinions of the CPR tool. Researchers observed that the toilet paper roll began to fatigue after several compressions, producing less recoil. Further research could focus on improving recoil in an equally convenient homemade CPR tool, improving compression depth, and directly comparing the homemade CPR tool to a commercially available CPR mannequin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We feel it is possible to teach the basics of compression-only CPR by combining a brief video and simulation with a homemade mannequin. Our method used a convenient internet-based video and a mannequin reproduced by viewers, requiring only an internet-enabled device and a towel, roll of toilet paper, and a t-shirt. While previously untrained participants appeared to benefit most from our training&#x02014;performing similarly to CPR-certified participants in terms of hand position, depth, and hands-off time&#x02014;the trained/certified participants also improved some skills; suggesting a possible role as a home-based refresher. Adequate compression depth remained problematic for both groups.
