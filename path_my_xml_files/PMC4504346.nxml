Many tick species act as vectors of bacterial and viral pathogens, often causing disease in dogs and humans. The <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> tick is an important vector for parasitic and infectious diseases such as Lyme borreliosis and anaplasmosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. <italic>I. scapularis</italic> is a tick species found in the eastern and central United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Of notable concern with <italic>I. scapularis</italic> is its ability to transmit <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, the causative agent of Lyme disease, to pets and their human companions. The <italic>Borrelia</italic>-spirochete can typically pass from an infected tick to the mammalian-host between 48 and 72&#x000a0;hours after the nymph or adult attaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Rapidly removing or killing ticks prior to transmission of the disease causing agents is the goal, so a sustained acaricidal activity persisting throughout the entire treatment interval would be expected to ensure better prevention of tick infestations for the pet.</p><p>This paper describes the two controlled studies performed that aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of fipronil/(S)-methoprene/cyphenothrin against <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> ticks at both 6 and 24&#x000a0;hours after tick infestations throughout the month.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Two studies were conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of fipronil/(S)-methoprene/cyphenothrin against <italic>I. scapularis</italic>. These studies were performed in the United States by an experienced, independent contract research facility and were designed in accordance with standard methods for evaluating the efficacy of parasiticides for the control of tick infestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Animals were handled in compliance with both Merial Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and local IACUC approvals, and were in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. The trial facility meets USDA-APHIS animal welfare requirements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Animals</title><p>The studies involved 24 purpose bred canines (12 per study), each identified by a unique numerical tattoo or implanted microchip. Beagles and mixed breed dogs, with short to medium hair length were used in these studies. Study 1 included 4 males and 8 female dogs aged 0.6-7.7&#x000a0;years old and weighing 6.6-13.7&#x000a0;kg (14.5-30.3 lbs.). Study 2 included 5 males and 7 female dogs aged 0.6-7.7&#x000a0;years old and weighing 6.7-11.6&#x000a0;kg (14.8-25.5 lbs.). Studies followed a controlled, randomized block design. All dogs were in good health and none had been treated with an ectoparasiticide product, either topically or orally, within three months prior to the study and treatment. Pre-treatment tick infestations, with removal counts were performed on Day &#x02212;5 to ensure that dogs were capable of maintaining adequate tick infestations and then allocated to their assigned treatment group. Dogs were not anaesthetized or sedated prior to any of the study infestations. Dogs were housed individually. Health observations were conducted daily throughout the study, which included every hour for four hours following the treatment of the fipronil/(S)-methoprene/cyphenothrin on Day 0.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>A total of 28 dogs (12 male and 16 female) were infested with approximately 50 (25 male and 25 female) <italic>I. scapularis</italic> ticks on Day &#x02212;5, and counted 24&#x000a0;hours later. The four dogs with the lowest pre-treatment tick counts were not allocated. The remaining 24 dogs (10 males and 14 females) with the highest tick counts were ranked by decreasing pre-treatment tick counts. Six replicates of 4 animals each were formed. The 4 dogs with the highest pre-treatment tick counts formed replicate 1; the next 4 highest formed replicate 2, and so on, until all dogs were allocated. Within replicates, each dog was randomly allocated to one of the four treatment groups, with two treatment groups randomly assigned to each study. On the second study, prior to Day 0, it was noticed that one dog developed a localized skin infection directly in the targeted treatment site area. That dog was removed from the study, appropriately treated, and replaced in the study by the dog with the highest remaining pre-treatment tick count. Thereafter, all the dogs remained in their assigned groups for the duration of the study. Dogs were weighed prior to Day 0 and the appropriate treatment size was selected based on the animal&#x02019;s weight. On Day 0, treatment was applied according to label instructions, topically by parting the hair between the shoulder blades and applying the formulation directly to the skin. In both studies the control group, Group 1, was treated with the appropriate dose of mineral oil of either 1.0&#x000a0;mL or 2.0&#x000a0;mL. The treated group, Group 2, was treated with the weight-appropriate dose of FRONTLINE&#x000ae; TRITAK&#x000ae; For Dogs (fipronil/(S)-methoprene/cyphenothrin) of either 0.67&#x000a0;mL or 1.34&#x000a0;mL.</p><p>The <italic>I. scapularis</italic> ticks used in the study were unfed adult ticks, 50&#x000a0;% male and 50&#x000a0;% female, and were the OSU <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> strain from Oklahoma State University Tick Rearing Facility. Dogs were treated once on Day 0 per allocation. Dogs were each infested on Days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-treatment with 50 (25 male and 25 female) live <italic>I. scapularis</italic> ticks, which were placed on the lateral aspect of the dog to avoid direct contact with the product application site. At either 6 or 24&#x000a0;hours following each infestation, dogs in Group 1 and 2 in their respective studies were thoroughly examined by hand, removing and counting all ticks on each dog. To ensure that the hand-counting and removal was complete, dogs were combed, using a fine-toothed flea comb, for 3&#x000a0;minutes to ensure no ticks remained. Different flea combs were used for collection with the treated and the control group dogs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All analyses and calculations were performed using SAS Version 9.3.
