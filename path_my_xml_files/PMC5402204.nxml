solution, with or without dextrose, on diarrheic calves with either experimentally induced
or spontaneous diarrhea. In the experimental model, diarrhea was induced in nine healthy
calves by administering cold milk (below 4&#x000b0;C) twice a day for 2 days. The calves were
randomly assigned to the isotonic saline (ISS), acetated Ringer&#x02019;s (AR) or acetated
Ringer&#x02019;s with 5% dextrose (ARD) groups, with three calves assigned to each group. The
calves received 80 m<italic>l</italic>/kg of their designated solution, at a flow rate of
20 m<italic>l</italic>/kg/hr. Infusion of ISS, AR and ARD were all found to be safe and
effective in increasing plasma volume. Intravenous (IV) infusion of ISS resulted in the
acidification secondary to dilution, while AR and ARD infusion inhibited acidification. In
addition, prevention of catabolism was observed only with IV infusion of ARD. Sixteen
calves with spontaneous diarrhea were enrolled in the clinical study. The calves were
randomly assigned to the AR or ARD groups, with eight calves being assigned to each group.
The calves received 100 m<italic>l</italic>/kg of their designated solution, at a flow
rate of 25 m<italic>l</italic>/kg/hr. Intravenous infusion of AR and ARD was found to be
effective in increasing plasma volume and inhibiting acidification. Only infusion of ARD
prevented catabolism, but it also led to hyperglycemia. Our results suggest that a
solution containing dextrose may be beneficial for wasting diarrheic calves.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acetate Ringer&#x02019;s solution</kwd><kwd>beta-hydroxybutyrate</kwd><kwd>calf</kwd><kwd>catabolism</kwd><kwd>diarrhea</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Neonatal diarrhea remains the most common cause of death in beef and dairy calves, and is a
major source of economic loss in the cattle industry [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ETEC), and
<italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>, <italic>rotavirus</italic> and
<italic>coronavirus</italic> appear to be the most important causes of infectious calf
diarrhea. Calves are more sensitive to fluid loss than adult cattle, because of their higher
total body water content and higher extracellular fluid volume. In addition, metabolic
acidosis can occur secondary to diarrhea contingent on its severity and duration [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Intravenous (IV) fluid therapy is important for
decreasing mortality associated with diarrhea in calves.</p><p>Use of bicarbonate precursors, such as sodium acetate and sodium lactate, carries minimal
risk in the treatment of mild metabolic acidosis in calves [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Acetate Ringer&#x02019;s (AR) solution is preferred to correct moderate metabolic
acidosis in calves [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Commercial AR solutions contain
28 mM of sodium acetate as the bicarbonate precursor. Calves can easily metabolize acetate
ions, which have an alkalizing effect [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in muscle
[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Naylor
<italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] demonstrated that
acetate ions have alkalizing effects similar to bicarbonate in healthy calves. Another study
showed that IV infusion of AR was effective in increasing plasma volume and correcting
metabolic acidosis in diarrheic calves [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Malabsorptive diarrhea in calves results in decreased absorption of not only electrolytes and
water, but also carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Diarrheic calves also become anorexic. Todd <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that lack of food intake for 30 hr caused
hypoglycemia and an increase in beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) levels indicating lipid
mobilization. Similarly, calves fed only electrolyte solutions developed significant increases
in BHBA and nonesterified fatty acid concentrations, indicating that these calves had a
profound negative energy balance [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The mean fat
content of feces was higher in calves with diarrhea than in healthy calves, and the mean
caloric uptake from milk decreased by 31% in diarrheic calves compared to that in healthy
calves. Negative energy balance continues throughout the course of illness [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This suggests that diarrheic calves need more energy
for maintenance. Normally, brain and red blood cells use glucose as an energy source. When
stores of glucose are low, gluconeogenesis is activated. Therefore, maintenance of
glycometabolism is important to prevent muscle catabolism and lipolysis. The addition of
dextrose to IV fluid solutions is routinely used to provide energy [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The addition of dextrose to IV fluid solutions intraoperatively
suppresses protein catabolism and the formation of ketone bodies in humans [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For the
same reason, the addition of dextrose to IV fluid solutions may be useful for the treatment of
calves with wasting diseases, such as diarrhea.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of the intravenous administration
of solutions with or without dextrose on diarrheic calves, and to monitor BHBA concentrations
as an index of lipid mobilization.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>All procedures were performed in accordance with the National Research Council Guidelines

kg, were enrolled in the study. All calves had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to
starter, hay and water throughout the study. Three of the calves were used twice in this
study after allowing a rest interval of more than 1 week. The calves were deemed healthy
based on physical examination and hematologic analysis. All calves were clinically normal
before the start of the experiment, as determined by vital signs, physical appearance,
milk intake, and urine and feces production. Dryness and coolness of the mucous membranes,
sinking of the eyes and eyelid skin tenting of approximately 0.5 sec were the main
clinical signs observed following the induction of diarrhea. All calves became dehydrated,
and metabolic acidosis was induced secondary to diarrhea caused by the following
acidification procedure. The calves were primed with cold milk, which was prepared by
adding 400 g of commercial milk replacement powder (Mo-toku milk 02 for calf, Scientific
Feed Laboratory Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) to 3 <italic>l</italic> of cold water (below
4&#x000b0;C). The milk was administered twice a day for 2 days through a feeding tube [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Before the start of and at the end of the
acidification procedure, base excess (BE), hemoglobin concentration (Hb) and BHBA were
measured. A 14-gauge catheter (Surefrow Catheter SR-OT1464C, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was
inserted into the right jugular vein of the conscious calves. The catheter was then
connected to an ordinary drip tube that controlled the flow rate. The calves were randomly
assigned to the ISS group (n=3; IV infusion of ISS), AR group (n=3; IV infusion of AR) or
ARD group (n=3; IV infusion of ARD). The calves received 80 m<italic>l</italic>/kg of the
designated solution, at a flow rate of 20 m<italic>l</italic>/kg/hr, resulting in a flow
rate for the dextrose of 1.0 g/kg/hr. Initiation of fluid infusion was designated as time
0 (base). Venous blood samples were collected at base, as well as 0.5, 1, 4 and 24 hr
after initiation of fluid therapy. Venous blood samples were anaerobically collected in a
heparinized 1-m<italic>l</italic> syringe from the left jugular vein, and the tips of the
syringes were capped after collection.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical study</title><p>Sixteen diarrheic calves (nine Holstein males, four Holstein females and three crossbred

and a body weight of approximately 40.0 kg were enrolled in this clinical study. All
calves had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to starter, hay and water throughout the
study. Dehydration and metabolic acidosis secondary to diarrhea were diagnosed in these
calves by veterinary practitioners on the basis of physical examination and blood gas
analysis (i-STAT 1, Abbott Lab., North Chicago, IL, U.S.A.). In 13 of the 16 calves
(81.3%), <italic>C. parvum</italic> was detected using a <italic>C. parvum</italic> rapid

connected to an ordinary drip tube that controlled the flow rate. The calves were randomly
assigned to the AR (n=8; IV infusion of AR) or ARD groups (n=8; IV infusion of ARD). The
calves received 100 m<italic>l</italic>/kg of AR or ARD, at a flow rate of 25
m<italic>l</italic>/kg/hr, resulting in a flow rate for the dextrose of 1.25 g/kg/hr.

all calves increased to &#x0003e;0.2 mM. Therefore, the acidification procedure used in this
study was deemed suitable for inducing metabolic acidosis and ketosis. Clinical signs,
such as moist cough, jugular vein congestion, ptosis, salivation and arrhythmia, were not
observed during the experimental period in any group. Moist lung sounds appreciated on
auscultation, which were not associated with severe clinical signs, were present in 2/3

0.114, 7.298 &#x000b1; 0.046 and 7.308 &#x000b1; 0.018, respectively. The HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and
PCO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the ISS, AR and ARD groups remained constant
throughout the infusion period. The BE measurements from the ISS group were slightly
decreased as compared with the base values until the end of fluid therapy, but these

to 7.192 &#x000b1; 0.061 and 7.145 &#x000b1; 0.050, respectively. The HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and
PCO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the AR and ARD groups remained constant throughout the
infusion period. The BE measurements in 8/8 calves in the AR group and 8/8 calves in the
ARD group were slightly increased compared with the base values until the end of fluid
infusion, decreasing from &#x02212;15.8 &#x000b1; 4.7 and &#x02212;17.0 &#x000b1; 4.9 to &#x02212;12.3 &#x000b1; 4.4 and &#x02212;14.4 &#x000b1; 4.6 mM,
respectively. However, these changes were not significant. The BHBA concentrations of the
AR group slightly increased as compared with the base values until the end of fluid
infusion, increasing from 0.21 &#x000b1; 0.08 mM to 0.38 &#x000b1; 0.34 mM at the end of infusion;
however, these changes were not significant. In contrast, ARD infusion induced progressive
and significant decreases in BHBA concentrations, which reached 0.06 &#x000b1; 0.05 mM at the end
of fluid infusion (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 by Dunnett&#x02019;s test). The sequential changes
in BHBA concentrations for the ARD group were significantly greater than those for the AR
group <italic>(P&#x0003c;</italic>0.05). The base values of plasma glucose in the AR and ARD
groups were 84.8 &#x000b1; 28.6 and 79.4 &#x000b1; 16.2 mg/d<italic>l</italic>, respectively. Significant
increases in plasma glucose concentrations were induced in calves by ARD infusion, which
reached 337.0 &#x000b1; 57.6 mg/d<italic>l</italic> 30 min after initiation of fluid therapy, and
remained between 340.6 and 406.3 mg/d<italic>l</italic> throughout the procedure. However,
plasma glucose concentrations returned to 84.9 &#x000b1; 19.4 mg/d<italic>l</italic> 24 hr after
initiation of fluid therapy. In the AR and ARD groups, plasma potassium concentrations
decreased slightly throughout the procedure, reaching 4.3 &#x000b1; 0.7 and 3.7 &#x000b1; 0.6
mEq/<italic>l</italic>, respectively, at the end of fluid infusion
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Plasma sodium and chloride concentrations did not change
until the end of fluid infusion in both the AR and ARD groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, IV infusion of both AR and ARD was found to be effective in increasing
plasma volume and correcting BE. However, only IV infusion of ARD prevented catabolism. This
suggests that it is necessary to use AR and ARD properly. Administration of AR is
appropriate for the early stages of diarrhea typified by dehydration and metabolic acidosis,
but which has not progressed to exhaustion. Meanwhile, ARD infusion may be beneficial for
wasting diarrheic calves with dehydration and metabolic acidosis.</p><p>There are many consistent clinical and pathological changes observed in calves with
diarrhea. The cholera toxin of <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic> and the heat labile toxin
(LT) of <italic>E. coli</italic> cause secretory diarrhea [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In a clinical study, <italic>C. parvum</italic> was isolated from 13/16
diarrheic calves. Following infection, clinical signs peaked at 3 to 5 days and lasted for 4
to 17 days [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. <italic>C. parvum</italic> damages the
small intestinal villi, which results in failure of electrolyte and water absorption
(malabsorptive diarrhea). Calves with diarrhea resulting in dehydration had increased
D-lactate concentrations and a negative energy balance caused by anorexia and malabsorption
of nutrients [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Hypoglycemia has been reported in
diarrheic calves, which were found to be weak, lethargic or comatose [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Hypoglycemia, often occurring in combination with hyperlactatemia,
was typically observed in the terminal stages of the disease [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, intravenous fluid therapy must supply sufficient sodium
to normalize the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, provide an alkalizing agent to correct
the metabolic acidosis and provide energy because most calves that have diarrhea are in a
state of negative energy balance [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this study,
we used an experimental model and a clinical study to evaluate whether dextrose administered
intravenously to diarrheic calves was an effective treatment.</p><p>The acidification procedure used in this study significantly decreased the BE, from 5.9 &#x000b1;
1.5 to &#x02212;9.1 &#x000b1; 3.8 mM (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). In general, a calf with a BE &#x02264;15 mM is
diagnosed with severe metabolic acidosis [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
Therefore, the acidification procedure used in this study was a suitable method for inducing
mild acidosis.</p><p>In the experimental model, infusion of ISS, AR and ARD was found to be safe and effective
in increasing plasma volume. There was no significant difference between the three groups in
relative changes in plasma volume until the end of fluid therapy. In the clinical study, IV
infusion of AR and ARD was found to be effective in increasing plasma volume. There was no
significant difference between the AR and ARD groups in relative changes in plasma volume
until the end of fluid therapy. These results indicate that both AR and ARD infusions are
appropriate for the treatment of dehydrated calves. However, at the end of fluid therapy,
the rPV of the AR group was found to have increased significantly than that of the ARD
group. It is possible that osmotic diuresis caused hyperglycemia in the ARD group. A
possible explanation for the difference in rPV was the distribution of fluid between the
plasma and interstitial compartments in the ARD group. There appears to be a few differences
between AR and ARD infusion used for the purposes of rehydration. Intravenous infusion of AR
resulted in more rapid rehydration than did IV infusion of ARD.</p><p>In the experimental model, the relative changes in BE for the ISS group were slightly
decreased at the end of fluid therapy. In the ISS group, the chloride concentration
increased significantly, from 102.4 &#x000b1; 5.4 mmol/<italic>l</italic> at base to 107.5 &#x000b1; 4.6
mmol/<italic>l</italic> at the end of therapy (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Barker
reported that IV infusion of 0.9% saline solution resulted in severe acidosis caused by
increased serum chloride levels [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, the
cause of the decrease in BE in the ISS group could be the increased serum chloride levels.
This suggests that ISS may be of limited usefulness in calves with metabolic acidosis. In
the experimental model, BE measurements in 2/3 calves in the AR group and 2/3 calves in the
ARD group increased during fluid therapy. Similarly in the clinical study, BE measurements
in 8/8 calves in the AR group and 8/8 calves in the ARD group increased during fluid
therapy. The changes were not significant in either the experimental model or the clinical
study. There appears to be no difference between AR and ARD infusion in the correction of
BE.</p><p>Intravenous infusion of ISS in the experimental model and IV infusion of AR in both the
experimental model and the clinical study induced catabolism. Intravenous infusion of both
ISS and AR led to increased BHBA concentrations. After rehydration, the
Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump and Cori cycle could be activated in calves with
diarrhea; both use energy in the form of ATP. Consequently, ISS and AR without dextrose did
not prevent exhaustion. On the contrary, in both the experimental model and the clinical
study, we demonstrated that IV infusion of ARD prevented catabolism. This suggests that the
addition of dextrose maintains glycometabolism and inhibits increases in BHBA caused by
lipolysis. In the experimental model, ARD infusion induced a rapid and significant decrease
in BHBA. In the clinical study, ARD infusion resulted in significant decreases in BHBA
values at the end of fluid therapy. This suggests that exhaustion occurred more severely in
the clinical study than it did in the experimental model. Several investigators have
reported that the addition of dextrose to fluids maintains blood glucose and inhibits
glyconeogenesis. As a result, the breakdown of skeletal muscle and formation of ketone
bodies in patients undergoing surgery is controlled [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, ARD containing 5% dextrose may be useful for the treatment of
wasting diseases like diarrhea. Infection with C. <italic>parvum</italic> has been shown to
induce severe villous atrophy in calves [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], leading
to malabsorptive diarrhea. Absorption is impaired due to the loss of mature villous
epithelial cells and their associated transporters as well as a decrease in total surface
area [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For prevention of catabolism and maintenance
of adequate nutrition, the addition of dextrose to IV fluid solutions may be more effective
than the oral administration of dextrose.</p><p>The addition of dextrose to IV fluid solutions may lead to hyperglycemia [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Increases in blood insulin may cause a rebound
phenomenon after infusion of dextrose-containing fluids. In the experimental model used in
this study, hypoglycemia was observed in the ARD group. Gareis <italic>et al.</italic>
[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reported that the addition of either 100 or 400
g of dextrose to 10 <italic>l</italic> of IV fluids containing saline and sodium bicarbonate
(given over 24 hr) resulted in decreased milk intake in calves with neonatal diarrhea.
Similarly, IV infusion of ARD may affect intake of milk or starter. Mcmanus <italic>et
al.</italic> [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that hyperglycemia led
to immunosuppression during surgery in humans. Thus, several investigators have indicated
that hyperglycemia is not a desired outcome following fluid therapy. Future studies are
needed to determine an appropriate method of incorporating dextrose in IV fluid
solutions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Science Research from the
