In cases of levator muscle paralysis or impaired function, a &#x0201c;sling&#x0201d; is implanted to attach the eyelid to the eyebrow, using the action of the frontalis muscle to elevate the eyelid (frontalis sling).<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> While these procedures are a mainstay of treatment, in our experience they have disadvantages in that they do not always restore normal blink function and overcorrection may result in exposure keratitis. Substantially less attention has been given to nonsurgical approaches, which has led to lack of effective options during the early recovery period from neurological etiologies, in cases with daily variability in the ptosis such as myasthenia gravis, or other cases where surgery is contraindicated. The ptosis crutch has been available for many decades and consists of a wire attached to the patient's spectacle frame to provide a tonic mechanical elevation of the eyelid.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> However, we observed major problems with the ptosis crutch, including the need for frequent adjustment to maintain lid elevation, inability to close the eye completely, and increased risk of eye injury during spectacle adjustment or if the patient were to fall.</p><p>We recently demonstrated successful correction of eyelid ptosis using magnetic force in a case series of complete unilateral third nerve palsy.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The device elevated the eyelid while allowing a volitional blink.

Informed consent was obtained from the participants following detailed explanation of the nature and possible consequences of the study. Participants were inpatients at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, MA. Twelve participants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-t01">Table 1</xref>) were screened, enrolled, and met the inclusion criteria of having paralytic ptosis and ability to provide informed consent or assent. Selection was not affected by age or sex. Median age of participants was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR] 39&#x02013;66) and 67% were female. The right eye was affected in six patients, left eye in three, and bilateral in three. The most common etiology was traumatic brain injury with cranial nerve III injury. Participants with third nerve palsy and double vision were treated using 8 prism diopter base-in press-on prism (3M, St. Paul, MN) on the nondominant eye. Patients also were encouraged to move the eyes away from the paretic motor field by turning the head opposite to the affected eye, which reduced the angle of strabismus and further minimized double vision. Three participants had severe bilateral eyelid ptosis, but only one eyelid was treated; selected using a clinical decision-making process involving consideration of acuity, motility, and eyelid function.</p><table-wrap id="i2164-2591-7-1-7-t01" content-type="2col" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient Characteristics</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="i2164-2591-7-1-7-t01"/></table-wrap><sec id="s2a"><title>Cross-Over Intervention Methods</title><p>Participants were informed that the study was investigating the relative effectiveness of two devices to help open the affected eyelid, but they were masked as to which device was the predicate (crutch) and novel (MLP) device. The devices were mounted on similar spectacle frames to avoid participant bias based on appearance or comfort. The order of the interventions was not counterbalanced (MLP trial always was performed after the crutch trial) to avoid repeated removal and reapplication of the magnet array adhesive, which could irritate the eyelid skin. Participants were asked to choose one device over the other (or no device), after which they were debriefed and informed that the MLP was the experimental device.

A clinician experienced in fitting ptosis crutches (KH) adjusted the wire to match the contour and position of the upper eyelid and ensured that the device effectively elevated the eyelid. The clinician could not be masked by nature of experience needed to fit the crutch and because this study included continued optimization of fitting techniques for the MLP. Two nonclinician study staff, who were masked to which device was experimental, performed the video image processing and eyelid measurements offsite at Schepens Eye Research Institute, Boston, MA.</p><fig id="i2164-2591-7-1-7-f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Participant S11 with left paralytic ptosis, shown here with the predicate nonsurgical device, the ptosis crutch.

If the eyelid array became loose or detached, it was reapplied by one of the clinical study staff who documented the length of the adhesion (days). After the 1-week trial the study ended and the participants were given the option to continue with the MLP until discharge from the rehabilitation hospital at which time they were scheduled for follow-up with an oculoplastic surgery specialist (MY).

The primary outcome measure was interpalpebral fissure size IPF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-f03">Fig. 3</xref>). Two masked raters with medical and research training but unfamiliar with the MLP or ptosis crutch were trained to classify video frames by blink condition as resting state (time between blinks when eyelids were resting open), spontaneous blink, and volitional blink trials. Criteria for classification of blink types were predetermined and available to the raters in a written protocol. The raters were trained on the protocol before making the measurements. IPF was defined as the greatest distance between the upper and lower eyelid margins at the base of the eye lashes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-f03">Fig. 3</xref>). Marginal reflex distance, used commonly to quantify mild to moderate ptosis, was not a suitable option considering the severity of the ptosis in our sample.

We hypothesized that age and sex may affect the response to the MLP due to differences in skin laxity and orbital structure; thus, these variables were included in the model as adjusting covariates. The model was fit for each different blink condition (resting open, volitional blink, spontaneous blink).

The MLP was shown to have substantial advantages over the predicate ptosis crutch in this patient population, providing similar opening and better ability to close the eye volitionally. The MLP was very well tolerated by participants with high comfort ratings and no serious adverse events. No participant who began the 1-week trial dropped out, supporting the value and comfort of treatment when used during inpatient rehabilitation for 1 week at 2 hours per day or less. Adhesion of the device was excellent (median 5 days). Application was very challenging with the Tegaderm, becoming substantially easier when switching to IV 3000, which has a backing making it easy to trim to the size needed while still being easy to handle and apply. Frames with adjustable nose pads that wrapped around worked the best (Bolle Silium Safety Glasses). They could fit over habitual spectacles, at least with the safety lens removed (not shown in photos). Adjustable nose pads are rare on a wraparound frame design, but were critical to allow proper positioning of the spectacle magnet. The wraparound design was not critical, but seemed to distribute the weight better than standard frames. For some participants, an eyewear strap was needed to prevent sliding.</p><p>While IPF during opening at the immediate time point was greater with the MLP compared to the crutch (11.2 vs. 9.3 mm), 11.2 mm was not necessarily better and might suggest some overcorrection. However, by the 20-minute time point opening IPF with the MLP had reduced significantly to 9.2 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-f07">Fig. 7</xref>), similar to the crutch and perhaps a better amount of opening. Reduction of opening may reflect adjustment of the frame by the patient or some stretching of the adhesive. At the 1-week time point, this amount of opening was maintained; however, most patients had the MLP reapplied at some point during the week (mean adhesion time 5 days) and so the 1-week measurement reflects an adhesion duration of approximaely 2 days. While it is useful to know there was no change by 2 days, efficacy with longer intervals remains unconfirmed and it is possible that there would be some further stretching of the adhesive (although patients and therapist reported consistent efficacy). This will need to be determined before a definite replacement schedule can be recommended.</p><p>Over the 1 week of use skin erythema occurred in only two participants, increase in punctate staining in only one, and there was no reduction in visual acuity from ocular surface drying. S5 and S10, who experienced skin erythema, had severe bilateral ptosis and felt the need to wear the MLP much longer than instructed. Also, some eyelid skin erythema was present at baseline, as S5 and S10 had been taping the eyelid open before the study. Despite the minor adverse events, both participants requested to continue using the MLP at the end of the 1-week trial due to marked functional improvement provided by the MLP. Perhaps, using the MLP as a first treatment and avoiding taping of the eyelid open would have prevented erythema despite the longer MLP wear times. S12 used the MLP longer than instructed but did not suffer eyelid skin erythema, perhaps because tape was not used before enrollment in the study.</p><p>Neither age nor sex were predictive of efficacy due to thin lid skin or other factors; however, the sample was fairly small and wear times were only 2 hours per day: we recommend future studies continue to evaluate these factors. One Asian patient participated in the study and could not be fitted with the MLP or crutch due to low nose bridge anatomy. This problem might be addressed using low bridge fit nose pads, available for standard spectacles. It is worth noting that when the frame was held manually in the correct position, the blink was restored effectively.</p><p>Spontaneous blink during MLP use was possible by some participants, but was not significantly better than with the ptosis crutch. The decreased spontaneous blink had no adverse effect on the cornea, at least over the 1-week trial duration. Improvement in spontaneous blink should be an aim of future studies. Improving the spontaneous blink may be possible by increasing the thickness of the magnet coating to reduce force at the surface.</p><p>Before our study, data on nonsurgical correction of ptosis and magnetic correction of ptosis (surgical and nonsurgical) were limited to case series and opinion pieces.<sup><xref rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-b12" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-b13" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-b14" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-b15" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Our study begins to fill a significant gap in terms of nonsurgical correction during inpatient rehabilitation while not excluding use of data and methodology to advance success with surgical implantation or nonsurgical chronic use. Chronic use for myasthenia gravis, a condition where ptosis often is variable throughout the day and where surgery typically is not offered, is a population that stands to benefit greatly from such technology. However, evaluation of safety for chronic daily use and limitations of wear must be examined with further optimization.</p><p>In terms of United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, the predicate ptosis crutch was exempt from the premarket notification 510(k) submission (similar to glasses and low vision aids), and so the MLP should fall in the same category. However, inquiry with the FDA is recommended before any attempts to translate the technology for clinical use. We expect the cost in the market will be comparable to other spectacle-mounted visual devices but substantially less than for surgery.</p><p>This study was has several limitations. First, it examined use of the MLP in a very select population of inpatients recovering from neurological disease or trauma with very severe ptosis. Use of the MLP in the community or for longer wear times cannot be endorsed at this time; however, we have begun examining longer term outpatient use with positive results (Singh et al. <italic>Optom Vis Sci.</italic> 2016;93: AAO E-abstract 16118). Secondly, as our present study included continued optimization of the MLP, it required that the clinician fitting the MLP not be masked. Now that methods for fitting are more standardized and initial safety has been established, a clinical trial with randomization where the fitter also is masked and with longer wear times would be possible. Third, the ptosis crutch always was trialed before the MLP, and so order effect is possible and relative efficacy results should be viewed as preliminary. Fourth, MRD is a preferred method for measuring mild-to-moderate ptosis, but had a poor outcome for this study, where ptosis was near total for most patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i2164-2591-7-1-7-t01">Table 1</xref>), and a common outcome for opening and closing was desirable. Finally, we did not measure brow position and so the influence of opening from frontalis recruitment is unknown; however, frontalis recruitment cannot fully explain the large improvement in opening from the crutch and MLP.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The MLP represents a simple, inexpensive, and feasible device for temporary correction of severe ptosis. Longer wear times and chronic use require investigation and are warranted considering the positive results of this trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="tvst-17-01-03_s01"><label>Supplement 1</label><media xlink:href="tvst-17-01-03_s01.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Joseph Rizzo, MD, for discussions about device development and study design, Nevena Zubcevik, MD, for recommending IV 3000 skin adhesive, and Guilherme Batalha who performed image processing and measurements.</p><p>Supported by the Harvard Clinician Scientist Development Program (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD; K12EY016335), Boston Keratoprosthesis (B-KPro) Fund, the Eleanor and Miles Shore fund, Massachusetts Lions Eye Research Fund, and a Research to Prevent Blindness Unrestricted Grant (Mass Eye and Ear).
