However, the response of cellular immunity on the virological response in patients with antiviral treatment remains largely unclear. We aimed to clarify the response of peripheral T cells and monocytes in chronic hepatitis C patients with antiviral treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients with chronic hepatitis C were treated either with interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;37) or with pegylated interferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;33) for up to 24 weeks. Frequencies of peripheral regulatory T-cells (Tregs), programmed death-1 (PD-1) expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells or CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 expressing CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry in patients at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks following treatment and in 20 healthy controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Frequencies of Tregs, PD-1 and TLR3 expressing cells were higher in patients than those in control subjects (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).

Interferon alpha (IFN&#x003b1;) in combination with ribavirin (RBV) remains a gold standard treatment for chronic HCV infection. However, approximately one-half of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 patients fail to achieve viral clearance <xref rid="pone.0093620-Shepard1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Thus, it is important to identify the factors that may be valuable in improving antiviral strategy and treatment response.</p><p>Both innate and adaptive immunity have a profound impact on status of HCV infection. Impairment of host immunity, especially HCV-specific cellular immune response, may lead to chronic infection <xref rid="pone.0093620-Marukian1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093620-Shiina1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) have been shown to be increased in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic HCV infection and can suppress the proliferation of HCV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which may affect the antiviral treatment response <xref rid="pone.0093620-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093620-Tseng1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), expressing in activated T cells, B cells and monocytes, plays an essential role in regulation of adaptive immune responses <xref rid="pone.0093620-Sarikonda1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response generated during acute HCV infection can be gradually exhausted in settings of persistent virus infections by the high expression of PD-1 <xref rid="pone.0093620-Nakamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093620-Missale1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Studies have shown that toll-like receptors (TLRs) can detect the presence of HCV infection through recognition of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and control activation of the adaptive immune responses by inducing dendritic cell maturation <xref rid="pone.0093620-Pasare1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093620-Hackl1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In human monocytes, TLR3 is localized in intracellular endosomal compartments and the agonist of TLR3 represents an attractive target for pursuing the HCV clearance <xref rid="pone.0093620-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, up to now, the effects of Tregs, PD-1 expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells or CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and TLR3 expressing CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes on virological response in patients treated with IFN&#x003b1; plus RBV remains poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to clarify the role of Tregs, PD-1 and TLR3 in treatment response by assessing the baseline levels and dynamic changes of these immune mediators in patients receiving the combined antiviral treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093620.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093620.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.

In the present study, proportions of Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells or CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were significantly increased in the patients at baseline as compared with the controls, indicating that the impaired cellular immune function might contribute to chronic HCV infection.

In our study, there was a significant decrease of Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in chronic hepatitis C patients at 12 weeks after treatment compared with their baseline levels, indicating that IFN/RBV treatment could restore HCV-specific T-cells response by reducing circulating CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Furthermore, the decrease proportions of Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells or CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were more obvious in cEVR patients than those in non-cEVR cases. According to Thimme et al. <xref rid="pone.0093620-Bengsch1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093620-Seigel1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, T cell exhaustion contributed to the failure of about half of HCV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and the antiviral efficacy of HCV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was linked to surface expression of PD-1. Other studies had also reported that PD-1 was up-regulated on total CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in patients with chronic infection compared with normal subjects, and antiviral therapy that led to sustained elimination of circulating HCV RNA was associated with down-regulation of PD-1 on a wide range of cells <xref rid="pone.0093620-Raziorrouh1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093620-GoldenMason2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Besides PD-1 modulation, activation of Tregs also involved in impairment of HCV-specific T effector cells. Langhans&#x02019;s study proposed that antiviral therapy is likely to shift the functional balance in the immune system between Tregs and T effector cells towards more efficacious effector responses in chronic hepatitis C patients. Our finding was in accordance with Langhans report <xref rid="pone.0093620-Langhans1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, which indicated that interferon combined with ribavirin therapy could enhance proliferation of T effector cells as well as inhibit functions of Tregs, thus, reverses Treg-mediated suppression of T effector cells in chronic hepatitis C.</p><p>Treatment with IFN&#x003b1;-2b/RBV or PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV for 12 weeks, the frequencies of circulating Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> in two groups or PD-1 expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in IFN&#x003b1;-2b/RBV group in patients who achieved cEVR were significantly lower than those in patients without cEVR. For PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV treated group, the frequencies of PD-1 expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> was also lower in cEVR patients, but the <italic>P</italic> value was higher than 0.0167, perhaps on account of small sample size. Therefore, we speculated that Tregs and PD-1 could inhibit the responder cells population and function, which correlated with the risk of developing non-response. In contrast, patients who showed relatively abrogated capacity of Tregs and PD-1 might achieve cEVR and recover from HCV infection. This demonstrated that the suppression of Tregs and PD-1 might correlate with cEVR as it could generate an effective immune response and which provide a possible therapeutic target for immune modulation. However, whether the decrease in the frequency of Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were the necessary causes of cEVR warranted further investigation. No significant differences of the Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells or CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were found between IFN&#x003b1;-2b/RBV and PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV treated groups at any parallel time either from cEVR or non-cEVR, indicating that the immunomodulatory effects of IFN&#x003b1;-2b and PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a were comparable.</p><p>Activation of TLRs can induce both innate and adaptive immunity <xref rid="pone.0093620-Gay1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. TLR3 signaling is induced by double-stranded (ds) RNA, a molecular signature of viruses, and is mediated by the TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-&#x003b2; (TRIF) adaptor molecule. Thus, TLR3 plays an important role in the host response to viral infections <xref rid="pone.0093620-Schroder1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The innate immune response activated through recognition of viral PAMPs by TLR3 leads to IFN-&#x003b2; induction, which in turn increases the interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) expression. Thus far, TLR3 expression in peripheral blood has not been well analyzed in chronic hepatitis C patients under antiviral treatment. Monocytes in peripheral blood were identified as the cells responding to TLRs stimulation <xref rid="pone.0093620-Villacres1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In present study, we found that the level of TLR3 expressing CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes was elevated in chronic hepatitis C patients and further increased at 12 weeks, but returned to baseline level at 24 weeks after treatment with IFN&#x003b1;-2b/RBV or PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a/RBV. This change was more significant in cEVR patients than that in non-cEVR ones. This suggested that the anti-HCV treatment could increase TLR3 expressing CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes to enhance antiviral activity at early stage of treatment and restore the cell number and function to baseline level as HCV was cleared. An important finding coming from our TLR3 analysis was that lower peripheral TLR3 expressing CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes at baseline was an independent predictor for cEVR. In keeping with our findings, Hashad et al. <xref rid="pone.0093620-Hashad1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and Yuki et al. <xref rid="pone.0093620-Yuki1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> found that pretreatment up-regulation of hepatic TLR3 expression was a predictive factor for non-respond. HCV infection could activate monocytes via TLRs pathway and elevate the expression of TLR3 as our study found, but pre-existing monocytes activation was a factor mediating reduced responses to TLR3 stimulation <xref rid="pone.0093620-SarasinFilipowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Thus, infection of monocytes by HCV may account for a defective response to HCV infection. Furthermore, the endogenous IFN system activation in the liver before treatment not only was ineffective in HCV clearance but also hampered further response to exogenous IFN plus RBV <xref rid="pone.0093620-GoldenMason2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. These reasons might explain why the level of TLR3 expressing CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes was lower in cEVR patients than that in non-cEVR ones, but further and expanded investigations were needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, the baseline level of peripheral TLR3 expressing CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes might serve as a predictor of response to antiviral therapy and have a substantial impact on treatment decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the present study suggested that low peripheral TLR3 expressing CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes at baseline was a novel predictor for early virological response of antiviral therapy in chronic HCV-infected patients.
