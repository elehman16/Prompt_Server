Although development and advancement in understanding of the pathophysiology of pain, analgesic's pharmacology and the development of better effective techniques for postoperative pain control, patients still continue to experience considerable discomfort. Laparotomy results in parietal pain, whereas laparoscopy has a visceral component, a somatic component and shoulder pain secondary to diaphragmatic irritation as a result of CO<sub>2</sub> pneumoperitoneum.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The degree of the pain after laparoscopic procedures has multifactorial influence including the volume of residual gas,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] type of gas used for pneumoperitoneum,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] pressure created by the pneumoperitoneum[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and insufflated gas temperature.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Earlier scientists have also reported several beneficial effects of the intraperitoneal application of bupivacaine with morphine on postoperative pain management after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Buprenorphine is a semisynthetic, highly lipophilic opioid and showed slow receptor association, but high affinity to multiple sites from which dissociation was very slow and incomplete (T-half = 166 min, 50% binding after 1 h), in contrast fentanyl achieved equilibrium rapidly and also dissociated rapidly and completely (T-half = 6.8 min and 100% by 1 h). Thus, buprenorphine has a longer duration of analgesia action compared to fentanyl. Studies have also shown that when buprenorphine is given in combination with a local anesthetic in inflamed tissues, it improves the quality of analgesia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] When this drug is given intrathecally, it improves quality and duration of postoperative analgesia as it is a &#x000b5; receptor agonist with low intrinsic activity.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, buprenorphine has side effects similar to those of opioids, that is, sedation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sweating, and headache. It is 25&#x02013;50 times more potent comparatively. Thus, we have used buprenorphine and not fentanyl for our study. Studies have also reported that buprenorphine added to the local anesthetic, for brachial plexus block, for upper extremity surgery results in longer postoperative analgesia than traditional opioids.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] A review of the literature, especially from our country, shows that studies to assess the analgesic efficacy of intraperitoneal instillation of buprenorphine and bupivacaine during laparoscopic cholecystectomy are rarely undertaken.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Objective</title><p>To assess the analgesic efficacy of the combination of bupivacaine and buprenorphine in alleviating postoperative pain following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present research is a randomized, double-blind prospective controlled study conducted in the Department of Anaesthesiology, Dayanand Medical College and Hospital Ludhiana, Punjab after formal ethical approval from Hospital's Ethics Committee. The study sample consisted of 90 adults patients, age group 22&#x02013;65 years, of either sex belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I and II and scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy under a standardized general anesthesia technique. A prior written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects. Prior to the procedure, detailed history, general physical examination and relevant systemic examination of all the patients were done following all standard protocols and precautions. Routine investigations such as hemogram, urine routine, renal function test, liver function tests, serum electrolytes, random blood sugar, and electrocardiogram were performed and analyzed in detail prior to procedure following all standard precautions and protocols required. Exclusion criteria consisted those who were uncooperative, unwilling, having history of anaphylaxis to local anesthetics and/or opioids and the drugs to be used, history of drug abuse, morbidly obese patients, ASA classification III, IV, V and patients having any other significant co-morbidities or any other with psychiatric disease.</p><p>The subjects were shifted to surgical theater followed by carefully measuring the required vital parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate and pulse oximeter oxygen saturation level (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and recording them accordingly. Intravenous (i.v.) access achieved. After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) for 3 min, induction of anesthesia was achieved with thiopentone sodium (2.5%) 4&#x02013;6 mg/kg i.v. slowly (until the abolition of eyelash reflex) along with the injection of fentanyl 1.5 mcg/kg i.v. Intubation with an appropriate cuffed endotracheal tube was facilitated using neuromuscular blocker suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg i.v. Anesthesia was maintained using controlled ventilation with halothane (0.5&#x02013;1.5%) and nitrous oxide 66% + O<sub>2</sub> (33%) using Bain's circuit. Vital parameters including heart rate, BP, electrocardiogram, temperature, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> and SpO<sub>2</sub> were carefully monitored throughout the procedure. Neuromuscular blockade was achieved with pancuronium bromide or atracurium besylate. All patients were given an injection of metoclopramide 10 mg i.v. intraoperatively. We have used commercially available bupivacaine and buprenorphine (i.v. injection) from NEON Company, Mumbai, India, under the brand name ANAWIN (0.5%) and BUPRIGESIC. At the end of the procedure, all the subjects were randomly allocated to groups using computer-generated random numbers. Each group of 30 subjects, that is, Group A: Physiological saline (0.9% normal saline) 25 ml after the surgery completion; Group B: Bupivacaine 25 ml (0.25%) after surgery completion; Group C: Bupivacaine 25 ml (0.25%) + buprenorphine (0.3 mg) after surgery completion. The surgeon, unaware of the nature of the study drug, was requested to instill the drug on the upper surface of liver and on the right subdiaphragmatic space to allow it to diffuse into the space near and above the hepatoduodenal ligament and above the gall bladder. Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with an injection of neostigmine 2.5 mg i.v. plus glycopyrrolate 0.5 mg i.v. The trachea was extubated, and subjects shifted to the recovery room, where the observations were made and recorded by an anesthesiologist; unaware of the group to which subject belongs. All subjects were made familiar with the visual analogue scale (VAS) score preoperatively and instructed in detail on its use as a tool for measuring postoperative pain. All subjects were asked to describe the pain relief at 0 (on arrival at recovery), 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h postoperatively on a four-point scale. Patients were informed before surgery that they could request an analgesic as if required. A total number of subjects in each group requiring supplemental analgesic was recorded. Subjects showing a VAS &#x02265;3 and/or verbal response scale (VRS) &#x0003c;2 scores were administered a supplemental analgesic during the postoperative period. Analgesia was supplemented either with intramuscular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac sodium or another opioid like tramadol.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All observations recorded were carefully collected, segregated, categorized, tabulated, and meticulously analyzed working with a critical difference through analysis of variance and Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.

However, patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures experience postoperative pain especially in back, abdomen and shoulder region that is one of the critical medical areas to be explored. However, it is associated with less pain and disability without increasing mortality or overall morbidity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves several components (parietal, visceral and shoulder pain) with different intensities and their own time courses.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Clinicians have used various modalities and measures to ameliorate this pain associated with laparoscopy with significant success rate. Some of the measures were; evacuation of the insufflating gas,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] application of local anesthetic to the site of surgery,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] infiltration of local anestheic to the skin and muscle wounds[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and usage of appropriate NSAIDS.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The doses of bupivacaine used in our study were lower than those thought to cause systemic toxicity. All the groups were statistically comparable with respect to age, sex distribution, body weight.</p><p>Our results significantly correlate with the previous observation of various authors who studied the efficacy of 15 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine (Group A) administered intraperitoneally immediately after pneumoperitoneum and the same amount at the end of operation and compared it to the control group (15 ml of 0.9% saline) in laparoscopic cholecystectomies.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] VAS pain scores were significantly lower up to 8 h in Group A as compared to Group B. The prolonged analgesia observed in this study can be attributed to the use of higher volumes and concentration of bupivacaine. In Group C mean pain scores (VAS) at rest over the 24 h period was lower than Group A and Group B. VAS score remained low in 83.33% of patients up to 24 h. The results are consistent with the observation of scientists who demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of bupivacaine 0.25% 30 ml plus morphine 2 mg significantly reduced postoperative analgesic requirement during the first 6 h after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In our study also the requirement of postoperative analgesic in 10% of patients was delayed up to 8 h in Group C.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This longer duration may be attributed to the lipophilic nature of the buprenorphine compared to hydrophilic morphine, due to which it is longer acting analgesic. In our study, mean VRS scores were higher in Group C as compared to Group A and Group B at all-time intervals during the 24 h postoperative period. Scores of 2 (good relief) or 3 (complete relief) on the VRS were reported more often by patients in Group C than in Group A and Group B which resulted in higher total pain relief scores.</p><p>Finally, a detailed comparison of VAS and VRS scores among the various groups shows that the intraperitoneal instillation of bupivacaine with lipophilic opioids, that is, buprenorphine local anesthetic results in a significant reduction in pain and lesser need of analgesic postoperatively [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. In our study, it was found that only five patients (16.67%) needed analgesic in Group C. Rest 25 patients did not need rescue analgesic up to 24 h postoperatively. In Group B, 15 patients (50%) required analgesic. In Group A, all 30 patients (100%) required analgesia, 21 patients at 0 h, seven patients at 1<sup>st</sup> h, one patient each at 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> h, respectively. Thus, the number of patients requiring analgesic was higher in Group A (100%) as compared to Group B (50%) and Group C (16.67%) in 24 h postoperative period and the difference in the number of patients requiring rescue analgesic between all groups was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). This further supports the fact that analgesic effect of intraperitoneal bupivacaine plus buprenorphine is better comparatively.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Trends in systolic blood pressures in different groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-23-g007"/></fig><p>In our study, the control group showed a significant increase in heart rate up to 24 h postoperatively when compared to Group C at all-time intervals and to Group B as well. The systolic BP and diastolic pressures were significantly low in Group C as compared to Group A and Group B at all-time intervals postoperatively [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. There was no statistical significant difference in diastolic BP between the Group A and Group B except at 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup> h postoperatively. The respiratory rate was significantly low in Group C as compared to Group A and Group B at all-time intervals throughout 24 h period postoperatively. These results were similar to the study by other authors,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] who studied the effect of intra-peritoneal bupivacaine as an analgesic in laparoscopic cholecystectomy postoperative pain management. Thus, hemodynamic parameters also showed significant improvement in Group C indicating better postoperative analgesia in Group C patients receiving a combination of bupivacaine and buprenorphine.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Trends in diastolic blood pressure in different groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-23-g008"/></fig><p>To conclude our observations and groups behavior clearly shows that instillation of combination of buprenorphine along with 0.25% bupivacaine intra-peritoneally effectively relieves postoperative pain for a longer duration after laparoscopic cholecystectomy as compared to the instillation of only bupivacaine or 0.9% normal saline.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and
