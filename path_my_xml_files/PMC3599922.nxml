In order to better understand the potential reasons for the improved outcomes in the intervention group, the experiences of the participating health workers were explored through qualitative focus group discussions, as focus group methodology has been found to be a useful method of obtaining a detailed understanding of client and health worker perspectives within health systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Two ninety minute focus groups were conducted in Nyanza province, a poor agricultural region of Kenya, with 10 health workers from the intervention group clinics where staff had received the training programme, and 10 health workers from the control group where staff had not received the training during the earlier randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>These focus group discussions suggest that the health workers in the intervention group perceived an increase in their communication, diagnostic and counselling skills, and that the clients in the intervention group noticed and appreciated these enhanced skills, while health workers and clients in the control group were both aware of the lack of these skills.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Enhanced health worker skills conferred by the mental health training programme may be responsible for the significant improvement in outcome of patients in the intervention clinics found in the randomised controlled trial, despite the general shortage of medicines and other health system weaknesses. These findings suggest that strengthening mental health training for primary care staff is worthwhile even where health systems are not strong and where the medicine supply cannot be guaranteed.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISCRCTN53515024/">ISRCTN 53515024</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Mental disorders are common in primary care across the world. A few specific interventions for single disorders or single client groups in low income countries have been evaluated but it remains challenging to scale up for all the usual mental disorders and client groups within existing human and financial resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Since 2005, the Kenya Ministry of Health has conducted a programme to train 3000 level 2 and level 3 primary health care staff across Kenya in collaboration with the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC), Kenya Psychiatric Association and the WHO Collaborating Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, funded by Nuffield International Foundation and using a sustainable general health system approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In 2010 the research project conducted a phase 2 exploratory trial as a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the effect of an affordable low cost training intervention, which was integrated with the national health sector reforms. The training intervention was accompanied by the World Health Organization primary care guidelines adapted for Kenya, and was also intended to be accompanied by routine supervision from district staff and by routine availability of medicines in the clinics. The trial assessed the impact of the training programme: (i) on the competencies of primary care staff to recognise mental disorders, treat and make appropriate referrals to the scarce specialist service; (ii) on recovery (improved health and social outcomes and quality of life) of clients. The trial was conducted in a real clinical field setting, using local trainers (who had been trained in 2006, received a refresher course in 2009 and had delivered several such courses per year since 2005) to train health staff in the intervention group. The project did not exert any special influence on the usual local availability of medicines, district supervision or local health management information systems. During the course of the trial Kenya, and especially Nyanza Province, experienced a severe shortage of medicines, and this was reflected in the research findings on medicine availability in the clinics participating in the trial. Nonetheless, the trial found significant improvement in the clients of the trained health workers in the intervention group compared with those in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Since focus group methodology has been found to be an effective way to explore health worker and client views within health system contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and at the request of the funder (the UK Department for International Development), we therefore conducted focus groups with some health workers and clients from the trial to better understand their perspectives and experiences. This paper reports the experiences of some of the health workers in the trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We contacted 20 health workers from 20 of the 100 clinics which had taken part in the RCT and invited them to take part in one of four ninety minute focus groups (10 primary care workers selected from the intervention group, and 10 primary care workers selected from the control group). We paid respondents&#x02019; transport and subsistence for the day they came for the interviews. No additional payments were made. There was no communication about the study between the different groups of participants before their respective focus groups were held.</p><sec><title>Ethical considerations, explanation and consent</title><p>An explanatory information sheet was given to each client and health worker in English and Kiswahili, and read out to those who could not read. We explained verbally in English, Kiswahili and Luo to the participants the purpose of the meeting and asked for their individual consents. They were reassured of confidentiality and told that we wanted to learn from their experiences. We then assigned each participant an identification number. They were told that the conversations would be taped but they would not be identified by name.</p><p>The focus group discussions were held in August 2011, eight months after the end of the randomised controlled trial, during a residential two days in a small hotel at Chulaimbo, near Kisumu, which was easily accessible by all those invited. They were conducted by CO assisted by RJ, and each lasted 90&#x02013;120&#x000a0;minutes. Discussions were conducted mainly in English, but also in the local language where participants could not understand English or found it easier to express themselves in Luo. A voice recording of all the sessions was made, and both RJ and JA took written notes which were used to help clarify the transcript material where necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Instruments</title><p>The focus group discussions were guided by the following exploratory questions:</p><p>To start with, could you tell us what you know about mental health?</p><p>What are your views concerning psychiatric disorders in this district, and in this health centre?</p><p>What are the common types of mental/psychiatric disorders encountered locally?</p><p>What is your experience in managing these cases?</p><p>Could you describe a specific case?</p><p>Are there any agencies involved in the management of the mentally ill? Please give examples.</p><p>In what way do they help?</p><p>Have you had any training in mental health? Please specify.</p><p>Did you attend the recently concluded training for primary health workers? Please describe your experience.</p><p>What were the positive things about the training?</p><p>What were the negative things about the training?</p><p>Did you benefit from the training?</p><p>How has it affected your practice?</p><p>Have the patients benefited in any way? Please give a specific example.</p><p>Please describe how you apply the knowledge and skills learnt in the training? If it is not applicable, please explain why.</p><p>Would you recommend the training to a colleague?</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The recordings of the discussions were transcribed and translated into English where necessary. The voice recordings and the transcripts were analysed for common themes emerging in response to the guideline questions. Matrices were created to help facilitate the comparison of text across the different categories of informant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>11 health workers attended from the control group and 14 from the intervention group. This was more than the numbers invited, but these additional 5 attendees fulfilled eligibility criteria of having taken part in the RCT, and were therefore included in the respective focus groups, and their statements are included in this analysis. Some health workers who had not been part of the randomised controlled study also arrived at the focus group venue. They were not sent away as many had travelled far, and were therefore placed in a separate focus group for the purposes of discussion. As they had not received the training intervention, their comments are included here as part of the controls.</p><sec><title>Understanding of mental health and mental illness</title><p>The health workers in the intervention group were able to recognise the less severe as well as more severe forms of mental disorder and hence perceived the load of mental illness to be high in the community, and described a broad spectrum of mental health problems seen in the clinics</p><p><italic>&#x0201c;I feel that mental illness is very important because like in our facility we can see like two clients a week</italic>. <italic>Mostly they are psychotic</italic>.&#x0201d; Health worker 5, intervention group.</p><p>In contrast, the health workers in the control group thought that mental illness occurred only &#x0201c;<italic>once in a while</italic>&#x0201d;.

Health worker 16, intervention group.</p></sec><sec><title>Involvement of the community</title><p>This was crucial and some of the trained health workers had opened dialogue with the community members through health education talks given in the community meetings (Chief&#x02019;s &#x0201c;baraza&#x0201d; and church gatherings) which, in their view, led to greater acceptance of the patients in the community and helped to de-stigmatise mental illness:</p><p>&#x0201c;<italic>After the training</italic>, <italic>what me and my colleague did</italic>, <italic>first we decided to go to the chief barazas and informed them that even mental illness would be treated at our local dispensary</italic>, <italic>and then we approached the in</italic>-<italic>charge of the Siaya district psychiatric unit who promised to give us some drugs</italic>, <italic>so that as we get the clients we would forward their names and could come on a weekly basis</italic>, <italic>see them but leave us with some drugs to be giving them every month</italic>.&#x0201d; Health worker, intervention group.</p><p>The trained health workers recognised that the reintegration of mentally ill patients with other types of patients made them feel accepted by the general community, enhanced recovery and prevented psychosocial exclusion. Some health workers said they had been able to form patient support groups but that it was challenging since the patients were not homogeneous and had differing needs:</p><p>&#x0201c;<italic>And unlike in HIV where we really are able to form support groups</italic>, <italic>mental illness is a bit very challenging to form a support group or same because some people have got diverse</italic>, <italic>mental illnesses are diverse because traditions are completely very different</italic>. <italic>So when you want to put them together</italic>, <italic>it will be like who are we</italic>, <italic>who are these people</italic>.&#x0201d; Health worker 20, intervention group.</p></sec><sec><title>Rehabilitation</title><p>The health workers however had not so far been able to help patients with specific activities of daily living, or help with workplace skills, but they did feel that the possibility of assessment and treatment at primary care level was better for speedy rehabilitation than admission to a level 4 hospital:</p><p>&#x0201c;<italic>Yes</italic>, <italic>I think it has done a lot to rehabilitate these patients because</italic>, <italic>let</italic>&#x02019;<italic>s say when they are taken to a psychiatric unit</italic>, <italic>some of them don</italic>&#x02019;<italic>t get well quickly enough because there is that mentality that the patient feels</italic>, <italic>he is mentally ill</italic>. <italic>And as the integration to these other health centres</italic>, <italic>the patient just feels as if he</italic>&#x02019;<italic>s among other clients who are sick maybe with malaria or these other types of illnesses</italic>, <italic>so psychologically he feels he is being managed as a patient with malaria</italic>, <italic>in a way it makes him recover very fast</italic>.&#x0201d; Health worker, intervention group.</p><p>&#x0201c;<italic>I think it has improved our referral system because whenever we have patient who is not responding to treatment</italic>, <italic>we follow the district psychiatric nurse to come and review</italic>.&#x0201d; Health worker 26, intervention group.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first qualitative focus group study of health workers involved in a randomised controlled trial of primary care training on mental health in Kenya. The study was conducted in Nyanza province, Kenya, in the public sector primary care system, and the study findings are limited to this group, although are likely to have wider relevance for Kenyan primary care as a whole. Further limitations of the study include the fact that most of the research team for the focus group study were also involved in the randomised controlled trial. The use of both clients and health workers affords some triangulation of the findings (see accompanying papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]).</p><p>From the focus group discussions it seems that trained health workers reported being more effective than the untrained health workers in assessment, diagnosis and treatment. The skills learned during the training seemed to help, not only in the better management of psychosocial problems, but also in better management of physical disorders such as HIV, by appropriate counselling and decreasing non-compliance with medications.</p><p>Since the drug supply was poor in both the control and the intervention groups it is likely that these enhanced psychosocial skills in the health workers, noticed by both themselves and their clients (see accompanying papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]), are the factors that contributed to better recovery in the clients in the intervention group compared to those in the control clinics in the randomised controlled trial reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These focus group discussions suggest that the health workers in the intervention group perceived an increase in communication, diagnostic and counselling skills, while health workers in the control group were aware of the lack of these skills. These findings are triangulated to some extent by the findings in the accompanying paper about client experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], where the clients in the intervention group noticed and appreciated enhanced communication, diagnostic and counselling skills in their respective health workers, whereas clients in the control group were aware of the lack of these skills. These enhanced generic health worker skills conferred by the mental health training programme may be at least partly responsible for the significant improvement in outcome of patients in the intervention clinics where staff had received the training programme, compared to the control group, despite the general shortage of medicines and other health system weaknesses.</p><p>These study findings concur with those found in a randomised controlled trial of the same training programme in Iraq, where research observers found better diagnosis and communication skills in staff trained in the program, compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>These findings support the value of strengthening mental health training for primary care staff and indicate that such training is worthwhile even where health systems are not strong and where the medicine supply cannot be guaranteed.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>RJ was responsible for overall design of the study, obtained funding, and co-led the focus groups with CO, wrote the first drafts of the introduction and discussion, and subsequent drafts of the overall paper. CO chaired the focus group discussions, supplied the transcription of data and the main analysis of findings, and wrote the first drafts of the methods and results. SO supervised the local implementation of the study design. JA coordinated the invitations of client and health workers, and took notes of the focus group discussions.
