All specimens were wrapped in doubled plastic bags and stored frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. Before biomechanical testing, the specimens were thawed at room temperature in a humidity-controlled environment for 8 h. The soft tissues were removed by dissection, leaving the ligaments, facet joint capsules, and intervertebral discs intact. The end vertebrae were trimmed, fixed with plain screws, and embedded in liquid self-curing denture base material and denture base resin (Type II). Each pot included a 10-mm screw secured to a metal plate that was incorporated in the resin cast. This screw was located at the level of the middle column of the vertebrae and was used as an anchor for the testing machine. The resin was left to cure for 30 min. To avoid the influence of air exposure on biomechanical behavior, all specimens were kept moist during the tests by spraying them with saline solution. Handling experimental material routinely used in <italic>in vitro</italic> biomechanical investigation in this manner, does not alter the material characteristics of the bone and soft tissues.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Creation of an experimental fracture</title><p>After the intact spine was tested for flexibility, an unstable burst fracture was created in the L3 vertebra using the pre-injury and the dropped-mass technique. A 2-mm drill bit was used to create holes in the L3 vertebral body with V-shaped corpectomy [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. After the pre-injury model had been created, the specimen was mounted through its pots on a ferric base. The specimen was flexed to approximately 10&#x000b0; and a 10-kg weight was dropped from a height of 0.5 m on a vertical rail, and then from 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 m, and so on, until the V-shaped cut closed. After the creation of the L3 vertebral fracture, it was ensured that the pedicle remained intact for further experimentation.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A line diagram of the specimens in the MPS and PPS groups showing.

Two kinds of spinal fixations (i.e., with or without intermediate screw placement) were studied in each group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. After a fracture was created, a short-segment posterior pedicle screw construct was used to realign and stabilize the spine. The specimens in the MPS group were fixated with monoaxial pedicle screws, and polyaxial pedicle screws were used for those in the PPS group. Short-segment pedicle screw devices were used in this study. The specimens in which an intermediate screw was not applied received a 4-screw (monoaxial or polyaxial) construct incorporating one vertebra above and one vertebra below the fracture. The remaining specimens (MPSi and PPSi) underwent a 6-screw construct in which two intermediate screws were added to the fractured vertebrae in addition to the 4-screw construct described above [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The intermediate screws were of the same length and were inserted to the same depth as the other four screws. We reused the same specimens in MPS group and MPSi group, PPS group and PPSi group in order to standardize the procedure and avoid any difference amongst the specimens in the same group.

All specimens were subjected to 0&#x02013;500 N flexion and axial compression in a displacement-controlled mode at a rate of 5 mm/min on an MTS858 (Material Testing System, MTS) testing machine. The MTS858 testing machine is used to make the specimen move in the mode of flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. The ranges of motion (ROMs) of the relative intervertebral motions were automatically recorded by the Eagle-4 and Motion Analysis position capture and measurement system (Micron Company, California, USA). The camera system recorded the movements of infrared LED markers attached to each of the levels, L2&#x02013;L4. A digitizing probe was used to locate landmarks on each vertebra from which local coordinate systems were established. The local coordinate systems were aligned to the primary anatomic planes (sagittal, coronal, and axial). The relations of the superior vertebral local coordinate system with respect to the inferior vertebral coordinate system were quantified with Euler angle transformations. These transformations were calculated to determine the ROM. ROM was defined as the change in angular position relative to the origin. Subsequent transformations were then used to determine the ROM of L2&#x02013;L4.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The ROMs calculated for the 4- and 6-screw constructs were then compared with the values obtained for the intact and fractured specimens.

A smaller ROM due to the use of an intermediate screw represents enhanced stability of the construct, in contrast to a larger ROM that was observed in the standard short-segment construct.

Many surgeons believe that anterior column reconstruction is critical in correcting kyphotic deformity and reestablishing the anterior load bearing capacity of the vertebral component. Short-segment posterior spinal instrumentation using pedicle screws remains the standard method for the fixation of thoracic and lumbar fractures, with acceptable results. The advantages of this technique include less surgical dissection, blood loss, and time in surgery, and as a result, decreased perioperative morbidity. However, loss of reduction and instrumentation failure associated with this technique is well described in the literature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> These failures have been attributed to poor bone quality, inadequate anterior column support, and insufficient points of fixation.</p><p>The biomechanical properties of monoaxial pedicle screws have been widely reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> Segmental fixation with additional monoaxial pedicle screws at the level of the fracture increases construct stiffness and shields the fractured vertebral body from anterior loads. Furthermore, this additional point of fixation allows for a 3-point reduction maneuver, analogous to that used for reduction of long bone fractures. In a recent prospective randomized study, the efficacy of the fracture-level screw combination in achieving and maintaining correction for the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures was evaluated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> The authors of that study concluded that reinforcement with a fracture-level screw could help provide and maintain improved kyphosis correction. It also offered immediate spinal stability in patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture. Another mid-term clinical study demonstrated superior results with the fracture-level screw combination, supporting the evidence of other reports.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> Interestingly, in most of these studies, the pedicle screws used were monoaxial, despite the current trend toward using polyaxial screws in short-segment fracture fixation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> On review of the literature, we found that there was a paucity of data, both clinical and biomechanical, on the use of polyaxial screw as an intermediate in unstable burst fractures, and thus this biomechanical study was instituted.</p><p>The current study showed that when short-segment constructs contained intermediate screws, flexion, extension, and torsion decreased in both the MPSi and PPSi groups, compared to the respective constructs (MPS and PPS) without this reinforcement. Lateral bending also decreased in the PPSi group. Without intermediate screws, the short-segment construct in the PPS group had significantly greater ROM in flexion and extension when compared with the MPS group. However, there were no significant differences between the MPSi and PPSi groups. The addition of intermediate screws at the level of a burst fracture significantly increased the stiffness of the short-segment pedicle fixation, irrespective of whether monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws were used. However, this increase was more significant for the MPSi construct, as the PPSi already had significantly increased stiffness as compared to the MPSi. These results may be because there is a better coupling between the polyaxial screw heads and the connecting rod. Thus, there is less torsion at the coupling site and consequently less stress on the entire construct. The intermediate screw provides a 3-point fixation of the fractured segment. When using monoaxial screws, the addition of an intermediate forces the surgeon to bend the connecting rod to accommodate the additional screw. Polyaxial screws, on the other hand, facilitate the installation of the connecting rod, and their biomechanical properties have been reported in several studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> Stanford <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> suggested that the rod&#x02013;screw link design of the polyaxial screw reduces its static compressive bending yield strength as compared with the fixed screw designs. Liu <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> pointed out that there were significant differences between the monoaxial screws and polyaxial screws in the bending stiffness, yield load, yield torque, and torsional stiffness in static tests (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Shepard <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> suggested that polyaxial screws do not significantly decrease the stiffness of the construct. On the contrary, the polyaxial constructs create more security by permitting better contact and holding strength between the screw head and the rod. When there is the combined effect of bending loads and shear force on the rods, there would be higher resistance to rotational slippage between the rod and the screw head.</p><p>The limitations of study are that the data were pertinent to results immediately after surgery, but do not take into account early bone resorption or the cyclical loading effect which have long-term impacts on outcome. The flexibility of the construct was tested on a burst fracture model that was created in a controlled and reproducible manner by the pre-injury and dropped-mass technique. Nevertheless, the pattern and nature of a spinal burst fracture in clinic is more variable and unpredictable. Anekstein <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> hypothesized that the true mechanical effect of the intermediate screws is less predictable in <italic>in vivo</italic> settings. Only a prospective clinical study can show the true practical significance of the addition of intermediate screws.</p><p>We used, a model of fresh-frozen calf spines. Although not human, calf spine has been used before as a valid biomechanical model.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref> Calf is a tetrapod; its anatomical characteristics and common fracture site are different from those of the human, and because the calf lumbar spines (L1&#x02013;L5) can be easily dissected from the other vertebrae of calf, we chose the L1&#x02013;L5 calf lumbar spines and made the L3 vertebral fracture instead of the T12 or L1 which are the most common fracture sites in humans. Calf spine segments are presumed to have higher bone mineral density than human spines, and therefore have different biomechanical behavior. This difference may influence the results of any biomechanical study. Nevertheless, the use of an animal model allows for smaller inter-specimen differences, as the human spine has been shown to have significant variability in bone mineral density that might potentially affect the test results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref> As this study is comparative, the authors favored the animal model to that of the human cadaver spine. It can be argued that the number of cases in each group was less in the present study to reach a meaningful conclusion. However, in the previous biomechanical studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref> the number of the cases used in the experiment was usually six or seven. In the present study, we used 12 cases and 6 cases in each group and we believe that these numbers have brought forward meaningful results. Another disadvantage of this study is that there was no comparison with long-segment fixations and application of the cross link, which have been shown to have better biomechanical stability than the short segment in managing unstable burst fractures.</p><p>In conclusion, the addition of intermediate screws at the level of a burst fracture significantly increases the stability of a short-segment pedicle fixation, using either monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws. However, the short-segment MPS fixation group was significantly more stable in flexion and extension than the short-segment PPS fixation group. We believe that this study provides a biomechanical rationale for using an intermediate screw at the level of fractured vertebrae with posterior short-segment fixation, especially when using monoaxial screws for fixing the unstable burst fractures of the lumbar region.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
