The primary outcome was the enrollment of 50 infants in six to nine months at 10 sites. The first pilot was halted after four months for failure to enroll a single infant.

Infants with suboptimal response to INO received either aerosolized saline or IPGE<sub>1</sub> at a low (150&#x000a0;ng/kg/min) or high dose (300&#x000a0;ng/kg/min) for a maximum duration of 72&#x000a0;hours.

Due to the delay in the physiologic fall in pulmonary vascular resistance, it is also known as persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). The goal of therapy is to decrease the regional pulmonary vascular resistance of ventilated lung areas, thus decreasing intrapulmonary shunting and selectively reducing the pulmonary-artery pressure without causing systemic vasodilation. Intravenously administered vasodilators lack pulmonary selectivity leading to systemic side effects. Inhaled nitric oxide (INO), a selective pulmonary vasodilator, has revolutionized the treatment of respiratory failure in the newborn. However, there is lack of sustained improvement in 30 to 46% of infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, INO requires specialized delivery systems, making the treatment expensive.</p><p>Aerosolized prostaglandins I<sub>2</sub> (PGI<sub>2</sub>) and E<sub>1</sub> (PGE<sub>1</sub>) have been reported to be effective selective pulmonary vasodilators in animals, adults, and preterm and term newborns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Compared to PGI<sub>2</sub>, PGE<sub>1</sub> has a shorter half-life, lower acid dissociation constant (pKa, 6.3 versus 10.5), bronchodilator action, and anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects on the alveolar, interstitial, and vascular spaces of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, PGE<sub>1</sub> is readily available in pharmacies of hospitals with neonatal services and has a proven safety record from its intravenous use in ductal-dependent cardiac anomalies. Prostaglandin nebulization can be performed without the sophisticated technical equipment needed for INO and hence is less expensive. Prostaglandins and nitric oxide relax the vascular smooth muscle through two different second-messenger systems; therefore, in combination, INO and inhaled PGE<sub>1</sub> (IPGE<sub>1</sub>) may have a synergistic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>We reported the safety and feasibility of short-term administration of IPGE<sub>1</sub> in an un-blinded phase I/II dose-escalation single center study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] suggesting the need for placebo-controlled randomized studies to establish the efficacy and safety of this drug for NHRF. In that study, four doses ranging from 25 to 300&#x000a0;ng/kg/min were tested for a maximum duration of three hours. The purpose of the two studies included in this report was to determine the feasibility of conducting a future large randomized control trial (RCT) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of prolonged IPGE<sub>1</sub> at high-volume level III to IV neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network (NRN).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pilot one: a randomized clinical trial of inhaled PGE<sub>1</sub> in neonatal hypoxemic respiratory failure</title><p>Following the availability of INO for the treatment of NHRF, several interventional clinical trials for NHRF were halted prematurely for lack of enrollment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, we sought to quantify the number of potentially eligible patients and perform a pilot trial before embarking upon a RCT of IPGE<sub>1</sub>. Late preterm and term infants with NHRF who had an oxygenation index (OI) (OI&#x02009;=&#x02009;mean airway pressure (MAP)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO<sub>2</sub>)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100/arterial oxygen tension (P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)) &#x02265;15 and &#x0003c;25 on two arterial blood gases (ABGs) and had not previously received INO were eligible for the study. Infants would be randomly assigned to receive two doses of IPGE<sub>1</sub> (300 and 150&#x000a0;ng/kg/min) or placebo over a maximum duration of 72&#x000a0;hours. The primary outcome was the ability to enroll 50 infants in six to nine months at 10 sites, without excessive protocol violations or adverse effects. Secondary outcome variables included the definition of optimal dose and duration of treatment with the study aerosol, the need for INO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) mortality, and duration of mechanical ventilation, O<sub>2</sub> administration, and INO administration.</p><p>The research study was approved by the institutional review boards (IRBs) of all participating sites (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The first pilot RCT was halted after four months for failure to enroll any infants. The most common cause for inability to enroll infants was the rapidly changing condition of the infants, resulting in prior initiation of INO in transport or soon after admission. The next most frequent causes of inability to recruit infants were lack of an arterial line and hypothermia treatment for neonatal encephalopathy, both of which were exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Pilot two: a randomized clinical trial of inhaled PGE<sub>1</sub> in neonates with sub-optimal response to inhaled nitric oxide</title><p>After evaluating the causes for lack of enrollment in the first pilot, we determined that co-administration of IPGE<sub>1</sub> and INO could potentially have a substantial positive impact on study feasibility, while allowing us to test for synergy between INO and IPGE<sub>1</sub>. In addition, we elected to include infants receiving therapeutic hypothermia, as this was now standard therapy in participating centers.</p><p>In order to design and meaningfully interpret the data from the second pilot RCT in a manner that would be most helpful for designing the main trial, we created a definition of the primary outcome and conducted sample size calculations for the main trial. Using the composite outcome of need for ECMO or death as the most concrete clinically meaningful outcome for the future main trial, a sample size of 149 patients per group would be required to detect a 16% absolute risk reduction in the composite outcome of ECMO or death from 50% in the control arm to 34% in the study arm, with &#x003b1; of 0.05, a power of 80%, and a two-tailed test. To get an estimate of the number of infants in the NRN sites that might be eligible for the main trial, we queried all NRN sites. Between 2009 and 2010, 775 infants received INO for NHRF in 17 sites in the NRN; 30 to 35% met the composite outcome of death or ECMO and 10 to 13% died without receiving ECMO. Based on these numbers, it would be feasible to perform the main trial of IPGE<sub>1</sub> in NHRF over three years or less.</p><p>Study eligibility was modified in the second pilot to include infants who had a suboptimal response to INO defined as an OI of &#x02265;15 on any two arterial blood gases, obtained 15&#x000a0;minutes to 12&#x000a0;hours apart, and during the first 72&#x000a0;hours of INO use. The research study was approved by the IRBs of all participating sites and informed parental consent was obtained for all enrolled infants once eligibility was confirmed and before institution of study intervention.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Subjects</title><p>Late preterm (34 0/7 to 36 6/7&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation) and term infants at less than or equal to seven days postnatal age, undergoing conventional ventilation (CNV) or high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) for NHRF (including perinatal aspiration syndrome, suspected or proven pneumonia or sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome, idiopathic PPHN, or suspected pulmonary hypoplasia), and with a suboptimal response to INO were eligible. An indwelling arterial line was a requisite for study participation, as was informed parental consent. Exclusion criteria included the decision not to provide full treatment, a known structural congenital heart disease except patent ductus arteriosus and atrial or ventricular level shunts, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and thrombocytopenia (platelet count &#x0003c;80,000/&#x003bc;l) unresponsive to platelet transfusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study procedures</title><p>There were three arms to the study: low-dose IPGE<sub>1</sub> (150&#x000a0;ng/kg/min), high-dose IPGE<sub>1</sub> (300&#x000a0;ng/kg/min), and placebo (aerosolized saline). The two doses of IPGE<sub>1</sub> were selected on the basis of the results of the pre-clinical toxicity study and the phase I/II open label study of IPGE<sub>1</sub> in NHRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Eligible infants were centrally randomized by telephone using permuted block randomization. The IPGE<sub>1</sub> was double-masked. Only the participating center&#x02019;s pharmacist was aware of the infant&#x02019;s assigned group.</p><p>PGE<sub>1</sub> solution for aerosolization was prepared from synthetic PGE<sub>1</sub> (Prostin VR (Alprostadil) 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml in 1&#x000a0;ml dehydrated ethanol, Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) by dilution in sterile 0.9% saline (Sodium Chloride 0.9% Injection USP, Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA). Fresh solutions were prepared every 24&#x000a0;hours. Aerosol administration began with a PGE<sub>1</sub> dosage of either 300 or 150&#x000a0;ng/kg/min diluted in 4&#x000a0;ml preservative-free sterile normal saline/hr in study patients, and 4&#x000a0;ml sterile normal saline/hr in control patients. The study medication was delivered using a syringe pump into the nebulizer chamber of the MiniHeart low flow jet nebulizer (WestMed Inc., Tucson, Arizona, United States) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The nebulizer was placed approximately 50&#x000a0;cm from the endotracheal tube for CNV, and approximately 35&#x000a0;cm from the endotracheal tube in HFOV, based on bench studies to determine the emitted dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The nebulizer chamber was primed with 2&#x000a0;ml of study medication at study aerosol initiation. For weaning purposes, normal saline was administered using a second syringe pump with a Y-connection into the nebulizer chamber with increasing dose as the study drug aerosol dose was decreased, such that the total volume delivered was always 4&#x000a0;ml/hour. During aerosol administration, FiO<sub>2</sub> delivered in the gas flow through the nebulizer was matched to that delivered in the ventilator circuit.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Data on the first OI &#x02265;15 were available in six of the seven enrolled infants; four of the six infants had OI &#x02265;29 (highest OI: 99). OI on the first qualifying arterial blood gas ranged from 16 to 69, with five of the seven infants having OI &#x02265;25. OI on the second qualifying arterial blood gas ranged from 20 to 44, with six of the seven infants having OI &#x02265;25. All seven infants had at least one documented OI &#x0003e;25, with six infants having OI &#x0003e;35 prior to starting the study aerosol. The interval between the first and second qualifying arterial blood gas ranged from one to nine hours. The time from randomization to study aerosol initiation ranged from 3.0 to 20.0&#x000a0;hours, with the interval being less than six in all infants in the control group and more than six hours in all infants in the combined IPGE<sub>1</sub> groups (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c).

On the ABG obtained four hours after the start of the study aerosol, there was improvement in oxygenation in all three groups compared to the ABG obtained after 60&#x000a0;minutes (mean change in PaO<sub>2</sub> being 30, 85, and 43&#x000a0;mmHg in control, low-dose, and high-dose IPGE<sub>1</sub> groups, respectively). The duration of treatment with study aerosol ranged from 10 to 72&#x000a0;hours (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). All seven enrolled infants survived. Six infants received ECMO; five of these received ECMO within 24&#x000a0;hours of discontinuation of the study aerosol. During study aerosol administration, acute deterioration was noted in three infants, two in the low-dose and one in the high-dose IPGE<sub>1</sub> group, at 10, 36, and 34&#x000a0;hours of age, respectively. The first wean of the study aerosol had been attempted in two of these infants and was successful in one infant.</p><p>All enrolled infants were closely monitored for predefined adverse events. The lowest mean blood pressure recorded during study aerosol administration was 37, 43, and 45&#x000a0;mmHg in the control, low-dose, and high-dose IPGE<sub>1</sub> groups, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The highest heart rate recorded during study aerosol administration was 200, 131, and 142&#x000a0;bpm in the control, low-dose, and high-dose IPGE<sub>1</sub> groups, respectively. The highest temperature recorded during study aerosol administration was 38.2, 33.6, and 33.7&#x000b0;C in the control, low-dose, and high-dose IPGE<sub>1</sub> groups, respectively. Two adverse events were reported during the study and nether was attributed to the study aerosol. One infant in the control group developed transient, self-resolved mild fever within five minutes of starting the study aerosol, which was completely resolved within six hours after onset. One infant in the control group developed moderate hypotension 66&#x000a0;hours after initiation of the study aerosol. It was completely resolved within an hour of its onset. All enrolled infants were carefully clinically monitored for signs of PDA after study aerosol discontinuation. None of the infants had clinical signs of failure secondary to PDA prompting an echocardiogram. One infant (in the high-dose IPGE<sub>1</sub> group) developed seizures later in the hospital course, but the infant was not receiving study aerosol at that time. No protocol violations were reported during the study. There was one minor protocol deviation (ABG obtained &#x0003e;60&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;15&#x000a0;minutes after aerosol initiation) and one pharmacy protocol violation (infant incorrectly received 150&#x000a0;ng/kg/min instead of the assigned 300&#x000a0;ng/kg/min dose of PGE<sub>1</sub>; this was recognized on the 2nd day of study aerosol administration).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We assessed the feasibility of two pilot RCTs to evaluate the use of two doses of IPGE<sub>1</sub> in critically ill neonates with NHRF and were unable to recruit sufficient eligible subjects in the time period allowed. No infants were recruited in the first pilot. The second pilot was designed taking into account factors that hindered the feasibility of the first pilot. We demonstrated that continuous administration of aerosols was feasible in the second pilot. Of the 46 infants screened in this second pilot, only 14 met the eligibility criteria and seven were enrolled. Though the goal was to identify patients with OI &#x02265;15, in fact all infants had much higher OIs at enrollment. All infants survived, and six of the seven received ECMO; five of these received ECMO within 24&#x000a0;hours of discontinuation of the study aerosol. There were no serious adverse events. Acute deterioration was documented in three infants in the IPGE<sub>1</sub> groups 10 to 36&#x000a0;hours after start of study aerosol. There were systematic differences between the infants in the three groups; most notably, infants in both of the IPGE<sub>1</sub> groups had lower Apgar scores, more need for delivery room resuscitation, an earlier age at presentation, and significantly lower temperatures throughout the study aerosol administration. The small sample size and clinical differences between the three groups precludes any inference regarding the efficacy of IPGE<sub>1</sub> in PPHN.</p><p>The results of the two pilot RCTs reported in this study highlight the substantial investments of capital, human resources, technological expertise, and time in evaluating emerging new therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Planning for these studies required performance of preclinical studies mandated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA; addressing concerns about aerosol drug delivery with various modes of neonatal ventilation and/or INO; reaching consensus regarding patient management protocols, eligibility criteria, definition of meaningful outcome parameters, and use of nebulizer device in the study; development of study documents, training of site personnel, and obtaining IRB approvals.</p><p>The feasibility of conducting a large RCT was recognized to be an important limitation as several intervention clinical trials for NHRF were halted prematurely for lack of enrollment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; thus pilot studies were undertaken. Even though a survey of NRN sites between 2009 and 2010 suggested adequate numbers of patients eligible for this study, the pilot studies identified that the available patient population was very small. Foremost among factors contributing to lack of feasibility of this study was the decreased number of patients. This was attributed to improved perinatal care practices leading to decreased rates of both post-maturity and respiratory morbidity, as well as improved results in NHRF with the use of INO, surfactant, and HFOV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It is likely that with improved lung recruitment strategies, early use of surfactant and optimal delivery of INO, the current failure rate of INO may be considerably lower than that quoted in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Secondly, the consent process was challenging because of the short time window available, the high degree of stress parents&#x02019; experienced, frequent administration of medications that affect maternal cognition, and the lack of availability of parents when infants were transferred to tertiary care centers soon after birth for the management of PPHN.</p><p>The third factor that made these trials challenging was the novel nature of the study intervention. These pilot RCTs were the first trials of aerosolized selective pulmonary vasodilators in critically ill neonates with NHRF. The study protocol was complex and difficult to master for investigative teams. At the time of inception of this study, the MiniHeart low flow jet nebulizers were the only FDA approved nebulizers available for use in neonates; preliminary data were obtained using the MiniHeart nebulizer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and consequently the protocol allowed the use of MiniHeart nebulizers only in this study. Since then, ultrasonic and vibrating mesh nebulizers have been developed and are increasingly being used clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. As there are advantages and disadvantages associated with each aerosol device, studies are needed to evaluate these devices for the delivery of IPGE<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>Another factor that contributed to the lack of feasibility of these trials was the long time lapse between IRB approval and initiation of enrollment. As defined by feasibility criteria in the second pilot, 75% of centers were IRB approved; however, readiness for study enrollment did not coincide with IRB approval. This may be due to the need for hospital approvals of research studies, as well as the need for training of site nurses, respiratory therapists, and pharmacists in implementing this novel intervention.</p><p>These studies highlight the challenges of performing clinical trials in critically ill neonates with hypoxemic respiratory failure. To date, only three interventions for NHRF (ECMO, INO, and HFOV) have been shown in large RCTs to significantly improve outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Objective evidence for other interventions for the treatment of term NHRF is lacking. Although INO has revolutionized outcomes, 40% of babies still do not respond, and thus further therapeutic improvements are critical. Other drugs, including sildenafil, inhaled iloprost, endothelin antagonists, and antioxidants, are actively being explored for the treatment of NHRF, but no large RCTs in critically ill neonates have been reported. A failure to recruit patients in this trial has important implications for other clinical trials in this patient population. Inability to design definitive clinical trials to evaluate newer therapies in NHRF will propagate the practice of &#x02018;off-label&#x02019; use of drugs that have been approved for use in adults first [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. From developmental and metabolic standpoints, the disease processes in children and their responses to therapies are very different from those in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The search for robust evidence to guide the safe therapy of children and neonates with pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease is crucial.</p><p>Important lessons can be learned from clinical trials in adult and pediatric pulmonary hypertension where similar challenges with recruitment are encountered. The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in adults, children, and neonates is insufficient to support formal examination of all potential drug targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Recognizing the need for innovative approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], a workshop was established to consider alternative clinical trial designs in pulmonary hypertension, in order to raise the likelihood of new treatments reaching patients. Acknowledging that classical sample size calculations often lead to unrealistic expectations of the number of subjects to be recruited, Offringa and van der Lee described statistical and epidemiological aspects of small sample approaches and emphasized the importance of maximizing information obtained from the few subjects enrolled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Development of national and international databases with common entry criteria may be an alternative approach. Clinical studies in pulmonary hypertension might be enhanced by a consortium approach that utilizes the expertise of academic medicine, the treatment initiatives of the pharmaceutical industry, and study design from funding agencies interested in biological mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. To address this challenge, the Pulmonary Hypertension Academic Research Consortium was created as a forum to openly discuss strategies for clinical trials in pulmonary hypertension that would benefit all of the stakeholders. The goals of the consortium were to establish consensus clinical endpoint definitions for future clinical trials, advance the conduct of clinical research in the field, identify modern strategies for clinical trials, and provide guidance to the pharmaceutical industry to allow them to better identify and develop treatments with the most promise. Similar approaches need to be explored in NHRF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, there are important lessons to be learned from the two pilot RCTs described in this report that will be instrumental in designing future studies in this critically ill population. The second pilot demonstrates that it is possible to administer aerosols continuously in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for extended periods of time. When defining feasibility criteria, it needs to be recognized that readiness to commence study enrollment does not coincide with IRB approval. This lag needs to be adjusted for in future clinical trials. In this small sample size, there were no serious adverse events reported with the two doses of IPGE<sub>1</sub>; future studies should explore the efficacy of the higher dose and consider dose escalation to identify the optimal therapeutic dose. The second pilot also demonstrates that though the goal was to identify patients with OI &#x02265;15, in fact all the babies had much higher OIs at enrollment as has been shown in other RCTs in NHRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This suggests that future trials randomize infants at an even earlier stage, preferably at the time of initiation of INO. Another approach would be to randomize infants to placebo and treatments soon after PPHN is diagnosed, and then add specific therapy, such as INO. Future studies should allow the use of nebulizer devices approved by the FDA for use in neonates with provision for a subgroup analysis by the nebulizer device during the evaluation of data. Ventilator strategy, use of supportive therapies (such as surfactant and inotropes), and underlying cause of PPHN should be taken into account while designing future studies. Both of the pilot trials reinforce the challenges of performing RCTs in this critically ill population of patients and the need for pragmatic study designs reflective of the real-world situations with a realistic timeline.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec20"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13063_2014_2415_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Additional file 1:
