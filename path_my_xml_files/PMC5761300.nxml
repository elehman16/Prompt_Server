Proportions of SRI responders were 40.0% (10/25) and 54.5% (6/11). In the RCI/RCI group, total hSLEDAI and BILAG scores declined from 10.0 and 15.7 at week 0 to 3.5 and 4.6 at week 52, respectively. Reductions in the placebo/RCI group on switching were observed (mean hSLEDAI: 9.1&#x02013;3.3; BILAG: 13.5&#x02013;2.6). Other disease activity endpoints also improved in both groups.

Patients were also required to have a BILAG<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> score of A or B in the mucocutaneous and/or musculoskeletal domains. All patients were required to be seropositive for, or have a documented history of, antinuclear antibodies and any one of the following: anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith or anticardiolipin antibodies. Persistent disease activity had to be evident despite the use of stable, moderate-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 7.5&#x02013;30&#x02009;mg/day or equivalent) for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. All patients completing the double-blind period were eligible to enter the OLE phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>In the double-blind phase, patients were assigned randomly to receive RCI 40 U daily or 80 U every other day by subcutaneous injection or to one of two volume-matched placebo groups. During weeks 5&#x02013;8 of the double-blind phase, RCI doses were tapered by reducing the frequency of administration to twice weekly according to a protocol-defined schedule. The initial RCI dose in the OLE was based on the study drug regimen at the completion of the double-blind period at week 8. Patients receiving 0.2&#x02009;mL (RCI 16 U), 0.5&#x02009;mL (RCI 40 U) or 1.0&#x02009;mL (RCI 80 U) injections of RCI or placebo at week 8 received RCI 16 U, 40 U or 80 U twice weekly at the start of the OLE. Investigators were permitted to adjust the RCI regimen for safety or efficacy reasons from weeks 9&#x02013;20 to achieve a stable RCI regimen (defined as consistent volume and frequency over at least 8 weeks) no later than week 28. Once a stable RCI regimen was achieved, steroid taper was encouraged but left to the investigator&#x02019;s judgement. The goal was to taper completely off steroids, but if this was not possible, attempts were made to taper to a low (&#x0003c;7.5&#x02009;mg/day) daily dose.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Assessments</title><p>Efficacy variables included the hSLEDAI,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> BILAG-2004, Physician&#x02019;s Global Assessment (PGA),<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x000a0;Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA) Flare Index (SFI),<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> CLASI activity score<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and tender and swollen joint count. The hSLEDAI is identical to the SELENA-SLEDAI but uses the SLEDAI-2K definition for proteinuria and was used because it is able to capture ongoing proteinuria. Efficacy assessments were performed every 4 weeks except for hSLEDAI and SFI, which were assessed every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks, then every 4 weeks for the remainder of the study. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, measurements of vital signs and clinical laboratory investigations.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>A novel composite responder index, which was evaluated at 4-week intervals, defined a responder as a patient with a decrease in hSLEDAI score from 4 to 0 for arthritis and no worsening in other organ systems based on BILAG score, or a patient with a decrease in hSLEDAI score from 2 to 0 for rash and no worsening in other organ systems based on BILAG score. Worsening was defined as an increase in any BILAG score to a higher level (eg, a minor change in musculoskeletal or mucocutaneous systems could increase a D score to C, which was considered worsening). Because of the stringency of the definition of &#x02018;worsening&#x02019;, a revision to the novel composite endpoint was made. The revised novel composite responder index redefined a responder as a patient with a decrease in hSLEDAI score from 4 to 0 for arthritis or from 2 to 0 for rash and no new BILAG A score and no more than one new BILAG B organ domain score. Additional assessments included the proportions of patients meeting the SRI, hSLEDAI decrease&#x000a0;&#x02265;4&#x02009;and rate of severe SFI flares at weeks 8 and 52. Other disease activity outcomes included changes in hSLEDAI, total BILAG score, PGA, changes in tender and swollen joint count for patients with score&#x000a0;&#x0003e;0 at double-blind baseline and CLASI activity score for patients with score&#x000a0;&#x0003e;0 at double-blind baseline. The proportion of patients achieving a reduction in daily prednisone dose to&#x000a0;&#x0003c;7.5&#x02009;mg/day by week 52 was also determined. Safety endpoints included AEs, serious AEs (SAEs) and SAEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation over the 52-week period.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All results reported used the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, defined as all randomised patients who had received at least one dose of study medication and who had any post-baseline efficacy or safety data.

The degree of improvement was generally comparable with that observed with RCI treatment during the double-blind phase and was achieved by about 12&#x02013;16 weeks after RCI was initiated.</p><p>The effects of RCI during the 52-week treatment period were evaluated in post&#x000a0;hoc analyses using a number of validated outcome measures, including the hSLEDAI, BILAG-2004, CLASI, PGA, SRI, assessments of tender and swollen joints, as well as two novel composite responder indices. Although the primary endpoint of response using the novel index was not met for the double-blind phase,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> RCI demonstrated consistent improvement in results across multiple outcome measures, such as the SLEDAI and BILAG over 52 weeks. Consistency of results across multiple measures was seen in the tender and swollen joint count and CLASI scores among patients with counts and scores&#x000a0;&#x0003e;0 at baseline. Improvements in the novel organ-specific responder index were similar to those for the revised novel responder index at week 8, but the response rate using the novel organ-specific responder index was considerably lower at week 52 than the rate using the revised index. Inconsistency between the week 52 responder index rates as opposed to the rates at week 8 most likely relates to the longer exposure and thus greater opportunity for mild flares to be captured due to the more stringent BILAG threshold of worsening that was incorporated into the response definition of the novel responder index (no worsening in other organ systems on the basis of BILAG score) versus the revised novel responder index (no new BILAG A score and no more than one new BILAG B organ domain score). BILAG worsening of any degree is a particularly stringent endpoint as minor variations in BILAG disease activity or laboratory variables can too easily trigger worsening domain scores.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The revision defined BILAG worsening based on the original SRI. While stringent analyses are important to demonstrate substantial improvement, they can also be challenging to use to demonstrate treatment effects in small studies. Therefore, this revision to the novel responder index may prove useful in future pilot studies of treatment when looking for indication of a potential response. Taken together, the efficacy results provide preliminary, randomised, controlled evidence that RCI treatment results in reductions in disease activity and corticosteroid requirements in patients with SLE who have persistent disease despite moderate-dose corticosteroid therapy.</p><p>RCI was well tolerated in the pilot study. No new safety signals were observed during the 52-week treatment period. Important study limitations include the small sample and the lack of inferential statistical analyses, meaning that conclusions regarding clinical improvement with long-term RCI must be viewed with caution.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this pilot 52-week study support RCI as a treatment option for patients with SLE disease manifestations that are unresponsive to moderate-dose corticosteroid therapy. Preclinical evidence in healthy humans demonstrating direct, steroid-independent effects of RCI on the function of activated human B lymphocytes supports a potential unique mechanism of action for this agent in the treatment of autoimmune diseases characterised by aberrant humoural immune responses.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Additional studies to better understand how differential <italic>in vitro</italic> signaling in response to RCI might contribute to its clinical efficacy are ongoing. Further evaluation of RCI in a well-powered clinical trial in SLE is underway (NCT02953821).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Shanique Smythe and Maya Das (formerly of Mallinckrodt) for contributions to study monitoring and data collection.
