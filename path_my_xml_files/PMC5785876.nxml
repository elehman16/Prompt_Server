It has major impact on patients through disability and associated comorbidities. Current treatment strategies have considerably improved the prognosis, but recent innovations (especially biologic drugs and the new class of so-called &#x0201c;JAK/STAT inhibitors&#x0201d;) have important safety issues and are very costly. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are highly effective in RA, and could reduce the need for expensive treatment with biologic agents. However, despite more than 65&#x000a0;years of clinical experience, there is a lack of studies large enough to adequately document the benefit/harm balance. The result is inappropriate treatment strategies, i.e. both under-use and over-use of GCs, and consequently suboptimal treatment of RA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The GLORIA study is a pragmatic multicentre, 2-year, randomised, double-blind, clinical trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of a daily dose of 5&#x000a0;mg prednisolone or matching placebo added to standard of care in elderly patients with RA. Eligible participants are diagnosed with RA, have inadequate disease control (disease activity score, DAS28&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2.6), and are&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;65&#x000a0;years. The primary outcome measures are the time-averaged mean value of the DAS28 and the occurrence of serious adverse events&#x000a0;or adverse events of special interest. During the trial, change in antirheumatic therapy is permitted as clinically indicated, except for GCs. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility are secondary outcomes. The main challenge is the interpretation of the trial result with two primary endpoints and the pragmatic trial design that allows co-interventions. Another challenge is the definition of safety and the relative lack of power to detect differences between treatment groups. We have chosen to define safety as the number of patients experiencing at least one serious adverse event. We also specify a decision tree to guide our conclusion on the balance of benefit and harm, and our methodology to combat potential confounding caused by co-interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Pragmatic trials minimise impact on daily practice and maximise clinical relevance of the results, but analysis and interpretation of the results is challenging.

Both the disease and its treatment cause multiple comorbidities such as increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and osteoporotic fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Approximately 1% of the world population is affected by RA with a prevalence of 2% in people 60&#x000a0;years and older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Europe, the prevalence of RA is expected to increase along with the increase in the proportion of elderly in the population. Current treatment strategies have considerably improved the prognosis, but recent treatment innovations (especially biologic drugs and JAK/STAT inhibitors) have important safety issues and come at high societal cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; in addition, many patients still have smoldering progressive disease despite treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Apart from treatment, societal costs are a result of functional disability, decreased societal participation, and reduced work capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Balance of benefit and harm of glucocorticoid treatment</title><p id="Par25">Glucocorticoids (GC) exhibit unparalleled anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions. The introduction of GCs in the 1950s was a revolution in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including RA; it resulted in the only Nobel Prize awarded to a rheumatologist (Hench, together with Kendall and Reichstein in 1950). In those early years, enthusiasm generated by the initial results of unequalled efficacy in previously untreatable diseases led to the unrestricted use of high doses of GC. Unfortunately, such use disclosed a spectrum of adverse events that caused wide disillusionment and a still ongoing debate about the balance between the benefit and harm of GC treatment. Recent trials have suggested this balance can be favourable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, a meta-analysis has proven beyond doubt that GCs at low doses slow the progression of joint damage in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These findings have renewed and induced both European and US rheumatology associations to review their position, especially in early RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Low-dose GCs (defined as a daily dose of 7.5&#x000a0;mg prednisolone equivalent or less) could prove an important co-treatment of both early and established RA in combination with other antirheumatic drugs. Apart from their clinical effects, low-dose GCs have the potential to reduce the need for expensive biologic agents. Unfortunately, clinical studies large enough to adequately document the long-term balance of benefit and harm of low-dose GCs are lacking. A limited set of high quality data from trials does not support strong claims of harm (as opposed to a wealth of observational studies with high potential for bias), but the generalizability of trial data is questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The result is inappropriate treatment strategies associated with both under-use and over-use of GCs, and consequently suboptimal treatment of chronic inflammation in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Adherence</title><p id="Par26">Medication adherence (or compliance; generally defined as the extent to which patients take medications as prescribed) is often below 50% in patients with chronic diseases such as RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The measurement of medication adherence in clinical trials is challenging, and many different methods have been tried [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Computerised devices or electronic monitoring devices assess adherence more accurately than self-reporting and prescription refill records. Linking electronic monitoring devices to apps on smart devices may improve adherence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The trial</title><p id="Par27">This report describes the design of the Glucocorticoid Low-dose Outcome in Rheumatoid Arthritis (GLORIA) study, which compares the balance of benefit and harm of the addition of 5&#x000a0;mg/day prednisolone or placebo to standard of care for 2&#x000a0;years, in patients 65&#x000a0;years of age and older. A secondary objective is to study adherence and to test the effectiveness of smart device technology to improve adherence in a randomised sub-study. The report focuses on the occurrence and influence of co-treatment as a result of the pragmatic design and the interpretation of the outcomes of benefit and harm. The details of the sub-study about adherence are described in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The items addressed in this protocol are described in the standard protocol items: recommendation for interventional trials (SPIRIT) checklist in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cost-effectiveness</title><p id="Par28">Another aim of this trial is to study the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of adding low-dose glucocorticoid to the treatment of patients with RA. The costs of current RA treatment are very high with mean costs estimated at &#x020ac;3000/patient/year, and &#x020ac;15.0000/patient/year for patients on biologic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Significant savings can be realised by improving the RA treatment strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is very likely that the optimised use of GCs in RA would allow for important savings, specifically by delaying or avoiding the need for expensive biologic drugs and other agents such as JAK/STAT inhibitors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par29">The GLORIA study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled pragmatic multicentre clinical trial (phase IV). Eight hundred patients with RA are planned to be recruited from rheumatology clinics in seven European countries: Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia.</p><p id="Par30">Patients will be randomised to either prednisolone or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation is stratified for participating study site, for prior exposure to GC, and for concurrent start or change of any other second-line antirheumatic therapy. The randomisation is integrated in an interactive web response system (IWRS) as part of the electronic data management system. The minimisation randomisation method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] will be used. Minimisation is a method of randomisation that allocates subjects to the treatment group that best maintains balance in stratifying factors. It is effective even at small sample sizes and with multiple stratification variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par31">The eligibility criteria are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria for participating in the GLORIA trial</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Inclusion criteria</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;1.

Most relevant data to assess sample size adequacy for this study come from the CAMERA-2 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">Based on a one-sided <italic>Z</italic> test, at a base case expectation for a total of 20% of patients experiencing at least one event in 2&#x000a0;years in the placebo group and 400 patients in each treatment group, we have about 80% power to detect an increase of 7% (from 20 to 27% events; 90% power for an increase of 9%). These estimates change little when the base case expectation is varied by&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5%.</p><p id="Par63">At the chosen sample size, and observed placebo event rates between 15 and 25%, observed point estimates of difference of 4&#x02013;5%, respectively, will have a one-sided <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and thus be declared significant. In case the trial detects smaller, non-significant differences in AEs favouring placebo, the upper 95% confidence bound can be calculated to be about 3&#x02013;4% above the point estimate. For example, if the trial shows a non-significant difference of 3% more AEs in the GC group, this finding is compatible with a real increase not exceeding 6%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical analyses</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Hypotheses</title><p id="Par64">We will test hypotheses about the differences in benefit (DAS28 score and damage progression) and harm (encountering an adverse event, as defined in the protocol) of prednisolone treatment versus placebo.

Second, under the null hypothesis we expect to find no difference in selected AEs (as defined in the protocol) between the prednisolone and placebo group after 2&#x000a0;years (primary harm null hypothesis) and 3&#x000a0;months (secondary harm null hypothesis).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Harm and benefit analyses</title><p id="Par66">We will estimate the average effect of treatment on continuous outcomes (e.g. DAS28 and on damage progression) in separate mixed-effects regression models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

The mixed-effect model will be estimated by full information maximum likelihood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which assumes that missingness can be explained by the observed data. In addition, for dropouts we investigate the possibility that missingness occurs not at random: we will do a worst-case analysis where we assume that patients with missing DAS28 data after a certain date until the end of the 2-year trial period did not respond or lost response (non-responder imputation). This imputation method recodes the DAS28 value of all those missing assessments to the patient&#x02019;s baseline value.</p><p id="Par70">The way of handling missing data for the second benefit outcome of damage progression, operationalised as difference between Sharp van der Heijde radiograph scores at baseline and at 24&#x000a0;months, depends on which value is missing. We will exclude patients with missing data at both time points or at the 2&#x000a0;year measurement list-wise from this analysis. In patients missing only a baseline value, this value can be imputed by linear interpolation from values of an older X-ray, if present; otherwise such patients will also be excluded. In the second step, we will extend the first analysis for a multiple imputation analysis of missing outcomes using the algorithm &#x0201c;multiple imputation by chained equations&#x0201d; (MICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par71">For the harm outcome, operationalised as the occurrence of at least one serious AE or an AE deemed of special interest, for most dropouts from the study we will have information to indicate the presence or absence of an AE at the last follow-up visit. If this information is not present, we will first create a dataset under the assumption that no such AE occurred in these cases (best case analysis); and then we will create a dataset under the assumption that such an AE did occur in these cases (worst case analysis).</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Classification of co-interventions</title><p id="Par72">Given that GLORIA is a pragmatic trial where co-interventions are allowed, the observed effects are likely a compound of the &#x0201c;pure&#x0201d; treatment effects and the effects of (potentially differential) co-interventions in the treatment and placebo groups. In theory, two types of confounding can be distinguished - harm and benefit confounding. Harm confounding does not play a role.</p><p id="Par73">Benefit confounding can be defined as the expectation that patients on placebo more frequently require co-interventions because their RA is not under control, leading to subsequent improvement in disease activity. Benefit confounding will most likely work in one direction: it will decrease the difference in DAS28 or damage progression between the prednisolone group and the placebo group; so if the trial shows that the prednisolone group has significantly more DAS28 improvement and less damage progression (primary objective), benefit confounding no longer impacts the main conclusion of the trial. If the primary objective is not met we will proceed to assess the presence of benefit confounding. First, we will study co-medication changes and distinguish three types: (co-medication) intensification, switch and taper. This forms the basis of a decision tree (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Decision tree for the assessment of benefit confounding in an individual patient</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2396_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par74">The first type, permanent or temporary intensification of co-medication, comprises an increased dose of current antirheumatic drug(s), the addition of a new antirheumatic drug to the current treatment, or an i.m. or i.a. GC injection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Box 1). In the case of intensification, lack of efficacy can always be assumed.</p><p id="Par75">The second type, co-medication switch, can be for lack of efficacy or for an AE, as documented by a high DAS28 or an AE report (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Box 2). The medical monitor will adjudicate situations where neither of these can be documented.</p><p id="Par76">The third type, co-medication taper, comprises a decrease in dose or stop of current medication(s) without initiating other antirheumatic therapy. The main reason to taper is low disease activity, sometimes in the presence of an AE (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Box 3). The medical monitor will adjudicate situations where neither of these can be documented.</p><p id="Par77">For practical reasons the analyses regarding benefit confounding are limited to the first &#x0201c;medication change event&#x0201d; in the case of multiple events in the same patient. If significantly more treatment intensifications, more switches for lack of efficacy or fewer tapers for low disease activity occur in the placebo group than in the prednisolone group, we will assume benefit confounding. As we assume that benefit confounding works in one direction, we will use one-sided log likelihood ratio tests for differences in the occurrences of the three types of co-medication changes (intensification, taper and switch) between the prednisolone and placebo group.</p><p id="Par78">If there are no differences between the groups in co-medication changes we will proceed to the next step. This is to study the 3-month results in the subgroup of patients who started only study medication at baseline, i.e. who had no changes in co-medication at baseline or in the first 3&#x000a0;months. We will assume benefit confounding if two conditions are met: (1) prednisolone benefits these patients more than placebo, i.e. a significant difference in &#x02206;DAS28 over 3&#x000a0;months, and (2) this improvement in disease activity is maintained in the remaining trial period, i.e. mean DAS28 in the prednisolone group does not deteriorate more than 0.6 between 3 and 24&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par79">If these conditions are not met, we will proceed to the final step. We will compare the number of GC injections between the groups. If there are significantly more injections in the placebo group, we will assume benefit confounding. The presence of benefit confounding will be used in our interpretation of overall trial results.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Interpretation rules</title><p id="Par80">The interpretation of the trial result with two primary endpoints is a challenge. In this trial we want to summarize the results in one outcome measure because both primary endpoints are equally important for the final assessment of the trial result. Therefore, we defined a composite outcome measure, which assesses the outcomes of benefit (disease activity and damage progression) and harm simultaneously. We will compare the prednisolone group to the placebo group and we will interpret the results as presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Interpretation rules for the assessment of the benefit and harm outcomes: prednisolone versus placebo group. <bold>a</bold> Interpretation rules for benefit: prednisolone versus placebo group. <bold>b</bold> Interpretation rules for harm: prednisolone versus placebo group. <bold>c</bold> Combined assessment for benefit and harm: prednisolone versus placebo group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2396_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par81">For benefit, the trial is a success if the disease activity and damage progression are both lower in the prednisolone group (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). In addition, it is a success if either disease activity or damage progression is lower in the prednisolone group, in the presence of benefit confounding. Finally, it is a potential success if only benefit confounding is demonstrated. For harm the trial is a success if the occurrence of AEs is the same or lower in the prednisolone compared to the placebo group (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).</p><p id="Par82">The assessment of benefit and harm are then combined for a final assessment (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Success in (potential) benefit and harm obviously translate into overall success, whilst other combinations result in a tradeoff or failure. We assess the final outcome as a failure if both benefit and harm do not result in success. The tradeoff assessment is defined as a failure in (potential) benefit, whilst harm was assessed as a success. The other possibility for tradeoff is a success in (potential) benefit and a failure in harm.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Cost analyses</title><p id="Par83">The analyses of cost will be driven by the primary analysis result and interpretation. If the combined assessment of benefit and harm is a success (both benefit and harm favour GC), cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed with the mean DAS28 as the effectiveness measure. If the combined assessment is a failure, a simple cost comparison will be performed. Finally, if the combined assessment points to a tradeoff, a cost-utility analysis will be performed. The reason is that there is no simple metric for effectiveness other than the utility to describe the potential benefit of treatment in this situation.</p><p id="Par84">The cost analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle and from a societal perspective. Analysis will involve models of cost per unit of efficacy. Different outcome measures will be used as unit of efficacy. Confidence intervals (CI) for costs and differences in costs will be estimated using bias-corrected accelerated bootstrapping with 1000 iterations.</p><p id="Par85">The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be calculated by dividing the difference between the mean costs by the difference in mean effects of the two treatment groups. CIs for the ICER are also calculated using bootstrapping with 5000 iterations. The results will be graphically presented on the cost-effectiveness plane and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve will be constructed. Sensitivity analysis will be done to assess the effect of uncertainty in the main cost drivers and utility estimates on the ICER.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>(Serious) adverse events</title><p id="Par86">Subjects will be carefully monitored throughout the study for SAEs and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs).

Since the eligibility criteria of our trial are wide, we expect that many older patients with RA are eligible to participate in the study. Also, our design emulates the routine care setting. Assessments and procedures are tailored to represent standard of care, and concurrent antirheumatic treatment is allowed next to the study medication with minimal limitations.</p><p id="Par89">The design also creates challenges. We have chosen harm as the co-primary outcome and tried to address potential confounding due to co-interventions, resulting in an elaborate decision tree to best interpret the results. Finally, we have tailored the cost analyses to align with the possible result of the benefit-harm assessment.
