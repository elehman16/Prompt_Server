</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases. COPD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and results in an economic and social burden that is projected to increase in the coming decades due to continued exposure to COPD risk factors (such as tobacco smoking, air pollution) and the changing age structure of the world&#x02019;s population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The preferred therapeutic administration route for COPD patients is via inhalation because it maximizes the concentration of the drug in the target tissue (the lung), providing the greatest potential therapeutic effect while minimizing systemic concentration. As a consequence, the advantages include a more rapid onset of action, lower dosing, avoidance of the first-pass metabolism and fewer systemic side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Inhaled medications are administered through appropriate inhalation devices. The choice of device is of major importance because differences in engineering may result in differences in the efficiency of dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, properly designed inhalation devices improve patient adherence to the prescribed therapy, resulting in successful disease control with better clinical outcomes and reduced costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Current international guidelines recommend the use of inhaled long&#x02010;acting bronchodilators for first&#x02010;line management of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Tiotropium bromide is a quaternary ammonium class of anticholinergic bronchodilators that dilate bronchial smooth muscle through antagonism of muscarinic receptors located in airway smooth muscle. Tiotropium has a similar affinity to subtype M1, M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors, but dissociates much more slowly from M1 and M3 receptors than from M2 receptors, resulting in a long duration of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Compared with previous anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium, tiotropium has the advantage of its long duration of action that allows once-daily administration, and thus classifies as a long&#x02010;acting muscarinic antagonist. Tiotropium is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms of COPD and to reduce the frequency of exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In general, the inhaled route of administration results in the majority of the delivered tiotropium dose deposited in the gastrointestinal tract and, to a lesser extent, in the intended target organ, the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Previous pharmacokinetic investigations have revealed that, following dry powder inhalation of tiotropium by young healthy volunteers, there is an absolute bioavailability of 19.5&#x000a0;%, and the remaining approximately 80&#x000a0;% of inhaled tiotropium dose is swallowed. This suggests that the fraction reaching the lung is highly bioavailable as it is expected, from the chemical structure, that tiotropium bromide is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The terminal elimination half-life of tiotropium bromide is between 5 and 6&#x000a0;days following inhalation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Tiotropium is currently commercially available under two different formulations: an aqueous solution delivered by the Respimat<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> device (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH &#x00026; Co KG, Germany) and a dry powder for inhalation (DPI) formulation delivered via the HandiHaler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> device (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH &#x00026; Co KG, Germany) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In addition, Laboratorios Liconsa, S.A., Spain, has developed a novel formulation of tiotropium bromide DPI and a new monodose capsule-based device. The developed product was designed to deliver tiotropium 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g with a pre-metered dose of tiotropium 13&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g in a hard capsule, in contrast with the reference product DPI delivered via the HandiHaler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> device, which also delivers 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g but requires a pre-metered dose of 18&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g in the capsule. The test tiotropium 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g delivered-dose DPI was based on a spray-dried matrix formulation with enhanced aerosolization properties of the tiotropium active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), allowing less API metered dose per capsule while maintaining the same delivered dose and product performance.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Devices used in the study for the administration of medication. <italic>Top</italic> HandiHaler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; <italic>bottom</italic> Zonda<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>

</p><p>Development of the new tiotropium bromide formulation and device followed the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines on the requirements for therapeutic equivalence for orally inhaled products (OIPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This guideline has a stepwise approach, and bioequivalence for abridged applications can be accepted only with comparative in vitro data if some criteria are satisfied, including that the products must contain the same active substance (i.e. same salt, ester, hydrate or solvate, etc.). This first criterion was not satisfied because the experimental product is an anhydrous tiotropium whereas the reference is the monohydrated form. Since a biowaiver is not possible, the second step is to perform an in vivo bioequivalence study. The same guideline recommends that pharmacokinetic trials for the demonstration of bioequivalence are to be carried out in the intended patient population (COPD patients in the case of tiotropium bromide). Conversely, the EMA guidance on the investigation of bioequivalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] recommends that bioequivalence studies should normally be performed in healthy volunteers to reduce variability not related to differences between the assayed products (with the exception of drugs with safety concerns). Hence, studies with healthy subjects are considered as adequate in most instances to detect formulation differences and to allow extrapolation of the results to the intended populations for which the reference medicinal product is approved.</p><p>Finally, the questions and answers document recently released by the EMA that established the use of the area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) from time zero hours to 30 min (AUC<sub>0.5</sub>) as an acceptable surrogate for lung deposition for OIPs such as tiotropium with very quick absorption in the lung, was also taken into consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present publication was to show the results of the comparative bioavailability study carried out in healthy volunteers to demonstrate the bioequivalence between two tiotropium bromide DPI formulations, as recommended by the EMA guidelines for OIPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and bioequivalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical Considerations and Study Design</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Independent Ethics Committee of MHAT Tokuda Hospital Sofia AD, Sofia, Bulgaria.

A complete medical and surgical history, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, FEV<sub>1</sub> (by means of spirometery), and clinical laboratory examination (hematology, blood chemistry, serology, urinalysis) were performed at screening examination. Physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, vital signs and clinical laboratory (blood and urine) analysis were also repeated 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;days after the last dosing day.

This pharmacokinetic study demonstrates bioequivalence to the Spiriva HandiHaler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p><p>Overall development was carried out in accordance with EMA guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and a single dose and crossover design was then chosen. The crossover design has the advantage of requiring a smaller population. Although the possibility of a within-subjects crossover effect was remote after a single dose of tiotropium, the washout period was long enough as to control the potential impact of the effect. Noteworthy is the two-stage design that is seen less frequently in pharmacokinetic studies, although its use is accepted by the current EMA guideline on bioequivalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A two-stage design was chosen for accurate estimate of a final sample size for proving bioequivalence and to minimize the risk of any potential AEs.</p><p>In the EU, pharmacokinetics bioequivalence studies are considered an acceptable methodology to compare the lung deposition of two inhalation products containing the same active substance. Pharmacokinetic studies are usually considered more discriminative than studies based on pharmacodynamic or clinical endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The crossover design is the most powerful design for a bioequivalence study since it removes the intersubject variability from the comparison of average bioavailability between the formulations. The planned washout period was of at least 10 days&#x02019; duration between the subsequent study periods, considered appropriate in view of the long terminal elimination half-life of tiotropium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Finally, and due to practical reasons, the washout time between periods was 14 days.</p><p>The use of healthy volunteers instead of patients is supported by the EMA guidance on bioequivalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, healthy volunteers are considered more discriminative than patients because the presence of bronchoconstriction may result in greater central lung deposition, and hence two inhaled products may appear to be more similar than they actually are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, in the case of tiotropium, a lung deposition study using radiolabeled tiotropium and assessed by &#x003b3; scintigraphy showed that tiotropium inhaled from the HandiHaler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> DPI has similar delivered doses and lung deposition in healthy subjects than in patients with different stages of COPD disease (mild, moderate and severe) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To our knowledge, at present no pharmacokinetic single-dose study has been published including COPD patients to allow the comparison of the bioavailability between populations.</p><p>In this study, the widening of the conventional 90.20&#x000a0;% CI acceptance range for <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> was not necessary (the <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> values [87.26&#x02013;106.60&#x000a0;%] were within the preset acceptance range within the 80&#x02013;125&#x000a0;%). Outcomes from this study have demonstrated that tiotropium is not a drug with high variability (&#x0003c;30&#x000a0;%).</p><p>Generally, the OIP guidelines advocate that pharmacokinetic studies should be conducted in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the available evidence suggests that pulmonary drug deposition is more central in asthmatic patients versus healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], bioavailability is generally greater in healthy volunteers versus asthmatic patients (presumably as the drug is less susceptible to removal by mucociliary clearance prior to absorption in the former) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and the extent of drug deposition in asthmatic patients is related to the magnitude of airways obstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, variability of bronchoconstriction or other underlying pathological changes in asthmatic (and COPD) subjects between study periods may confound the bioequivalence assessments.</p><p>A post hoc statistical analysis of the study was performed with the aim of evaluating the bioequivalence of the truncated AUC<sub>0.5</sub> as a primary parameter. This is justified for OIPs such as tiotropium with a very quick absorption in the lung (&#x0003c;5&#x000a0;min) where absorption occurs before the contribution of gastrointestinal absorption is significant. Hence, AUC<sub>0.5</sub> is an acceptable surrogate for lung deposition and, subsequently, efficacy, whereas AUC<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is a surrogate for safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the present study, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>max</sub> for the test formulation and the reference was approximately 3&#x000a0;min, and the subsequent analysis of bioequivalence on AUC<sub>0.5</sub> resulted in bioequivalence. Thus, since the results of the study fulfilled the conditions of the EMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], a study with charcoal was not necessary and only the hereby presented pharmacokinetic study without active charcoal blockade is sufficient to demonstrate comparable pulmonary deposition and equivalent systemic exposure between the two inhalation products.</p><p>A limitation for any pharmacokinetic study of tiotropium is the low plasma concentrations reached after inhaled administration. In consequence, a rapid, selective and highly sensitive bioanalytical method that allows the measurement of tiotropium with an LLOQ of sub-pg/mL was developed and validated for this study. This LLOQ is significantly lower than that used in other similar recent publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and to our knowledge is the lowest LLOQ published for tiotropium. The dual-stage LLE and a 2D UHPLC greatly reduced matrix effects and increased assay sensitivity. Moreover, a supratherapeutic dose of two capsules was administered to better perform the pharmacokinetic profile. The use of this sensitive method was crucial for the determination of bioequivalence because it allows the appropriate characterization of pharmacokinetic parameters.</p><p>Also essential for the determination of bioequivalence was the adequate description of absorption curve and <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>. It is well known that tiotropium is very rapidly absorbed after inhalation, but the early and frequent sampling times around the expected <italic>t</italic>
<sub>max</sub> (six samples up to 15&#x000a0;min post-dose) allowed a good estimate of <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>. Furthermore, tiotropium also has a long half-life (32&#x02013;36&#x000a0;h in this study), therefore we were obliged to extend the sample collection up to 48&#x000a0;h. Noteworthy is the fact that as a result of the rapid absorption, all subjects had a quantifiable concentration at the last extraction sample.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has demonstrated the bioequivalence of a tiotropium 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g delivered-dose DPI to be used with the Zonda<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> inhaler to Spiriva Handihaler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.
