The initial effect on macular edema shedding after a single ranibizumab injection could be amplified with the following two injections of the loading dose. After a single injection of triamcinolone the beneficial initial effect on the macula edema faded within 3&#x000a0;months. Subretinal fluid and INL cystoid spaces diminished early in the course of treatment while fluid accumulation in the ONL seemed to be more persistent in both treatment arms. In FA, the area of leakage diminished significantly in both treatment arms. After repeated injections the morphologic OCT and FA characteristics of the treatment arms converged.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Despite the higher dosage of triamcinolone, both therapies were safe and effective for treating diabetic macular edema.

Considering the increasing number of patients with diabetes, ocular complications are set to become a serious health issue in the near future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Consequently, current treatment strategies for DME should be assessed in every possible detail.</p><p id="Par7">DME has for a long time been graded exclusively in funduscopy as focal or clinically significant depending on its distance from the fovea. The advent of fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) allowed DME to be characterized in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A great variety of morphology patterns of DME became apparent, even though all patients had the same underlying disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Hence, a combination of OCT with FA is considered more advantageous for the classification of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To date, little is known about the different pathophysiologic pathways that are directly associated with the distinct appearance in OCT or FA and their impact on disease progression and treatment response. Nevertheless, central retinal thickness (CRT) has been internationally established as the main morphologic marker in DME diagnosis and treatment follow-up regardless of the concurrent intraretinal changes.</p><p id="Par8">Within the past decade, various multi-center studies have proven the effectiveness of intravitreally applied anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents or corticosteroids in the treatment of DME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition to a gain in visual acuity, CRT has been found to decrease to normal in most patients after repeated treatment. However, changes in morphologic characteristics have rarely been described as precise grading has not yet been automated and is therefore very time consuming.</p><p id="Par9">This study investigated the detailed morphologic changes seen on multiple high-resolution cross-sectional OCT images of the macula, color fundus photography and standardized findings in early and late phase FA images of the macula in the course of pro re nata (PRN) treatment of DME with either ranibizumab, that had been approved by the FDA and the European Union for the treatment of vision impairment secondary to DME, or triamcinolone, that was used off-label.The dosage of triamcinolone was doubled to 8&#x000a0;mg/0.1ml in order to obtain a prolonged effect on DME resolution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par10">Here, we report the results of the comparison of 0.5&#x000a0;mg ranibizumab and 8&#x000a0;mg triamcinolone PRN treatment for macula centers involving DME.

All procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee.</p><p id="Par12">Patients were recruited at the tertiary referral clinic for diabetic retinopathy at the Department of Ophthalmology, MUW. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to study inclusion. Only one eye of each patient could be included in the study. Eligibility criteria were patients aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years with type 1 or 2 diabetes, a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between 20/25 and 20/400 (Snellen equivalent) and a macula center involving DME with a CRT of more than 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m measured with spectral domain (SD) OCT (Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Dossenheim, Germany). Blood samples were drawn at baseline to evaluate glycemic control and preexisting comorbidities such as hypercholesterolemia or renal failure. Exclusion criteria were any vision-impairing ocular conditions other than diabetic retinopathy, a recent history of intraocular surgery or laser therapy within 3&#x000a0;months prior to study inclusion. If both eyes were eligible, the eye with the worse BCVA was included in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intravitreal intervention</title><p id="Par13">Eligible patients were divided at random into two groups to either receive three monthly injections of 0.5&#x000a0;mg ranibizumab (Lucentis<bold>&#x000ae;</bold>, Novartis Pharma AG, Vienna, Austria) or one intravitreal injection of 8&#x000a0;mg triamcinolone acetonide (Volon A<bold>&#x000ae;</bold>, Dermapharm GmbH, Vienna, Austria) dissolved in a volume of 0.1&#x000a0;ml. The treating physician prepared triamcinolone acetonide for intravitreal injection by replacing the solvent agent benzyl alcohol with physiologic saline solution immediately before intravitreal application. The baseline injection of triamcinolone was followed by two sham procedures at months 1 and 2 to maintain patients&#x02019; masking. Sham procedures were only mimicked by conjunctival contact without penetration of the ocular globe after the same preinjection care. The treating physician was unmasked.</p><p id="Par14">Beginning at month 3, all patients were reassessed monthly by a masked physician to see if they needed PRN treatment of their assigned study medication based on the following predefined retreatment criteria: evidence of intraretinal or subretinal fluid on OCT with a 100-&#x003bc;m increase in CRT or a decrease in BCVA &#x0003e;5 letters compared with any previous study visit. Ranibizumab injections could be applied monthly whereas triamcinolone could be injected no more than every 3&#x000a0;months intermitted by sham injections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par15">Experts in BCVA testing and OCT imaging masked to the patients&#x02019; treatment assignment tested visual function and assessed retinal layer thickness at each monthly visit (30&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;7&#x000a0;days). BCVA was measured on a logarithmic scale of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) using ETDRS charts at a distance of 2&#x000a0;m. Eyes were examined with a slit-lamp, indirect ophthalmoscope and intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured (Goldmann Applanation Tonometry, Haag Streit GmbH, Wedel, Germany). SD OCT images of the macula (20&#x000b0;&#x000d7;20&#x000b0; horizontal macula pattern centered at the fovea, high resolution, 49 sections, ART 9) were acquired. Furthermore, 30&#x000b0; and 60&#x000b0; color fundus photos were taken monthly centered on the fovea and on the optic disc (FF 450 plus camera, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data assessment</title><p id="Par16">OCT, fundus photo and FA image graders were masked to patients&#x02019; treatment assignment. CRT values were verified by reviewing the OCT scans for segmentation errors at the inner limiting membrane (ILM) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and correcting them manually, if necessary using the HRA/Spectralis viewing module version 6.0.9. The ETDRS grid was centered manually for accurate CRT measurements when it was not centered on the fovea.</p><p id="Par17">The morphology seen on OCT images and fundus photos acquired at baseline and 1,3,6 and 12&#x000a0;months after the first intravitreal injection were thoroughly graded. All 49 scans of the macular cube were graded for the presence of subretinal fluid (SRF), cystoid changes in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and cystoid- or sponge-like swelling in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), features that can be reliably detected in OCT scans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. FA images at baseline and at month 12 were graded for signs of macula ischemia by manually outlining the area of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in early phase images using Spectralis software. Additionally, the area of fluorescein leakage was outlined manually and measured in late phase images accordingly. The source of leakage was assessed in early phase images in conjunction with late phase images using a modified grading based on the ETDRS report number 11: leakage predominantly (&#x0003e;50%) from microaneurysms or leakage hardly (&#x0003c;50%) from microaneurysms but from staining vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The pattern of hyperfluorescence secondary to dye pooling in cystoid spaces was classified as petaloid, honeycomb or diffuse in late phase images. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] As DME can present different patterns in the same patient, all three patterns could be graded in parallel in the same FA image. Fundus photos were evaluated for diabetic retinopathy grading and the assessment of hard exudates (HE) and cotton wool spots (CWS).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Fluorescein angiography leakage pattern: Images of the right eye of two patients diagnosed with diabetic macular edema. <bold>a:</bold> Early phase image showing several microaneurysms (MA) that are the source of leakage seen in the late phase image (<bold>b</bold>).

The protocol specified that patients withdrawing their agreement to the study could be replaced up to one year before the projected study termination. The initial power analysis had to be repeated to account for the difference in sample size due to an imbalance in allocation that only became apparent after unblinding. The effect size that can be detected at the two-sided significance level of 5% with a power of 80% was a Cohen&#x02019;s d of 1.05 for a 1:1 allocation ratio and 30 patients. This effect size increased to 1.23 with the 15:10 sample sizes. This effect size is still sufficient to detect a clinically relevant effect in changes of visual acuity during the year of observation.</p><p id="Par19">The baseline characteristics of patients were compared across treatment groups by Fisher&#x02019;s exact probability test for dichotomous, by the Fisher-Freeman-Halton test for categorical, and Mann-Whitney test for metric variables. Differences to baseline values of logMAR and retinal thickness were analyzed by general estimation equation (GEE) linear models with an ^^unstructured correlation matrix. Comparisons for each time point between treatment arms were done by linear contrasts applying Bonferroni-Holm correction. Within treatment groups, comparisons against baseline were done by testing the variable for the respective time point against zero. The correlation between BCVA and CRT was investigated by computing Spearman correlation coefficients. The relation between change in BCVA and change in retinal layers thickness was analyzed by linear regression.

At month 3, BCVA was similar in the treatment arms (ranibizumab logMAR: 0.18&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.25; triamcinolone logMAR: 0.21&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.25; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.093), while CRT was significantly thicker in the triamcinolone group (ranibizumab: 324&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;58&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m; triamcinolone: 431&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;103&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.019).

While in the ranibizumab group BCVA was significantly better than at baseline at all time-points after the second injection, patients treated with triamcinolone had significantly better visual function at months 4, 6 and 7 only compared with baseline.

Consistent with the data from Protocol I of the DRCR, the net initial gain in visual acuity in patients treated with triamcinolone was lost within the second half of the year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Even though we used a double dose of triamcinolone (8&#x000a0;mg instead of 4&#x000a0;mg in Protocol I) and the minimum treatment interval was shorter (12 instead of 16&#x000a0;weeks), the initial effect on DME resolution in the triamcinolone arm did not prevail as long as expected. After 3&#x000a0;months, patients treated with ranibizumab had a significantly thinner CRT than those treated with triamcinolone (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.019). Similar peaks of edema recurrence were seen in Protocol I at 16, 32 and 48&#x000a0;weeks after initial triamcinolone injection accordingly. The fading potency of a single intravitreal triamcinolone injection was also reflected in the recurrence of SRF and cystoid spaces after 3&#x000a0;months. Hence, reinjection of triamcinolone should be considered earlier in some patients, depending on morphologic dynamics, to avoid under-treatment.</p><p id="Par32">Overall, CRT was similar in the treatment arms at baseline and at month 12 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.271 and <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.426, respectively), but BCVA was significantly better in the ranibizumab group after 12&#x000a0;months (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.015). A decrease in BCVA after 6&#x000a0;months of triamcinolone treatment is consistent with data published in a previous paper, where the loss in BCVA was attributed to cataract formation because pseudophakic patients treated with triamcinolone and those treated with ranibizumab had similar visual acuity results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As cataracts were not to be operated during the study period, loss of BCVA in the triamcinolone-treated eyes might have been related to cataract formation. In our cohort there were only two pseudophakic patients in the triamcinolone treatment arm, so we could not do a subgroup evaluation. As has been reported in previous studies, intravitreally applied triamcinolone is associated with an increased risk of IOP elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although seven out of 15 patients (47%) in the triamcinolone group had at least one IOP measurement &#x0003e;25&#x000a0;mmHg compared with only one (10%) in the ranibizumab group, all patients responded well to IOP-lowering medication.</p><p id="Par33">We focused on morphological details graded in OCT and FA images because the overall treatment response assessed as changes in BCVA and CRT after anti-VEGF or triamcinolone application in diabetic macular edema has already been studied extensively. OCT characteristics have been shown to be predictive for the treatment response in patients with age-related macular degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In general, morphologic features in DME have been described in detail and some characteristics graded at baseline found to be associated with a better treatment response to DME therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Nevertheless, a continuous evaluation of anatomic characteristics in OCT and FA images over the course of 1&#x000a0;year of treatment with ranibizumab or triamcinolone has not yet been published. Patients with intraretinal cysts and preservation of the foveal contours have been found to benefit most from intravitreal bevacizumab therapy in terms of BCVA gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In our cohort, INL cysts disappeared in six out of eight patients (75%) after 3 monthly injections of ranibizumab, while ONL swelling seemed to be more persistent. However, patients treated with ranibizumab gained statistical significance in BCVA within the first 3&#x000a0;months of treatment. These results partially contrast with those of another study where the gain in visual acuity was mainly attributed to the regression of ONL cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, the morphologic evaluation in that study was limited to three trans-foveal OCT scans, whereas we evaluated the presence of ONL swelling within all 49 OCT scans of the macular cube.</p><p id="Par34">In addition to INL and ONL cysts, serous retinal detachment was graded in 30% of patients. Both treatment strategies were effective in serous retinal detachment reduction after repeated intravitreal application. Fluctuations over time paralleled the trend of cystoid intraretinal fluid accumulation. Three out of ten patients in the ranibizumab group and one out of 15 in the triamcinolone group did not need any further treatment after the first 3&#x000a0;months over the 12&#x000a0;months study duration. Morphologic characteristics at baseline were similar to those of the patients who needed repeated treatment within the study period. Hence, we could not identify any morphologic characteristics that predicted the overall treatment response in our study patients.</p><p id="Par35">Interestingly, the area of leakage measured in FA images was statistically significantly different at baseline, although the source of leakage, size of FAZ and OCT characteristics were similar between the two groups. However, the area of leakage statistically significantly regressed in both treatment arms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). There is evidence that fluorescein leakage without intraretinal fluid accumulation in OCT is related to the breakdown of the RPE barrier and that neutralizing VEGF with an antibody leads to a partial recovery of barrier properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The importance of the RPE pump function in the pathogenesis and treatment response in patients with DME is still unknown. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the difference in leakage area at baseline was a confounding factor in our study.</p><p id="Par36">The major drawback of our study was the single center design entailing a relatively small number of study patients. Nevertheless, the prospective, randomized, double-masked study design, the multimodal retinal imaging techniques including regularly obtained FA and SD OCT images and the thorough masked image analyses of the whole macula add to the value of data presented.</p><p id="Par37">To conclude, this descriptive analysis of morphologic characteristics in DME emphasizes the high diversity of diabetic macular edema that cannot be reflected in central retinal thickness alone. Furthermore, it gives a detailed insight into the treatment response to two different agents over 1&#x000a0;year. Yet predicting morphological characteristics has not been accomplished. In the future, detailed retinal image analyses might add to individualized treatment strategies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Open access funding provided by Medical University of Vienna.
