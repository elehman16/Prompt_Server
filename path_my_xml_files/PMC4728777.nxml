The aim of this cluster randomised trial was to investigate the effects of implementing a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for peripheral venous catheters (PVCs) in paediatric care in the format of reminders integrated in the EPRs, on PVC-related complications, and on registered nurses&#x02019; (RNs&#x02019;) self-reported adherence to the guideline. An additional aim was to study the relationship between contextual factors and the outcomes of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study involved 12 inpatient units at a paediatric university hospital. The reminders included choice of PVC, hygiene, maintenance, and daily inspection of PVC site. Primary outcome was documented signs and symptoms of PVC-related complications at removal, retrieved from the EPR. Secondary outcome was RNs&#x02019; adherence to a PVC guideline, collected through a questionnaire that also included RNs&#x02019; perceived work context, as measured by the Alberta Context Tool. Units were allocated into two strata, based on occurrence of PVCs. A blinded simple draw of lots from each stratum randomised six units to the control and intervention groups, respectively. Units were not blinded. The intervention group included 626 PVCs at baseline and 618 post-intervention and the control group 724 PVCs at baseline and 674 post-intervention. RNs included at baseline were 212 (65.4&#x000a0;%) and 208 (71.5&#x000a0;%) post-intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">No significant effect was found for the computer reminders on PVC-related complications nor on RNs&#x02019; adherence to the guideline recommendations.

The insertion and management of PVCs are very common procedures that registered nurses (RNs) in Sweden perform on a daily basis. Maintaining optimal function of PVCs in paediatric patients is essential, as re-insertion is often highly stressful for the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As PVCs in paediatric care should be replaced when clinically indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the importance of RNs&#x02019; adherence to guidelines such as the recommended daily inspections of PVC sites is important.</p><p id="Par7">One of the most consistent findings from clinical and health services research is the failure to implement research into practice and policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are commonly used as a strategy to overcome this gap, but the assumption that a CPG will implement itself is long gone, as there are several factors to consider for its implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Successful implementation can, according to the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework, be understood as a function of the relationship between evidence, context, and facilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The framework suggests that successful implementation is more likely to occur when evidence and context are considered high. Context comprises three dimensions: culture, leadership, and evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The rationale for choosing the PARIHS framework is that it describes influential factors involved in implementing evidence-based practice in nursing care. Furthermore, the framework has been used in several studies, and the dimensions have been validated in a number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, PARIHS has also been criticised, for example, it is not clear what role individuals play as part of the interaction between evidence and context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and that the influence of staff turnover is not considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">There are several strategies used for disseminating and implementing CPGs such as distribution of educational material, audit and feedback, and tailored interventions. A review on the effectiveness and efficiency of guideline dissemination and implementation strategies for physicians published in 2004 showed that a majority of the strategies resulted in modest to moderate improvements in patient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] but that the most promising strategy was in the form of reminders. Computerised decision support systems (CDSSs) are electronic systems designed to aid directly in clinical decision-making by generating recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. According to Choi and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], CDSS can be categorised into three groups: (1) reminders, notifications, alerts, or warnings designed to regularly remind healthcare workers of, e.g. assessments, monitoring, and scheduled care; (2) point of care guidelines, which provide necessary information and guidelines for certain activities or offers automatic care plans or checklists based on individual patient data; and (3) references for information/guidelines, which enable health care professionals to search for necessary information. Computer reminders are defined as &#x0201c;patient or encounter specific information, provided via a computer console either visually or audibly, which is designed or intended to prompt a health care professional to recall information usually encountered through their general medical education, in the medical records or through interaction with peers, and so remind them to perform or avoid some action to aid individual patient care&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, p. 4]. There are no systematic reviews on the effect of computer reminders on nursing performance or patient outcomes; there are however systematic reviews on CDSS which have shown that CDSS effectiveness in nursing practice is still inconsistent and that further studies are needed in order to identify in which contexts they are most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Studies in recent years of CDSS have shown improvement in nursing recording [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], but single studies of computer reminders have shown effect on nurses&#x02019; adherence to CPGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and decreased omissions in nursing care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">To summarise, computer reminders have shown some effect on physicians&#x02019; behaviour and outcomes of care, but knowledge is lacking on the effect on RNs&#x02019; behaviour and patient outcomes and how contextual factors might influence the implementation. The main aim of this cluster randomised study was to investigate the effects of implementing a CPG for PVCs in paediatric care in the format of reminders, integrated in the electronic patient record (EPR), on PVC-related complications, and on RNs&#x02019; self-reported adherence to the guidelines. An additional aim was to study the relationship between contextual factors and the outcomes of the intervention. As the computer reminders could only be implemented at unit level, a cluster randomised design was chosen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par10">The study was conducted at a paediatric hospital, a division within a large urban university hospital in Sweden. The paediatric hospital is located at three sites and admits patients from 0 to 18&#x000a0;years of age. At the time of the study, the hospital had a capacity of 245 beds and consisted of 19 inpatient units and approximately 940 RNs were employed.</p><p id="Par11">Insertion and management of PVCs was an area identified for quality improvement at the hospital, and a CPG was developed in 2010. The CPG was developed by RNs with expert knowledge of PVCs in paediatric care and was based on critical appraisal of published research as well as RNs&#x02019; professional experiences. The CPG contained recommendations on PVC management, for example, it suggested indications for insertion, sizes, and insertion sites, as well as instructions for insertion, management, and removal; additionally, it contained information concerning PVC-related complications. The CPG was introduced both by the hospital through information at the nurse managers&#x02019; monthly meeting and by publication on the intranet, which was accessible via the computers in nursing stations.</p><p id="Par12">The first transition from paper-based patient records to an EPR system took place in 1997, and the current system was introduced in 2005. At the time of the study, all patient data were recorded in the EPR and there were computers at all nursing stations. A template for recording PVCs in a structured and standardised way was introduced at the hospital in 2009 as an option for documenting in the record notes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The fields concerning PVC insertion in the template was mandatory, meaning that the template could not be closed until these fields were completed. Several fields contained drop-down options where only one option could be selected (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Mouse pads containing information on how to document PVCs in the template were handed out on intervention and control units at the start of the intervention.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The content of the reminders integrated into the PVC template in the EPR</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Structure and content of the PVC template in the EPR (all units)</th><th>Reminders based on recommendations from the CPG (intervention units)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Insertion date<sup>a</sup>

Thus, RNs at the intervention units could not be blinded. The reminders were developed in collaboration between the researchers and RNs who were experts in EPRs. They were designed as speech bubbles that appeared on the screen for 20&#x000a0;s when the cursor was moved over the template. The reminders had a font and a background colour that deviated from the rest of the template. They consisted of five recommendations originating from the CPG for PVC management: disinfection of hands, use of disposable gloves, fixation of and choice of PVC size, inspection of insertion site, and documentation of removal cause (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These recommendations were selected, as adherence to them was presumed to have the greatest impact on patients with PVCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par14">The primary outcome was recorded occurrence of PVC-related complications at removal assessed by the bedside RN. Data was collected from the PVC template at baseline and post-intervention. The secondary outcome was RNs&#x02019; self-reported adherence to the CPG recommendations: disinfection of hands, usage of disposable gloves, and daily inspection of PVC site measured through a questionnaire, handed out at baseline and post-intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sample size calculation and randomisation</title><p id="Par15">In a record review performed at 14 inpatient units at the paediatric hospital in 2009, we found 87 PVCs in 147 patients, which yielded an expected number of six PVCs on each unit over 5&#x000a0;days. The proportion of recorded PVC-related complications in the EPR discovered during the record review was 34&#x000a0;%. The record review indicated that it was appropriate to split participating units into two strata based on the expected prevalence of PVCs. Eight units (surgery, cardiology, orthopaedic, neurology, two infection units, advanced homecare, and neonatal intensive care unit) were in the strata of high occurrence of PVCs, while four units (oncology, haematology, and two neonatal units) were in the strata of lower occurrence. An expected decrease of complications for the intervention units was set at 6&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% based on findings from a systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">A sample size calculation was performed to estimate the number of recorded PVCs required for this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The sample size of 1213 PVCs, about 100 PVCs per unit, was calculated to be necessary to have 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a difference in complications of odds ratio (OR)&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.5 between control and intervention groups at a significance level of 5&#x000a0;% and an intra-cluster coefficient of 0.001 on the unit level. An earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] on the accuracy and completeness of PVC recordings showed that a majority of observed complications were not recorded in the EPR. On this basis, a total of 1213 PVCs from the EPR were included in each group at both baseline and post-intervention in order to secure power. The randomisation was carried out by a third person through a simple draw of lots from each of the strata, allocating six units to the control and intervention groups, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Units, PVCs, and patients</title><p id="Par17">A requirement for inclusion of inpatient units was that they had access to the PVC template in the EPR system to document PVCs during the study period, which excluded seven of the hospital&#x02019;s 19 inpatient units. One unit in the intervention group changed to another EPR system 60&#x000a0;days after the introduction of the reminder. This unit was therefore only included for 60&#x000a0;days post-intervention and, consequently, also 60&#x000a0;days at baseline. The PVCs should have been inserted and documented in the PVC template at any of the 12 units at baseline (before 11 January 2011, the introduction date of the reminders) and post-intervention (after 1 April 2011). Each PVC was counted as one case and data were retrieved from the EPR system retrospectively at baseline and prospectively post-intervention. PVCs with no complete recording of reason for removal were excluded. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> describes the inclusion and exclusion of PVCs and patients. The final sample for PVCs in the intervention group was 626 at baseline and 618 post-intervention; in the control group, 724 PVCs were included at baseline and 674 post-intervention. As some patients had more than one PVCs, the final sample of patients at baseline was 475 in the intervention group and 466 in the control group; at post-intervention, there were 564 in the intervention group and 500 in the control group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart for inclusion RNs, PVCs, and patients at baseline and post-intervention</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2016_375_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Adherence to the CPG recommendations was measured through nine items regarding RNs&#x02019; management of PVCs. These items were based on the hospital&#x02019;s CPG for PVCs; three of the items were selected for the analyses as adherence to them was presumed to have the greatest impact on patients with PVCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]: How often do you disinfect your hands with alcohol-based products before managing PVCs? How often do you use disposable gloves when managing PVCs? How often do you perform daily inspection of the PVCs&#x02019; insertion sites? The items had a five-point Likert response scale: never, rarely, occasionally, frequently, and always. One item addressed whether the RNs knew about the hospital&#x02019;s CPGs for venous catheters, with the response alternatives yes or no. The demographic data for RNs can be seen in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. RNs work context was measured using the Alberta Context Tool (ACT), conceptually framed by the PARIHS framework and designed to assess context within complex healthcare settings with the assumption that context has a central influence on healthcare professionals&#x02019; use of knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The ACT adds five additional dimensions to the PARIHS elements of context (leadership, culture, and evaluation), namely, information-sharing interactions, information-sharing activities, information-sharing social processes, structural and electronic resources, and organisational slack (representing human resources, space, and time). In the present study, we used the data that referred to the three dimensions of context based on the PARIHS framework: <italic>Leadership</italic> reflecting emotionally intelligent leadership, <italic>Culture</italic> describing a supportive work culture, and <italic>Evaluation</italic> describing the use of data to provide feedback on the unit&#x02019;s performance (e.g. infection rates). Each dimension included six items and was answered on a five-point Likert scale: strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, and strongly agree. The ACT version used in this study is modified specifically for paediatric acute care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and has previously been used to investigate the influence of organisational context on RNs use of research in Canadian paediatric hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Permission to use the translated Swedish ACT version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] was granted by the developers. The ACT has been tested for validity and reliability in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] with a Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; for leadership, culture, and evaluation ranging

Complications comprised infiltration including extravasation, occlusion, signs and symptoms of thrombophlebitis, PVCs accidentally removed, suspicion of infection, and wounds. Elective reasons included completed treatment, the patient being bothered by the PVC, PVCs re-sited in connection with blood sampling or change to central venous access device, and other reasons (e.g. location dependent, been inserted too long, blood at insertion site). Exact 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval for proportions based on the binomial distribution is provided. Differences between intervention and control groups from baseline to post-intervention in reasons for removals of PVCs were analysed using logistic regression analysis. An interaction effect of being in the intervention group post-intervention was used for assessing the intervention effect. A result of an increased adherence to the CPG could have been an increased number of PVC days; thus, the difference of PVC mean days from baseline to post-intervention was analysed using linear regression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Registered nurses&#x02019; adherence and demographics</title><p id="Par25">The scorings of RNs&#x02019; adherence to the CPG were dichotomized into always versus not always (representing never, rarely, occasionally, and frequently), as the CPG prescribed that the recommendations should always be performed to ensure patient safety. RNs&#x02019; educational background and employment were divided into basic education (certificate or bachelor) versus advanced (master or specialist post-graduate qualification). Categorical variables are presented as frequency counts and percentage. Symmetrically distributed data are presented as means, and standard deviation and asymmetrically distributed data are presented as median and range. Statistical analysis of the effect of the intervention on RNs&#x02019; adherence was performed in the same way as for PVC-related complications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Context</title><p id="Par26">RNs&#x02019; individual mean scores for the ACT dimensions leadership, culture, and evaluation were calculated. The mean scores of each dimension for the intervention and control group were calculated by adding RNs&#x02019; individual mean scores per dimension divided by the number of RNs per group. RNs&#x02019; mean scores for each context dimension were used to categorise their scores into high and low, with a cut-off set at &#x0003e;3.5 (high) and &#x02264;3.5 (low) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. RNs&#x02019; scorings were then allocated into four context groups: high context, requiring high on all three context dimensions; moderately high context, high on two context dimensions and low on one; moderately low context, high on one and low on the two remaining; and low context, low on all three context dimensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

Also, there was no considerable difference in the RNs&#x02019; scoring of the context between the groups. The context in both groups was predominantly perceived as moderately low to moderately high, indicating that the conditions might not have been optimal for a successful implementation.</p><p id="Par33">The complication rate at baseline and post-intervention in both groups can be considered as high, as around 40&#x000a0;% of the recorded PVCs were removed due to signs and symptoms of complications. The number of PVCs that were removed due to suspicion of infection was low at baseline and post-intervention in both groups, which might be related to the rather high adherence to disinfection of hands. The adherence to the CPG recommendations was quite stable in both groups throughout the study period, but the adherence for disposable gloves and daily inspection showed a greater improvement potential compared to disinfection of hands. As daily inspection of the PVC site is an essential procedure in order to detect early signs or symptoms of PVC-related complications, the low adherence to this recommendation is of concern.</p><p id="Par34">There are few studies on the effects of computerised reminders in nursing, and to our knowledge, there are no other studies on the effect of computer reminders on RNs adherence to a CPG for PVCs and on patient outcomes related to PVCs. Therefore, we will discuss our findings in relation to research on computerised support interventions in general that is of relevance for our findings. A systematic review concludes that CDSSs that advise health care professionals automatically in the workflow at the point of care were not significantly associated with success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, systems that provided advice to both patients and health care professionals were more likely to succeed as well as CDSS that required the user to provide reason for deviating from recommendations. The authors of the review conclude that interactive CDSS seems to be more successful than CDSS that simply provide advice to health care professionals. The intervention used in this study involved reminders that integrated recommendations from the CPG into clinical practice by a relatively simple instrumental innovation. A recent overview of systematic reviews found no compelling evidence that multifaceted implementation interventions would be more effective in changing health care professionals&#x02019; behaviours compared to single component interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. But the authors argue that it might be appropriate to design single or less complex multifaceted implementation interventions that are more tailored to overcome contextual barriers and improve the targeted behaviour. Studies that have showed some positive outcomes concerning the use of CDSS in nursing practice in recent years have, in addition to CDSS, also included educational sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and/or feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The outcome of the present study might have benefitted from using facilitators to overcome the barriers of rigorous PVC documentation and regular feedback on items such as PVC-related complications, for example.</p><p id="Par35">The development and integration of computer reminders are dependent on the existing EPR systems&#x02019; usability and flexibility, which might hinder an optimal integration. RNs at the intervention units were only exposed to the reminders when recording in the template designated for PVCs, which meant that RNs who did not use the PVC template in the EPR were not exposed to the reminders. While we could not control where RNs recorded PVCs, we chose to only retrieve data from the PVC template to make sure that the included PVCs were documented by RNs in the intervention group that had been exposed to the reminders. Another consideration is that the fields in the template for recording PVC insertion (date, reason, attempts, side, site, and size) were mandatory; in other words, they had to be completed to save and close the template. Due to the EPR design restrictions, the fields relating to PVC removal (date, cause, and daily inspections) could not be made mandatory. With the range of 40.3&#x02013;49.1&#x000a0;% missing data regarding reasons for removal, we can assume that RNs were more exposed to the reminders that were activated when recording PVC insertion but less likely to see the activated reminders regarding removal and inspection.RNs perception and experiences of using the computer reminders at the interventions units are described in a separate article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The CPG and the reminder concerning daily inspection of the PVC site seemed to have little effect on RNs&#x02019; behaviours, implying that early sign and symptoms of complications may have gone unnoticed.</p><p id="Par36">In a study on an implementation support intervention like this, an analysis of the context at participating units was considered to be of importance. As suggested in the PARIHS framework, the more favourable the context, the better the conditions for successful implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], meaning that high ratings of context would be favourable for the implementation of the CPG recommendations. There was a significant difference in scorings between intervention and control in one of three context dimensions. However, as most RNs scored their context as moderately low or moderately high, it indicates that the conditions for a successful implementation to occur were less optimal. A majority of the RNs in both groups scored the culture at their units as high, while the mean scores for leadership were almost equally distributed between high and low for both groups. Evaluation was scored low by a majority of the RNs in both groups. A pilot study with a leadership intervention designed to influence RNs&#x02019; use of guideline recommendations concerning diabetic foot ulcers suggests that the unit manager&#x02019;s involvement played a role in initiating and enabling a change towards evidence-based practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The authors argue that further understanding of how context interacts with leaders&#x02019; ability to influence guideline adherence is needed, as well as the knowledge of what kind of organisational structures and processes are required to support nurse managers and clinical leaders in conducting relevant evaluations, such as with auditing and feedback. A previous study by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] showed a significant relationship between RNs&#x02019; scores of the evaluation dimension and adherence to the recommendation on daily inspection of PVC sites. We were, however, not able to investigate the direction of the relationship; in other words, if RNs that received regular feedback concerning nursing procedures performed daily inspection of PVC sites more often or if RNs that regularly carried out daily inspections of PVC sites received more feedback.</p><p id="Par37">The PARIHS framework suggests that successful implementation is more likely to occur when evidence and context are considered high. Evidence should then have a sound research base and coincide with clinical and patient experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The research base for the CPG recommendations could most likely have been more robust. Out of the 11 references that were included in the CPG, five were studies conducted in paediatric settings and none of these were referred to when recommending the choice of PVC site, size, or signs and symptoms of PVC-related complications. Professional experience was referred to when recommending PVCs sites that should be avoided. One can only speculate if the impact would have been different if the CPG could have been based on more rigorous evidence. Unfortunately, we do not have any data on how RNs perceived the CPG for PVCs, but it is a concern that approximately one third of the RNs (varying from 22.5 to 41.3 &#x000a0;% between groups and baseline to post-intervention) stated that they did not know about the CPGs for venous catheters (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p id="Par38">The primary outcome, PVC-related complications, was based on individual RNs&#x02019; observations and recordings, and we cannot verify if the recorded reason for removal was the accurate reason for removal or the exact number of real PVC-related complications. Consideration must also be given to the fact that the documentation might have improved over time, which may have resulted in an increase in recorded PVC-related complications. These two considerations, however, should not have affected the outcome as the shortcoming of the PVC recording and related complications should have been equally distributed in the intervention and control group due to the randomisation. It should be mentioned that we do not report the possible patient-related factors (i.e., the child&#x02019;s diagnosis/condition and type of pharmacological treatment administered via the PVC) that may have influenced the complication rate. The signs and symptoms of PVC-related complications in children are often nonspecific and sometimes interrelated. The signs and symptoms of infiltration including extravasation and occlusion can be similar, and we cannot guarantee that the documented complications were accurate.</p><p id="Par39">It should be mentioned that an analysis of patients&#x02019; ages between the two groups based on the division of neonatal patients was performed as these patients are more likely to have PVC-related complications compared to patients at the paediatric units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. PVCs recorded at neonatal units represented 58.7&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;149) of the complications in the intervention group at baseline and 53.7&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;139) post-intervention. Ten percent (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) of the PVC-related complications in the control group related to neonatal units at baseline and 5.4&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) at post-intervention. Age, based on division of neonatal patients, was not seen as a bias as the intervention group had more PVC-related complications among neonatal patients, compared to the control group, but the overall complication rate was below the occurrence found in the control group.</p><p id="Par40">The second outcome, RNs&#x02019; adherence to the CPG was based on self-reported data, which imply a risk for social desirability leading to over-reporting of preferred procedures for the management of PVCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, it does not seem that social desirability has affected the outcome to a high extent, as ratings of adherence to daily inspection of the PVC site were low. The computer reminders appeared when RNs were recording, and thus, they were exposed to the reminder after the targeted procedure. However, as the insertion, management, assessment, and documentation of PVCs are common daily procedures among Swedish paediatric RNs, we assumed that the reminders likely would impact RNs behaviour in forthcoming PVC management.</p><p id="Par41">The PARIHS framework was used to structure this study. In hindsight, it would have been an advantage to map the context of the setting before designing the intervention. By using a theoretical framework emphasising the importance of evidence and context, the opportunities to reflect on why the intervention had no impact increased, as well as better insights and future intervention ideas could be derived.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">The present cluster randomised controlled study implemented recommendations from a CPG in the format of reminders integrated into a PVC template in the EPR system. The results showed no significant effects on PVC-related complications or on RNs&#x02019; adherence to the CPG recommendations. The context in both groups was assessed to primarily vary from moderately low to moderately high, indicating that a successful implementation of the CPG recommendations in the format of reminders was probably less likely to occur. The intervention might have benefitted from a more tailored intervention that targeted specific barriers at the inpatient units, for example, the low frequency of recorded reasons for removal and daily inspection of PVC site, as well as the lack of regular feedback to RNs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Eva Johansson is deceased.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>UF participated in the study conception, design, data acquisition, and data collection and performed the statistical analysis and interpretations, as well as drafted and edited the final manuscript as submitted.
