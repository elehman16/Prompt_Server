Thus, non-adherence to medication can occur if a patient failed to initiate treatment, sub-optimally implemented the dosing regimen, and/or discontinued the treatment early.</p><p>Adherence is determined by many factors that can be grouped under five dimensions: social and economical, health system related, therapy related, condition related, and patient related.<xref rid="b4-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Determinants of adherence to antiepileptic drug (AED) regimens include the complexity of the drug regime, uncontrolled seizure, patients&#x02019; understanding about their illness, age, education level, and employment.<xref rid="b6-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Periods of adherence failure to AED regimens are associated with increased risk of seizure, status epilepticus, and mortality.

The inclusion criteria for patients were a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy, age &#x02265; 18 years, current use of AEDs, and the ability to provide consent and complete the scale independently. Patients were excluded if they had any mental problems that impaired their ability to complete the scale or if they refused to participate. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study by one of the investigators (SB). Patients were given a participation information sheet that described the type of study, and the nature and purpose of the intervention. Those who agreed to participate signed the consent form. The Office of Research Affairs and Ethics Committee of KFSH and RC approved this study. Patients recruited in September 2013 were allocated to the control group, while those recruited in October through December 2013 were allocated to the intervention group. Participants did not receive incentives.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>This study was designed as a prospective nonrandomized interventional study. The educational interview involved a 30-minute structured verbal face-to-face interview conducted by one of the researchers (RA) who is a pharmacist. All patients were educated according to the guidelines of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists regarding pharmacist-conducted patient education and counseling.<xref rid="b19-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Patients in the intervention group were interviewed individually and privately, either in the clinic after the consultant&#x02019;s examination or in the nurse&#x02019;s room.</p><p>The educational content was divided into two parts. The first part included education about the medical aspects of epilepsy, and the second part included information about AEDs. Leaflets that contained the content of the educational interview were written in Arabic and were presented in a &#x0201c;question and answer&#x0201d; format, and given to the intervention group. This leaflet included educational information about the medical aspects of epilepsy including the definition of epilepsy, causes, description of brain seizure activity, diagnostic procedures, seizure observation, and classification; information about AEDs; and information about the importance of adherence and the consequences of non-adherence. The pharmacists also discussed methods to incorporate AED administration into their daily lives and to transform their daily routines into cues to take their AEDs. The most common cue was prayer times. In addition, the pharmacist provided a pill organizer to each participant and counseling about how to use it, and its usefulness.</p><p>For more assistance and support, participants were advised to visit an Epilepsy Support and Information Center (ESIC) &#x02013; a non-profit regional office governed by KFSH and RC, under the &#x0201c;umbrella&#x0201d; of the International Bureau of Epilepsy, that provides information and support to epilepsy patients and their families. The leaflet also provided the web address for ESIC for patients to access online information. All participants received the usual care offered by their clinic. Patients in the control group did not receive an educational interview from the pharmacist, a pill organizer, or leaflets. They could access the ESIC, but the pharmacist did not encourage it.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study measures</title><p>The instrument used here consisted of a 2-part questionnaire. Part one included demographic data, and part two included medication adherence questions. Demographic characteristics included age, gender, marital status, occupational status, education, age of onset of epilepsy, seizure frequency, the time since the last seizure, and the number of AEDs taken. In this study, self-reported adherence was assessed using the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8).<xref rid="b20-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The scale provides information on behavior related to low adherence that may be unintentional (eg, forgetfulness) or intentional (eg, stopped taking medications because they felt that their symptoms were under control). The scale contains items that seek to assess the extent of implementation of a dosing regimen and discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>The MMAS-8 has been used previously to assess medication adherence in epilepsy patients.<xref rid="b23-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The license to use the validated Arabic version of the MMAS-8 was obtained. The version is in modern standard Arabic language &#x02013; the language used for reading and writing in Arab countries including Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The MMAS is an 8-item questionnaire with seven items represented in a yes/no format. The final question is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. According to the MMAS scoring system, a score of 8 reflects high adherence, and 6 to &#x0003c;8 reflect medium adherence; scores &#x0003c;6 reflect low adherence.<xref rid="b20-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The questionnaire was administered to both the intervention and control groups at baseline as well as 6 weeks after the intervention. While baseline measurements were carried out at the clinic, adherence levels post-intervention were assessed via a phone call to both groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A pilot study indicated that a sample size of 27 subjects in each group was sufficient. The size was estimated based on an average MMAS of 5.2&#x000b1;1.6 with an expected adherence difference of within 24% at a significance level of 5%.</p><p>Descriptive analyses including the means and standard deviations (SDs) were calculated for all quantitative values. Differences between the group&#x02019;s adherence levels were compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. The mean, median, and interquartile ranges were used for differences between adherence scores. Spearman&#x02019;s correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between age, education level, duration of illness, number of seizure episodes, or number of AEDs and adherence score. Chi-square tests, Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests, and independent <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to test for differences in patients&#x02019; characteristics such as seizure frequency, as appropriate. The statistician was blinded to which group received the intervention. Analysis was conducted to determine the effect of intervention after 6 weeks. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19 software (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Seventy patients were approached, and 60 agreed to participate; 30 were assigned to each group.

At baseline, 40.7% of patients in the intervention group had medium adherence scores (MMAS-8 score, 6&#x02013;8), and none were classified as having high adherence scores (MMAS-8 score, 8). Six weeks after intervention, 85.2% of patients in the intervention group had medium adherence scores (MMAS-8 score, 6 to &#x0003c;8) and 11.1% had high adherence scores (MMAS-8, score 8).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of pharmacist-led educational interview in epilepsy patients&#x02019; adherence to AED regimens. The adherence score improved significantly in the intervention group patients.</p><p>Compared with previous studies that used a MMAS-8 to measure medication adherence in patients with epilepsy,<xref rid="b7-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b23-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> our participants had higher rates of moderate-to-low adherence (MMAS-8 score, &#x0003c;8). Two-thirds of our participants were on polytherapy, which is higher than rates reported in other studies.<xref rid="b23-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This is probably attributable to the nature of the clinic from which the patients were recruited (an epilepsy clinic in a tertiary referral center).</p><p>Our results suggest that educational interview could positively impact the medication adherence of patients with epilepsy. Previous evidence on the effectiveness of educational interventions in terms of medication adherence in patients with epilepsy is mixed.<xref rid="b12-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Li et al<xref rid="b26-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> found that self-reported adherence remarkably improved in participants who received intensive education, consultation services, and repeated reminders, while unchanged adherence levels were reported in the non-intervention cohort. Peterson et al<xref rid="b27-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> reported a positive impact on patient adherence to AEDs among those who received counseling, a pill organizer, and other reminder techniques, measured using blood tests and refill frequencies.</p><p>In another study, there was no significant difference in adherence to AEDs based on detectable drug levels or by self-reporting between the intervention and control groups, 1 year after a day-long health educational program.<xref rid="b28-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Dash et al<xref rid="b23-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> investigated the effect of a structured one-on-one educational program administered by an epilepsy nurse over four sessions each lasting at least 30 minutes. They found that self-reported adherence scores were significantly improved in the intervention group with no significant change in the control group.</p><p>The current study&#x02019;s findings suggest that pharmacists can improve the utilization of treatment by educating patients with epilepsy. Similar research, albeit limited in number, shows similar directions. A randomized controlled trial comparing AEDs education provided by a pharmacist with AEDs plus behavioral intervention, found that adherence increased greatly from baseline in both groups, but without significant differences.<xref rid="b29-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In a before/after study conducted in adults with epilepsy,<xref rid="b30-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> a single 30-minute consultation with a pharmacist was associated with improved self-reported adherence 2 months after the intervention.</p><p>We did not assess the feasibility and costs of implementing such an intervention into pharmacists&#x02019; routine care for patients with epilepsy. Published evidence suggests that adherence-enhancing interventions are cost-effective or cost-saving.<xref rid="b31-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> However, more studies on the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist-delivered interventions to improve adherence are needed.</p><p>Although our study found a statistically significant difference in adherence score between baseline and 6 weeks after the educational interview, the clinical impact remains unclear. The level at which non-adherence becomes clinically significant varies between medications, and the needed adherence rate is unknown for many medications.<xref rid="b33-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Research examining the level at which nonadherence rates to AEDs becomes clinically significant is needed.</p><p>This study is one of the very few studies<xref rid="b29-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> that has examined the efficacy of pharmacist-led educational interview in patients with epilepsy. It does have some obvious limitations. The study was a prospective interventional study with no randomization. This might introduce selection bias. The majority of participants have had a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy for &#x0003e;10 years; thus, we cannot generalize our findings to newly diagnosed patients with epilepsy. The difference in collection periods between control and intervention groups is also a weakness. The fact that less than half of the participants used the pill organizer, limited our ability to assess the impact of this simple intervention. Previous studies have shown that reminder packaging has a positive impact on medication adherence.<xref rid="b34-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> We also used a self-reported adherence measure. Self-reported measures have several advantages.<xref rid="b33-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b35-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Self-reporting may be considered the most practical method of measuring adherence in clinical settings. They also provide a reasonably accurate estimate of adherence. Other advantages include low cost, ease of administration, and flexibility in timing and mode of administration. Also, self-reports can explain underlying issues that contribute to non-adherence. However, self-reported measures of adherence have several potential disadvantages.<xref rid="b33-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b35-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> First, many self-reporting measures have not been rigorously tested for convergent or criterion validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. Second, there is a chance of social desirability and memory biases. Patients could have reported themselves as being more adherent than they actually were, and non-adherence may have been underreported due to memory deficit and poor patient recall of information. Here, one of the authors who interviewed patients to obtain self-report adherence data also delivered the adherence-enhancing intervention. This might have increased socially desirable responses.<xref rid="b35-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Third, when using self-reporting measures to assess the efficacy of adherence-enhancing interventions, intervention participants may be disproportionately influenced to self-report faithful adherence compared to control arm participants.<xref rid="b35-ppa-11-959" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A pharmacist-led educational intervention had a positive impact on medication adherence in epilepsy patients. This study paves the way for conducting a randomized controlled trial with longer follow-up and more rigorous protocols for measurement of medication adherence to confirm the findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Use of the &#x000a9;MMAS is protected by US and International copyright laws.
