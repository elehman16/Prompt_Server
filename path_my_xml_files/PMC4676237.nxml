This randomized double-blind study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of adding clonidine to bupivacaine and bupivacaine-fentanyl combination.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Material and Methods:</title><p>A total of 100 patients scheduled for surgery under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated into four groups (<italic>n</italic> = 25 each) to receive intrathecal bupivacaine 7.5 mg plus normal saline 0.5 ml (group BS), intrathecal bupivacaine 7.5 mg, and fentanyl 25 &#x003bc;g (group BF), intrathecal bupivacaine 7.5 mg and clonidine 75 &#x003bc;g (group BC), intrathecal bupivacaine 7.5 mg, clonidine 37.5 &#x003bc;g, and fentanyl 12.5 &#x003bc;g (group BCF). The time of onset and duration of sensory block, highest dermatome level of sensory block, time of onset of motor block, time to complete motor block recovery and duration of spinal anesthesia, intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamics and side effects if any were recorded. VAS, total number of patients who were administered supplemental analgesic in each group and the total amount of supplemental analgesic administered in the next 24 h was quantified and documented in all the groups.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The time of onset of sensory block (min) in groups BS, BC, BCF, and BF was 10.80 &#x000b1; 2.26, 10.20 &#x000b1; 1.00, 10.00 &#x000b1; 0.00, and 13.80 &#x000b1; 2.61 respectively, thus onset of sensory block was significantly earlier in groups BC and BCF. Similarly, onset of motor block was also quicker in groups BC and BCF. Time of requirement of supplemental analgesia was 135.20 &#x000b1; 12.70 min, 199.2 &#x000b1; 21.92 min, 209.80 &#x000b1; 26.32 min, and 208.00 &#x000b1; 26.58 min in groups BS, BF, BC, and BCF respectively. Intraoperative and postoperative changes in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate were comparable. Sedation scores were significantly higher in group BC. Pruritus was only observed in groups BF and BCF. Mean nausea vomiting scores were comparable in all groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>We conclude that the addition of clonidine in doses of 75 &#x003bc;g and 37.5 &#x003bc;g to low-dose bupivacaine and bupivacaine-fentanyl prolongs the sensory and motor block while increasing the duration of postoperative analgesia without significant side-effects.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Intrathecal clonidine</kwd><kwd>spinal adjuvants</kwd><kwd>subarachnoid fentanyl</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spinal anesthesia is preferred over general anesthesia for lower limb surgeries due to its advantages such as decreased intraoperative blood loss, reduced incidence of deep venous thrombosis, and continued postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Various additives have been evaluated in the quest for an ideal adjuvant, which can enhance the quality of analgesia and prolong the duration of spinal anesthesia with minimal adverse effects. However, success with many additives has been variable, especially with regards to side-effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, pruritus, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and urinary retention.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Fentanyl has been used as a spinal additive to lower the dose of bupivacaine and prolong postoperative analgesia though at the expense of side effects such as pruritus and respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In recent times, clonidine has been attempted as a spinal additive. However, the most common adverse effects reported with the use of intrathecal clonidine are sedation and hypotension.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Most of these adverse effects are observed when clonidine is used in higher doses of 150-300 mcg.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It is possible that the combination of small doses of clonidine with fentanyl will prolong both motor and sensory block and decrease the incidence of adverse effects. Hence, the present study was designed to evaluate the effect of a combination of a small dose of clonidine and fentanyl on the quality of spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>After institutional Ethics Committee approval and written informed consent, 100-adult patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists grades I and II, scheduled for lower limb surgery under spinal anesthesia, were included in the study. Exclusion criteria included any patients on &#x003b1;-blockers and contraindication to regional anesthesia, history of significant coexisting diseases like ischemic heart disease, hepatic or renal diseases, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, neuropathies, rheumatoid arthritis, spinal deformities like kyphoscoliosis, history of allergy or anaphylaxis to local anesthetics and morbidly obese patients. A detailed preanesthetic checkup was conducted one day prior to surgery. Patients were instructed about the use of visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperatively as a tool for measuring postoperative pain. Investigations such as complete hemogram, urine routine, renal function tests, random blood sugar, chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram (ECG) were done prior to surgery as and when indicated. Patients were allowed light meals 6 h before surgery and clear liquids such as water and clear juice till 2 h prior to surgery. All patients were premedicated with tablet ranitidine 150 mg and tablet alprazolam 0.5 mg at night prior to surgery and 2 h before surgery.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated into either of four-study groups of 25 patients each as per computer-generated random number list. The name of the drug to be given was sealed in envelopes numbered 1-100, which was opened by an anesthesiologist not involved in the intraoperative and postoperative care of the patient and prepared in an unlabeled 2 ml syringe. This was then handed over to the attending anesthesiologist in a coded form who was blind to the nature of drug given. The intrathecal solutions administered were as below:</p><p>

</p><p>After shifting the patient to the operation theater, before insertion of intravenous (IV) cannula, baseline parameters such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respiratory rate (RR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and ECG were recorded. After achieving an IV access, preloading was done with 10 ml/kg of lactated ringer's solution over 15-20 min. Under all aseptic precautions, a midline spinal puncture was performed at the L3-L4 or L2-L3 level in sitting a position using a 26 gauge Quincke spinal needle after prior local infiltration with 2 ml of 0.5% lignocaine. All injections were given at a rate of 1 ml over 4-5 s and intrathecal solutions were at room temperature. Thereafter, the patients were placed in the supine position for surgery.</p><p>The time of onset and duration of sensory block, highest dermatome level of sensory block, time of onset of motor block, time to complete motor block recovery and duration of spinal anesthesia were recorded. At the end of the procedure, patients were shifted to postanesthesia care unit (PACU) where monitoring was continued.</p><p>The onset of sensory block was defined as the time between intrathecal injection to the absence of sensation at the T<sub>8-9</sub> dermatome, as assessed by light touch using cotton wool. The highest level of sensory block was evaluated by light touch at mid clavicular line anteriorly every 5 min for 20 min after injection, thereafter every 15 min. The duration of sensory block was defined as the time of regression of two segments in the maximum block height. Time for motor block onset was defined as when modified Bromage score was three or lesser.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The duration of spinal anesthesia was defined as the period from the spinal injection to the first occasion when the patient complained of pain in the postoperative period. Surgery was allowed to commence on achieving adequate sensory block height (T<sub>8-9</sub>). Sensory block was recorded 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after intrathecal injection and subsequently every 15 min. In the postoperative period, motor block recovery, and sensory block regression were assessed till 3 h every 15 min after completion of surgery.</p><p>Systolic blood pressure, DBP, HR, RR, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded 5 min before intrathecal injection, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min after intrathecal injection and subsequently every 15 min for the duration of surgery. In the PACU, HR, SBP, DBP, RR, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded every 15 min for 1<sup>st</sup> h, and then half hourly till 4<sup>th</sup> h and then every 4 h till completion of 24 h.</p><p>Hypotension was defined as SBP of less than 20% below baseline. Hypotension was treated with IV ephedrine 10 mg, repeated every 5 min if necessary. Bradycardia was defined as HR less than 50 beats/min for which 0.5 mg of atropine sulfate was administered intravenously. Sedation was evaluated using a 4-point sedation scale:[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] 0 = awake and alert, 1 = drowsy, but responding to verbal commands, 2 = not responding to verbal command, but responding to manual stimulation, 3 = difficult to awaken. Nausea was evaluated using a 5-point scale:[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] 1 = no nausea and vomiting, 2 = mild nausea, 3 = moderate nausea, 4 = severe nausea, treatment is necessary, 5 = intractable nausea, patient complains despite treatment. A rescue antiemetic in the form of IV injection ondansetron hydrochloride, 4 mg stat, was given when the nausea vomiting score &#x02265;3. Adverse effects such as pruritus, dryness of mouth, dizziness, and hypoxemia (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x02264;90%) were recorded and treated if required. All observations were recorded by an anesthesiologist who was blinded to the group allocation of the patient.</p><p>Pain scores using VAS were assessed in the PACU at 0,<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, 1, 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h. Patients had been informed before surgery that they could request an analgesic when they felt pain in the postoperative period. Any patient reporting VAS &#x02265;3 was administered a supplemental dose of an analgesic injection tramadol 50 mg IV. Total number of patients who were administered supplemental analgesic were noted in each group. The amount of supplemental analgesic administered in the next 24 h was quantified and documented in all the groups. Any patient with failed spinal anesthetic or patient complaining of pain in the intraoperative period, which required administration of general anesthesia, was excluded from the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was based on the power analysis calculated by previous study,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] so that 25 patients in each group would provide a power &#x0003e;0.8 (&#x003b1; = 0.5) to detect an increase of 30 min in the duration of spinal anesthesia and an increase of 30% in the time interval from intrathecal injection to first analgesic request.</p><p>The results were tabulated and analyzed using appropriate statistical techniques. Unless otherwise stated, results are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. All normally distributed continuous variables such as the duration of sensory block, motor block, spinal anesthesia, and demographic variables were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

It is known to potentiate both sensory and motor block of local anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The possible mechanisms involved in potentiating spinal block include: Suppression of the activity of wide dynamic range neurons and release of substance P, norepinephrine and acetylcholine in spinal cord dorsal horn and direct inhibition of impulse conduction in A&#x003b4; and especially C fibers, possibly by increasing potassium conductance.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Clonidine, thus complements the action of local anesthetics in stabilizing neurons and accounts for enhancement of effect of local anesthetics and opioids by modulating the transmission of painful stimuli thereby preventing the state of central sensitization.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine has been used intrathecally in different doses. The dose of clonidine used in the present study corresponds to that of van Tuijl <italic>et al</italic>. who administered intrathecal clonidine in a dose of 75 mcg/kg.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The results of our study demonstrates that that the addition of clonidine in doses of 75 &#x003bc;g to bupivacaine (7.5 mg) and 37.5 &#x003bc;g to bupivacaine (7.5 mg) plus fentanyl (12.5 &#x003bc;g) truncates the time of onset of sensory and motor block. Similar results were observed by Strebel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Gecaj-Gashi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] who reported shorter onset of sensory and motor block in patients receiving intrathecal clonidine. Grace <italic>et al</italic>., however observed prolonged time to onset of motor block in pethidine-clonidine group which is in contrast to the results of our study.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The difference in the result could be due to the fact that higher doses of pethidine 0.75 mg/kg was used in this study. It is possible that the higher dose of intrathecal pethidine could mask the effect of intrathecal clonidine.</p><p>We also observed significant prolongation of the duration of motor block in the groups BC and BCF. Singh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Benhamou <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] also reported significant prolongation of motor block when clonidine was used as an adjuvant for intrathecal use.

The difference could be explained by the fact that they used 3.5 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine and clonidine as compared to the present study, accounting for higher level of sensory blockade achieved and thus explaining hypotension.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Patients in groups BC and BCF were sedated as evidenced by higher sedation scores.

The quality of analgesia as evidenced by VAS scores and total postoperative rescue analgesic consumption was comparable among 37.5 &#x003bc;g and 75 &#x003bc;g clonidine in combination with bupivacaine and bupivacaine-fentanyl. Therefore, our study validates the use of intrathecal clonidine in doses of 75 &#x003bc;g and 37.5 &#x003bc;g in prolonging postoperative anesthesia and analgesia in terms of benefits versus side effects in patients undergoing lower limb surgeries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflicts of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maurer</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name><name><surname>Hiebert</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>GC</given-names></name><name><surname>Di Cesare</surname><given-names>PE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of outcomes of using spinal versus general anesthesia in total hip arthroplasty</article-title><source>Am J Orthop (Belle Mead NJ)</source><year>2007</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>E101</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17694193</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Staikou</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Paraskeva</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effects of intrathecal and systemic adjuvants on subarachnoid block</article-title><source>Minerva Anestesiol</source><year>2014</year><volume>80</volume><fpage>96</fpage><lpage>112</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23839318</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Idowu</surname><given-names>OA</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanusi</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Eyelade</surname><given-names>OR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effects of intrathecally administered fentanyl on duration of analgesia in patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia for elective caesarean section</article-title><source>Afr J Med Med Sci</source><year>2011</year><volume>40</volume><fpage>213</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22428515</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gabriel</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Gordin</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Alpha 2 agonists in regional anesthesia and analgesia</article-title><source>Curr Opin Anaesthesiol</source><year>2001</year><volume>14</volume><fpage>751</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17019175</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Filos</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name><name><surname>Goudas</surname><given-names>LC</given-names></name><name><surname>Patroni</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Polyzou</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hemodynamic and analgesic profile after intrathecal clonidine in humans.
