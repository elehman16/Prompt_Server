There are two basic devices used to achieve lung isolation: the double lumen endobronchial tube and the bronchial blocker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Traditionally, trainees acquire lung isolation skills on these devices while intubating patients under the guidance of an experienced anesthesiologist; but reportedly anesthesiology faculty and senior anesthesia residents with limited thoracic experience have a high rate of malposition or failed attempts and longer placement time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This method of training may result in major complications including death, and these complications may occur at rates as high as of 0.5&#x02013;2&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Lung isolation is clearly an advanced skill, yet, how much training a novice learner requires to become proficient in this skill is unknown.</p><p id="Par6">Traditionally, in educational research, either one method of teaching is compared with no teaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or with less robust teaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, since simulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and video-based trainings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] have become established as powerful teaching tools, we now have a stronger standing in doing comparative effectiveness studies on instruction techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Repetitive practice is required to perform a rarely used procedure upon short notice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and such skills decay if not actively maintained with repetitive practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The deficiency or decay of lung isolation skill among anesthesiologists is costly as it can result in delayed or cancelled surgeries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], prolonged operating room time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and airway complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Therefore, we planned a study to find out whether we can train novice learners to basic level of proficiency in lung isolation skills without risking our patients. Our detailed study aims were whether 1) novices can be trained to basic proficiency level of lung isolation skills before they apply their skills in patients; 2) video-based training is comparable to simulation-based training in teaching basic lung isolation skills; 3) lung isolation skills decay in a short time (2&#x000a0;months) with no practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par9">The study was submitted to the Human Studies Committee and Human Subjects Protection Program Office of the Institutional Review Board (IRB), University of Louisville, Kentucky, USA.

For the Global Rating Scale (GRS) for double lumen endobronchial tube outcome, group sample sizes of 5 (expert) and 15 (post-training simulation novices) would achieve 90&#x000a0;% power to detect a 20&#x000a0;% difference between the null hypothesis (that both group means are 4.7) and the alternative hypothesis (that the mean of the simulation group is 3.8), using a two-sided Mann-Whitney U test and a significance level of 0.05. Ninety-three percent power was detected for the Global Rating Scale for bronchial blocker outcome based on a 20&#x000a0;% mean difference between the expert (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.8) and post training simulation groups (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.8).

No retrospective power calculation was performed on the bronchial blocker time outcome as the post-training simulation group performed faster than the expert group (post-training simulation mean time of 62&#x000a0;s vs. experts mean time of 85&#x000a0;s). Similarly, a power analysis was not performed on the double lumen endobronchial tube and bronchial blocker percentages passing as the post-training passing rates were much greater than those found in Campos&#x02019; study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par37">In this study, we trained novices with two different training techniques. Our data indicated that Video-based didactic training was as effective as Simulation-based training in teaching basic lung-isolation skills. A part of the skills decayed within a 2-month period of no practice.</p><p id="Par38">To advance the science of teaching, Cook et al. suggested applying the principles of comparative effectiveness of clinical research to educational research; comparing one teaching method to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In this study, we developed performance measurement instruments, established a proficient competency level, trained faculty to rate the subjects&#x02019; performance, and also compared two active interventions in training novices to basic proficient competency level. Although there are many excellent tools available in the literature to assist in lung isolation learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], there is no single work about how to train novices to competency level for basic skill set, and when and how to retain them. We have provided a systems-based guidance tool on how to introduce an important technical skill to novice learners, how to test them, and when to retrain for decay in skills.</p><p id="Par39">
<italic>Skill decay</italic> refers to loss of acquired skill, knowledge, or training after a period of non-use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The longer the period of non-practice or non-use, the greater the decay will be [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In our study, there was a statistically significant decay of insertion speed of 15&#x000a0;s, but that may have little clinical significance. More than 50&#x000a0;% novices could not be available for the skill decay retesting at 2-months for the allowed time period. This may have affected our presented results positively or negatively.</p><p id="Par40">Our skill decay over time data suggests that non-thoracic anesthesiologists may require on-going re-enforcement of their lung isolation skills by performing certain numbers of successful procedures each year. We used 20 successful lung isolation procedures for the Experienced group as this is the minimum number required by Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in anesthesiology during three years of residency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We selected more than 100 successful lung isolation for the expert group because minimum number of successful procedure is the only way to certify proficiency at this moment.</p><p id="Par41">In our study, we used senior year medical students as novices instead of junior anesthesiology residents. One aim of the study was to determine <italic>skill decay</italic> after fixed period of non-practice or non-use. Because our hospital is a Level-1 trauma center, our residents may perform lung isolation as a part of their normal clinical work. Therefore, we could not pick our novice learners from our residents. This potentially would have invalidated the skill decay data.</p><p id="Par42">There are various limitations to our results. First, we acknowledge that the HAAS is made of plastic and there cannot be any difficult airway or harm such as migration of lung isolation device, hypoxia, tension pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum and tracheobronchial rupture due to poor lung isolation technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, if we had performed this study in patients, the assessment would have faced many other limitations: a) the time between completion of training to testing of lung isolation skill would be different in each trainee, which would make the comparison difficult; b) testing conditions could not have been standardized because each patient&#x02019;s anatomy is different; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and c) the assessment of dexterity decay after fixed lapse of time in double lumen endobronchial tube and bronchial blocker would have been impossible on patients for similar reasons mentioned above (please see &#x0201c;a&#x0201d;). Therefore, the value of training and testing novices on human anatomy simulators is both obvious and inevitable in teaching the basic skill set.</p><p id="Par43">The Human Airway Anatomy Simulator (HAAS) has a carina, which bifurcates into a right and left main-stem bronchus only. In patients with normal anatomy, the malposition lung isolation devices can be identified and corrected by fiberoptic bronchoscope assisted visualization of right upper lobe bronchus with its apical, anterior and posterior segmental bronchus, not present in HAAS. Similarly, in patients with congenital and acquired anomalies of the tracheobronchial tree, the differentiation of tracheal anatomy and lung isolation can be very challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In summary, the unfamiliarity with the use of fiberoptic scope and anatomy of the tracheobronchial tree can increase placement time with decrease success rate in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par44">In conclusion, in this comparative effectiveness educational study, we concluded that novice learners can be trained to basic skill level of lung isolation proficiency in the simulator setting. We also found out that video-based didactic learning was as effective as our simulation-based training. These newly learned lung isolation skills begin to decay within 2 months after initial training without practice. The skill decay findings may enforce the concept of advance procedural skills -such as elective lung isolation- to be only practiced by sub-specialists who practice these skills routinely. Alternatively, one may conclude that anesthesiologists who do not practice thoracic anesthesia and lung isolation skills routinely may require reinforcement/retraining of advanced skills in some intervals. Future research should focus on translating the lung isolation skills learned on simulators to real patients, who have non-standard and possibly difficult anatomy, as well as different body habitus.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par46">
