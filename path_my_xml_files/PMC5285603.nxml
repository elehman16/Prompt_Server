The aim of this clinical and radiological 6-month study was to compare and evaluate the clinical outcome of deep intraosseous defects following reconstructive surgery with the use of mineralized cancellous bone allograft (Puros<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) or autogenous bone.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Ten patients with 12 sites exhibiting signs of moderate generalized chronic periodontitis were enrolled in the study. The investigations were confined to two and three-walled intra bony defects with a preoperative probing depth of &#x02265;5 mm. Six of these defects were treated with Puros<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (group A) the remaining six were treated with autogenous bone graft (group B). Allocation to the two groups was randomized. The clinical parameters, plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and bone fill, were recorded at different time intervals at the baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Intraoral radiographs were taken using standardized paralleling cone technique at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months. Statistical analysis was done by using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey highly significant difference.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Both groups resulted in decrease in probing depth (group A, 3.0 mm; group B, 2.83 mm) and gain in clinical attachment level (group A, 3.33 mm; group B, 3.0 mm) over a period of 6 months, which was statistically insignificant.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Within the limitations of the present study, it can be concluded that both mineralized cancellous bone allograft (Puros<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) or autogenous bone result in significant clinical improvements.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd><italic>Bone substitutes</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>grafts</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>intraosseous defects</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>periodontal disease</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>periodontal regeneration</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues of teeth caused by specific microorganisms or group of specific microorganisms resulting in progressive destruction of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone with pocket formation, recession, or both.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The rationale of periodontal therapy is not only to control inflammation but also to reduce periodontal pockets and regeneration of alveolar bone, cementum, and periodontal attachment.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Autogenous grafts are considered to be the gold standard among graft materials[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] because they are superior at retaining cell viability, contain osteoblasts and osteoprogenitor stem cells and heal by osteogenesis, avoid the potential problems of histocompatibility differences and risk of disease transfer.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Allografts, such as DFDBA, exposes the bone inductive proteins located in the bone matrix such as bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) and BMP7,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] which are capable of inducing mesenchymal cells to differentiate into osteoblasts <italic>in vivo</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The ultimate goal of periodontal therapy is the regeneration of alveolar bone, cementum, and periodontal ligament.

Patients were randomly assigned to two study groups, i.e., A and B. Patients within the age group of 35&#x02013;50 years diagnosed with generalized chronic periodontitis exhibiting multiple intrabony defects (two wall and three wall defects), probing depth of &#x0003e;5 mm, sufficient keratinized tissue to allow complete tissue coverage of the defect, a radiographic evidence of vertical osseous defect with base at least 3 mm coronal to the apex of tooth, and patients who had not undergone any type of periodontal therapy in the past 6 months were included in the study. Patients with any systemic conditions which would compromise the outcome of periodontal therapy, pregnant or lactating women, teeth exhibiting mobility, patients known to be allergic to antibiotics/drugs, smokers and patients who were unable to maintain periodic recall visits were excluded from study.</p><p>Once the patients were included into the study, the entire study protocol was explained in detail to the patient, after which a consent form was signed. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ragas Dental College and Hospital. Initial therapy scaling and root planing were performed in a two sessions. Plaque control was assessed at the end of each scaling and root planing session and oral hygiene instructions were reinforced. After completion of the initial therapy, a re-evaluation was done after 4&#x02013;6 weeks. At this point, periodontal charting was repeated to assess the response to initial therapy and to review the criteria for surgery with respect to probing depth and attachment levels.

All granulomatous tissue was removed. Out of 12 sites in the study groups, 6 were randomly treated with Puros<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] and 6 were treated with autogenous bone scrapings. In group A, Puros<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was taken into a sterile dappen dish and mixed with saline [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. A moist gauze was used to remove any excess saline and the graft was placed into the defect. Small increments of the graft material were added and condensed into the defect till the defect was filled. In group B, the mucoperiosteal flap at the defect site and adjacent tooth was extended to expose the buccal shelf area. Ebner's grafter was used in pull motion to scrape graft from the exposed bone [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. The bone scrapings were collected into a sterile dappen dish, and the graft was placed in to the defect in increments and condensed till the defect was filled. Flaps were approximated and closed by using 4&#x02013;0 black silk interrupted sutures. Periodontal dressing was given with COE-Pak<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.

Animal and human studies of this material have shown good bone formation and repair.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Autogenous bone has been considered to exhibit osteogenic, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive properties, and has thus, been used with the intent to improve outcomes of periodontal regenerative procedures.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In the present study, the selected sample sites in both the groups showed overall reduction in the mean probing pocket depth and marked gain in the clinical attachment level, which could be attributed to the resolution of tissue inflammation, reconstruction of the supporting periodontal structures in terms of alveolar bone, periodontal ligament in accordance with the previous studies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Meta-analysis performed by Reynolds <italic>et al</italic>. on 12 studies showed greater clinical attachment loss gain and a significantly greater probing depth reduction was reported for bone allograft treatment 0.43 mm (SD: 2.25) compared with open flap debridement (OFD).[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The regeneration of the periodontal attachment apparatus in the present study had a favorable clinical and radiological outcome while using both bone replacement grafts mineralized cancellous bone allograft (Puros<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and autogenous bone.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, it is necessary to have a large sample size, greater duration of study, and assessment using surgical re-entry or advanced radiographical aids would provide more definitive information.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Both mineralized cancellous bone allograft, Puros<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and autogenous bone has the potential to promote predictable periodontal regeneration in the treatment of periodontal intraosseous defects and showed significant improvement in all clinical and radiographical parameters at the end of six months.
