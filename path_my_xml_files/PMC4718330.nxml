The incidence of breast cancer in women is about 15% in the UK [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the United States about 230,480 new cases of invasive breast cancer was diagnosed in women [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Based on the latest statistics, the statistics of cancer incidence is increasing in Iran [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A variety of screening tests are used to detect breast cancer e.g., mammography, ultrasound, MRI, clinical breast examination, and BSE [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].There are only three methods for early detection of breast cancer including mammography, clinical examination, and breast self-examination (BSE) [<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Early detection of breast cancer is crucial not only to the survivorship of a patient, but to her quality of life while treating the cancer, and thereafter [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Breast self-exam or a clinical exam allowed many breast cancers to be diagnosed and successfully treated. They with an annual mammogram starting at age 40 can help to early detection of breast cancer, when it's most treatable [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A study in China on 267,040 women, who did BSE, revealed that after about 10 years of follow-up, BSE enabled women to find their cancers earlier [<xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Another study in Canada on 290,000 women showed that screening included both a clinical exam and a mammogram was 95% effective at detecting breast cancer [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite efficacy of these methods, only 49.5% of women act in accordance with these guidelines [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and women do not perform them on a regular basis [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One of the factors influencing the success of these programmes is women's acceptance, their motivations and attitudes [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>There are many risk factors that affect the chance of developing cancer. Some of them like a person's age or race have a great impact and can't be changed. Others are related personal behaviors and may be controllable [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Understanding probably affecting factors can help develop a breast health plan [<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Considering the high prevalence of breast cancer in Iran, and considering that improving women's knowledge can be a base for improving their motivation and performance, present study aimed to assess women's knowledge, and their health behaviors about breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2a"><title>Study design and Subjects</title><p>Present study was a descriptive, analytic cross sectional. By using simple randomized method and after approving of the Research Ethic Committee of Islamic Azad University of Hamedan, 358 women were selected from Gynecology clinics in Hamedan city from April 10 to July 10, 2012. The including criteria were 35 years of age or more who were eligible to take part in the study, and without any history for breast cancer. The excluding criteria were unwillingness to attend the research during the study, and having a series of diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S2b"><title>Procedure and data analysis</title><p>Data collection tools included a two-part self-administered questionnaire and a self examination checklist. The first part of the questionnaire included some sociodemographic data (age, marital status, parity, etc); and the second section included questions relating to practices of Mammography, knowledge of breast cancer signs and relative risk factors, and the attitude of the participant toward BSE.</p><p>The knowledge questions were asked in three parts. Part 1) general question about knowledge of breast cancer in women and preventive behaviors were included: the prevalence of breast cancer in Iran, the kind of disease, easiest and cheapest way to detect, the onset of self-examination, breast self-examination in breast cancer prevention, breast self-examination time, the frequency of breast self-examination, mammography onset age, annual mammography information, the role of mammography in preventing breast cancer, the most common site of breast cancer, the most common age of breast cancer, symptoms (10 cases) and risk factors for breast cancer (9 cases). Part 2) knowledge about the symptoms of breast cancer were measured with ten questions including sinking part of the breast, orange peel form part of the breast, touching the wall and movable painless lump found in the breast, breast deformity, breast pain, bloody or watery discharge from the nipple, nipple of a breast sinking, sinking and breast skin lesions, breast enlargement, an enlarged auxiliary lymph nodes. Part 3) Knowledge about risk factors for breast cancer in women was measured by 9 items including a history of cancer in one breast, low fat diet, onset of menstruation at the age of 12 years, women who have not had children, women with first pregnancy before age 30, obesity, a history of cancer in a mother or sister or a close relative, history of benign breast tumors, menopause before 50 years of age. The questionnaire was set based on questions mean and sample score on three levels: poor, moderate and good. Participants received self-administered questionnaire. Answers were "correct" or "incorrect". If participant ticked "correct" she got 1 score (suitable) and if she ticked "incorrect", 0 score was considered (unsuitable).</p><p>Total number of knowledge questions was 30. Mean of score was 12 &#x000b1; 4.7. Total number of questions about cancer signs and risk factors were following 30 and 9. Mean of score for breast cancer symptoms was 2.39 &#x000b1; 4.76 and for risk factors was 1.39 &#x000b1; 4.2.</p><p>Check list also included how to do BSE. Initially, all subjects were taught breast self-examination technique by a physician. Then to each person was given a self examination check list. Checklists were controlled by trained researchers. If the person did the examination correctly, she got "1" score, and otherwise she got "0" score.</p><p>Content validity and test re-test reliability was done for the questionnaire and check list. To determine the validity of research tool, they were reviewed by 10 experts in this field. The reliability was determined by the measurement carried out by two researchers. Finally, the results were analyzed using the SPSS version 17.0. The level of p&#x02264;0.05 was considered for all statistical analyses.

Moreover, most participants did not perform BSE and mammography on the timing and regular basis. It can was affected by the low prior information about BSE and breast cancer. These results are in line with Radi study that found only 20.5% of participants had undergone breast screening, and 47.5% knew how to perform BSE [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In Yurdakos et al. study on 500 health personnel from 7 public hospitals with a mean age of 32 years old, only 22.2% of the health personnel had undergone mammographic evaluation [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>At present study most participants did not have any prior information about breast self examinations. However, prior information about mammography was widespread. In Radi study 79% of participants heard about BSE [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mean of awareness for breast cancer recognition, breast cancer signs and its risk factors among participants were low. A study in Egypt showed that total breast cancer knowledge scores had an average of 13.318 [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, only 44% of participants recognized the concept of breast self examination and 60% of them did not recognize mammography as an early detection method [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Another study on 45 breast cancer patients in Saudi indicated that Saudi women level of knowledge about breast cancer is very inadequate [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In contrast, in a survey, breast cancer and BSE awareness among nurses was relatively high [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This may be because of the key role they played in cancer information. It seems essential to increase women's awareness about benefits of breast cancer early detection.</p><p>Findings of present study highlight high educational need about breast cancer in Iran. Public awareness interventions are needed in order to promote early detection of breast cancer and overcome an ever-increasing burden breast cancer with emphasis on prevention and screening. In a program known as "Circle of Sisters", a breast cancer education initiative of free mammography was performed on 37 American Indian women. As a result, percentage of those expressing an intention to get a mammogram annually grew from 81.1% to 94.6% [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. An educational program should be considered for health care providers in order to train BSE effectively to women and mammograms guidelines. Physicians, health providers, health pamphlets, and other information sources should assist in clarifying the benefits [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Such training can lead to an increased awareness so that in a survey in Iran significant increases were observed after the educational program [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>Government should design women education programs by health care professionals in order to recognize the role of them in cancer preventing. El-Shinawi et al. in their study found that 97% of breast cancer patients were willing to participate in spreading awareness among their community and their own families [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Programs should be augmented in daily living pattern of women, as Sadler et al. found that program initiation time is the most important factor in participation in cancer education programs among Korean people [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It seems to be effective if the cultural factors are considered</p><p>Because of low prevalence of self-care interventions for early detection of breast cancer, and high prevalence of breast cancer in Iranian society, increasing the awareness about it is a necessity and using this type of interventions based on the costs versus benefits may be of special interest in health care system. The data were collected from one geographic region. It is recommended other studies in other regions, countries and with larger samples.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank president of research of Islamic Azad University, Toyserkan and Hamedan branches for their cooperation in this study.
