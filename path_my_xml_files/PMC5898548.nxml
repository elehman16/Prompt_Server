Limited reports on asthma self-management programs for adolescents to enhance prevention behaviors in Taiwan were found. The protocol paper presents a two-armed, randomized controlled trial aiming to test the effectiveness of a newly developed self-management program for 112 adolescents with asthma in Taiwan. The primary outcome is asthma self-efficacy. Data will be collected at baseline and the week 4.

The Global Asthma Report <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> reported approximately 334 million asthma sufferers, most of whom are between 10 and 14 years of age. Although the trend for hospital admission due to asthma and its related mortality have declined in higher-income countries, asthma prevalence continues to increase in some countries, such as Thailand and Taiwan <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A National Survey conducted in Taiwan demonstrated an increase of 2.6% in the prevalence of asthma among adolescents in 2005 and 7.3% in 2009 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The data for 2009 also indicated that 11.5% of asthmatic adolescents had visited the emergency department for an asthmatic attack whiles 16.9% of adolescents with asthma reportedly ignored the symptoms of a flare up.</p><p id="p0015">An effective self-management program may improve lung function and self-efficacy, decrease missed school days, and reduce activity limitations and emergency department visits <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Moreover, an ideal self-management program would be individually tailored for different populations; thus, a self-management program for adolescents must use age-appropriate strategies that appeal to adolescents <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">Several studies have investigated asthma interventions programs for asthmatic children in Taiwan <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, only one study was specifically designed for adolescents <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The results of these intervention programs for the enhancement of lung function and asthma control were inconsistent <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Also, there was a lack of theory-based intervention programs regarding behavior change <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, an intervention that uses different strategies, communication styles, and encouragement to address individual needs for enhancing patients' self-care is necessary <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The impact of asthma on adolescents differs from those of other age group <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, the development of a specific asthma self-management program for adolescents is vital. There has been far less research on the effects of such programs on asthma prevention and management, including the monitoring of symptoms of asthma. Studies in Taiwan have stressed the importance of improving knowledge in order to promote health outcomes; however, knowledge alone is insufficient to change behaviors or provide better health outcomes <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, particularly among adolescents <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><sec id="sec1.1"><label>1.1</label><title>Study aims</title><p id="p0025">The primary study aim is to develop an asthma self-management program for adolescents in Taiwan based on the self-efficacy model.

The participants and their parents will be present at all three sessions, during which questions will be encouraged, as well as cooperation between parents and adolescents in managing asthma. At the first meeting, the researcher will provide a booklet on asthma. The researcher will also send two short text messages to the participants following the weekly face-to-face sessions to remind them to use their medication and provide encouragement and motivation. In Week 4, the participants in the experimental group will receive a phone call in addition to the text message, with the aim of identifying problems, providing support, helping to solve any problems in carrying out their asthma action plan, and revising the information already provided. After the 4-week intervention, a research assistant who is blinded to the group allocation will collect the data.</p><p id="p0060">The validity of the intervention for adolescents in Taiwan was determined by experts in the field. A panel was established with members experienced in the care of patients with asthma and asked to review the content of the self-management program to determine its suitability for adolescents with asthma.

As the original scales were only available in English, permission to translate the English versions into Chinese by using the translation and back-translation approach <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> were obtained. All the questionnaires were firstly using forward translation followed by back-translation (Chinese to English). The translations were then compared for equivalence with the original English version by monolingual and bilingual authors.

Outcome-expectancy includes 8 items with a Cronbach's alpha valve of 0.84. The response items in the original version were measured on a 5-point scale, from 1 (not helpful) to 5 (extremely helpful). High outcome-expectation scores by adolescents with asthma indicate that they are more positive in anticipating good outcomes from engaging in the asthma self-management behaviors. As this proposed study is based on the self-efficacy theory, the researcher modified the response format, revised the content, and discussed these changes with the author via e-mail. The responses will now be rated from 1 (no confidence at all) to 10 (complete confidence), which is in accordance with the recommendation of Bandura <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Cronbach's alpha values of the Asthma Prevention Index and the Asthma Management Index are 0.71 and 0.51, respectively <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. High scores indicate high levels of asthma prevention and management behaviors. The outcome will be measured by the Asthma Control Test (ACT) which assesses the current clinical control of asthma, preferably over a 4-week period. The contents of this test include frequency of daytime symptoms, limitation of activities, nocturnal symptoms/awakening, need for reliever or rescue treatment, and patients' feelings about their asthma control. Low scores on the ACT indicate uncontrolled asthma, whereas, high scores indicate well-controlled asthma.

This program was based on Bandura's self-efficacy model in improving adolescents' self-confidence and outcome expectancy in carrying out an asthma self-management program. Although numerous self-management programs have been used in the treatment of asthma, not all the programs have demonstrated effectiveness and understanding of asthma self-management behaviors in adolescents. Asthma self-management programs <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> developed for adolescents have been criticized because of their insufficient attention to adolescents' developmental needs <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, which may contribute to their lack of effectiveness in asthma self-management. The major focus in developing the asthma self-management program in the proposed study is firstly on adolescents' developmental needs. Secondly, this intervention program has been designed using Bandura's four sources of attaining self-efficacy as well as outcome-expectations, another component of Bandura's model for self-management programs. These two outcomes, in turn, will help to encourage adolescents who are willing to carrying out prevention and management behaviors for asthma symptoms thereby controlling and managing their condition. Strategies for delivering the asthma self-management program include a face-to-face meeting with age-appropriate communication styles, text-messages, and a telephone call. Also, outcome expectation, which has received minimal attention in past studies, is important for improving a person's intention to practice positive health behaviors such as the self-management of asthma by demonstrating the link between actions and outcomes. Furthermore, conducting this study in Taiwan will redress the lack of studies in this country; as many previous studies regarding asthma self-management in adolescents have been conducted in the USA. This program will contribute to the evidence base for such programs.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Declaration</title><p id="p0110">None.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="p0115">The authors declare that they have no competing interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p id="p0120">TJT, AMC, and CJW contributed to the conception and design of the trail.
