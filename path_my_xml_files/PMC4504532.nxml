All patients received a subcutaneous injection of 3.6&#x0200a;mg goserelin every 4 weeks along with 25&#x0200a;mg exemestane daily. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). The second end point included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and clinical benefit rate (CBR) based on complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for &#x02265;6 months.</p><p>The median PFS was 13 months (range: 2&#x02013;42 months). The median DOR was 8 months (range: 2&#x02013;40 months). Two patients achieved CR (4.5%), and 15 patients experienced PR (34.1%). Fifteen patients (34.1%) had SD &#x02265;6 months. The ORR was 38.6%, and the CBR was 65.9%. Primary progressive disease occurred in 15 patients (34.1%). Five patients (11.4%) died during the study period. Because a few patients have died, the median OS has not been reached. Drug therapy was well tolerated. The most frequent grade-3 adverse events were arthralgia (18.2%), skin rash (6.8%), and myalgia (4.5%).

Studies of the use of goserelin in combination with exemestane in premenopausal women with local advanced or MBC are scant. From our 44 patients, 38 patients had been treated with tamoxifen before this study, including 26 patients for adjuvant ET, from which 20 developed recurrence or metastasis within 5 years and in all 12 metastasis patients the tamoxifen treatment failed because of PD. Aromatase inhibitors have become a standard ET, after the failure of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> However, for premenopausal breast cancer patients only aromatase inhibitor treatments are not applicable. In order to render premenopausal breast cancer patients in a postmenopausal state, medicinal ovarian function suppression using GnRH-analogs like goserelin has been developed leading to ORRs and duration of remission comparable to those seen following oophorectomy.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In our study, the ORR was 38.6% and higher than previously reported rates of 30%<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and 33%<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> in patients only treated with GnRH-analogs. Our CBR was 65.9% and also higher than 48% with only goserelin medication in premenopausal advanced breast cancer patients,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> which indicates that the clinical efficacy of goserelin combined with exemestane therapy in premenopausal women with local advanced or MBC is superior than goserelin medication alone. In addition, no grade-4 toxicities were observed, and those that did occur were consistent with the use of a single-agent AI treatment in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Various studies have reported similar results regarding the efficacy of aromatase inhibitors combined with goserelin as a first-line treatment in premenopausal women with hormone-responsive, locally advanced or MBC.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Cheung et al<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> studied the efficacy of goserelin plus anastrozole, and observed a CBR and ORR of 67% and 36%, respectively, with a time to progression of 12 months. Carlson et al<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> also investigated the efficacy of goserelin combined with anastrozole, and reported a CBR and ORR of 71.9% and 37.5%, respectively, with a median time to progression of 8.3 months.

The results of our investigation of the efficacy of goserelin plus exemestane are consistent with the findings of these previous studies. Comparisons of the various endocrine therapies used to treat breast cancer are problematic because the majority of such studies have used relatively small cohorts of breast cancer patients. However, the high level of efficacy that goserelin plus exemestane demonstrated in our study support the use of this regimen for ET in premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Previous studies have shown that various endocrine therapies for breast cancer have demonstrated low efficacy for visceral metastasis, but higher efficacies have been reported for bone or soft tissue metastases.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> The results of our study showed that patients with lung metastases responded more favorably to goserelin and exemestane combination therapy than those without lung metastases (ORR: 60% vs 25%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.059), and patients with only lung metastases had a significantly more favorable prognosis than those with only liver metastases (ORR: 73.3% vs 27.3%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.026). A limitation of our study was the small sample size and that it was a single-arm study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In our study, goserelin and exemestane combination therapy was a highly efficacious ET for hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or MBC in premenopausal women, and was significantly more efficacious in patients with lung metastases than in those with liver metastases. Future studies are warranted to identify the antitumor mechanism by which goserelin and exemestane act upon lung metastases. Large, randomized clinical trials investigating the efficacy of goserelin plus exemestane for locally advanced and MBC in premenopausal women are also warranted to confirm our overall findings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AIs = aromatase inhibitors, CBR = clinical benefit rate, CR = complete response, DOR = duration of response, ER = estrogen receptor, ER+ = estrogen receptor-positive, LH-RH = luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, MBC = metastatic breast cancer, ORR = objective response rate, OS = overall survival, PD = progressive disease, PFS = progression-free survival, PgR = progesterone receptor, PR = partial response, RECIST = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, SD = stable disease.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allemani</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Weir</surname><given-names>HK</given-names></name><name><surname>Carreira</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
