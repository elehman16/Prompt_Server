However, these treatments are not appropriate or helpful for all.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Direct brain stimulation is one approach to treating medically intractable partial-onset seizures. The RNS System (NeuroPace, Inc., Mountain View, CA, U.S.A.) is a cranially implanted neurostimulator that provides responsive stimulation directly to the seizure focus when epileptiform activity is detected. The intent is to disrupt epileptiform activity before a seizure can develop.</p><p>A randomized, multicenter, double-blinded, sham-stimulation controlled pivotal study assessed efficacy and safety of responsive direct brain stimulation as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the frequency of seizures in adults with medically intractable partial onset seizures from one or two foci. Efficacy and safety results of the blinded controlled portion of the trial were previously reported.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This manuscript provides study results during the open label period of this trial with up to 2&#x000a0;years of postimplant follow-up.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The RNS System (NeuroPace, Inc) is an investigational device that provides responsive cortical stimulation via the RNS Neurostimulator, a cranially implanted programmable neurostimulator, which is connected to one or two depth and/or subdural cortical strip leads that are surgically placed in the brain according to the seizure focus (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). Each of the four electrodes in a lead can sense and stimulate, and provides eight sensing and stimulating electrodes in total. The Neurostimulator continually senses electrocorticographic activity and is programmed by the physician to detect specific abnormalities on electrocorticography (ECoG) and then to provide brief pulses of stimulation in response to the detection. In most patients, the Neurostimulator is programmed to detect and provide stimulation to interictal epileptiform abnormalities. The physician adjusts detection and stimulation parameters for each patient as needed to optimize control of clinical seizures.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Implanted RNS Neurostimulator and NeuroPace Depth Lead and NeuroPace Cortical Strip Lead.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="epi0055-0432-f1"/></fig><p>Subjects participating in the RNS System Pivotal trial were 18&#x02013;70&#x000a0;years of age, had partial-onset seizures that had not been controlled with two or more trials of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), had three or more disabling seizures per month on average, and had undergone standard diagnostic testing that localized seizures to one or two&#x000a0;foci. Disabling seizures included simple partial motor, complex partial, and secondarily generalized tonic&#x02013;clonic. Seizures were recorded in daily seizure diaries. Subjects who were implanted with a vagus nerve stimulator were required to have vagus nerve stimulation turned off during the baseline period and to have the vagus nerve stimulator pulse generator (but not leads) removed prior to implantation of the RNS System.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating investigation sites. All patients gave written informed consent. The study was registered on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT00264810).</p><p>The Pivotal trial design is provided in Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>. To be eligible for implant, subjects had to have three or more disabling seizures per month on average over a 12-week Baseline Period while on stable AED regimens. For the first 4&#x000a0;weeks after implantation, the Neurostimulator was programmed to sense and record the ECoG, but not to deliver stimulation (Postoperative Stabilization Period). Subjects were then randomized 1:1 to the Treatment group (active stimulation) or to the Sham group (no stimulation). Stimulation was adjusted for the Treatment group over the next 4&#x000a0;weeks (Stimulation Optimization Period) and continued over the 12-week Blinded Evaluation Period (BEP). Both Treatment and Sham group subjects received responsive stimulation treatment throughout the Open Label Period (OLP), which began after the fifth postimplant month and continued to 2&#x000a0;years postimplant. AEDs were to remain constant through the end of the BEP but could be adjusted in the OLP. Study design and subject flow are presented in Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>RNS System Pivotal Study Design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="epi0055-0432-f2"/></fig><p>Changes in seizures during postimplant periods were compared to the preimplant baseline. During the BEP, the primary effectiveness outcome was the change from baseline in seizure frequency in the Treatment group compared to the Sham stimulation group as estimated by a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model. Over the OLP, changes in seizures were expressed as median percent change for each 3-month period compared to the preimplant baseline, and as responder rate (the percentage of subjects with a 50% or greater reduction in seizures). Significance was assessed by the GEE.</p><p>Quality of life in individual subjects was assessed by the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-89)<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> at baseline and for the OLP at 1 and 2&#x000a0;years after implantation. Clinically significant individual improvements in the overall QOLIE-89 score and primary scales were defined as an increase in the T-score of 5 points, which is equivalent to 0.5 standard deviations.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Group-averaged changes in the QOLIE overall score and primary scale scores were compared to baseline using the paired one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test.</p><p>Safety was assessed by the rate and types of spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs), which were classified by the investigators as serious or mild. An adverse event was identified as serious if it resulted in a hospital admission or invasive procedure, posed significant risks or consequences to the subject's acute or long-term health, or caused serious injury or death. AEs were further classified as device-related (definitely or potentially related to the RNS System) or not device-related, and anticipated or unanticipated. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed all AEs and a second committee determined whether deaths met criteria for sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP).</p><p>Other safety assessments were neuropsychological function and mood, which were evaluated at baseline and at 1 and 2&#x000a0;years after implantation. Standardized tests of neuropsychological functioning assessed a variety of domains that included visual and verbal memory, language, and cognitive flexibility.

The most frequent SAE during the postoperative period was implant site infection, occurring in 5 subjects (2.6%): one of these subjects had the Neurostimulator and Leads explanted. Four subjects (2.1%) had an intracranial hemorrhage; two of these four subjects had postoperative epidural hematomas that were evacuated, the third had a subdural hematoma evacuated, and the fourth had a small computerized tomography (CT) diagnosed intraventricular hemorrhage and was observed for 1&#x000a0;day in the hospital. Other SAEs that occurred during the first postoperative month were transient apraxia and dysphemia (one subject) and a procedure to revise the location of a lead (one subject).</p><p>Over the blinded periods (months 2 through 5 post-implant) there was no difference between the Treatment and Sham group subjects in the rate or types of SAEs.

The third subject had inpatient video&#x02013;electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, which was considered an SAE because the procedure was performed in the hospital. Other SAEs in the blinded period that were not considered to be device related included two subjects who had implant site infections (both were attributed to seizure-related head trauma and not considered to be device related) and two subjects who underwent procedures to revise the location of the leads.</p><p>Over the OLP, the most common SAE was admission to an inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit in order to perform video-EEG monitoring (13 subjects; 7.0%). Four subjects in the OLP had a lead revision to improve the lead location. Five subjects had damaged leads. Four of these five subjects had a depth lead that was damaged where the lead was secured at the burr hole, and the fifth subject had a strip lead that was damaged between the skull and a titanium plate and a second lead that was inadvertently cut. These were considered SAEs because there was a procedure to replace the leads. Three subjects had implant site infections during the OLP and one of these had the device explanted. Two subjects had subdural hemorrhages that were attributed to seizure related head trauma during the OLP. None of these subjects had neurologic consequences.</p><p>SAEs related to a change in seizures during the OLP included an increased frequency of complex partial (nine subjects; 4.8%) or tonic&#x02013;clonic seizures (seven subjects; 3.7%), and an exacerbation (increased severity or duration) in tonic&#x02013;clonic (seven subjects; 3.7%) or complex partial seizures (two subjects; 1.1%). There were three additional subjects with SAEs related to simple partial motor seizures; one subject's seizures were more severe and two subject's seizures were more frequent. In each of these cases, these were considered SAEs because the subject was hospitalized to change or administer AEDs and/or to be monitored. No subject withdrew from the trial because of an adverse event related to a change in seizures.</p><p>Six subjects died during the Pivotal trial. Four of these deaths were attributed to possible or definite SUDEP; one of these subjects was randomized to the Sham group and did not have stimulation enabled.

Treatment with the RNS System did not cause deterioration in any aspect of neuropsychological function or mood.</p><p>Specific adverse events of special relevance with any implanted device to treat seizures include hemorrhage and implant site infection, and changes in seizures. The rate of acute and chronic hemorrhages and the rate of infections of the implant site in subjects treated with the RNS System were not higher than the rates of hemorrhage or infection in patients implanted with intracranial electrode to localize the seizure focus<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> or with epilepsy surgery<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> or with deep brain stimulation for treatment of movement disorders.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Adverse changes in seizures are expected in any trial of an epilepsy therapy and likely represent the natural fluctuation of seizures in patients who do not respond to the treatment. The numbers of adverse events related to seizures in the RNS System trial was not higher than what has been reported in randomized controlled trials of antiepileptic medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>At least 30% of adults with partial-onset seizures do not have their seizures controlled with antiepileptic medications,<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and a similar percentage experience medication-related side effects that impact quality of life, such as impaired cognition, fatigue, problems with coordination, nausea, or other gastrointestinal symptoms.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Some of these patients will consider epilepsy surgery or the VNS. However, not all patients are candidates for these treatments and these treatments do not always work. Subjects in the RNS System Pivotal trial were not candidates for epilepsy surgery, and one third had already failed treatment with a VNS.</p><p>Despite the risks associated with all epilepsy treatments, the risks of doing nothing are often greater. Patients with more frequent seizures have poorer cognitive function; significant increases in anxiety, depression, and suicidality; poorer employment status; a lower quality of life; and worse overall health than patients with fewer seizures.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Patients do not need to achieve complete seizure freedom in order to experience positive life changes.<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> A reduction in seizure frequency, even without seizure freedom, can improve mood, employment, perceived health, and quality of life.<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> These observations reinforce the need to find new therapies that can reduce the burden of seizures.</p><p>Responsive stimulation to the seizure focus reduced the frequency of partial-onset seizures acutely and over the long-term, was well tolerated, and was acceptably safe in a population of persons with frequent and disabling partial-onset seizures who had failed multiple epilepsy therapies. There were enduring improvements in quality of life. Adverse systemic effects common with AEDs did not occur with treatment with responsive stimulation; adverse events related to coordination, gastrointestinal side effects, and allergic reactions were not higher in treated subjects compared to untreated subjects during the blinded periods. There was no deterioration in overall group measures of cognition or mood. The results of this study indicate that the RNS System provides an additional treatment option for patients with medically intractable partial-onset seizures who are not good candidates for epilepsy surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>University of Southern California: Rami G.
