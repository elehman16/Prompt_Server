Even modest (up to 2% of body weight) exercise-induced dehydration attenuates aerobic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and impairs cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Athletes often train or compete on consecutive days or more than once per day and must consume sufficient fluid to restore water balance or to replace fluid losses before the next exercise session. A fluid deficit incurred during one exercise session may compromise performance in the next exercise session if fluid replacement is insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Fluid intake can attenuate or prevent many of the disturbances in metabolic, cardiovascular, thermoregulatory functions, and performance that accompany dehydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to replace fluid and electrolytes rapidly to recover fully before the start of the next bout of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This is particularly challenging when sweat loss is high and the interval between exercise bouts is short. Both the volume of the rehydration fluid and its composition are critical for maintaining whole-body fluid homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>More than 3,000 brands of mineral water are commercially available worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Several studies have evaluated the effects of ingestion of water or commercially available drinks on the restoration of fluid balance after exercise-induced dehydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Only a few studies have evaluated the effects of natural and widely used mineral waters on restoration of performance after dehydrating exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It has been shown recently that desalinated ocean mineral water, taken from 662&#x000a0;m below sea level, can substantially accelerate recovery of aerobic power and lower-body muscle power after a prolonged bout of dehydrating exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Natural deep mineral water of moderate mineralization (DMW) is extracted from a depth of about 700&#x000a0;m in geological sandstone, dolomite, and gypsum layers, which were formed almost 400 million years ago. The DMW in these layers is 10,000&#x02013;13,000&#x000a0;years old. The composition of this calcium&#x02013;magnesium&#x02013;sulfate water was conditioned by a complex metamorphosis that took place in the ground and that involved the melting of calcium and magnesium minerals contained in the dolomite and gypsum layers. Presently, there is no information about the effects of DMW on recovery after exercise performed in a warm environment causing dehydration. We propose that the unique composition of DMW with moderate mineralization may accelerate the recovery in such exercise conditions. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a human study in which we compared the short-term recovery of physical performance after a prolonged, aerobic dehydrating exercise (ADE) in subjects given DMW or placebo (plain water) drink supplied for rehydration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Nine healthy, physically active, nonsmoking women (age 24.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.7&#x000a0;years; height 172.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.3&#x000a0;cm; weight 69.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.9&#x000a0;kg; body fat 21.2%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.4%) who were not taking any medications volunteered to participate in the study.

The criteria used to verify that VO<sub>2</sub>max was achieved were a respiratory exchange ratio greater than 1.1, maximum heart rate equal to 220 &#x02013; age &#x000b1; 10 beats per min, and a plateau in oxygen uptake with increasing workload (all the criteria had to be met).

Thus, we do not have data on the extent to which performance was reduced in the hypohydrated state immediately after the ADE. Based on the literature, even modest exercise-induced dehydration of up to 2% of body weight can attenuate aerobic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Another study reported only a small decrease in VO<sub>2</sub>max but a larger decrease in graded exercise time 1&#x000a0;h after dehydrating exercise causing a loss in body weight of 1.8&#x02013;2.1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

The type and amount of fluids ingested in the recovery period after exercise can significantly influence the restoration of fluid balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Full recovery of fluid balance can be achieved only when a significant, albeit insufficient, quantity of sodium is ingested after exercise. It has been shown that addition of 40&#x02013;50&#x000a0;mmol/L&#x02013;1 of sodium chloride to a rehydration beverage reduced subsequent urine output, thereby providing more effective rehydration than a sodium-free drink. However, this did not result in improved performance 4&#x000a0;h after the end of the rehydration period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, the low concentration of sodium in DMW would not have slowed recovery of performance in our study.The concentration of sodium in both drinks used in our study was low, and it seems that 4&#x000a0;h after ADE, the subjects were slightly dehydrated. The body weight was lower by 0.4&#x02013;0.7&#x000a0;kg or 0.6&#x02013;1.0% compared with before ADE but there was no significant difference between trials.</p><p>There is a limited range of commercially available mineral waters that have a composition sufficient to achieve full rehydration, even though it is generally thought by the public that some well-known drinks are effective for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the study by Shirreffs et al., volunteers were dehydrated by 1.94&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.17% of body mass after intermittent exercise in the heat and then ingested a carbohydrate&#x02013;electrolyte solution (Gatorade), carbonated water/apple juice mixture (Apfelschorle), or San Benedetto mineral water in a volume equal to 150% of the loss of body mass, and the responses were compared with the rehydration effectiveness of Evian mineral water. Four hours after rehydration, the subjects were in a significantly lower hydration status than the pretrial situation in the trials with Apfelschorle (&#x02212;365&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;319&#x000a0;mL, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.030), Evian (&#x02212;529&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;319&#x000a0;mL, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0005), and San Benedetto (&#x02212;401&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;353&#x000a0;mL, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.016) but were in the same hydration status as before the dehydrating exercise in the trial with Gatorade (&#x02212;201&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;388&#x000a0;mL, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.549) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Thus, water ingestion results in prompt diuresis, even during hypohydration, and prevents a return to the normal hydration state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Despite the use of commercially available solutions and mineral waters to assess their influence on rehydration and recovery of performance in several studies, it is difficult to compare the data because of differences in the magnitude of dehydration and study designs. In the study by Snell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] the subjects exercised at 70-75% VO<sub>2</sub>max for 60&#x000a0;min at 29-33&#x000b0;C, resulting in a dehydration weight loss of 1.8-2.1% body weight. After 60&#x000a0;min of rest, subjects performed treadmill test to voluntary exhaustion, which resulted in a small reduction in VO<sub>2</sub>max and a decline in treadmill performance by 3% relative to the control results. During next 60&#x000a0;min of rest subjects ingested the same amount of fluid lost in the form of one of three randomly assigned commercial drinks and then repeated the treadmill test to voluntary exhaustion. VO<sub>2</sub>max returned to baseline levels with Rehydrate, but there was only a slight improvement with Gatorade and Crystal Light. There were no differences in heart rate or ventilation with the three different replacement drinks. Relative to the dehydrated state, a 6.5% decrease in treadmill performance time occurred with Crystal Light (flavored water product), while replenishment with Gatorade, which contains fructose, glucose, sodium, and potassium, caused only a 2.1% decrease. By contrast, Rehydrate, which contains fructose, glucose polymer, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, amino acids, thiols, and vitamins, caused a 7.3% increase in treadmill time relative to the dehydrated state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Kalman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] compared the effects of ingestion of supermarket brand bottled water, pure coconut water, coconut water from concentrate, or a carbohydrate&#x02013;electrolyte sport drink (5&#x02013;6% carbohydrate solution). They found that all were capable of promoting rehydration 1&#x000a0;h after dehydrating exercise and that treadmill performance during the rehydration period did not differ between drinks. Subjects lost ~1.7&#x000a0;kg (~2% of body mass) during the dehydrating exercise. Addition of 40 or 50&#x000a0;mmol/L of sodium chloride to a rehydration beverage reduced subsequent urine output, thereby providing more effective rehydration than a sodium-free drink; however, this did not improve performance 4&#x000a0;h after the end of the rehydration period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Similar to our study, another recent study reported that desalinated ocean mineral water taken from 662&#x000a0;m below sea level substantially accelerated recovery in aerobic power and increased lower-body muscle power after a prolonged bout of dehydrating exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The physical challenge protocol in that study induced a prolonged impairment of aerobic power (more than 10%) that was present for 48&#x000a0;h during recovery with purified water. We applied a similar physical challenge but found a smaller difference in VO<sub>2</sub>max between conditions (9%) 4&#x000a0;h after ADE. There is no obvious explanation for this difference. The VO<sub>2</sub>max values were similar in both studies: 45.8 in our study and 49.7&#x000a0;mL&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the study by Hou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Our participants were female physically active students, and their aerobic capacity may be considered higher because of the 10&#x02013;15% difference between female and male untrained persons, as well as athletes, because of morphophysiological differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. VO<sub>2</sub>max at the same fat-free mass is considerably (~30%) higher in sedentary men than in sedentary women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Mild hypohydration exacerbates cardiovascular and thermoregulatory strain and tends to impair endurance performance, but greater aerobic fitness attenuates these physiological effects. However, in a study by Merry et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], performance power was reduced by 13% in untrained subjects and by 7% in trained subjects without an effect of fitness (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.38). The effects of hyperthermia on VO<sub>2</sub>max and physical performance in men and women are almost identical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Women seem not to be disadvantaged when there is rapid and complete restoration of exercise-induced sweat loss. In the study by Maughan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], five women with a regular menstrual cycle exercised in the heat to dehydrate themselves by 1.8% of body mass at three different stages of their menstrual cycle (2&#x000a0;days before, and 5 and 19&#x000a0;days after the onset of menses). Beginning 30&#x000a0;min after exercise and extending for&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;min, they consumed the same quantity of the same beverage on each occasion. The acute replacement of volume loss incurred by sweat loss after exercising in the heat did not differ between different states of the menstrual cycle.</p><p>The question arises as to the reason for better VO<sub>2</sub>max recovery in our study when rehydrating with DMW. The maximum oxygen pulse changed in a similar manner as VO<sub>2</sub>max, but at 4&#x000a0;h of recovery it was 7% higher in the DMW trial. The oxygen pulse is significantly related to stroke volume but not to the arteriovenous O<sub>2</sub> difference in men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. One possible explanation is that stroke volume recovered better in the DMW trial and that this led to a faster and better recovery of VO<sub>2</sub>max. In humans, VO<sub>2</sub>max is limited by the ability of the cardiorespiratory system to deliver oxygen to the exercising muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It has been established recently that maximum heart rate and myocardial work capacity do not limit VO<sub>2</sub>max in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Munch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] found that limited left ventricular filling and possibly altered contractility reduce stroke volume during atrial pacing, whereas a plateau in left ventricular filling pressure appears to restrict cardiac output close to VO<sub>2</sub>max. The left ventricular filling may be associated with blood plasma volume. Experiments with plasma volume expansion showed that 200&#x02013;300&#x000a0;mL of plasma volume expansion increased stroke volume measured during submaximal exercise and, consequently, increased VO<sub>2</sub>max and performance in untrained men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Expansion of the plasma volume is a well-recognized early response to endurance training and is observed even as an acute response to a single bout of intense exercise. The onset of the phenomenon is extremely rapid: hypervolemia is observed within minutes or hours of the cessation of exercise. However, 2&#x000a0;days are necessary to reach peak plasma volume expansion after a marathon or ultramarathon run. The magnitude of this natural expansion ranges from 9% to 25%, corresponding to an additional 300&#x02013;700&#x000a0;mL of plasma. Hypervolemia can improve performance by inducing better muscle perfusion and by increasing stroke volume and maximal cardiac output. By increasing skin blood flow, plasma volume expansion also enhances thermoregulatory responses to exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The effects of plasma volume expansion or training on stroke volume or VO<sub>2</sub>max do not differ between men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Thus we suppose that this parameter recovered better in DMW trial ensuring better recovery of stroke volume and VO<sub>2</sub>max.</p><p>In our study, muscle power remained significantly reduced in the placebo trial but recovered faster and approached the control level 48&#x000a0;h after ADE in the DMW trial. CK activity changed in a similar manner in both trials and was elevated 24&#x000a0;h after ADE. Decreased muscle power and elevated CK activity indicate the presence of fatigue, which may be associated with muscle damage. Warren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] suggested that measures of muscle function such as strength and power are effective indicators of both the magnitude and time course of muscle damage. The exercise conditions that can induce muscle damage are unaccustomed exercise and exercise with higher intensity or longer duration than those to which the subject is adapted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Because a high number of concentric and, particularly, eccentric contractions are performed during long-distance running, the symptoms of muscle damage are usually observed immediately and a few days after a running bout even in experienced runners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Our participants included running exercise in their daily regular physical activity, and this may explain the modest increase in CK activity compared to Hou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] data. An unaccustomed running duration may be the main reason for changes in CK activity and muscle power in our participants.</p><p>The key components of DMW contributing to the observed ergogenic benefits are not known. In our study, the calcium&#x02013;magnesium&#x02013;sulfate DMW was taken from a depth of about 700&#x000a0;m and is characterized by enriched contents of boron, phosphorus, chromium, manganese, iron, and copper. Hou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] speculated that the effect of deep ocean water on accelerating recovery after fatigue may be associated with the attenuation of exercise-induced muscle damage. It has been found that the main supplements that seem to protect against muscle damage are the flavonoids, which are known for their efficient anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Howatson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] reported that runners who consumed tart cherry juice for 5&#x000a0;days before and 48&#x000a0;h after a marathon showed faster recovery of muscle strength and reduced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>However DMW used in our study as well as deep ocean water do not contain such components. Possibly the minerals and trace elements in DMW may work cooperatively to restore normal human performance. Snell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] reported that recovery was significantly faster when consuming a rehydration drink containing fructose, glucose polymer, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, amino acids, thiols, and vitamins compared with Crystal Light, while replenishment with Gatorade, which contains fructose, glucose, sodium and potassium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is possible that the different effects on performance between a rehydration drink and Gatorade may be associated with higher concentration of calcium and magnesium in the rehydration drink. This may explain the better recovery of performance in our study in the DMW trial because DMW is rich in calcium and magnesium. In animals, a lack of dietary magnesium leads to increased free radical production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and magnesium supplementation eliminates free radical production induced by ischemia&#x02013; reperfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Serum magnesium concentration and dietary magnesium intake are known correlates of muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. It has been recently shown that magnesium enhances glucose availability in the peripheral and central systems and increases lactates clearance in the muscle during exercise in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Hou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] also speculated that a higher content of magnesium, lithium, and rubidium in deep ocean mineral water might be associated with strengthened antioxidant capability against oxidative stress during postexercise recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In DMW, the content of boron (0.417&#x000a0;mg/L), which is now considered an essential nutrient for humans, is twice that found in human serum (~0.2&#x02013;0.3&#x000a0;mg/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Boron is known to attenuate the exercise-induced rise in plasma lactate concentration in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and to prevent magnesium loss in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>On the application side, we have demonstrated for the first time the benefit of acute DMW supplementation on recovery of performance after prolonged ADE in a warm environment. An imbalance between the loss and gain of essential minerals and trace elements after prolonged exercise in the heat may delay recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ingestion of DMW accelerated recovery of aerobic capacity and leg muscle power compared with ingestion of water alone.
