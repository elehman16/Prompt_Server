Considering the side effects of drugs and also increasing acceptability of psychotherapy methods in health systems, we aimed to determine the effect of group cognitive behavioral therapy on the quality of sleep in women with multiple sclerosis in 2014.
</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This study is a randomized controlled clinical conducted on 72 women with multiple sclerosis who referred to medical centers of Isfahan. After convenience sampling, participants were randomly allocated into two equal groups of control (n=36) and intervention (n=36). In the intervention group, cognitive behavioral therapy was performed in 8 sessions. The control group, along with receiving the common drugs, participated in 3 group sessions and talked about their feelings and experiences. Data were gathered using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and analyzed through independent t-test, Chi-square, Mann Whitney, ANOVA with repeated measure, using SPSS 18.
</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>There was a significant difference between the mean score of sleep quality of the control and intervention groups immediately and one month after the intervention (P&#x0003c;0.001). ANOVA with repeated measure test showed that the mean score of sleep quality of patients in the intervention group had a significant difference at three stages of before, immediately and one month after the intervention.

Therefore, the damages caused by this disease would target the productive forces of the society and hence everybody that lives in the society.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>The prevalence rate of the disease varies from 60 to 200 per 100,000 people in the United States. Iran is considered to be located in a medium prevalence zone for MS and its rates have dramatically increased in the past 20 years.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Sleep disorder is one of the secondary clinical signs of this disease and one of the complications caused because of central nervous system damage that involves more than 50% of patients. Therefore, these patients experience more sleep problems than general population and patients with other chronic diseases. Also, according to the results of previous studies, MS female patients suffer from sleep disorders more than males.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>
Sleep disorders in these patients could have many reasons and potentially start with symptomatic and immunological treatments.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Also, disease-related factors like pain and intensification of patient&#x02019;s physical and mental problems could induce poor quality of sleep in these patients. In mental dimension, anxiety and depression are the most important symptoms of the disease that could affect the patient&#x02019;s quality of sleep.
<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>
Thus, according to the results of some studies, by treating the anxiety and depression of patients with multiple sclerosis, their quality of sleep would be enhanced.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>
Disorders like insomnia, difficulty sleeping during the day, breathing problems during sleep, frequent waking (waking up more than once), and having difficulty falling asleep (falling time of more than 30 minutes) are some of the factors that could affect the quality of sleep.
</p><p>
According to the results of different studies, patients with sleep disorders are at risk for co-occurrence of other problems like vascular diseases, obesity and diabetes that would threaten the health of patients in long term.
<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>
Different methods are used for treatment of the patients&#x02019; insomnia, like tranquilizers or sleeping pills. Due to the complications and side effects of drug therapy, following psychotherapy methods that could reduce sleep disorder in patients with MS seems rational.
<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>
Cognitive&#x02013;behavioral therapy (CBT) has represented an innovative psychotherapy approach. Since its introduction which dates back to more than 40 years ago, it has continuously developed and overall it has been highly successful.
<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Regarding the conducted research, this type of treatment could slow the pace of the disease and delay the onset of perpetual disability.
<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>
Most of the patients with multiple sclerosis, due to their insomnia, have wrong thoughts and beliefs about sleep and their sleep disorders and these thoughts would lead to disturbed functionality, thus increasing the intensity of insomnia.
<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The main mechanism involved in the effect of cognitive behavioral treatment is its deep effect on patient&#x02019;s thoughts and beliefs about insomnia.
</p><p>
Cognitive behavioral treatment could reduce anxiety by changing these thoughts and beliefs and consequently reduce the symptoms of insomnia.
<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Also, using methods like stop thinking, distracting the attention and problem resolving would decrease negative thoughts during the day and at bedtime that could lead to decrement of sleep disorders in patients.
<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>
According to the literature about necessity of attention to quality of sleep in patients with multiple sclerosis on one hand, and insufficient studies aimed to evaluate the effects of psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy on sleep quality of these patients on the other hand, this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of group cognitive behavioral treatment on the quality of sleep in women with multiple sclerosis.

<italic>Study Design and Participants</italic>
</title><p>The present randomized controlled clinical trial study was conducted on two groups (control and intervention) in three stages of before, immediately and one month after the treatment process. 
<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Statistical population was all the women with multiple sclerosis who referred to neurology specialized clinics, including MS clinics of Kashani and Al-Zahra hospitals. After receiving recommendation letter from research council of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, the researcher referred to the study environment from June to August 2014. Samples were selected by convenience method from 100 women who had multiple sclerosis and referred to the study environment.
<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>The inclusion criteria were definite diagnosis of multiple sclerosis by a neurologist based on Mc-Donald criteria, passing at least 6 months from the time of diagnosis, gaining a score of 5 or more for quality of sleep based on PSQI, having at least diploma (considering the active and participatory nature of cognitive behavioral therapy and its daily homework), not being a medical staff (physician, nurse), not using other psychotherapy methods like physical therapy, acupuncture, yoga and psychotherapy sessions at the time of the study, no recurrence of the disease during the previous month, not having any diagnosed mental and physical (chronic or acute) diseases at the time of the study (like vascular or renal diseases, severe depression, dysarthria or hearing impairment), no previous participation in therapeutic sessions like relaxation or cognitive therapy in the past 6 months and gaining a score of zero(normal neurological tests) to 5.5 (Ambulatory for 100 meters, disability precludes full daily activities) according to Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and based on the patients&#x02019; records and consultation with their doctors. 
<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>The exclusion criteria were unwillingness to participate in the study, inability for regular participation in sessions (being absent for more than 2 sessions), and encountering severe crisis and stress during the study. 
</p><p>Considering formula, the mean difference, reliability of 95%, power of 80%, minimum acceptable difference of 0.7s, and 10% possibility of sampling loss, 72 patients were selected for the study. The samples were randomly allocated to control (n=36) and test groups (n=36) through minimization method. In randomized controlled clinical trial studies with samples less than 200, there is a possibility of significant differences between the control and test groups, so the aim of minimization is to minimize the imbalance between the number of patients in each group.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>
<italic>Instruments</italic>
</title><p>Data gathering tool was a questionnaire that consisted of two parts; the first part was about demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, age, marital status, educational level, duration of the disease, number of hospitalizations, job, income and stage of the disease), and the second part was Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire is a standard self-report tool that evaluates the sleep quality during the previous month.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This questionnaire&#x02019;s reliability was calculated in a study conducted in Taiwan (r=0.88). Also, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire in distinguishing between good and poor sleepers were 90% and 87%, respectively. Also, the internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s a) of the PSQI in this study was 0.66.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Reliability and validity of this questionnaire in an Iranian population were evaluated by Farrahi Moghaddam et al (2012) and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficient for all the subjects was 0.77. Moreover, when the general health questionnaire-12 was used as a measure of psychiatric morbidity, it was well correlated with the PSQI scores (r=0.54, P&#x0003c;0.001).<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>This questionnaire contains 18 questions in 7 dimensions of intellectual quality, delay in falling sleep, and duration of sleep, sleep disorder, consumptions of sleeping drugs and dysfunction during the day. Each dimension has a score of zero (not having any problem) to three (having a serious problem). The total score of Pittsburgh&#x02019;s sleep is achieved from the sum of the scores of 7 dimensions from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate lower quality of sleep. Score of 5 or more indicates undesirable quality of sleep.

According to the results, the mean score of sleep quality of patients in the intervention group was significantly lower immediately and one month after the intervention than before the intervention.
</p><p>A study conducted to evaluate the effect of sleep health trainings and behavioral therapy on sleep quality of some Japanese workers, similar to the present study, indicated that the group who received cognitive therapy had a significantly better sleep quality than the group who just received sleep health trainings. Also, this change was maintained in the intervention group 3 months after the intervention.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Also, the results of another study aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical cognitive behavioral therapy on the insomnia of cancer patients showed that cognitive behavioral therapy could be an effective and efficient clinical method to reduce the patients&#x02019; sleep disorders. The changes in sleep quality of patients continued for 6 months after the intervention.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> But the results of a research about the role of reducing dysfunctional beliefs in improving insomnia showed that improper beliefs related to sleep disorders could be reduced with cognitive behavioral therapy, but this change in beliefs could not have an important role in reduction of insomnia in patients.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The reason for this difference between the results could be due to the content of the sessions. In the present study, along with emphasis on cognitive therapies, implementing relaxation exercises and intellectual visualization at the beginning and end of each session and also doing exercises at home as homework had an important role in improvement of sleep quality in patients. Also, in the present study the mean changes of scores of intellectual quality of sleep, sufficiency of sleep, delay in falling sleep and sleep disorders at three stages of before, immediately and one month after the intervention showed a significant difference (P&#x0003c;0.05). In the similar study, patients who received cognitive behavioral therapy reported more decrement in delay in falling sleep and more improvement in sleep sufficiency than the control group and these changes in the patients&#x02019; sleep quality of continued until the 3-month follow-up after the intervention.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The results of another study showed that progressive muscle relaxation increased the total score of insomnia severity index and its dimensions including inability to initiate sleep, number of waking during the night and the duration of real sleep among hemodialysis patients.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Also, the results of a research aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of group cognitive therapy on symptoms of insomnia in women with chronic insomnia showed that group cognitive therapy along with drug therapy, in comparison to just drug therapy, has been more effective on the insomnia symptoms of patients with chronic insomnia. This result was relatively stable until 3 months after the therapy.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>Therefore, according to the results of this study, through cognitive behavioral therapy sessions, patients learned about cognitive distortions and negative automatic thoughts and strategies to encounter these thoughts and consequently learned that by using these strategies at different life situations they could feel more relaxed. Therefore, considering the effects of these thoughts in creating anxiety in patients and consequently reducing sleep quality in different dimensions, this therapy was able to improve the sleep quality of patients by improving the delay in falling sleep, intellectual quality of sleep, sleep sufficiency and sleep disorders. However, it seems that more time and sessions are required to have more effective interventions for sleep quality of patients with multiple sclerosis in dimensions of consumption of sleeping drugs, dysfunction during the day, and duration
of sleep.
</p><p>Limitation of this study included individual differences in response to treatment and impact of environmental factors which could potentially affect the patient&#x02019;s perception of cognitive behavioral therapy effects. We restricted the effect of these limitations by allocating the patients to the control and intervention group randomly.
</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>According to the results of this study, cognitive behavioral therapy, as an effective and cost-effective therapy, could improve sleep quality in patients with multiple sclerosis. Therefore, providing this type of psychological interventions in mental health care services for patients with chronic diseases like multiple sclerosis is suggested. Also, in addition to minimizing the limitations mentioned above, conducting studies with more samples and longer follow-up periods is recommended. Also, considering the results of this study, we suggest using inter-professional approach and partnership between psychiatric nurses and physicians in order to maintain and improve mental health of these patients.
