Then, the final flush was performed with 5 ml of 17% EDTA for 30 s followed by 5 ml of 3% of NaOCl for 30 s and then 5 ml of distilled water. The root canal was dried with paper points and obturated with GP and AH Plus sealer using the lateral compaction technique. The coronal access cavity was sealed with a temporary filling material (Cavit). All teeth were stored at 100% humidity and 37&#x000b0;C for 3 weeks to allow the sealer to set completely.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Retreatment procedure</title><p>The specimens were randomly divided into four experimental groups with 12 roots each.

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Removing all root filling materials is a prerequisite of nonsurgical retreatment as it allows subsequent cleaning and shaping and filling of the root canal system.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Of various available rotary retreatment systems, only MtwoR and D-RaCe have two files each, making these systems simple and easy to use.</p><p>D-RaCe rotary retreatment system consists of two files. DR1 (size 30, 0.10 taper, 1000 rpm) has a cutting tip to facilitate initial penetration of the filling material and is capable of coronal third cleaning. DR2 instrument (size 25, 0.04 taper, 600 rpm) has a noncutting tip and was used with light apical pressure until the working length was reached and is used for removing filling material from apical 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of the root canal. The space for dentine removal on the back of the blades is deep and provides sufficient space for the exit of dentinal debris, contributing to the superior removal of filling material.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] DR1 and DR2 were designed with alternating cutting edges as well as a triangular cross-section.</p><p>The Mtwo rotary system also has two specifically designed files with cutting tips for retreatment. Mtwo R (15/0.05 and 25/0.05) files were operated in electric handpiece at constant speed 280 rpm and torque recommended by the manufacturer. The depth of the space designed for dentine removal is increased behind the blades, which provides the space for dentine removal and leads to efficient GP and sealer removal. Its capacity for good material removal is due to its structure. The Mtwo R instruments with positive rake angles act more like Hedstr&#x000f6;m files and tend to remove bulks of filling material.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the superior root canal cleanliness after retreatment with D-RaCe is in agreement with R&#x000f6;dig <italic>et al</italic>., who reported that D-RaCe rotary system is an efficient device for retreatment.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the better cleaning efficacy of D-RaCe rotary retreatment files could also be attributed to the higher rpm used when compared to the rpm used for Mtwo R rotary retreatment files. According to Ruddle, removing GP requires higher rpms than for cleaning and shaping procedures. The advantage of using higher rpm is that speed creates enough friction that mechanically softens and augurs GP from the root canals.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The additional instruments are aimed to refine the root canal preparation, especially in the apical third, as the diameter of the apical retreatment instrument is normally in a clinical situation smaller than that of the file used for the instrumentation.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The retreatment systems in the current study are similar to the previous study;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] however, the other parameters such as sealant and solvent are different. A minimum release of formaldehyde was observed for AH Plus when compared to AH26. AH Plus is considered as gold standard due to its low solubility, less expansion, and very good sealing ability.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Solvents have been used to soften and dissolve GP in the root canal to facilitate its penetration and removal. Whether solvents are helpful during GP removal or not, is inconclusive.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Chloroform is a Class 2B carcinogenic material and its use with these retreatment systems had a negative effect on the removal of filling material.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Endosolv R is originally designed for softening hardened resorcinol-formaldehyde resin.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The use of Endosolv R as a solvent in the present study led to GP and sealer residue on the canal walls. The reason for residual GP and sealer could be attributed to the solvents ability to soften GP and modify its structure to a viscous and highly adhesive material, which makes it more difficult to remove.</p><p>The current results showed no greater efficiency of material removal when using this solvent. It could, therefore, be concluded that its use in retreatment with either Mtwo R or D-RaCe rotary systems might not be necessary.</p><p>In the present study, both D-Race and Mwo R retreatment systems were more efficient in cleaning the coronal third of the root canals. This finding is likely due to the variable taper of the instruments; furthermore, Gates-Glidden size 2 which corresponds to size 70, was used to remove 2 mm of filling materials from the orifice. The use of Gates-Glidden drill is the most effective technique for removing root filling material from coronal and middle part of the root canal system.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] According to Fridman and Moshonov, an increase in canal size decreased the remaining material.</p><p>In this study, complete removal of the filling material was not observed in all the groups. This is because of no chemical interaction between GP and AH Plus sealer, therefore, remaining sealer brushed on the canal wall might have increased the area of remaining material. This is in accordance with a study conducted by Schirrmeister <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The present study shows the maximum amount of remaining filling material in the middle third of the root canals. The middle third has greater compaction of obturating material and sealer. Moreover, greater sealer penetration into dentinal tubules at the middle third could be the reason for greater amount of remaining debris in the middle third.</p><p>Under the conditions of the present study, it was impossible to completely remove the root canal filling material regardless of the technique used. D-RaCe rotary retreatment instruments were significantly more effective in the removal of filling material from the root canals when compared to Mtwo R rotary retreatment system. The use of solvent in the present study did not improve on the removal of filling material from the root canals.</p><p>No instrument fracture was observed in the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitation of the current <italic>in-vitro</italic> study,</p><p>
