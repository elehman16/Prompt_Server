A major barrier to the implementation of effective psychological interventions in routine clinical care is a lack of cost-effectiveness data. This paper describes the planned economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial of a psychoeducational intervention for people with a history of melanoma who are at high risk of developing new primary disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Method and analysis</title><p>The economic evaluation is a within-trial analysis to evaluate the incremental costs and health outcomes of a psychoeducational intervention compared to usual care from the perspective of the Australian healthcare system. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be conducted, providing estimates of the cost to reduce fear of melanoma recurrence and the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Fear of melanoma recurrence will be measured using the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory and preference-based quality of life measured using the Assessment of Quality of Life&#x02014;8 Dimensions (AQoL-8D) instrument. The AQoL-8D will provide utilities for estimation of QALYs in the cost-utility analysis. Unit costs of health services and medicines will be taken from the Medicare Benefits Schedule and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme national databases. Health outcomes, and health service and medication use will be collected at baseline, 6 and 12&#x02005;months follow-up. The within-trial analysis will be conducted at 12&#x02005;months, consistent with the end point of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Approval to conduct the study was granted by the Sydney Local Health District (RPAH zone) Ethics Review Committee (X13-0065 and HREC/13/RPAH/86), the Department of Health and Ageing Human Research Ethics Committee (21/2013), the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (2013/595), and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Ethics Committee (EO 2013/4/58).</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12613000304730; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cost-effectiveness analysis</kwd><kwd>cost-utility analysis</kwd><kwd>QALY</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>Fear of cancer recurrence</kwd><kwd>Psychological intervention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We have performed a number of preliminary studies, including (1) a systematic review of the literature on economic evaluations of psychological interventions to inform cost drivers and (2) a pilot study of the intervention in three melanoma clinics to determine the feasibility and acceptability of self-reported health service use and cost-related data collection.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The protocol follows recognised guidelines to design and report economic evaluations nested in a randomised controlled trial and will include individual level data, which include objective measures of health service and medicine use, obtained by linkage to national data collections, overcoming the limitations of self-report.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In Australia, there is not an explicit willingness to pay threshold for reduction of fear of cancer recurrence in people with cancer, or an explicit willingness to pay threshold for a quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory clinical cut-off point has been validated in those with other cancers but not in people at high risk of developing second or subsequent melanomas.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A further potential limitation is the short duration of the trial, with cost-effectiveness being calculated at 12&#x02005;months.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Research supports the value of psychological interventions to enhance psychological adjustment, mental health and quality of life of people with melanoma.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In addition, guidelines recommend that psychological and psychoeducational interventions be offered as part of routine clinical care for people with melanoma.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Currently, however, there are no funded psychological support programmes for melanoma survivors during their post-treatment follow-up. A major barrier to the implementation of these interventions in routine clinical care is a lack of data on their cost-effectiveness. In a recently published systematic review, we identified only eight economic evaluations of psychological interventions in cancer, and only one (a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)) was carried out in the melanoma context.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Given the increasingly limited funding for healthcare resources, it is vital that psychological interventions be assessed for their impact on health outcomes and value for money. To facilitate decision-making, it is important to consider whether implementing an intervention is worthwhile given the incremental costs and incremental benefits that may be generated. The additional cost per health outcome considered &#x02018;worthwhile&#x02019; is based on willingness to pay thresholds as well as other key criteria, usually defined by government decision makers. An intervention that is cost-effective has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) lower than the funders&#x02019; willingness to pay threshold.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> An alternative approach to using the ICER is the net benefit approach, where a cost-effective intervention is the one with the highest net benefit.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Recommended best practice for economic evaluations of healthcare interventions is that they are conducted prospectively alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> We are conducting a RCT of a psychoeducational intervention for people with a history of melanoma who are at high risk of developing new primary disease (ie, a second or subsequent melanoma). To heighten the transparency of our methods and results and to enable a detailed description to be provided, we describe in this paper the protocol for a within-trial economic evaluation of the psychoeducational intervention based on 12-month follow-up data. The economic question to be addressed is whether the psychoeducational intervention is cost-effective from a health system perspective, compared to usual care, in reducing the proportion of participants who report fear of melanoma recurrence at a level warranting clinical intervention, and cost-effective in terms of quality-adjusted survival.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>Full details of the RCT protocol have been published.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In brief, the Melanoma Care Intervention Study was a two-arm RCT designed for people with a history of melanoma who are at high risk of developing new primary disease and who were attending one of three high-risk melanoma clinics across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. People attending the clinics have had a melanoma and carry an additional risk factor, either multiple primary invasive melanomas, dysplastic nevus syndrome (ie, many atypical moles) or a strong family history; alternatively they could carry a high-penetrance mutation in <italic>CDKN2A</italic> or <italic>CDK4</italic> (with or without a melanoma diagnosis). Recruitment for the trial was conducted between February 2014 and January 2015 at the Sydney Melanoma Diagnostic Centre, the Melanoma Institute Australia (both in metropolitan Sydney) and the Newcastle Skin Check Clinic, located in a regional, coastal area. Randomisation was performed, ensuring allocation concealment, using the telephone randomisation service at the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Clinical Trials Centre, The University of Sydney. Recruited participants were assigned an identification code and randomised using minimisation, stratified by high-risk clinic site.</p><p>The economic evaluation is a within-trial analysis to evaluate the additional costs and health outcomes of the psychoeducational intervention compared to usual care from the perspective of the Australian healthcare system. Economic evaluations are comparative analyses of alternative interventions in regards to costs, resource use and health outcomes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This protocol outlines the methods for an economic evaluation of a CEA and cost-utility analysis (CUA) to evaluate the cost per health outcome gained. The difference between the two analyses is the measure of effectiveness used. With CEA, costs are expressed in monetary units (eg, dollars) and effects in clinical outcome units (eg, additional people in whom the fear of melanoma recurrence&#x02014;at a level warranting clinical intervention&#x02014;is averted), while for CUA, costs are expressed in monetary units and effects in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. The health system perspective considers costs and outcomes relevant to the Australian healthcare system. This was informed by a recent systematic review of economic evaluations of psychological and psychoeducational interventions in cancer, which reported that the main drivers of costs were direct medical costs.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study population</title><p>All trial participants will be included in the economic evaluation.

First, the primary outcome of effectiveness for the CEA will be the proportion of participants who do not report fear of melanoma recurrence warranting clinical intervention, in the past month. Fear of new or recurrent melanoma was assessed using the Severity subscale of a modified (ie, melanoma-specific) version of the 42-item Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The FCRI was categorised into two levels: FCRI Severity scores within the &#x02018;normal&#x02019; range (scores ranging from 1 to 12) and FCRI Severity scores indicating a potential need for clinical intervention (scores ranging from 13 to 36).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A higher score is indicative of greater fear of cancer recurrence.</p><p>Second, for the CUA, the Assessment of Quality of Life&#x02014;8 Dimensions (AQoL-8D) will be used to measure health-related quality of life and provides utilities for estimation of QALYs.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The AQoL-8D is a preference-based measure, designed to record health-related quality of life in a format amenable to economic evaluation. It is specifically developed for interventions that aim to improve mental health, with norms for the Australian population by age and gender. It is sensitive to change after psychological interventions because it includes domains such as depression/anxiety, social function and self-esteem.

Potential differences in costs and health outcomes between the two groups and the 95% CIs will be presented. Since costs and QALYs are usually non-normally distributed,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> we will use generalised linear models<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> for adjustment of baseline covariates. The effect of the intervention will be estimated using a linear mixed model with random intercept, including time as a repeated categorical variable and adjusting for baseline scores (ie, baseline outcome scores will be included as covariates in the model). Baseline covariates will include age, gender, family income, education level&#x000a0;and marital status. CIs for the ICERs will be calculated using a non-parametric bootstrap procedure. Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS V.9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA) and Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Washington, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was based on the main study clinical end points, not the expected difference in cost-effectiveness. Sample size calculations were based on 80% power and a two-sided &#x003b1;=0.05 test. Since there was not a validated, accepted estimate of the minimal clinically important difference for the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory Severity subscale, we based the sample size calculation on a standardised mean difference (Cohen's d) of 0.5, which is a moderate effect size and is applicable to a wide variety of patient-reported outcomes.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Based on previous research (not yet published), the SD was estimated as 29; thus, the expected mean difference in the FCRI scale was 14.5. Using these values, and after taking into account the maximum expected attrition rate of 20%, the sample size required was 77 per group. Sample sizes based on economic outcomes are usually large in order to detect statistically significant differences due to the large variability in the use of healthcare resources and cost measures.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It was therefore not feasible for our trial to be based on the economic end point because of the relatively limited number of patients attending the high-risk melanoma clinics. To overcome this limitation in the evaluation, we will plot a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). The CEAC is a graphical representation of the quantification of the uncertainty around the expected cost-effectiveness, at different willingness to pay levels.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>CEA and CUA</title><p>The economic evaluation will use patient-level data on resource use and effects within the clinical trial period to assess the cost-effectiveness of the psychoeducational intervention compared to the usual care. Total and average costs for the intervention and control groups and the average cost per participant will be reported in disaggregated and aggregated formats. Total and mean outcomes (fear of cancer recurrence severity and quality-adjusted survival) will be reported for the intervention and usual care groups. For fear of cancer recurrence severity and QALYs, we will adjust for baseline values.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> ICER will be calculated and reported.

<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> For transparency of reporting and to enable a detailed description of the economic evaluation methods to be provided, this paper presents the protocol of a within-trial economic evaluation aiming to assess the cost-effectiveness of a psychoeducational intervention developed for people with a history of melanoma at high risk of developing new primary disease. This study will provide the first prospective, trial-based evidence on the healthcare costs associated with psychoeducational support for people with melanoma.</p><p>This study has several strengths. First, in preparation for the economic evaluation of the intervention, we have performed a number of preliminary studies, including (1) a systematic review of the literature on economic evaluations of psychological interventions to inform cost drivers and (2) a pilot study of the intervention in three melanoma clinics to determine the feasibility and acceptability of self-reported health service use and cost-related data. Second, this protocol follows recognised guidelines to design and report on economic evaluations nested in a RCT.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In addition, the economic evaluation will include individual-level data, which are preferable for economic evaluations.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Importantly, these individual-level data include objective measures of health service and medicine use, obtained by linkage to national data collections, overcoming the limitations of self-report.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Reliable economic evaluations are crucial to shape healthcare policy, in particular when the possibility of bias in economic evidence has been minimised by randomisation.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Economic evaluations of psychological and psychoeducational programmes are also necessary to inform decision makers and to promote the funding and implementation of these interventions in clinical care. A review of the literature found a scarcity of cost-effectiveness studies related to psychological interventions in cancer in general and in melanoma in particular.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The only previous study by Bares <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> was a retrospective economic evaluation of a psychological intervention to alleviate emotional distress in people with melanoma. The authors found an ICER of $402.37 for 1 point decrease of the Global Severity Index of the Brief Symptom Inventory scale for the usual care group, compared to an ICER of $7.66 for 1 point decrease for the intervention group (usual care+cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy). However, the study lacked methodological rigour in that the perspective chosen was not stated, not all costs and outcomes were properly identified and valued, and a sensitivity analysis was not conducted.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>A limitation of the proposed evaluation is that in Australia, there is not an explicit willingness to pay threshold for reduction of fear of cancer recurrence in people with cancer, or an explicit willingness to pay threshold for cost per QALY gained. However, an observation of the decisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee between 1994 and 2003 points to an &#x02018;arbitrary&#x02019; threshold of $A69&#x02005;900 per QALY gained.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In addition, the FCRI clinical cut-off point has been validated in those with other cancers but not in people at high risk of developing second or subsequent melanomas. Furthermore, the use of a clinical cut-point of 13 or above on the severity subscale of the FCRI has been proposed as the point at which people should be referred for a psychological assessment and potentially treatment.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, we would undertake a sensitivity analysis for the main economic outcome if future published cut-points were to differ markedly. Common to all cost-effectiveness analyses conducted alongside clinical studies, restrictive inclusion criteria and protocol-driven resource use among other factors could influence the external validity of the results.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Therefore, we will conduct a range of sensitivity analyses around key variables (cost drivers, total cost calculated with and without the cost of the intervention development, patient characteristics) to address the uncertainty around the ICER relating to the external validity. A further potential limitation is the short duration of the trial, with cost-effectiveness being calculated at 12&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The publication and peer-review of economic evaluation protocols alongside clinical trials is recommended to increase transparency and minimise bias.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This study aims to contribute valuable evidence about the cost-effectiveness of a psychoeducational intervention for people with a history of melanoma at high risk of developing new primary disease.
