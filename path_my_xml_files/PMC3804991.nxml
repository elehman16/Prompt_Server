exercises for the masticator muscles on the limited ROM and pain of temporomandibular
joint dysfunction (TMD). [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 10 men and 31 women in
their 20s and 30s. They were randomly divided into no treatment, active exercises and
relaxation exercise for the masticator muscle groups. The exercise groups performed
exercises three times or more a day over a period of four weeks, performing exercise for
10 minutes each time. Before and after the four weeks, all the subjects were measured for
ROM, deviation, occlusion, and pain in the temporomandibular joint. [Results] ROM,
deviation and pain showed statistically significant in improvements after the intervention
in the active exercise and relaxation exercise for the masticator muscle groups. Deviation
also showed a statistically significant difference between the active exercise and
relaxation exercise groups. [Conclusion] The results verify that as with active exercises,
relaxation exercises for the masticatory muscles are an effective treatment for ROM and
pain in TMD. Particularly, masticatory muscle relaxation exercises were found to be a
treatment that is also effective for deviation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Masticator muscle</kwd><kwd>Relaxation exercise</kwd><kwd>Temporomandibular joint dysfunction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Humans move the temporomandibular joint 1,500&#x02013;2,000 times daily, making it one of the most
used joints in the human body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
temporomandibular joint is a unique bicondylar joint which is used in mastication and
speech, and is critical for normal mouth function. The maximum mouth opening distance is a
generally accepted measurement of temporomandibular joint mobility and function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the movement of the temporomandibular
joint, the lower jawbone and the teeth should interact in alignment. In addition, when the
mouth is open, the normal range of motion should be 40&#x02013;60&#x02005;mm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup> Scott<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that the critical functional opening of the mouth is 35&#x02013;40&#x02005;mm. In particular, although the
lower jawbone should move in alignment with the teeth, when the movement of the
temporomandibular joint on one side is abnormal, an asymmetric movement can occur, in which
the mouth opens lopsidedly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Limited range of motion (ROM) in the temporomandibular joint can result from causes such as
excessive movement of the masticatory muscles, external injury, emotional stress, and
malocclusion. Rather than a single cause, a combination of various causes may develop the
symptom<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Limited ROM in the
temporomandibular joint can accompany symptoms such as pain, crepitus, headache, and
tinnitus. Such symptoms are called temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD). The main
symptoms of TMD are limited ROM and pain which are known to be experienced by 65&#x02013;80% of the
population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, quality of life
may be affected, with a negative effect on social function and emotional health<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A number of studies have investigated treatments for the motional dysfunction and pain in
temporomandibular joint, encompassing massage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, electrotherapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, active exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and manipulation therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Their results are also being applied in
clinical practice.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to identify the influence of masticatory muscle relaxation
exercises on the limited ROM and pain of temporomandibular joint dysfunction, to confirm
that excessive tension of masticatory muscles can be a cause of limited ROM and pain in the
temporomandibular joint, and to suggest treatment guidelines for TMD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study selected 10 men and 31 women in their 20s and 30s, who were had limited ROM
and pain in the temporomandibular joint or were feeling discomfort which their masticatory
function. The subjects were randomly divided into no treatment, active exercise and
masticatory muscle relaxation exercise groups. The subjects had limited ROM and crepitus
in the temporomandibular joint, but had no orthopaedic diseases, such as external injuries
or degenerative diseases, and weren&#x02019;t being treated with drugs or physical therapies for
limited ROM, pain or crepitus. In addition, the subjects were selected from amang those
who understood the purpose of this study and were capable of understanding and complying
with the tester&#x02019;s instructions. All subjects understood the purpose of this study and
agreed to participated in this research. All participants signed an informed consent
approved by the Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Weight and height of all subjects were measured. Then, each subject was assessed for
pain, deviation and ROM of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and degrees of occlusion were
evaluated. The range of joint motion of maximal opening of TMJ was measured in millimeters
as the distance between the median clefts of the upper and lower teeth using a
goniometry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. If it is less than 35
mm, TMJ is considered to have limited ROM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. To measure the deviation of TMJ, the subjects opened their
mouths to the maximum and were then photographed with a digital camera. Analysis of the
images was performed using the Global Posture System (GPS, Chinesport, Italy), a body
alignment analysis program. The deviation of the angle connecting the median clefts of the
upper and lower teeth was measured in degrees.</p><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Relaxation exercise of Masticator Muscle. A: before exercise, B: put the front

exercises on ROM and pain in the temporomandibular joints, and thereby suggest treatment
guidelines for TMD. Influential factors in TMD include gender and age. Specifically, women
and the age group of 15 to 45 are known to be at greater risk of TMD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study had more female subjects than male subjects,
31 females (78%), which substantiates that gender is an influential factor in TMD.</p><p>The major symptoms of TMD include pains in the masticatory muscles, tenderness on pressure,
joint sounds with jaw opening, and limited mandibular movements. The temporomandibular joint
is surrounded by ligaments, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The masticatory muscles which move the temporomandibular
area are composed of the temporalis, masseter, medial pterygoid, and lateral pterygoid.
These muscles enable mouth opening and-closing, lateral movement, and forward and backward
movement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, and excessive tension or
imbalance of muscles can limit the joint movements, possibly resulting in limited ROM, a
major symptom of TMD.</p><p>&#x000d6;zkan &#x00026; &#x000d6;zkan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated and
reported TMD symptoms including crepitus, disc displacement, and trigger points in the
masticatory muscles. Among the symptoms, trigger points in the temporalis, masseter, medial
pterygoid, and lateral pterygoid muscles were found to account for a high proportation
symptoms. Trigger points occur due to the muscle contraction induced by prolonged excessive
tension, and indicate the small segments within muscles, where tenderness on pressure and
pain exist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pain is a factor that
limits movement. Our results confirm that both the active and masticatory muscle relaxation
exercises reduce pain and increase ROM up to the normal range as suggested by Friction &#x00026;
Shiffman<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results also confirm that
both exercises are effective for pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>
and limited ROM, suggesting that ROM increased because pain was reduced. The increase in ROM
can be explained by the active exercise and the masticatory muscle relaxation exercise,
which involve opening and closing movements, being effective at pain reduction. The major
cause of TMD is known to be problems in the masticatory muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study also confirmed that limited ROM and pain, the
main symptoms of TMD, stem from the masticatory muscles. This study found revealed that the
masticatory muscle relaxation exercise resulred in a significantly greater reduction in pain
than the active exercise. This outcome suggests that masticatory muscle relaxation exercises
are a more effective intervention than active exercises for limited ROM and pain in TMD.</p><p>The deviation of the temporomandibular joint has been suggested to be the result of
imbalance in the jaw-opening muscles, or the spasm of the jaw-opening muscles on the side
opposite to the deviation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present
study, there was no change in deviation after the active exercise, whereas a statistically
significant decline in deviation was observed after the masticatory muscle relaxation
exercise. Consequently, we consider that masticatory muscle relaxation exercises are
effective for reducing the deviation of the temporomandibular joint, and that excessive
tension in the masticatory muscles is the cause of the deviation.</p><p>In a previous study, M&#x000f6;ller suggested that when the pain of masticatory muscles is
reduced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, the adjustment of relevant
joints is enabledincreasing its/their stability. In the presenr study, a relatively larger
reduction in occlusion was achieved through the masticatory muscle relaxation exercise,
implying that masticatory muscle relaxation exercises are an effective intervention, even in
the condition of deep bites.</p><p>Our results suggest that excessive tension in the masticatory muscles are a closely
correlated with pain, deviation, and ROM of the temporomandibular joint. We consider the
limited ROM and pain of TMD are triggered by excessive tension in the masticatory muscles,
and thus, masticatory muscle relaxation exercises and active exercises can be effective
interventions. The masticatory muscle relaxation exercise is static, and the active exercise
is active. The reduction of tension in the masticatory muscles suggests that static exercise
is a more effective treatment than active exercise. Therefore, masticatory muscle relaxation
exercise is more effective than active exercise at reducing pain and improving ROM.</p><p>The masticatory muscle relaxation exercise resulted in a statistically significant decline
in the deviation caused by unilateral problems in the joint as well. Moreover, this exercise
gave positive results in occlusion as well. Therefore, the results suggest this exercise
would be beneficial as a TMD interventional treatment in clinical practice. Our study
results have limitations in that they can&#x02019;t be generalized to patients outside the age
groups of the 20s and 30s, or to TMD involving lesions within the muscles. Thus, further
research will be necessary to complement the present work.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Mackowiak</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group>: Relief of pain from headache and TMJ.
