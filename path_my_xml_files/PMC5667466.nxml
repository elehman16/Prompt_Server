The severity of paranoia lies on a continuum, ranging from fleeting ideas that someone on the street might be laughing at us, to more elaborate and persistent beliefs (sometimes called persecutory delusions) such as that the secret services are trying to have us killed. Paranoia is one of the most common symptoms of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and is associated with significant distress and disruption to the person&#x02019;s life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This results in increased use of services, including inpatient admissions, and high costs to mental health care providers. Developing effective interventions for paranoia is, therefore, a clinical priority. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE; 2014) recommends cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp), including paranoia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, there are significant challenges to access, engagement, adherence and effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. CBTp has relatively high training and delivery costs, which limits availability. Even when it is offered, people may be reluctant to engage in therapy, and can struggle to remember what is discussed or apply new learning to daily life. Recent meta-analytical studies of CBTp have found small- to medium-sized beneficial effects on paranoia, and a pressing need to improve outcomes has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Our research team has approached this challenge in two main ways: firstly by adopting an <italic>interventionist causal approach</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] to increase CBTp effectiveness and secondly by incorporating <italic>user-centred inclusive design methods</italic> to enhance accessibility and usability. Our resultant new digital intervention, SlowMo, aims to improve the appeal, ease of use, memorability and clinical effectiveness of psychological therapy for people who fear harm from others.</p><p id="Par42">The interventionist causal approach to improving therapy effectiveness involves first identifying mechanisms that play a causal role in paranoia (e.g. reasoning, worry, negative self-beliefs, safety behaviours and sleep dysfunction) and then developing tailored interventions to target these causal processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These targeted interventions are anticipated to reduce paranoia severity through different pathways given the multifactorial causality of paranoia. For example, a recent randomised controlled trial of a brief intervention focussed on worry processes demonstrated that reductions in this mechanism accounted for improvements in paranoia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In contrast, SlowMo works by intensively targeting a certain type of thinking associated with paranoia, which can be thought of as <italic>fast thinking</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Fast thinking is characterised by focussing on too little information (&#x02018;jumping to conclusions&#x02019;) and belief inflexibility (high conviction in thoughts and a lack of consideration of alternative ideas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). It has been robustly linked to paranoia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Systematic attempts to modify this style of reasoning include group-based, metacognitive training (MCT) and, more recently, individual training (MCT+) developed by Moritz and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Whilst earlier findings for MCT were promising, more robust designs have not shown consistent improvements in reasoning, or paranoia at long-term follow-up, particularly for those with more severe difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">The SlowMo intervention builds on the important work of Moritz and colleagues and is the endpoint of a decade of development and testing in four studies targeting fast thinking in paranoia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The first versions of the intervention were tested iteratively, in three randomised studies and one case series, with developments over time in intervention content, duration and name, whilst always targeting aspects of fast thinking and paranoia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We found reductions in unhelpful fast thinking and improvements in paranoia severity. In an experimental study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] designed to examine mediation, we found preliminary evidence that changes in belief flexibility mediated improvements in paranoia. Most recently, in a feasibility randomised controlled trial, 31 participants with paranoia were recruited and randomly allocated 2:1 to the Thinking Well intervention or treatment as usual (TAU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The intervention involved face-to-face sessions with a therapist, initially working on a brief computer-based programme targeting reasoning biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] followed by four additional therapy sessions (with no additional digital component) aimed at generalising the learning to real-world situations. We found reductions in fast thinking (belief flexibility and jumping to conclusions) and promisingly large effects (effect size <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1) on paranoia severity. However, assessments were not blinded and the sample size was small. Further, whilst the acceptability of the intervention was high, participants suggested ways in which the intervention could be made more personalised, enjoyable and applicable to daily life. Our experimental work also indicated that people with more working memory difficulties and negative symptoms benefitted less from the therapy. This current iteration (SlowMo) shares the focus on reasoning of its predecessors (Maudsley Review Training Programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and Thinking Well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]). However, whilst previous versions of the intervention relied on verbal presentation of material using PowerPoint and pen-and-paper tools, SlowMo uses a website and app for interactive, multimodal communication of information, together with consistent use of normalising (everyday) language.</p><p id="Par44">Incorporating digital technologies into psychological interventions presents unique opportunities for improving outcomes, understanding mechanisms of change and reducing costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, to deliver meaningful change in health care, digital solutions need to be tailored to meet the specific needs of their users and to be trustworthy with regard to safety, privacy and effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To meet this challenge, the development of SlowMo therapy has involved a <italic>user-centred inclusive design</italic> approach. Inclusive design aims to address the needs of the broadest range of users possible, a crucial issue given the heterogeneity of psychosis. Our design approach was informed by the Design Council&#x02019;s double diamond method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which comprises the following phases: discover, define, develop and deliver. Importantly, stakeholders (service users, clinicians, researchers, technologists, innovation design engineers), including sampling of &#x02018;extreme&#x02019; users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], were involved from the outset, with iterative exploration, prototype testing and feedback informing the design and development of SlowMo.</p><p id="Par45">SlowMo aims to assist people with paranoia by supporting them to notice their upsetting concerns and fast-thinking habits, and then providing them with strategies to <italic>slow down for a moment</italic> in order to focus on new information and develop safer thoughts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It consists of an easy-to-use, enjoyable and memorable digital interface. Thoughts are visualised as bubbles, with different speeds, sizes and colours reflecting different thinking habits, intensities of emotion and coping tips. This simple visual metaphor aims to help people to understand that thoughts are transient, and that we can modify them by using coping strategies. Based on session content from earlier work, an interactive web-based app facilitates the delivery of face-to-face meetings. This is then synchronised with an innovative, mobile app for use in daily life, which is &#x02018;native&#x02019; (i.e. one that runs on the phone and can work offline). Feasibility testing of an early prototype has been conducted with acceptability, usability and enjoyment assessed through a self-report 10-item User Experience Survey, adapted from use in a previous study examining the feasibility of a mobile app for the management of psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The measure generates a mean percentage for each dimension of user experience, ranging from 0 (totally disagree) to 100 (totally agree). Results were extremely positive, with high rates of acceptability, usability and enjoyment (&#x0003e;75%). Participants indicated that they significantly preferred the digital interface to conventional therapy materials. This is particularly encouraging in the context of digital interventions given recent evidence that overall uptake of a therapeutic app for psychosis delivered in a naturalistic setting was low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Given these data on the digital interface, together with the proof-of-concept, feasibility and acceptability evidence from our four preliminary studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], we are now well placed to test the SlowMo intervention in a fully powered, larger, methodically rigorous, multisite randomised controlled trial.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p id="Par46">We aim to test the clinical efficacy of SlowMo over 24&#x000a0;weeks compared to TAU to determine the mechanisms through which it reduces paranoia, and to identify participant characteristics that moderate its effectiveness (either by moderating the degree of change in the mechanism, or by influencing adherence to the intervention). We will test the hypothesis that changes in fast thinking mediate changes in our primary outcome of paranoia severity. Consistent with our interventionist causal approach, we do not hypothesise that worry is a mediator, as it is not targeted in the SlowMo intervention, even though changes in worry did mediate changes in paranoia in a recent trial, when it was the treatment target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, we will examine any observed effects. In addition, we have preliminary evidence of modifiers of treatment effects that we will also take the opportunity to investigate. Using a randomised controlled trial design, we have selected TAU as the comparator condition. This is because there is a very low penetration of evidence-based psychological treatment in the NHS, and thus the key efficacy question to address at this stage is whether SlowMo confers benefits over and above standard care. An important secondary goal is to evaluate mechanisms of action; the trial hypotheses concern reasoning, and are best tested where the control condition is inactive with respect to the targeted psychological processes.</p><p id="Par47">The main research questions are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par48">Is SlowMo efficacious in reducing paranoia severity over 24&#x000a0;weeks, when added to TAU, in comparison to TAU alone?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par49">Does SlowMo reduce paranoia severity by improving fast thinking (reducing belief inflexibility and jumping to conclusions)?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par50">Do participant characteristics (i.e. their cognitive capacities, specifically working memory and thinking habits; and their symptoms, specifically negative symptoms) moderate the effects of the intervention?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par51">Does outcome differ by adherence to the intervention and is adherence predicted by the participants&#x02019; beliefs about their illness and about the intervention?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">Does the SlowMo digital therapy platform have acceptable rates of usability, acceptability and adherence?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">Does SlowMo lead to changes in the following secondary outcomes: other delusional symptoms, wellbeing, quality of life, self and others schemas, service use and worry</p></list-item></list>

Independent randomisation (centrally administered independently of the trial team by the King&#x02019;s Clinical Trials Unit (CTU)) will use an online system generating randomly varying permuted blocks, stratified by site and baseline paranoia severity.

Research workers will be blind to therapy allocation, to facilitate completion of unbiased and objective assessments. Adherence to the blindness procedure will be supported by the research coordinator and therapists having responsibility for the randomisation process and informing participants of randomisation outcome. Further, the blinding procedure will be explained to participants and they will be reminded not to inform research workers of therapy allocation. Breaks in blinding will be monitored and recorded.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Planned trial interventions</title><p id="Par68">SlowMo therapy consists of eight individual, face-to-face sessions, of 60&#x02013;90&#x000a0;min, delivered by trained therapists within a 12-week timeframe, assisted by a web-based app hosted on a touchscreen laptop, with interactive personal accounts and tasks. Initial sessions involve building the meta-cognitive skill of noticing thoughts and thinking habits (visualised as bubbles spinning faster or more slowly). People learn that everyone thinks fast at times, and this can be useful. However, thinking slowly can be helpful in dealing with stress and fears about other people. This key principle frames the sessions in which people are supported to try out tips to slow down for a moment, e.g. by considering the impact of mood and past experiences on concerns and by looking for safer alternative explanations. There is an emphasis throughout the intervention on practising the skills inside and outside sessions. Participants build confidence in managing paranoia, feeling safer in their daily life and working towards a valued goal. The overall session structure is fixed, but individual content is personalised throughout as participants record their individual worries, ways of feeling safer, key learning from each session, and a message for the week ahead. All of the personalised session content is synchronised with a native mobile app installed on a standard android smartphone to assist therapy generalisation into daily life. This allows people to notice their fears and thinking habits, and supports them to slow down for a moment, by providing strategies, encouraging them to audio- or text-record helpful new information and to generate safer thoughts. Recorded information is stored in a format whereby, when experiencing recurrent concerns, people can readily access what was previously useful. Optional notifications are available if people wish the app to check-in with them. The app is specifically designed for offline use, to minimise concerns about privacy and security. Participants are not given standardised instructions about when to use the app, rather the emphasis is on tailoring usage according to what is most helpful for the individual. Use of the app is monitored objectively through data input and system analytics.

A standard method of reporting will be employed, categorising events by severity (five grades, A&#x02013;E). Subject to the approval by the independent chairperson of the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC, see below, &#x02018;Research governance&#x02019;), investigators will also determine whether an event is temporally related to the intervention, and whether it is unexpected or unexplained given the participant&#x02019;s clinical course, previous conditions and history, and concomitant treatments.

The primary analysis will test for a treatment effect on the primary and secondary clinical outcomes. Random effects regression models allowing for clustering by both participants and therapists will be fitted to the repeated measures, controlling for treatment site, baseline paranoia severity and the corresponding baseline assessment for the outcome under investigation. We will allow for missing outcome data under the Missing At Random assumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]; we may also use inverse probability weighting to adjust for non-adherence to allocated treatment and other intermediate outcomes as predictors of future loss to follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].

These models preserve the basic mediation model by replacing observed variables with latent constructs &#x02013; the growth factors driving the temporal responses, M<sub>1</sub> to M<sub>p</sub> and Y<sub>1</sub> to Y<sub>p</sub>. Importantly, the mediational structure only applies to the slope growth or change factors since randomised treatments are independent of the intercept growth factors (baseline values).

We will begin by allowing for baseline values of the mediator and of the clinical outcome, as in the analyses of the successful EME Worry Intervention Trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

Improving the effectiveness and accessibility of psychological treatments for paranoia is a clinical health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The current trial aims to achieve this in two ways. Firstly, adopting an interventionist causal treatment approach, SlowMo therapy tackles <italic>fast thinking</italic>, which research has shown to play a key role in the development and maintenance of distressing paranoia. Secondly, incorporating digital technologies into psychological interventions presents unique opportunities for developing effective and accessible treatments. However, the adoption of digital technology cannot of itself guarantee effective therapy. We therefore used an inclusive design approach in the development of SlowMo therapy, with stakeholder involvement at each stage and a clear focus on addressing the needs of the broadest possible range of users, including sampling of &#x02018;extreme&#x02019; users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par94">Given the strong evidence for targeting reasoning as a treatment for paranoia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], our encouraging pilot data, and its inclusive user-centred design, SlowMo is expected to be highly acceptable and to lead to clinically worthwhile improvements in paranoia severity, working by supporting people to &#x02018;slow down for a moment&#x02019; and reduce their reliance on fast thinking. The data from this study will also add significantly to our understanding of psychological mechanisms and change processes in paranoia. As well as providing valuable information for treatment development, evidence of mechanisms of action will inform the theoretical understanding of paranoia in a way that may itself shape future therapeutic initiatives. The trial will provide data on whether characteristics of participants (including working memory and negative symptoms) moderate the effects of the intervention on fast thinking, and also the effect on outcome of an adequate dose of treatment and therapy adherence. From the perspective of digital health, we will examine the usability and adherence of a novel digital therapy, including an app for self-management in daily life in a large sample of people affected by severe mental health difficulties. Uniquely, the mobile app allows for monitoring of fast and slow thinking in real time and is, therefore, well placed to advance our understanding of its role in paranoia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p><p id="Par95">In summary, the SlowMo trial has the potential to inform future stratified medicine approaches, the development of more targeted therapies and the applicability of digital health innovations with this population.
