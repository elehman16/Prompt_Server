While several biochemical mediators have been implicated in RIC's mechanism of action, it remains unclear whether the localization or &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; of RIC affects the extent of protective signaling. In this randomized crossover study of healthy individuals, we tested whether the number of cycles of RIC and its localization (arm versus thigh) determines biochemical signaling and cytoprotection. Subjects received either arm or thigh RIC and then were crossed over to receive RIC in the other extremity. Blood flow, tissue perfusion, concentrations of the circulating protective mediator nitrite, and platelet mitochondrial function were measured after each RIC cycle. We found that plasma nitrite concentration peaked after the first RIC cycle and remained elevated throughout RIC. This plasma nitrite conferred cytoprotection in an in vitro myocyte model of hypoxia/reoxygenation. Notably, though plasma nitrite returned to baseline at 24&#x000a0;h, RIC conditioned plasma still mediated protection. Additionally, no difference in endpoints between RIC in thigh versus arm was found. These data demonstrate that localization and &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; of RIC does not affect cytoprotection and further elucidate the mechanisms by which nitrite contributes to RIC-dependent protection.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) refers to brief sub-lethal ischemia applied to an area remote from the organ being targeted for protection from a future (preconditioning) or past (postconditioning) ischemic insult. In practical terms this is usually achieved in human subjects using a blood pressure cuff placed on an extremity and inflated above systolic blood pressure (often 200&#x000a0;mm Hg), rendering the extremity ischemic for a period of 5&#x000a0;min prior to deflation (which permits reperfusion) <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. RIC was first shown to be cardioprotective in 1993 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and subsequent studies have confirmed that other organs such as brain <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and liver <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> can be similarly protected. RIC is attractive from a clinical perspective as it is minimally invasive compared to traditional ischemic preconditioning, which involves targeting sublethal ischemia to the organ intended for protection, and carries minimal risk and discomfort <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. While RIC has shown promise in preliminary clinical studies with surrogate endpoints <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and possible survival benefits <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, other recent large randomized clinical trials have yielded disappointing neutral results <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>The inconsistences in the benefit of RIC between trials may derive from a lack of understanding of how best to &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; RIC. The commonly used protocol of 5&#x000a0;min inflation-deflation of a blood pressure cuff placed on an upper extremity repeated for 3&#x02013;4 cycles has been adopted in clinical studies <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> without formal testing of the optimal dose or location in humans. Thus, it is unknown whether some or all patients would benefit from more or less than 3&#x02013;4 cycles of RIC. Further, it remains unknown whether RIC applied to an upper (arm) versus lower (thigh) extremity would alter the required dose or efficacy of RIC due to considerable differences in vascular and soft tissue mass in the arm versus leg.</p><p>One reason for the absence of a human dose titration of RIC is likely due to the lack of understanding of the precise mechanisms that underlie RIC-mediated protection <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Though a number of mechanisms have been proposed including neural and autonomic signaling <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, studies demonstrating that organ protection can be transferred from a RIC-treated animal to an untreated animal by the simple transfer of blood suggest that humoral factors are likely imperative to protection <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In this regard, Rassaf and colleagues recently demonstrated that nitrite, the one electron oxidation product of nitric oxide (NO), was significantly increased in the blood after RIC and necessary and sufficient to confer cardioprotection when applied to an ex vivo heart model of ischemia/reperfusion <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This production of nitrite was dependent on the reactive hyperemia (RH) that ensues during the reperfusion phase of RIC and due to oxidation of nitric oxide derived from vascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Notably, prior studies have shown that nitrite mimics the effects of RIC and mediates cytoprotection in a number of ischemia/reperfusion models, and this is due to its inhibitory effect on mitochondrial respiration in the target organ <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thus, the extent of RH and the resulting concentration of plasma nitrite generated represent a quantifiable parameter to measure the &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; of RIC.</p><p>Here we measure RH and plasma nitrite as physiological and biochemical signaling mediators of RIC and use these parameters to quantify the &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; of RIC delivered using sequential cycles of arm versus thigh RIC. We sought to determine whether RIC applied to a larger endothelial bed (thigh) would generate more nitrite than a smaller bed (arm) and whether consecutive cycles of RIC would further increase production of protective plasma nitrite. We measured platelet mitochondrial respiration in each subject as a target of the action of nitrite as well as utilized an <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured myocyte model of hypoxia-reoxygenation to demonstrate cytoprotection. We discuss our results in the context of further understanding RIC-dependent biochemical signaling as well as determining how to optimize RIC dosing in the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Human subject selection</title><p>The study was approved by and in accordance with the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from each subject.

Subjects were randomized to receive RIC applied to the right forearm or right thigh during week 1, with the procedure repeated on the other extremity two weeks later (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref><bold>A</bold>). After a baseline blood pressure measurement, the subjects were allowed to get comfortably seated and a blood pressure cuff was placed either on the right forearm or right thigh. An 18 gauge intravenous (IV) catheter was placed in the left antecubital vein (ie contralateral side from the RIC extremity) and was used for all subsequent blood draws. The extremity being used for RIC was secured to the contralateral extremity using cushions and tape assuring the subject was comfortable. This was to minimize movement and permit simultaneous imaging of both ipsilateral and contralateral extremities by laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI; Perimed AB, Jarfalla, Sweden) throughout the RIC protocol. The LSCI camera was positioned 20&#x000a0;cm over the dorsal surface of the feet or palmar surface of the hands for the thigh and arm occlusion, respectively. Tissue oximetry (StO<sub>2</sub>; Inspectra 650, Hutchinson Technologies, Hutchinson, Minnesota) pads where placed on both thenar eminences or both halluces for the thigh and arm occlusion, respectively. Stable baseline recordings were collected using the LSCI and StO<sub>2</sub> devices for one minute prior to the first cuff occlusion during which time a baseline blood draw (14&#x000a0;ml) was collected (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref><bold>B</bold>). RIC was initiated by inflating the blood pressure cuff to 200&#x000a0;mmHg to cause vaso-occlusion. This was at least 50&#x000a0;mm Hg greater than all subjects&#x02019; systolic blood pressure, measured at the beginning of each study day. The blood pressure cuff was maintained at 200&#x000a0;mmHg for 5&#x000a0;min with continuous monitoring of pressure through an in-line manometer. After 5&#x000a0;min the cuff was rapidly released permitting reperfusion, which in all cases could be verified visually by witnessed hyperemia. Additional blood samples were obtained four minutes after cuff release. LSCI and StO<sub>2</sub> recording continued until at least 5&#x000a0;min after the final cuff release.

To determine whether RIC modulates mitochondrial function, we next measured the platelet mitochondrial respiration rate in each subject after each cycle of RIC. RIC performed in both the arm and thigh significantly inhibited platelet basal and maximal uncoupled mitochondrial respiration, but had no effect on mitochondrial proton leak (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref><bold>A</bold>). RIC performed in the arm decreased basal platelet mitochondrial OCR from baseline values of 109.3&#x000b1;19.7 pmol/min to 72.7&#x000b1;13.5 pmol/min by cycle 3 representing a maximal inhibition of 34%. Interestingly, significant inhibition was still present 24&#x000a0;h after RIC. RIC administered to the thigh resulted in a similar pattern of inhibition of basal OCR with maximal inhibition reaching a slightly greater level than arm (41%; <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref><bold>B</bold>). Maximal uncoupled OCR was also inhibited to a similar extent by both arm and thigh RIC (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref><bold>C</bold>).

To determine whether the nitrite generated by RIC was responsible for the cytoprotection, PRP samples were treated with acidified sulfanilamide to bind bioavailable nitrite.

Our major finding was that physiological (RH and tissue oxygen saturation) and biochemical (plasma nitrite concentration) effects of RIC were not significantly different when RIC was applied to the arm versus thigh. Consistent with RH, we found that blood flow increases after each RIC cycle, and we extended previous studies to show that this results in a smaller but significant increase in tissue oxygen saturation compared to baseline in the ipsilateral extremity. On a biochemical level, circulating nitrite concentration increased to the greatest extent after the first cycle of RIC but remained elevated after subsequent cycles. Nitrite production was concomitant with a progressive inhibition of platelet mitochondrial respiration and a trend to increased superoxide production. Plasma taken from subjects after RIC protected myocytes from cell death in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of hypoxia-reoxygenation and the protection for plasma from cycles 1&#x02013;3 was dependent on nitrite.</p><p>Our data confirm prior studies noting that RIC results in RH <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and extend these results to demonstrate that increased blood flow results in a significant augmentation of tissue oxygen saturation. Notably, the increases in tissue oxygen saturation peaked later and were 10-fold lower in magnitude than the increase in blood flow. This may be a reflection of increased tissue oxygen consumption after ischemia which would limit the measurement of oxygen saturation or may reflect a more limited blood supply to the regions where we assessed tissue oximetry. It also must be noted that the duration of peak RH blood flow was brief with peaks lasting only several seconds and return to baseline (pre-cuff occlusion) blood flows within 120&#x000a0;s such that oxygen delivery is likely more reflective of the area under the blood flow curve rather than just the peak. The lack of increased blood flow in the contralateral extremity or changes in the nadir blood flow before the subsequent RIC cycle are consistent with this and imply that RIC is not causing a prolonged change in systemic blood flow, but rather having a discrete blood flow effect limited to the tissue bed undergoing ischemia and reperfusion.</p><p>It is interesting that we failed to see further augmentation of RH with multiple cycles of RIC or when RIC was applied to the thigh, which encompasses a much larger tissue/endothelial bed than the arm. These findings are consistent with those of Johnson et al. who showed in a murine model of RIC that increasing cycle number or performing RIC on two hindlimbs instead of one did not confer greater protection <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In our study, while blood flow did peak significantly earlier in the forearm than thigh, this may merely be a reflection of the distance from the cuff to the site of LSCI data collection. With respect to multiple cycles of RIC, it is possible that the 5&#x000a0;min cycle length achieves maximal dilation in healthy volunteers. Consistent with this, Raff and colleagues saw little increase in forearm blood flow (FBF) measured by plethysmography between 2 and 5&#x000a0;min of occlusion but noted a difference between 1 and 2&#x000a0;min of occlusion <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Notably, these authors did report an increase in FBF when the blood pressure cuff was applied to the wrist (ie forearm) versus upper arm <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, though differences in blood flow measurement methodology could account for this.</p><p>We measured RIC-induced increases in plasma nitrite of the same magnitude as previously reported by Rassaf and colleagues in healthy subjects <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Our results are consistent with NOS-dependent production of NO, which is oxidized to nitrite during RH <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. However, this is the first report that demonstrates that circulating nitrite concentration peaks after the first cycle of RIC and decreases with subsequent cycles. This is likely due to ischemic consumption of nitrite. Nitrite is a recognized endocrine reservoir of NO that can be reduced to bioavailable NO in conditions of hypoxia and acidosis, such as those present during ischemia <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Hypoxic metabolism of nitrite results in the generation of a number of NO-dependent species including iron-nitrosylated and S-nitrosated proteins <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, which are markers of NO production and can be responsible for downstream signaling. Prior studies demonstrate that RIC-dependent NO generation is maximal after 1&#x000a0;min of ischemia <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Thus our 5&#x000a0;min ischemic period potentially results in a net consumption rather than augmented production of nitrite. This finding leads us to wonder whether shorter ischemic duration or fewer cycles would actually increase nitrite generation at least in subjects with &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; endothelium.</p><p>The consumption of nitrite has potential consequences for the number of RIC cycles required to mediate cytoprotection. Though it did not reach statistical significance, plasma collected after the first cycle of RIC showed the greatest level of cytoprotection in our <italic>in vitro</italic> model of hypoxia-reoxygenation. Interestingly, though plasma from subsequent cycles showed significant cytoprotection, this cytoprotection appeared to be less dependent on nitrite (evidenced by the decreased effect of acidified sulfanilamide). We and others have previously shown that acute nitrite-dependent cytoprotection after ischemia/reperfusion is dependent on the S-nitrosation and inhibition of complex I, which decreases respiratory rate <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Our data for the four cycles of RIC are consistent with this mechanism as we show that platelet mitochondrial respiration is progressively more inhibited with each RIC cycle. While we did not measure S-nitrosation in this study, the consumption of nitrite is consistent with the production of S-nitrosothiols.</p><p>The data demonstrating that plasma collected 24&#x000a0;h after RIC also mediated cytoprotection is consistent with the paradigm that RIC mediates two temporal windows of protection <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The acute window (minutes to hours after RIC is administered) is traditionally thought to be due to biochemical mediators, while delayed cytoprotection (hours to days after RIC) is usually attributed to changes in gene or protein expression <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Our data suggests the presence of plasma nitrite is required for acute protection (cycles 1&#x02013;4), while nitrite does not have to be present to mediate protection 24&#x000a0;h after RIC is administered. We have previously shown that nitrite induces delayed protection through the production of mitochondrial ROS and subsequent upregulation of AMP Kinase, and we observe a trend to increased mitochondrial ROS production in this study. However, the protective effect observed with the plasma at 24&#x000a0;h could also be mediated by other factors including the release of high mobility group box-1 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> or adenosine <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p>Our data have potential implications for the interpretation of the recent neutral RIC clinical trials <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We recently showed that subjects with comorbid endothelial dysfunction show diminished RH <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and it is known that these subjects show minimal increases in nitrite after RIC <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Thus an alternative explanation for the failure to translate RIC to humans may be a failure to appreciate dosing requirements in the setting of health vs. disease. However, our data suggesting progressive mitochondrial inhibition with multiple cycles which persists at 24&#x000a0;h may suggest a more delayed effect could show efficacy in these subjects. Further investigation is required to elucidate the exact mechanism of RIC-dependent mitochondrial inhibition and its effect on delayed protection.</p><p>A limitation of our study is the inclusion of only healthy subjects as well as only Caucasian subjects. Prior studies suggest that blood flow regulation may be variable between subjects of different race <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. It is therefore important to replicate these results in other healthy and diseased populations to fully understand the effects of RIC which will be needed to achieve the optimal dose. Additionally, our study has shown that while nitrite may stimulate signaling mediating delayed protection, its actual presence at 24&#x000a0;h is potentially not required. Future studies should expand on this pathway. Notwithstanding the limitations we have demonstrated that RIC increases blood flow and tissue oxygen saturation after RIC. These increases correspond with augmented plasma nitrite which is associated with mitochondrial inhibition and cytoprotection. These effects of RIC are similar regardless of extremity used and suggest that while nitrite-mediated protection is maximized after the initial cycle of RIC, significant protection is retained with up to four cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><title>Sources of funding</title><p>This work was supported by funds from the <funding-source id="gs1">Pennsylvania Emergency Medical Foundation</funding-source> (FXG), K08-NS069817 (CD), the <funding-source id="gs2">Hemophilia Center of Western Pennsylvania</funding-source> (SS), R01-GM113816-01 (SS) and <funding-source id="gs3">American Heart Association</funding-source> grant 16GRNT27740024 (SS).</p></sec><sec id="s0095"><title>Author contributions</title><p>CD, FXG, JCR, and SS conceived, designed and directed the study.
