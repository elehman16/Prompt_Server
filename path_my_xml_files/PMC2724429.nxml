Arterial hypertension, progressive renal failure and flash pulmonary oedema are clinical manifestations of RAS requiring intervention and treatment and may be resolved by revascularisation therapy. In the past, RAS was under recognised, under diagnosed and under treated. With improved non-invasive imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging angiography, computed tomography angiography and high resolution renal duplex sonography, the diagnosis is currently more frequently established.</p><p>Atherosclerosis accounts for approximately 90% of cases with RAS and most commonly involves the origin and the proximal third of the main renal artery. In fact, ostial RAS can be considered as a combined disease of the aorta and the renal artery, rather than an isolated problem of the renal arteries. The prevalence of atherosclerotic RAS increases with age, male gender, traditional cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, disease, in particular aorto-iliac occlusive disease) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, the true prevalence of atherosclerotic RAS in unselected patients is unknown. In hypertensive patients, a significant RAS is observed in below 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], whereas a prevalence of up to 12% has been reported in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac catheterisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and up to 40% in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Undoubtedly, atherosclerotic RAS is a progressive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], as more than half of the patients exhibit an increasing degree of stenosis within five years after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and one out of five patients with a critical stenosis suffers renal atrophy and renal failure during this period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>RAS may be treated conservatively by so called best medical treatment, surgically, or by endovascular interventions using balloon angioplasty and stenting. Applying endovascular therapy, there is general agreement that ostial lesions should be stented as it improves primary patency rates and reduces the burden of reintervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The indications for endovascular treatment are a matter of ongoing debates. Curing hypertension by means of angioplasty rarely occurs, although the number of antihypertensive medication usually can be reduced after successful treatment. Currently three randomised controlled trials (RCT) on the effects of balloon angioplasty compared to medical treatment of RAS in hypertensive patients have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and a systematic review re-analysed the combined data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, there is still a lack of evidence concerning the indications for treatment in patients with hypertension, because each of these studies had severe limitations.</p><p>Targeting ischaemic nephropathy, according to single centre reports revascularisation could stabilise or at least slow the decline of renal function. However, none of the former RCT's was designed to analyse this clinical endpoint. The largest of these 3 trials &#x02013; DRASTIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] &#x02013; did not find any advantage of angioplasty with respect to renal function. Yet, interpretation of DRASTIC is hampered by a high proportion of cross-over (48%) from best medical therapy to intervention after 3 months of follow-up due to insufficient blood pressure control and an out-dated interventional technique (plain balloon angioplasty). Moreover, the study included patients with moderate diameter stenosis (50% to 70%) that are unlikely to cause haemodynamic compromise. Nevertheless, in the balloon group, an increase of GFR of 15 ml/min was documented whereas best medical therapy resulted in a slight decline of GFR. This result was insignificant as a consequence of small sample size; only 102 patients were enrolled in this trial.</p><p>Interventional treatment has been demonstrated to be safe, durable and effective at improving hypertension, slowing the progressive decline in renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and in cases also improving renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, angioplasty also bears the risk of inducing renal deterioration. Careful patient selection remains the most crucial point in renal interventions; however, current data are insufficient to give final recommendations on this issue. Even the just recently orally presented results of the up to date largest randomised trial (ASTRAL &#x02013; <underline>A</underline>ngioplasty and <underline>ST</underline>ent for <underline>R</underline>enal <underline>A</underline>rtery <underline>L</underline>esions presented by lead investigator Philip Kalra at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology ACC 2008) are hampered by a large selection bias of the enrolled patients.</p><p>This study (RADAR) is designed to compare the best medical treatment versus the best medical treatment plus renal artery stenting with the Dynamic Renal stent (BIOTRONIK, B&#x000fc;lach, Switzerland) in patients with haemodynamically significant atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. The key inclusion criterion is the proof of significance of RAS by duplex ultrasound in terms of significantly reduced intra-renal resistance index and extended acceleration time at the affected side. Both parameters correlate closely with an angiographic diameter reduction of at least 70%. This selection criterion should exclude patients without haemodynamically relevant RAS from study entry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>RADAR is designed as randomised, multi-centre, prospective study. Patients with haemodynamically relevant atherosclerotic RAS matching the inclusion and passing all exclusion criteria will be randomised to receive best medical treatment or best medical treatment plus renal artery stenting. Best medical treatment is defined as optimal drug therapy for control of hypertension (blood pressure &#x02264; 125/80 mmHg), of hypercholesterolemia (LDL &#x02264; 100 mg/dL), and of diabetes (HbA1c &#x02264; 6.5%).</p><p>The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical impact of percutaneous transluminal renal artery stenting (PTRAS) on the impaired renal function measured by the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) in patients with haemodynamically relevant atherosclerotic RAS. Furthermore the effect of PTRAS on renal function, hypertension and quality of life in comparison to medical treatment will be evaluated. Safety and efficacy of both treatments are further endpoints of this study.

At time of randomisation the patient's medical history and concomitant medication, clinical events and quality of life will be recorded. A 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement will be obtained. Renal stenting will be performed under angiography imaging. For patients randomised to best medical treatment the degree of stenosis measured by renal duplex sonography will be confirmed by MR angiogram or multi-slice CT where possible. Best medical treatment will be initiated at randomisation or post procedurally (for PTRAS arm only), and adjusted as needed at all visits. For all patients renal duplex sonography will be performed at baseline, post procedure (for PTRAS arm only), and at 6 and 12 months follow up. Clinical events will be obtained at baseline and during all visits including a telephone follow up 3 years after randomisation. Twenty four hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement and blood sampling for eGFR determination will be done at baseline, post procedure (for PTRAS arm only), and after 2, 6 and 12 months. Adverse events and concomitant medication will be recorded up to 12 months after randomisation. At baseline, 6 and 12 months patients' quality of life will be assessed using a validated general health quality instrument (SF-12v2&#x02122;). For further assessments see flow chart and table of events. Patients randomised to the 'no revascularisation'-group and presenting with a severe increase in serum creatinine concentration indicating the need of renal replacement therapy, or recurrent flash pulmonary oedema despite existing multidrug therapy (5 drugs), may receive a Dynamic Renal stent.</p><p>Only patients who have given written informed consent in accordance with the applicable regulations, the Declaration of Helsinki, GCP and ISO 14155 will be enrolled in the trial. The trial is conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medical (investigational) product. Significant device failure may constitute an adverse event if an undesirable experience occurs.</p><p>Adverse events information will be collected throughout the study in the Case Report Forms (CRF). Adverse events will be recorded on the CRF by the Investigator or a person authorised by the investigator. Event, date of onset, severity, duration, and relationship to device or prescribed drug regimen (see 5.7) will be recorded in the CRF. Any adverse events will be monitored until they are adequately resolved or reach a stable state.</p><sec><title>Adverse Device Effect</title><p>An adverse device effect is any untoward and unintended response to a medical device. This includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use or the deployment of the device. Also user errors that result in an untoward and unintended response are included. Adverse device effects information will be documented in the CRF as adverse events related to the device.</p></sec><sec><title>Serious Adverse Event</title><p>Serious adverse events are adverse events that</p><p>a) led to death,</p><p>b) led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that</p><p>1) resulted in a life-threatening illness or injury,</p><p>2) resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,</p><p>3) required in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation,</p><p>4) resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to</p><p>body structure or a body function.</p><p>c) led to foetal distress, foetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.</p><p>The Investigator must judge on whether each event meets the definition of a "serious" adverse event.

The safety and performance of these reference devices was demonstrated in clinical studies which together included more than 260 procedures. Dynamic Renal is equivalent to the reference stent systems (Palmaz Blue from Cordis Corporation a Johnson &#x00026; Johnson company and Herculink Elite from Abbott Vascular Corporation) due to its very similar design, materials and technical characteristics. Although the clinical behaviour of a stent system can not be entirely predicted from its technical characteristics or its similarity with established stent systems, it is justified to expect that the Dynamic Renal stent system will be equivalent to the marketed predecessor and reference devices during clinical use.</p><p>The Dynamic Renal stent is a tubular, balloon-expandable stent sculpted by laser from a single tube of L-605 cobalt-chromium (CoCr) alloy. The stent consists of circular segments at each end followed by a transition zone and struts arranged in a double helix in the middle. Each loop of the helices is connected to the next loop by 2&#x02013;3 (alternating) longitudinal struts. This design is broadly similar to that of the approved Dynamic stent system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The stent surface is fully coated with a layer of amorphous hydrogen-rich silicon carbide (a-SiC:H). This material has semi-conducting properties that efficiently prevent the electron transfer from fibrinogen to the metal surface in vitro. Thereby the conversion from fibrinogen to fibrin and it's deposition at the stent surface is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Additionally, a-SiC:H-coated stents exhibit a lower adhesion and activation of blood platelets and leucocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Finally, the release of potentially allergenic ions from a silicon carbide coated stent is substantially reduced in comparison to an uncoated metal stent. This coating is used on all BIOTRONIK coronary and peripheral stents produced so far and was evaluated in a number of clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Full information can be deduced from the applicable instructions for use.</p><p>The stent delivery system is based on a rapid-exchange balloon catheter. The stent is securely crimped on a polyamide balloon situated at the distal tip of the catheter between two radiopaque markers made of a Platinum-Iridium alloy. The proximal shaft of the delivery system consists of a polyamide tube (PA12) that incorporates a stiffening wire made of stainless steel (AISI 301) to improve its pushability. It has a single Luer port for connecting an inflation/deflation device to inflate/deflate the balloon. The distal section of the catheter comprises the inflation/deflation (balloon) lumen and the 15 cm long guide wire lumen which starts at the catheter tip and ends at the guide wire exit. It accepts guide wires of 0.014" diameter. The stent delivery system is compatible with guiding catheters with a minimal inner diameter of 0.070 inch (1.78 mm, 6F sheath compatible) or introducer sheaths of 4 to 5 F.</p><sec><title>Device sizes</title><p>The Dynamic Renal stent system is available in 16 different variants. The stent is available in lengths of 12 and 19 mm. It is pre-mounted on a delivery system which has nominal balloon diameters of 4.5, 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0 mm and usable lengths of 80 cm and 140 cm respectively that allow a femoral or brachial/radial access route.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study Committees</title><sec><title>Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)/Clinical Events Committee (CEC)</title><p>In this study, the DSMB/CEC is composed of five members (four physicians with sufficient experience in the targeted indication, and one biostatistician), who are independent of the conduct of the trial.</p><p>Based on the safety data, the DSMB/CEC may recommend to modify or stop the trial. The DSMB/CEC will discuss and classify all clinical events for later analysis. At the onset of the trial, the DSMB/CEC established explicit rules outlining the minimum amount of data required, and the algorithm followed in order to classify a clinical event. BIOTRONIK will compile clinical event packets when the necessary data are available from the investigative sites. They will provide this information to the DSMB/CEC. The DSMB/CEC will meet based on event rate accrual to review and adjudicate all clinical events for which the required minimum data is available. The Committees will also review and rule on all deaths that occur throughout the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Coordinating and Co-Coordinating Investigators</title><p>Thomas Zeller, MD, Department Angiology, Herz-Zentrum Bad Krozingen, S&#x000fc;dring 15, 79189 Bad Krozingen, Germany,</p><p>Marco V.

The lumen reduction of the lesion must result in a measurable reduction of kidney perfusion distal to the stenosis expressed by a significant reduction of the resistance index of the affected kidney. This reduction of the resistance index nicely correlates to an at least 70% diameter reduction by angiography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. With this strict inclusion criterion it is intended to randomise only patients in whom restoration of normal kidney perfusion should have an impact on kidney function and with this by modulating the renal hypoperfusion triggered humoral disorders also an impact of secondarily affected organs such as the heart and the brain.</p><p>All former comparative studies on RAS were more liberal with their inclusion criteria accepting even moderate degrees of RAS, e.g. DRASTIC included about one third of patients having a degree of angiographic diameter stenosis less than 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Even the recently at the Annual Meeting of the American College of Cardiology (Philip Kalra) presented so far largest study including more than 800 patients, the ASTRL trial, enrolled 25% of the patients with RAS less than 70% (range 20&#x02013;100%) diameter stenosis. Due to the inclusion of patients without haemodynamically relevant RAS and the small sample sizes (DRASTIC 102 patients), all currently published studies failed in proving a significant benefit of renal artery intervention on blood pressure control and renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Noteworthy GFR in the DRASTIC study increased by 15 ml/min in the balloon angioplasty group whereas it slightly decreased by 1 ml/min in the control arm. However, the study was not powered adequately to show a significant difference. The sample size calculation for the present study was based on a recently published pilot study (PRECISON [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]) for the trial and the so far reported controlled trial data. Enrolling in total 300 patients in a 1:1 randomised fashion we expect a significant difference in the primary study endpoint, the difference between treatments in change of eGFR over 12 months.</p><p>Renal function is one of the most powerful predictors of survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Another one is left ventricular hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]; the analysis of the course of left ventricular mass index is also included as a secondary endpoint because the reducing the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system by RAS revascularisation should lead to a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Affecting these major endpoints, renal function and left ventricular hypertrophy, RAS stenting should also impact the composite clinical endpoint of patient survival, hospitalisation and end-stage renal failure after 3 years.</p><p>Provided a timely initiation of all study sites it is expected to finish patient enrolment within 1 year so that the analysis of the primary endpoint should be available in 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the strict physiological definition based on reduction of the resistance index, including only patients with haemodynamically relevant RAS and on enrolling in total 300 patients in a 1:1 randomised fashion the expected outcome of the study is a significant difference in the primary study endpoint, the difference between treatments in change of eGFR over 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>": Inch; 24h-BP: blood pressure obtained during 24 hour continuous assessment; ADE: Adverse device effect; AE: Adverse event; ASA: acetylic salicylic acid; a-SiC:H: amorphous hydrogen-rich silicon carbide; BMT: Best Medical Treatment; BP: blood pressure; CEC: Clinical Event Committee; cm: centimetre; CoCr: Cobalt chromium; CRF: Case report form; CT: Computerized tomography; DDD: defined daily dose according to WHO drug dictionary; dL: decilitre; &#x00394;RI: difference in RI between the two kidneys; DSMB: Data Safety Monitoring Board; ECHO: Echocardiogram; eGFR: estimated GFR; g: gram; F: French; g/m<sup>2</sup>: gram per square meter; GFR: glomerular filtration rate (in this study the eGFR will be used); HbA1c: hemoglobin A1c; ICD: International Classification of Disease; i.e.: <italic>id est </italic>(that is); IEC: Independent Ethic Committee; INR: International normalized ratio; IRB: Institutional Review Board; ITT: intention to treat; LDL: low density lipoprotein; LVMI: left ventricular mass index; m<sup>2</sup>: square meter; MACCE: Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebral Events; MDRD: Modification of diet in Renal Disease (study); mg: milligram; min: minute; ml: millilitre; mm: millimetre; mmHg: Milliliters of mercury; MR: Magnetic resonance; NYHA: New York heart association; PAD: peripheral artery disease; PTRA: percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty; PTRAS: percutaneous transluminal renal arterial stenting; RAS: renal artery stenosis; RCT: Randomised controlled trial; RDS: renal duplex sonography; RI: resistance index; RVD: reference vessel diameter; SADE: Serious adverse device effect; SAE: Serious adverse event; SCr: serum creatinine; sec: Second; TLR: target lesion revascularization; TVR: target vessel revascularization; U: Unit; WHO: World Health Organization.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>The draft of the manuscript was prepared by Uwe Schwarzw&#x000e4;lder and Michael Hauk and finally approved by Thomas Zeller.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Sandra Hujer (Clinical Project Manager Biotronic AG, Ackerstrasse 6, B&#x000fc;lach, Switzerland) for her critical review of the manuscript.
