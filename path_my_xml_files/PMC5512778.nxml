These two vaccines have similar measles and rubella strains, but different mumps strains (Hoshino in Cadila MMR vaccine, and L-Zagreb in Serum MMR vaccine). Three hundred and twenty-eight subjects of either sex, aged 15&#x02013;18&#x000a0;months, were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either the Cadila or Serum MMR vaccine. Immunogenicity assessments (IgG antibodies against measles, mumps, and rubella viruses) were done at baseline and 42&#x000a0;d after vaccination. Solicited (local and systemic) and unsolicited adverse events were recorded for up to 42&#x000a0;d following vaccination. The Cadila MMR vaccine was found to be non-inferior to the Serum MMR vaccine in terms of end-of-study proportion of subjects seropositive for anti-measles antibodies (100.0% in both groups), anti-mumps antibodies (94.5% vs. 94.0%), and anti-rubella antibodies (95.5% vs. 91.0%). Both vaccines were well tolerated by all study participants; the most common adverse event reported in both groups was fever, followed by rash. The results of this phase III clinical trial show that the novel Cadila MMR vaccine is non-inferior to the Serum MMR vaccine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Cadila Healthcare Limited</kwd><kwd>Hoshino mumps strain</kwd><kwd>novel vaccine</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>MMR vaccine</kwd><kwd>measles</kwd><kwd>mumps</kwd><kwd>rubella</kwd><kwd>Serum Institute of India limited</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="6"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="22"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Measles, mumps, and rubella are viral diseases associated with significant morbidity and mortality in children.

We assigned 216 subjects to the Cadila group and 112 subjects to the Serum group in a 2:1 ratio. Within the Cadila group, we assigned 108 subjects each to the Cadila single-dose group and the Cadila multi-dose group. All 216 of the Cadila group subjects completed their post vaccination 30-minute observation period and were thus considered for safety analysis. Fifteen Cadila subjects did not complete the study as per the protocol; hence, 201 subjects were considered for the per protocol immunogenicity analysis (101 in the Cadila single-dose group, and 100 in the Cadila multi-dose group). Among the 112 subjects in the Serum group, 100 were considered for the per protocol immunogenicity analysis, and all 112 were considered for safety analysis.

The Cadila MMR vaccine contains the Edmonston-Zagreb measles strain, the Hoshino mumps strain and the RA 27/3 rubella strain. The Hoshino mumps strain has been combined with AIK-C measles strain and the Takahashi rubella strain in Japan and Iran,<sup>6--9</sup> but it is the first time that it has been combined with the Edmonston-Zagreb measles strain and the RA 27/3 rubella strain in this novel vaccine. This study is the first to compare an MMR vaccine containing the Hoshino mumps strain with a WHO pre-qualified MMR vaccine.</p><p>The immunogenicity results of this study show that the Cadila MMR vaccine is non-inferior to the Serum MMR vaccine with respect to the proportion of subjects seropositive at the end of the study and the seroconversion rates for all three viral strains. Both the single-dose and multi-dose formulations of the Cadila MMR vaccine are similar to each other, and non-inferior to the Serum MMR vaccine. Moreover, the GMTs of both anti-rubella and anti-mumps antibodies are similar in the two groups, but the GMT of anti-measles antibodies is significantly greater in the Cadila group than in the Serum group. This greater rise in the anti-measles antibodies with Cadila MMR vaccine could be attributed to the higher release potency of its measles component (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0005">Table&#x000a0;5</xref>). However, there could also be a possibility of interference of the L-Zagreb strain of mumps on the immune response of the measles strain. This effect would need to be confirmed in large adequately designed clinical studies.

In one such previous clinical trial comparing the GSK MMR vaccine with the Merck MMR vaccine, the GMT for anti-measles antibodies was 2342.5&#x000a0;mIU/mL with the GSK MMR and 2548.8&#x000a0;mIU/mL with the Merck MMR vaccine.

The serum IgG antibody titers against the measles, mumps, or rubella viruses were assessed by commercial ELISA kits manufactured by IBL International, Germany. The assay cut-offs were as follows: 200&#x000a0;mIU/mL for anti-measles antibodies, 8 EU/mL for anti-mumps antibodies and 8 IU/mL for anti-rubella antibodies. <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18-20</sup></xref> An antibody titer equal to or greater than the cut-off was defined as seropositive. In initially seronegative subjects, seroconversion was defined as appearance of antibody levels above the cut-off levels. The geometric mean of the post vaccination anti-measles, anti-mumps, and anti-rubella antibody titers was calculated for all subjects considered for immunogenicity analysis at the end of the study.</p><p>Diary cards were provided to the parents or guardians of the enrolled subjects to record solicited local adverse events (pain, redness, or swelling) for 7&#x000a0;d and systemic adverse events (fever or rash) for 14&#x000a0;d following vaccination. All other adverse events recorded during the first 2&#x000a0;weeks after vaccination, or any adverse event noted after the first two weeks, were recorded as unsolicited adverse events. The adverse events were graded from grade 1 to grade 3 based on the severity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0006">Table&#x000a0;6</xref>). The causality of the adverse events was assessed using the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) criteria.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>

</p></sec><sec id="s0004-0004"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary immunogenicity variable was the proportion of subjects who are seropositive at the end of the study. The Cadila MMR vaccine was considered non-inferior to the Serum MMR vaccine if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI of the difference between the proportion of subjects seropositive at the end of the study (Cadila group&#x02013;Serum group) was not less than &#x02212;10 percentage points. The secondary immunogenicity variables were the Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) at the end of the study and the seroconversion rate. GMTs were calculated by taking the antilog of the mean of the log transformed antibody titers. The unpaired t-test was used to compare the log-transformed data of the antibody titers of the two groups. <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Non-inferiority comparison was made for the seroconversion rate as mentioned above.</p><p>The data for the Cadila group were sub-grouped into Cadila single-dose and Cadila multi-dose groups. The proportion of subjects seropositive at the end of the study and the seroconversion rates were compared between the two groups using the Chi-square and Fischer's exact tests, and the GMTs were compared using the unpaired t-test. The data from the Cadila single-dose and Cadila multi-dose groups were compared to the Serum group data for non-inferiority.</p><p>Immunogenicity assessments were done both for the Per Protocol (PP) Population (defined as all randomized subjects who had completed the trial with no violations, as per the protocol, with both pre- and post-vaccination immunological assessments) and the modified Intention to Treat (mITT) Population (defined as all the randomized subjects with both pre- and post-vaccination immunological assessments, including subjects with protocol violations).</p><p>The PP analysis was considered definitive and has been presented in the Results section. The safety population included all subjects who were administered the study vaccine and had been available for a 30&#x000a0;minute observation period for safety assessment.</p><p>A sample size of 261 subjects (174 in the Cadila group and 87 in the Serum group) had sufficient power ( &#x0003e; 80%) to demonstrate non-inferiority with a margin of 10%, and an expected responder rate (proportion of subjects seropositive at the end of the study) of 92% for each strain. Considering a dropout rate of 20%, a total of 327 subjects were to be enrolled in the study (218 in the Cadila group and 109 in the Serum group). The 218 in the Cadila group were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the Cadila single-dose group or the Cadila multi-dose group.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec><title>Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest</title><p>The authors declare that no potential conflict of interest exists with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was sponsored and funded by Cadila Healthcare Limited, India.
