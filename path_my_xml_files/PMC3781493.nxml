Hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes results from a combination of insulin resistance in several insulin target tissues (including liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue) and &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The relative contribution of these two defects to the pathogenesis of diabetes continues to be debated. Longitudinal studies in high-risk individuals seem to indicate that insulin resistance is an early phenomenon, occurring years before any evidence of glucose intolerance, whereas &#x003b2;-cell failure develops later in the pathogenesis of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, most of the genetic loci associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, identified in genome-wide association studies, encode proteins involved in the insulin secretion pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>The development of new insulin sensitizers appears critical for an optimal therapeutic management of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance&#x02013;associated diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Metformin and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are the two classes of insulin sensitizers available on the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The mechanism of action of metformin, currently used as the first-line drug in type 2 diabetes, remains poorly understood. Whereas metformin effectively reduces gluconeogenesis and hepatic glucose production, its effect on peripheral insulin resistance remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). TZDs are ligands for the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor (PPAR) &#x003b3;, which improve both hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, TZDs are highly debated because of the occurrence of several adverse events (AEs) such as body weight gain, fluid retention, congestive heart failure, bone fractures, and possibly bladder cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>The PPAR nuclear receptor subfamily is composed of three members, PPAR&#x003b1;, PPAR&#x003b3;, and PPAR&#x003b4; (also known as PPAR&#x003b2;). PPAR&#x003b1;, the target of the hypolipidemic fibrates, is highly expressed in liver parenchymal cells, where it controls genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, PPAR&#x003b1; agonists, such as fenofibrate, do not influence glucose homeostasis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). PPAR&#x003b4; is widely expressed and plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, fatty acid oxidation, and insulin sensitivity in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In humans, 2-week clinical studies in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and moderately overweight subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) demonstrated that the synthetic PPAR&#x003b4; agonist GW501516 improves dyslipidemia (reducing plasma triglycerides [TGs] and increasing HDL cholesterol) and glucose metabolism (decreasing plasma insulin), whereas liver fat content was reduced.</p><p>GFT505 and its main active circulating metabolite, GFT1007, are PPAR modulators with preferential activity on human PPAR&#x003b1; in vitro (half-maximal effective concentration [EC<sub>50</sub>]: 45 nmol/L for GFT505 and 15 nmol/L for GFT1007 compared with &#x02248;30 &#x003bc;mol/L for fenofibrate), with additional activity on human PPAR&#x003b4; (EC<sub>50</sub>: 175 nmol/L for GFT505 and 75 nmol/L for GFT1007 compared with 1 nmol/L for GW501516). Studies in rodents indicated that both GFT505 and GFT1007 undergo extensive enterohepatic cycling and are liver-targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated that GFT505 treatment improves several metabolic parameters, including fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), in abdominally obese patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). To further assess the effect of GFT505 on insulin sensitivity, we performed a placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study in abdominally obese male subjects using the gold standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method. Moreover, the effect of GFT505 was assessed on several other metabolic parameters, including plasma lipids and liver enzymes.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Clinical study design</title><p>A multicenter, randomized, single-blind (subject), placebo-controlled, crossover study was performed between 18 January 2011 (first patient, first visit) and 28 November 2011 (last patient, last visit) with GFT505 (2-[2,6 dimethyl-4-[3-[4-(methylthio)phenyl]-3-oxo-1(E)-propenyl]phenoxyl]-2-methylpropanoic acid), 80 mg (4 capsules of 20 mg each once daily before breakfast) in male patients aged 18&#x02013;75 years (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2012/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link> for the study design). The duration of each treatment period was 8 weeks, separated by a 6-week wash-out period. The randomization was stratified by site (Center of Clinical Investigation Nantes and Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Rh&#x000f4;ne Alpes). The primary objective was to evaluate in each patient the differences in glucose infusion rate (GIR) measured at the second step of a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp performed at the end of each 8-week treatment period with GFT505 or placebo. The secondary objectives included the evaluation of differences in basal and insulin-suppressed endogenous glucose production (EGP), FPG, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, plasma lipids including free fatty acids (FFA), liver enzymes, and inflammatory markers at the end of each treatment period. Gene expression (mRNA) was analyzed in muscle tissue biopsy specimens collected once at the end of the first treatment period in the two groups.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: waist circumference &#x02265;94 cm; BMI &#x02264;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; and HOMA-IR (FPG [mmol/L] &#x000d7; fasting plasma insulin [&#x000b5;UI/mL]/22.5) &#x0003e;3. Patients had to be consuming stable diets and performing physical exercise within 3 months before screening. Main exclusion criteria were uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &#x0003e;160&#x02013;95 mmHg), known heart failure (New York Heart Association stage I&#x02013;IV), acute cardiovascular episode 6 months before the start of the study, diabetes mellitus, history of bariatric surgery, and excessive alcohol consumption (&#x0003e;3 alcoholic beverage/day). Biochemical exclusion criteria included fasting plasma TG &#x0003e;400 mg/dL or LDL cholesterol concentration &#x0003e;220 mg/dL, thyroid-stimulating hormone more than twice the upper limit of normal, chronic renal failure (creatinine clearance &#x0003c;60 mL/min according to Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula or serum creatinine &#x0003e;180 &#x000b5;mol/L), active liver disease or hepatic dysfunction as defined by elevations in liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase, and &#x003b3;-glutamyltransferase [&#x003b3;GT] more than three-times the upper limit of normal), and unexplained serum creatine phosphokinase more than twice the upper limit of normal. Hypolipidemic drugs were not permitted, except statins (except fluvastatin) or ezetimibe, if the dose had been constant and stable at least for 3 months before screening and remained constant during the study.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps</title><p>Insulin sensitivity was assessed after each treatment period by using the two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure according to DeFronzo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). After an overnight fast, the subjects were admitted to each center (0800 h) and fitted with intravenous catheters placed into the veins in one forearm for insulin and glucose infusion and in the other forearm for blood sampling. The GIR was adjusted according to arterialized blood glucose samples measured every 5&#x02013;10 min to maintain euglycemia (5.0 &#x000b1; 0.5 mmol/L). After a basal period of 2 h, two different flow rates of insulin were used successively: 0.2 mU&#x022c5;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x022c5;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for the first 2 h and 1.0 mU&#x022c5;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x022c5;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for the last 2 h. Blood samplings were collected each 10 min during the last 30 min of basal period and each insulin infusion step of the clamp to determine glycemia, insulinemia, plasma FFA, TGs, and glucose isotopic enrichment in <sup>2</sup>H. The use of nonradioactive glucose tracer (deuterated glucose [6,6 <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]-glucose; Eurisotop, St. Aubin, France) during the clamp allowed to measure the rate of glucose appearance (Ra) in basal condition and during the steady state of each insulin infusion period. During the basal period, the amount of tracer infused was based on weight and glycemia of the subject. It included an initial bolus, adjusted by the basal glycemia (FPG [g/L] &#x000d7; 80 &#x000d7; base flow), followed by a constant base flow corresponding to 1% of the theoretical rate of glucose disappearance (3 mg&#x022c5;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x022c5;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). During the hyperinsulinemic clamp, the infusion rate of tracer [6.6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]-glucose was adapted to glucose infusion to maintain a constant ratio between the labeled glucose and the unlabeled glucose (1%), corresponding to 0.03 (first step) and 0.08 (second step) mg&#x022c5;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x022c5;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The exact quantity of tracer infused was determined by weighing the syringe at the beginning and the end of the test.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Calculations</title><p>The average rate of glucose infused at steady state of the first level (90&#x02013;120 min) and the second level (210&#x02013;240 min) of the clamp is called GIR and is expressed in mg&#x022c5;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x022c5;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Flow measurement of glucose turnover was measured in the final 20 min of the basal period (calculations for times &#x02212;20, &#x02212;10, and 0). With glycemia stable, the Ra corresponds to the basal peripheral glucose utilization (Rd) and also to the EGP. EGP (expressed in mg/kg&#x022c5;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was calculated by the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ1"><graphic xlink:href="2923equ1"/></disp-formula>With F indicating flow rate of glucose infused (mg/kg&#x022c5;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and MR indicating molar ratio tracer/traced (MR% deuterated glucose/natural glucose).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Skeletal muscle biopsies</title><p>The biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle was performed with a Bergstrom trocar after local anesthesia of the biopsy area with lidocaine 1%.

With a sample size in each sequence group of 10 (a total sample size of 20), a 2 &#x000d7; 2 cross-over design would have 80% power to detect a difference in means of 0.980 (the difference between a treatment 1 mean, &#x000b5;<sub>1</sub>, of 4.900, and a treatment 2 mean, &#x000b5;<sub>2</sub>, of 3.920) assuming that the crossover ANOVA &#x0221a;mean squares error was 1.000 (the SD of differences, &#x003c3;<sub>d</sub>, would be 1.414) using a two-group <italic>t</italic> test (crossover ANOVA) with a 0.050 two-sided significance level.</p><p>The efficacy analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. The main efficacy variable was the difference in GIR level after an 8-week period of treatment. A mixed model was built with treatment, period, clinical center, sequence, and interaction of treatment center as fixed factors and patient within sequence as random factor (carry-over effect). Least squares means were derived from the mixed model. The treatment effect was computed as differences between least squares means. The 95% two-sided CI was computed. Tests were two-sided and type I error risk was set at 0.05. No formal adjustment of type 1 error risk has been made. Given the number of secondary end points, <italic>P</italic> values between 0.01 and 0.05 should be interpreted cautiously.

In accordance with a hepatic insulin-sensitizing action, GFT505 improved the levels of liver enzymes (&#x003b3;GT and ALT). GFT505 also improved plasma lipid parameters, significantly decreasing both TG and LDL cholesterol levels. Finally, the safety profile of GFT505 was good, with no reported serious AE.</p><p>In clinical practice, TZDs remain the most efficacious insulin-sensitizing drugs that improve both hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In parallel, TZDs reduce liver fat in patients with type 2 diabetes with or without nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Metformin is a biguanide that acts by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I, leading to reduced hepatic mitochondrial ATP production and gluconeogenesis rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In contrast to TZDs, several studies indicate that metformin fails to improve peripheral insulin sensitivity and to reduce liver fat content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Compared with placebo, GFT505 improved simultaneously the GIR by 21% during the second insulin infusion period and the suppression of EGP by 43% during the first insulin infusion period of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The extent of the GIR increase on GFT505 treatment seems to be in a range similar to that observed in two placebo-controlled studies with pioglitazone, one in prediabetic subjects with coronary heart disease (+12.5%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and the second in nondiabetic subjects with combined hyperlipidemia (+33%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Although our data demonstrate that GFT505 is a new potent insulin sensitizer, only a head-to-head trial will allow a reliable comparison between these two drugs. GFT505 also enhanced insulin suppression of FFA levels, indicating a global insulin-sensitizing effect on muscle, liver, and adipose tissue.</p><p>In agreement with previous clinical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and animal studies, there is no evidence of PPAR&#x003b3; activity of GFT505 in this study either. In diabetic <italic>db/db</italic> mice, 58-day treatment with GFT505 produced a similar decrease in FPG and HbA<sub>1c</sub> as rosiglitazone, but without increasing plasma adiponectin concentrations and without inducing the expression of PPAR&#x003b3; target genes in adipose tissue (data not shown). Here, we confirm that GFT505 does not increase plasma adiponectin concentrations in humans either. In contrast, a significant reduction of adiponectin levels is even observed on GFT505 treatment, suggesting that GFT505 either improves adiponectin signaling or exerts its effects in an adiponectin-independent manner. Thus, together with the low affinity and partial agonist activity of GFT505 on PPAR&#x003b3;, as well as the large enterohepatic cycling and liver-targeted pharmacodynamics of GFT505 (as illustrated by the lack of gene regulation effects in skeletal muscle), our data seem to exclude insulin-sensitizing effects resulting from PPAR&#x003b3; activation in adipose tissue. The insulin-sensitizing effect of GFT505 could be linked to its PPAR&#x003b4; or combined PPAR&#x003b4;/PPAR&#x003b1; activity. In three randomized hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, the pure PPAR&#x003b1; agonist fenofibrate failed to improve either peripheral or hepatic insulin sensitivity in patients with the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), or type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In contrast, it has been demonstrated that the pure PPAR&#x003b4; agonist GW501516 significantly reduces HOMA-IR in abdominally obese patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to directly demonstrate that combined PPAR&#x003b4;/PPAR&#x003b1; activation leads to an improvement of insulin sensitivity in humans.</p><p>To explore the molecular mechanisms whereby GFT505 improves insulin sensitivity, skeletal muscle biopsies were performed at the end of the first treatment period. Because muscle biopsies were performed only once per patient during the study, gene expression comparisons were unpaired and may lack power. Skeletal muscle is one of the main PPAR&#x003b4; target tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Pharmacological activation of PPAR&#x003b4; with GW501516 increases fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and improves metabolism in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In addition, PPAR&#x003b4; activation with specific synthetic agonists also enhances fatty acid oxidation and oxidative gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), as well as basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in primary human myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In human skeletal muscle biopsy specimens, GW501516 has been shown to increase CPT1b mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In contrast, GFT505 failed to induce the expression of several PPAR&#x003b4; target genes (CPT1b, PDK4, CD36) in muscle biopsy specimens. Therefore, it seems unlikely that a direct activation of PPAR&#x003b4; in skeletal muscle contributes to the insulin-sensitizing action of GFT505 in vivo. Moreover, GFT505 does not induce PPAR&#x003b1;/&#x003b4; target genes (CPT1 and PDK4) in skeletal muscles of diabetic <italic>db/db</italic> mice either (data not shown). These results are in accordance with the pharmacokinetics of GFT505, which is a liver-targeted drug that undergoes extensive enterohepatic cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Thus, additional studies are needed to unravel the precise molecular mechanism behind the peripheral insulin-sensitizing effect of GFT505.</p><p>Interestingly, GFT505 improved insulin suppression of plasma FFA levels during the first step of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, an effect potentially contributing to the improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity, possibly by reducing intramyocellular lipotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). A similar reduction of circulating FFA has been previously observed in subjects with abdominal obesity treated with PPAR&#x003b4; agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In contrast, PPAR&#x003b1; agonists, such as fenofibrate, reduced fasting plasma FFA levels in some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), but not all, studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). However, overall fenofibrate fails to improve glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In a direct comparison with the PPAR&#x003b4; agonist GW501516, the pure PPAR&#x003b1; agonist GW590735 also failed to decrease fasting plasma FFA concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Finally, insulin suppression of circulating FFA was not modified by fenofibrate in several clamp studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The enhanced insulin suppression of plasma FFA levels with GFT505 suggests improved insulin sensitivity in adipocytes. Unfortunately, we did not sample adipose tissue biopsy specimens during the study; therefore, we are unable to determine whether GFT505 can directly activate PPAR&#x003b4; target genes in adipose tissue. Alternatively, the decrease in circulating FFA after GFT505 treatment could be attributable to an increase in FFA uptake and &#x003b2;-oxidation in the liver. Therefore, additional studies are needed to unravel the mechanism of action of GFT505 on FFA metabolism.</p><p>An intriguing finding of our study is that GFT505 reduces both &#x003b3;GT (&#x02212;30%) and ALT (&#x02212;20%) levels, suggesting an improvement in liver function in these severely insulin-resistant subjects. These data are in line with previous studies with GFT505 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and selective PPAR&#x003b4; agonists in pilot studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Eight weeks of treatment with the PPAR&#x003b4; agonist MBX-8025 (100 mg/d) reduced &#x003b3;GT by 28% in overweight men with mixed dyslipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In addition, 2 weeks of treatment with the PPAR&#x003b4; agonist GW501516 decreased &#x003b3;GT by 23% in moderately obese men, without improving ALT. Interestingly, GW501516 also reduced liver fat content by 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), and this effect correlated with the change in &#x003b3;GT levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The decrease of hepatic steatosis after PPAR&#x003b4; activation by GW501516 could be attributable to the reduced flux of FFA from adipose tissue or an increase in FFA uptake and &#x003b2;-oxidation in the liver. In contrast, there is no evidence for a beneficial role of PPAR&#x003b1; agonists in human NAFLD because fenofibrate does not improve transaminase levels or hepatic fat content in several randomized studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>The safety profile of GFT505 is reassuring, with no specific AEs. In contrast to what is observed with PPAR&#x003b3; agonists, there was neither body weight gain nor fluid retention. In addition, there were no significant increases in plasma creatinine or homocysteine levels, which are some classical PPAR&#x003b1;-related side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>The study has several limitations. Our analysis was restricted to Caucasian men and studies in women are warranted. The duration of treatment remains too short to assess the long-term safety of the drug. In addition, statistical significance of secondary end points should be interpreted cautiously because of multiple comparisons. A measure of glucose/lipid oxidation by indirect calorimetry may allow determining the effect of GFT505 on FFA oxidation. A direct measure of liver fat content is lacking to reinforce the hypothesis that GFT505 improves NAFLD by reducing liver steatosis.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the dual PPAR&#x003b1;/&#x003b4; agonist GFT505 is a new insulin sensitizer that exerts a beneficial impact on multiple components of the metabolic syndrome, including hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and possibly NAFLD. Many of these effects seem to be mediated by a combined activation of PPAR&#x003b4; and PPAR&#x003b1; into the liver, but the precise mode of action of GFT505 remains to be further determined.
