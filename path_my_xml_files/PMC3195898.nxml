                    the gold standard in comparative effectiveness research (CER) but the high cost
                    and complexity of traditional trials and concerns about generalizability to
                    broad patient populations and general clinical practice limit their appeal.
                    Unsuccessful implementation of CER results limits the value of even the highest
                    quality trials. Planning for a trial comparing two standard strategies of
                    insulin administration for hospitalized patients led us to develop a new method
                    for a clinical trial designed to be embedded directly into the clinical care
                    setting thereby lowering the cost, increasing the pragmatic nature of the
                    overall trial, strengthening implementation, and creating an integrated
                    environment of research-based care.</p><p><bold><italic>Purpose</italic></bold> We describe a novel randomized clinical
                    trial that uses the informatics and statistics infrastructure of the Veterans
                    Affairs Healthcare System (VA) to illustrate one key component (called the
                    point-of-care clinical trial &#x02013; POC-CT) of a &#x02018;learning healthcare
                    system,&#x02019; and settles a clinical question of interest to the VA.</p><p><bold><italic>Methods</italic></bold> This study is an open-label, randomized
                    trial comparing sliding scale regular insulin to a weight-based regimen for
                    control of hyperglycemia, using the primary outcome length of stay, in non-ICU
                    inpatients within the northeast region of the VA. All non-ICU patients who
                    require in-hospital insulin therapy are eligible for the trial, and the
                    VA&#x02019;s automated systems will be used to assess eligibility and present
                    the possibility of randomization to the clinician at the point of care.
                    Clinicians will indicate their approval for informed consent to be obtained by
                    study staff. Adaptive randomization will assign up to 3000 patients,
                    preferentially to the currently &#x02018;winning&#x02019; strategy, and all care
                    will proceed according to usual practices. Based on a Bayesian stopping rule,
                    the study has acceptable frequentist operating characteristics (Type I error
                    6%, power 86%) against a 12% reduction of median length
                    of stay from 5 to 4.4 days. The adaptive stopping rule promotes implementation
                    of a successful treatment strategy.</p><p><bold><italic>Limitations</italic></bold> Despite clinical equipoise, individual
                    healthcare providers may have strong treatment preferences that jeopardize the
                    success and implementation of the trial design, leading to low rates of
                    randomization. Unblinded treatment assignment may bias results. In addition,
                    generalization of clinical results to other healthcare systems may be limited by
                    differences in patient population. Generalizability of the POC-CT method depends
                    on the level of informatics and statistics infrastructure available to a
                    healthcare system.</p><p><bold><italic>Conclusions</italic></bold> The methods proposed will demonstrate
                    outcome-based evaluation of control of hyperglycemia in hospitalized veterans.
                    By institutionalizing a process of statistically sound and efficient learning,
                    and by integrating that learning with automatic implementation of best practice,
                    the participating VA Healthcare Systems will accelerate improvements in the
                    effectiveness of care.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1740774511398368"><title>Introduction</title><p>Medical decision making is informed by clinical trials and observational studies.
                Randomization in clinical trials reduces or eliminates biases of observational
                studies, such as selection by indication and confounding from unmeasured prognostic
                factors that affect treatment decisions and outcomes. By their purpose, randomized
                clinical trials (RCTs) can be designed on a spectrum ranging from
                    <italic>pragmatic</italic> (comparing effectiveness of interventions in the most
                realistic of situations and with diverse subjects) to <italic>explanatory</italic>
                (comparing efficacy in precisely described clinical situations and selected
                patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774511398368">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774511398368">2</xref>]. The goal of explanatory
                trials is to better understand how and why an intervention works while pragmatic
                clinical trials are designed to provide information needed to assist healthcare
                providers make informed clinical decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774511398368">3</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Pragmatic&#x02013;Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary
                    (PRECIS)</italic> is a measure of where on this continuum an individual trial is
                situated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774511398368">4</xref>]. It takes
                under consideration the attributes of an RCT such as flexibility of the
                interventions, practitioner expertise required, eligibility criteria, intensity of
                follow-up and adherence monitoring, and the nature and scope of the primary outcome.
                RCTs are considered on the pragmatic end of the spectrum when these attributes are
                chosen to allow the trial to more closely mimic conditions encountered in the
                clinical care arena. Examples include eligibility criteria that reflect the patient
                population likely to receive the intervention, study investigators with expertise
                and experiences similar to the healthcare providers who will ultimately administer
                the treatments, treatment protocols that allow the flexibility required in routine
                clinical care, and outcome measures, and follow-up procedures that would be part of
                routine clinical care. Despite their reflection of routine clinical care, pragmatic
                trials are currently still complicated and expensive to implement, because of the
                use of dedicated study personnel to recruit participants, administer the
                intervention and monitor the participants for study outcomes and adverse events.</p><p>We are testing a real implementation of a new methodology for clinical trials, that
                we have called point-of-care clinical trials (POC-CTs), with features designed to
                maximize the pragmatic nature of studies. Aspects of the approach we describe here
                have been proposed or implemented by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774511398368">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774511398368">8</xref>] and discussed in detail under the name of
                the &#x02018;clinically integrated randomized trial&#x02019; by Vickers and Scardino
                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774511398368">9</xref>]. The defining
                characteristic here is that to the maximum extent possible the clinical trial
                apparatus is embedded in routine clinical care. Optimally, this would include
                recruitment and randomization of study subjects at their POC by their usual
                healthcare provider. Once randomized to a treatment arm subjects would continue to
                be treated by their healthcare provider with minimal or no deviation from usual
                care. Follow-up of participants would thus reflect current clinical practice.
                Assessment of subject compliance and practitioner adherence to protocol, and
                ascertainment of clinically relevant endpoints would be performed through medical
                record review, with minimal contamination of the clinical care
                &#x02018;ecosystem&#x02019; by intrusive study dependencies. The intrusiveness of
                study operations, from randomization through endpoint ascertainment, would be
                greatly reduced if performed using tools familiar to healthcare providers and data
                already present in an electronic medical record (EMR).</p><p>A POC-CT shifts away from the asynchronous, distinct, and separate environments of
                research and clinical care, toward a real-time integrated system of research-based
                care. The goal of POC-CTs is to deliver the best care to patients while learning
                from each experience and redefining that care. Under this new paradigm, ongoing
                results would be more rapidly and more likely adopted by providers who participated
                in the studies. By synthesizing research with practice and tools to learn from that
                process, participating facilities can move to the goal of becoming &#x02018;learning
                healthcare systems.&#x02019;</p><p>In this article, we describe a specific POC-CT designed to test the feasibility and
                usefulness of the method, in answering a question of relevance to the Veterans
                Affairs (VA) Healthcare System. The clinical context and issues are described and
                ethical issues discussed. The use of outcome adaptive randomization to enhance
                implementation also addresses the frequentist operating characteristics of the
                design. The kinds of comparativeness questions best suited to POC-CT are argued.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-1740774511398368"><title>Illustrative example: sliding scale insulin regimen <italic>versus</italic>
                weight-based insulin protocol</title><p>We describe a POC-CT which compares two common regimens of administering insulin
                therapy to hospitalized patients requiring insulin; the sliding scale and
                weight-based approach. The VA has an EMR that includes electronic ordering of
                medications and protocols for both of these insulin regimens. Review of EMR data at
                the VA Boston Healthcare System demonstrated that each of these two approaches is
                used with approximately equal frequency and discussions with treating clinicians
                indicated that choice of method administration is based on personal preference and
                not on patient specific determinants.</p><p>There are no published data comparing the effectiveness or the adverse effects of the
                sliding scale or a weight-based insulin protocol in treating inpatients with
                hyperglycemia. For the sliding scale, short acting insulin is administered three to
                four times daily according to the degree of hyperglycemia, and no basal insulin is
                administered. This regimen, therefore, responds to hyperglycemia after it occurs,
                and does not prevent it. The weight-based insulin protocol is a twice daily regimen
                of basal intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) plus a pre-meal twice a day regimen of
                short acting regular insulin, plus a correction dose of regular insulin depending on
                the degree of hyperglycemia. In addition, depending on the amount of the correction
                dose, the basal doses are adjusted upward for the next day&#x02019;s NPH insulin
                dose to manage the hyperglycemia.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-1740774511398368"><title>Study design</title><p>Overall, the study is an open-label, randomized trial comparing sliding scale to a
                weight-based regimen in non-intensive care units (ICU) inpatients in a single large
                VA healthcare facility. There will be no modification to the treatment protocols
                already in use which will be accessed through the existing order entry menu.
                Consented patients will be randomized to treatment arms using an adaptive
                randomization method. Subjects are otherwise treated as usual. That is to say, there
                is no treatment protocol imposed other than insulin regimen beyond randomization.
                    <italic>There are no required diagnostic procedures and no study-specific
                    follow-up events required</italic>. Outcomes and covariates data will be
                collected directly from the computerized patient record system (CPRS). The primary
                endpoint is hospital length of stay (LOS); secondary endpoints include glycemic

                (treatment units) within a hospital is small and having enough clusters to achieve

                complex issues for a first use of POC-CT. Furthermore, we are interested in testing
                the feasibility of individual patient-level randomization, and the use of adaptive
                randomization to &#x02018;close the implementation gap.&#x02019; While it is

                and might be expected to be shortened if diabetic control can be made more
                efficient. It is also readily ascertainable from the EMR. Secondary outcome measures
                include degree of glycemic control and readmission within 30 days of discharge with
                the primary readmission diagnosis of control of glycemia. Tertiary outcomes include
                infections, acute kidney injury, and anemia, all of which have been previously used
                as outcome measures in studies of insulin regimens. Infection will be defined as new
                antibiotic administration associated with either fever or leukocytosis. Acute kidney
                injury is defined as a decrease in estimated GFR of greater than 50% and

                applications. Software tools available in CPRS include order sets (predefined
                customizable sets of orders), templates for clinical notes, decision logic (reminder

                related to clinical parameters and flags derived from the ordering process. These

                the enrollment is balanced, with our proposed design the number of patients assigned
                to the superior treatment is higher.</p><p>The operating characteristic simulation is dependent on the accuracy of the data
                model used to generate the LOS. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774511398368">Table 1</xref>, we use the exponential model to
                generate the data, as well as to do the updating. Thus, it makes the assumption that
                the Bayesian model is correctly specified, as is done in most published work, when
                estimating (frequentist) operating characteristics. But the LOS data from a

                the operating characteristics to misspecification of the data model. For example,
                the Type I error estimate rises from 6% to 7%, and the power at a
                difference of 0.5 days drops from 71% to 62%. However, we consider
                the Type I error less relevant in this context, comparing the effectiveness of two
                widely used procedures for setting dose. In a different context, the Type I error
                might be more important. The probability of making the right choice when it matters
                (a full day difference) is high (100%) in the log-normal scenario, too.
                These results illustrate the value of a hybrid approach, where the Bayes method is
                confined to updating the randomization probability (thus closing the implementation
                gap and maximizing the number of patients receiving the right treatment) and
                inference is based on operating characteristics from a range of more realistic
                models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec13-1740774511398368"><title>Discussion</title><p>POC-CT methodology is well suited for studies with the following features: <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Interventions already approved by the FDA.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A clinical question where there is equipoise regarding clinically

                the relevance of the findings to current practice at the VA Boston Healthcare
                System. Adaptive randomization is designed to assign subjects preferentially to the

                environment. CPRS is in use at all the VA&#x02019;s 1500-plus points of care and was
                designed to incorporate clinical data as part of efforts to improve clinical care.
                As a result, it features several packages that allow end users to automatically
                generate reports, &#x02018;listen&#x02019; for certain values associated with
                patient data objects, consider these values with programmatic logic, and introduce
                information and workflows directly into the EMR. To capitalize on this level of
                flexibility, most VA healthcare systems employ Clinical Application Coordinators,
                who use these tools to create and report measures of the quality of care, to
                implement guidelines, and to create clinical reminders based on the priorities of
                each hospital. This infrastructure will allow for the relatively easy roll-out of
                this and other POC-CT studies system-wide as well as systematic implementation of
                findings.</p><p>The ability to use existing functionalities, as opposed to developing custom software
                is important for a number of reasons. First, development of new software
                functionality is constrained by time for development, testing, and approval, and
                development resources. Second, by capitalizing on existing system functionality, we
                increase the likelihood of a successful deployment to other VA hospitals or clinics,
                each one of which employs CPRS. Finally, although this particular use of CPRS may be
                novel, the POC-CT processes are presented through familiar interfaces and into a
                culture of robust CPRS use, which we hope will facilitate adoption of this
                approach.</p><p>The ability of institutions to implement POC-CTs is dependent on the ability to use
                the EMR to: (1) identify events as they present in real time; (2) intervene in the
                clinical care workflow; and (3) track longitudinal data. It is worth noting that
                these functionalities are critical to the creation and implementation of many novel
                approaches to learn from and improve healthcare based on real data and that few
                systems offer such capabilities to end users. The need for such functionalities is
                of particular relevance in light of the US Federal Government&#x02019;s upcoming
                investment of $19 billion to support the adoption of EMRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774511398368">13</xref>]. Much of this funding
                is contingent on the adoption of &#x02018;certified&#x02019; EMR systems and the
                &#x02018;meaningful use&#x02019; of such systems. Definitions that require flexible
                integration with EMR data and workflows are essential to meeting the goals of such
                enormous investments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774511398368">14</xref>].</p><p>The ethical and practical considerations of informed consent have been extensively
                discussed and debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774511398368">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774511398368">19</xref>] as have methods such as cluster randomization which might obviate or
                preclude individual informed consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774511398368">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774511398368">21</xref>]. Detailed analyses of these
                considerations are outside the scope of this article. However, as POC-CTs or
                similarly designed trials become an important component of clinical research, it
                will be incumbent on investigators, ethicists, and IRBs to fully consider the
                potential benefits and apparently minimal incremental risks of a POC-CT, and to take
                responsibility for helping their healthcare systems to lower the barriers to
                successful study design and implementation of improvements in care.</p><p>A study coordinator will obtain written informed consent for all subjects entered
                into this trial. This requirement accounts for a significant proportion of the study
                cost and introduces the single most tangible perturbation to the usual care
                workflow. We recognize that replacement of such full written informed consent by an
                alternative (such as simple &#x02018;notification&#x02019; by the healthcare
                provider and verbal consent by the subject with subsequent randomization through a
                fully automated computerized process) would result in an even more efficient design,
                with a closer match to clinical care. The IRB could consider such a variation on the
                usual research informed consent, on a study-by-study basis, especially when the
                POC-CT results in care materially identical to usual clinical practice. Parallel
                requirements would be a waiver of HIPAA authorization to obtain study data from the
                EMR and acknowledgement that treating clinicians who authorize automated
                randomization are not &#x02018;engaged&#x02019; in research.</p><p>A POC-CT will likely require significantly less study-specific infrastructure and
                cost than traditional RCTs (after the up-front investment in coordinating center and
                informatics, already made by the VA). These advantages together with an economy of
                scale once an investment in the methodology has been made could lead to low
                incremental cost per study as well as allowing study designs of sufficient duration
                to capture clinically relevant (as opposed to surrogate) endpoints.</p></sec><sec id="sec14-1740774511398368"><title>Limitations</title><p>Several issues may impede adoption of POC-CTs. Some patients may find it surprising
                and troubling that healthcare providers do not know what is the best treatment for
                them. This disclosure could make the consent process lengthy and difficult. Although
                the medical community might be at equipoise regarding treatment options, individual
                healthcare providers may have strong treatment preferences, either in general or for
                particular individual patients. Both of these issues could have ramifications for
                recruitment rates and the success of a POC-CT. We note that &#x02018;reluctance to
                randomize&#x02019; is an issue for all RCT designs, not just POC-CT.</p><p>Most (if not all) uses of POC-CT we envision would have an open (unblinded) design,
                which raises the possibility of cross-contamination of treatments, or differential
                clinical interventions due to physicians&#x02019; perceptions of patients&#x02019;
                needs, or other failures of the exclusion principle, such as observational bias in
                the outcome. Therefore, the use of POC-CT may be restricted to clinical situations
                where the effects are likely to be minimal. We think that the EMR-based protocols we
                compare here, as well as the outcome of LOS, sharply reduce physician unblinding as
                a threat. We emphasize that POC-CT is not a universal alternative to the classical
                double-blind RCT with its many controls for bias; rather, it can be seen as a
                competitor to observational studies, by removing the particular bias from selection
                by indication that plagues such non-experimental studies.</p><p>Our pragmatic intent requires us to rely on individual clinician judgment of
                eligibility, which is another mark of distinction between POC-CT and conventional
                trials, which often have elaborate procedures for defining &#x02018;inclusion and
                exclusion.&#x02019; This certainly restricts the use of POC-CT to contexts where
                such precision is unnecessary. However, it also contributes to the
                &#x02018;ecological validity&#x02019; of treatment effects.</p><p>Highly pragmatic POC-CTs such as this study may yield results that are locally
                convincing but are not easily generalized to other healthcare systems. A healthcare
                system such as the VA, motivated to conduct POC-CTs and with the organization and
                infrastructure capable of supporting it, could generate &#x02018;locally
                selfish&#x02019; evidence-based medicine to gain evidence of comparative
                effectiveness most relevant to its population and systems. In general, comparative
                effectiveness findings are most applicable to the systems and individuals who
                participated in its creation rather than to the &#x02018;free riders&#x02019;
                &#x02013; those who may desire evidence-based medicine but who are unwilling to be a
                part of that evidence.</p><p>The above may suggest that the POC-CT approach is limited to a narrow range of
                clinical questions and contexts. We are just now beginning to expand our list of
                possible use cases, and we do not want to speculate in advance of the facts. We
                agree with Vickers and Scardino [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774511398368">9</xref>] that features of POC-CT might be implemented in practice in four
                distinct areas: surgery, &#x02018;me too&#x02019; drugs, rare diseases, and
                lifestyle interventions. In addition to questions of optimizing care (such as the
                insulin example described here) use cases currently under consideration include
                technology introduction (imaging, robotics, and biomarker-guided therapy),
                pre-hydration with bicarbonate <italic>versus</italic> saline with or without
                n-acetylcysteine in contrast-induced nephropathy, and comparing prolonged exposure
                and cognitive processing therapies as alternative treatment strategies for
                post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>Finally, the proposed study design using outcome adaptive randomization leads to
                real-time implementation into practice, and stimulates reconsideration of the role
                of the traditional peer review process that subjects study results to expert outside
                review before planning their implementation in practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies
