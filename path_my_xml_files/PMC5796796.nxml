Red light is the most widely used light source while Intense pulsed lights (IPL) is reported effective and well-tolerated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse reactions of ALA-PDT with red light on acne compared with ALA-PDT with IPL.12 patients were recruited in the randomized, prospective and split-face study. 5% ALA cream were applied on the whole face with 2&#x000a0;hours' incubation before narrow band LED(633 &#x000b1; 10&#x000a0;nm, 36 &#x0223c; 108J/cm<sup>2</sup>) on one side of face and IPL(590&#x0223c;1200&#x000a0;nm, 15&#x0223c;17J/cm<sup>2</sup>) on the other side. Three treatment sessions were administered with 2-week interval each time and 8&#x000a0;weeks' follow up. The number of the total acne lesions and inflammatory lesions of the side treated by red light-PDT showed a relatively higher reduction rate that that by IPL-PDT (P &#x0003c; 0.05). Significant PpIX fluorescence decrease was observed only for the group of red light (P &#x0003c; 0.05). Lower pain intensity numeric rating scale values and Investigator's Global Severity Assessment (IGA) grading for erythema of the IPL side were observed (P&#x0003c;0.05).The results suggested that both red light and IPL are effective for ALA-PDT on acne vulgaris. ALA-PDT with red light may achieve better efficacy by more effective photobleaching of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), whereas IPL may accomplish less adverse reactions and better tolerance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Photodynamic therapy</kwd><kwd>Red lights</kwd><kwd>Intense pulsed lights</kwd><kwd>Acne vulgaris</kwd><kwd>5-aminolevulinic</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Guide support project in western medicine of shanghai municipal science and technology</named-content></funding-source><award-id>16411961700</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Shanghai unicipal commision of health and family planning</named-content></funding-source><award-id>201540273</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning (201540273) and Guide support project in western medicine of Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission (16411961700).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="26"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the pilosebaceous follicle, mostly found in young adults aged between 18 to 40.

ALA Has been used as photosensitizer for PDT to treat acne in China since 2004. In 2012, our prospective study proved that similar PpIX levels and lesion clearance rate were seen in areas receiving 3, 5, and 10% ALA. Besides, the average PpIX level increased with the increase in incubation time between 1 and 5&#x000a0;hours simultaneously.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> One year later, a self-controlled multicenter clinical trial stated a low-dose topical ALA-PDT regimen using 5% ALA, 1&#x000a0;hour incubation and red light source of 3 treatment sessions is suggested as optimal scheme for the treatment of different severity of acne vulgaris in Chinese patients.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p>Various light sources have been used in the process of ALA-PDT for the treatment of acne, which include light-emitting diodes (LEDs), filtered incandescent or arc lamps, slide projectors, fluorescent lamps, IPLs, lasers and sunlight.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Red light and blue light are widely used in PDT for the treatment of acne as well as pulsed sources such as IPLs and pulsed dye lasers (PDLs).The scattering and absorption of photons are closely related to the penetration of light into skin. With the increase of wave length, the ability of the scattering and absorption of photons decease. In contrast, the longer the wave length is, the deeper the light penetrates. Facial sebaceous glands are located approximately 0.5 to 1.0&#x000a0;mm from the cutaneous surface.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> However, ALA has a maximum absorption band in the blue light spectrum (405&#x02013;415&#x000a0;nm) and weaker absorption bands, which are located in the green (506&#x000a0;nm to;540&#x000a0;nm), yellow(572&#x02013;582&#x000a0;nm) and red spectra (628&#x02013;635&#x000a0;nm).<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In order to achieve optimal efficacy, red light is the optimal choice not only because it has deep penetrating wavelength region but also it has relatively higher absorption of the Porphyrin that can lead the PDT reaction efficiently to the follicular units and sebaceous glands. However, possibly because of the intensity of the Red Light that different degrees of pain were reported after red light-PDT. When irradiated with higher irradiances, patients would feel further painful and suffer more from the severity of erythema.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Hence, we need to seek other light sources to balance the efficacy and adverse reactions.</p><p>IPLs, with a broad spectrum of 500&#x02013;1200nm, include ALA absorption bands of green, red and yellow. ROS such as singlet oxygen generated during a high fluence light pulse can drive a series of oxygen-dependent and non-oxygen-dependent reactions through the Oxygen depletion.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> For one thing, ROS can damage blood vessels and leads to vascular coagulation. For another, the reduction of cytokines such as Interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1&#x003b1;) and the increase of transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) may contribute to IPL's role of anti-inflammation and rejuvenation effect.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Histological changes showed decreased elastic fibers in the dermis deformation, increased collagen fibers after IPL treatment.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Barakat et&#x000a0;al reported the significant decrease of neutrophils after the treatment of IPL for acne.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p><p>There's not enough studies compared and contrast different light sources for ALA-PDT for the treatment of acne, especially for red light and IPL.

Ulceration and scarring are rare thanks to relatively low dose and short incubation time. Although pain can be reduced by cold spray and ice bags, the painful treatment course can still affect the compliance of patients in clinical practice.

Ltd., Shanghai, China) and was applied evenly to acne lesions after the face was cleaned with mild soap. The ALA-applied area was occluded with cling film and covered with a black cloth for light. After 2&#x000a0;hours' incubation, the lesion surface was rinsed with clean water to remove the excess ALA and was prepared for light irradiation.</p><p>The side treated by red light: The lesions were then exposed to a LED light source (633 &#x000b1; 6&#x000a0;nm) (Omnilux Revive, Photo Therapeutics Ltd., Manchester, UK) in the red light spectrum. The distance between the LED device and the face was adjusted to deliver a power density of 66&#x000a0;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> to the surface of the face. During the first and second course, a suboptimal light dose (36&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> and 72J/cm<sup>2</sup>) was delivered and a full dose (108&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup>) was delivered during the third course.</p><p>The side treated by IPL: The lesions were exposed to an IPL device (M22 Universal IPL, Lumenis, San Jose, CA, USA).

The filter emitted light with the wavelength between 590 and 1200&#x000a0;nm. A single pass without overlapping was performed, and double pulses of 5.0&#x000a0;ms duration which interspaced with a 30&#x000a0;ms delay were used.</p><p>During one side for light irradiation, the other side of the face was protected from light.

Fluorescence images were captured by a digital camera equipped with a 420-nm long-pass filter. To measure the amount of PpIX, PpIX fluorescence intensity was detected in the acne lesions of comedones, inflammatory papules, pustules and nodules/cysts (3 lesions for each type) before and immediately after light irradiation in the 1st session of ALA-PDT using fluorescence spectroscopy (Curalux;Munich, Germany, excitation wavelength 405&#x000a0;nm, emission wavelength 440&#x02013;800&#x000a0;nm).

Images of both sides of face were taken for comparisons. The clearance rate of skin lesions (%) = (the total number of skin lesions before treatment &#x02212; the total number of skin lesions after treatment)/the total number of skin lesions before treatment &#x000d7; 100%.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-0006"><title>Evaluation of adverse reactions</title><p>To examine and evaluate possible adverse reactions, patients were asked to report the severity of pain during the first treatment session, which was evaluated with an 11-point pain intensity numeric rating scale (PI-NRS) (0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). Post treatment reactions such as erythema, edema, exudation, hyperpigmentation and scarring were evaluated immediately after each treatment and during the follow-up. Evaluation of erythema severity was performed by Investigator's Global Severity Assessment (IGA) grading at 4,8&#x000a0;weeks after the last treatment session and the evaluation was based on the following criteria:</p><p>0: No erythema.</p><p>1: Reddish, mild erythema</p><p>2: Red, moderate erythema</p><p>3: Dark red, edematous and servere erythema or hyperpigmentation.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-0007"><title>Statistics</title><p>Results were analyzed using statistics software (PASW Statistics 19, IBM SPSS Statistics, Armork, NY, USA). Graphs were completed using GraphPad Prism version 6.00(GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). PI-NRS values and IGA grading between the 2 groups were compared by Mann-Whitney U test. Paired t-test were used to compare the PpIX fluorescence intensity of 2 groups and lesion count. All P values were two-tailed, and a P value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Data were expressed as the means &#x000b1; standard deviation unless otherwise specified.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first prospective and split face study which compares red light with IPL for ALA-PDT on acne vulgaris. Our data indicated that both light sources were safe and effective for clinical practices and have their own advantages. Red light may achieve better efficacy by more effective photobleaching of PpIX but IPL showed less adverse reactions and better tolerance. Therefore we believe IPL-PDT has the potential to become an alternative light source for ALA-PDT for the treatment of acne vulgaris in the future and further studies may focus on the indication and parameters of IPL-PDT.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning (201540273) and Guide support project in western medicine of Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission (16411961700).</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>HC</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Dellavalle</surname><given-names>RP</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Garner</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group>
