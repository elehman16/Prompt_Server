The present study sought to replicate this finding, and determine whether support from a technician is as effective as guidance from a clinician.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing three groups: Clinician-assisted vs. technician-assisted vs. delayed treatment. Community-based volunteers applied to the VirtualClinic (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.virtualclinic.org.au">www.virtualclinic.org.au</ext-link>) research program and 150 participants with GAD were randomized. Participants in the clinician- and technician-assisted groups received access to an iCBT program for GAD comprising six online lessons, weekly homework assignments, and weekly supportive contact over a treatment period of 10 weeks. Participants in the clinician-assisted group also received access to a moderated online discussion forum. The main outcome measures were the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7). Completion rates were high, and both treatment groups reduced scores on the PSWQ (p&#x0003c;0.001) and GAD-7 (p&#x0003c;0.001) compared to the delayed treatment group, but did not differ from each other. Within group effect sizes on the PSWQ were 1.16 and 1.07 for the clinician- and technician-assisted groups, respectively, and on the GAD-7 were 1.55 and 1.73, respectively. At 3 month follow-up participants in both treatment groups had sustained the gains made at post-treatment. Participants in the clinician-assisted group had made further gains on the PSWQ. Approximately 81 minutes of clinician time and 75 minutes of technician time were required per participant during the 10 week treatment program.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both clinician- and technician-assisted treatment resulted in large effect sizes and clinically significant improvements comparable to those associated with face-to-face treatment, while a delayed treatment/control group did not improve. These results provide support for large scale trials to determine the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of technician-assisted iCBT programs for GAD. This form of treatment has potential to increase the capacity of existing mental health services.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/trial_view.aspx?ID=308195">ACTRN12609000563268</ext-link>

The 12-month prevalence of GAD in Australia and the US is 2.7&#x00025; and 3.1&#x00025;, respectively <xref rid="pone.0010942-Australian1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010942-Kessler1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. GAD commonly co-occurs with other anxiety disorders and/or depression and is highly disabling, resulting in levels of disability comparable to depression <xref rid="pone.0010942-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010942-Andrews1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although people with GAD frequently utilise health care facilities they often report somatic rather than psychological symptoms, making diagnosis difficult <xref rid="pone.0010942-Wittchen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>GAD can be treated effectively with cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT) <xref rid="pone.0010942-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0010942-Dugas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but numerous barriers to treatment exist, including the direct and indirect costs of treatment, the limited availability of mental health professionals, stigma, and the difficulty of patients attending treatment during office hours <xref rid="pone.0010942-Marks1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. One promising strategy for reducing these barriers involves Internet-based CBT (iCBT) programs. iCBT programs result in clinically significant improvements in patients with depression <xref rid="pone.0010942-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, panic disorder <xref rid="pone.0010942-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0010942-Carlbring1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, social phobia <xref rid="pone.0010942-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov7" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, with encouraging results recently reported from the first iCBT program for treating GAD <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov8" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In that study, treatment group participants obtained clinically significant reductions in severity of GAD symptoms relative to a control group.</p><p>The successful use of a non-clinician (technician) to administer iCBT, without compromising clinical outcomes, has been reported in iCBT programs for depression and social phobia <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov6" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov7" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The use of technicians to oversee administration of iCBT programs has considerable implications for the cost-effectiveness of iCBT. An important question is whether similar effects could be obtained from iCBT for GAD.</p><p>The present CONSORT-Revised compliant randomized controlled trial (RCT) <xref rid="pone.0010942-Moher1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> had two aims: To replicate the recent finding that people with a DSM-IV <xref rid="pone.0010942-American1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> diagnosis of GAD could be treated using the Worry program <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov8" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, a diagnosis-specific iCBT program developed to treat GAD, and; to examine the relative clinical efficacy and acceptability of clinician- and technician-assisted iCBT using the Worry program <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov8" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We tested four hypothesises: Firstly, that clinician-assisted (CA) treatment would be efficacious; secondly, that participants in a technician-assisted (TA) group would show similar clinical improvements on measures of GAD, depression and disability as the clinician-assisted (CA) group; thirdly, that both treatment groups would have better outcomes than a delayed treatment (control) group; and finally; improvements would be sustained at follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see CONSORT <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0010942.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0010942.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics</title><p>This study was approved by the St Vincent's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee and by the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee.

Participants who satisfied all criteria were informed of the study design and invited to return a completed consent form by email. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, and the University of New South Wales.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>Treatment groups received access to the Worry program, an iCBT program with demonstrated efficacy at reducing symptoms of GAD <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov8" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The Worry program consists of six online lessons, printable summary and homework assignments, automatic emails, and additional resource documents. The six online lessons represent best practice principles used in CBT programs for GAD including cognitive therapy, challenging meta-beliefs about worry, graded exposure, challenging core beliefs, and relapse prevention. Part of the content of each lesson is presented in the form of an illustrated story about a woman with GAD who, with the help of a clinical psychologist, learns to gain mastery over her symptoms. Automatic emails are sent to congratulate participants for completing each lesson, to remind them to complete materials, and to notify them of new resources. As people progress through each lesson they have access to additional written documents providing supplementary information about techniques such as managing sleep problems, assertiveness and problem solving skills, managing low mood, panic, and other common comorbid symptoms. They are also provided with access to vignettes written by previous participants about their own experiences in the Worry program of managing GAD. Participants are expected to complete the homework tasks prior to completing the next lesson, and to complete all lessons within 10 weeks.</p><p>All participants in the treatment groups began the 10-week treatment program at the same time. Participants were advised to complete one lesson every 7&#x02013;10 days and to complete the six lessons within 10 weeks of starting. All participants received automatic emails informing them when a lesson was to be completed, and reminder emails if they had not completed a lesson within 7 days of notification.</p><p>Three staff conducted the study, with supervision from NT. The technician (KM) was employed in an administrative role as a Clinic Manager, Anxiety Disorders Clinic, Mental Health Service, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney. She reported no prior experience with research programs, no qualifications in health care or counseling, and had no clinical duties in her usual role. The clinician (ER) was a qualified and registered clinical psychologist, employed at the same unit as KM. The third staff member (KS) was a research assistant, who provided administrative support to the technician and clinician.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Technician-Assisted Treatment</title><p>During treatment the technician provided TA group participants with weekly email or telephone contact. The technician was given a guideline script which identified the topics covered in each lesson of the program and activities participants should be encouraged to practice for each lesson. The technician was instructed to contact each TA group participant weekly to provide encouragement and support, and where possible to respond to participants' general questions by referring them to the materials in the Worry program. The technician was not permitted to provide clinical advice. The technician received supervision from the clinician and was instructed to inform the clinician of any perceived deterioration in the participants' mental health status, or of any concerns about participants' wellbeing. While conducting this research the technician maintained her full-time role as a Clinic Manager.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Clinician-Assisted Treatment</title><p>CA group participants had weekly email or telephone contact with the clinician and access to an online discussion forum where they could post questions to the clinician about the program content. Information posted on the discussion forum could be read by other participants in the CA group. The clinician was provided with the same guideline script as the technician but was also instructed to answer participants' questions via forum, email, or telephone. The clinician was instructed to actively engage with each participant in treatment including goal setting, problem solving, and discussion of strategies for overcoming hurdles to progress. Because of the clinical nature of messages on the forum, the TA group did not have access to a forum. The clinician and technician were instructed to try to spend no more than 10 minutes in contact with each participant per week. The total time required and nature of all contacts with participants during treatment was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Control Group</title><p>Control group participants received no treatment for 11 weeks and then received the clinician-assisted program described above, beginning treatment one week after the intervention groups completed the Worry program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study was a 3 group randomized controlled non-inferiority trial to determine whether technician-assisted iCBT was equivalent to clinician-assisted iCBT but superior to delayed treatment (control).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Primary and Secondary Outcomes</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Outcomes</title><p>One week prior to beginning the trial participants completed the following questionnaires online: The Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) <xref rid="pone.0010942-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>; the GAD-7; the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item (PHQ-9); the Kessler 10 (K-10) <xref rid="pone.0010942-Kessler2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>; the Sheehan Disability Scales (SDS) <xref rid="pone.0010942-Sheehan2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>; and the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) <xref rid="pone.0010942-Devilly1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010942-Borkovec1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The PSWQ is a 16-item measure with scores ranging from 16&#x02013;80. The GAD-7 is a 7-item measure with scores ranging from 0&#x02013;27. The PSWQ and GAD-7 are frequently used clinical and research measures of GAD. A score of 10 on the GAD-7 has been identified as providing an important threshold for identifying DSM-IV congruent GAD <xref rid="pone.0010942-Spitzer1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The PHQ-9 is a 9-item measure of depressive symptoms with scores ranging from 0&#x02013;27. The K-10 is a 10-item measure of psychological distress with scores ranging from 10&#x02013;50. The SDS is a 3-item measure of disability with scores ranging from 0 to 30 and the CEQ is a widely used measure of the expectancies or perception of treatment credibility.</p><p>The PSWQ, GAD-7, PHQ-9, K-10, SDS and a treatment satisfaction questionnaire (based on the CEQ) were re-administered one week post-treatment and at three-months post-treatment (follow-up), while the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 was also administered mid-treatment (at week 5). All of these measures are considered reliable, valid, and appropriate for clinical and research purposes, with recent research indicating that online administration of questionnaires results in acceptable reliability of responses <xref rid="pone.0010942-Garb1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010942-Carlbring3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

At intake all participants met DSM-IV diagnosis of GAD, and the majority reported onset before the age of 30 years. In addition to access to the components of the Worry program, CA group participants had weekly email or telephone contact with the clinician and access to an online discussion forum. The clinician actively engaged in treatment with CA group participants. In addition to having access to the Worry program, TA group participants had weekly email or telephone contact with the technician, but did not have access to an online forum. The technician provided support and encouragement, did not provide clinical advice, but was instructed to refer clinical questions or concerns to the clinician.</p><p>The first hypothesis, that clinician-assisted treatment using the Worry program would be efficacious was supported. Large within-group effect sizes were obtained for the CA group on measures of GAD and importantly, satisfaction with treatment was high. This replicates the outcomes of an earlier preliminary study using the Worry program <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov8" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and extends those results by confirming the stability or improvement of clinical gains 3 months post-program.</p><p>The second hypothesis, that participants in the TA group would show similar clinical improvements on measures of GAD, depression, and disability, to those in the CA group, was also supported. At post-treatment outcomes for both treatment groups were superior to the control group, satisfaction with treatment was high in both treatment groups, and there were no differences between the two treatment groups in clinical outcomes. At post-treatment more than 50&#x00025; of participants in the treatment groups were classified as recovered compared to 10&#x00025; of controls, while reliable clinical change was observed in almost 50&#x00025; of participants in the treatment groups compared to 6&#x00025; of controls. Consistent with the final hypothesis, at follow-up this pattern of results was maintained for participants in the TA group, while at follow-up the CA group obtained significantly lower scores on the PSWQ than at post-treatment, indicating that they made additional gains.</p><p>At post-treatment and follow-up ESs in the treatment groups on both GAD measures were greater than 1.0 indicating that the treatment effect was considerable. The magnitude of these ESs is comparable to improvements typically reported in meta-analyses of face-to-face CBT-based treatment of GAD <xref rid="pone.0010942-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010942-Mitte1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. These results were obtained with a relatively low level of total contact time per participant but a large number of total contacts. It is estimated that 7 hours per week of clinician or technician time was required to conduct each group of more than 45 participants. However, during treatment CA group participants received approximately 33 contacts, prompts, and reminders compared to 31 in the TA group, a difference that was statistically, but unlikely to be clinically significant. More than half of these contacts were managed by the automated email system. These results indicate the importance of regular contact, even if the contact is automatic or of relatively short duration.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Generalizability</title><p>These results replicate the findings of a recent RCT <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov8" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> reporting the preliminary results of the Worry program. The present results indicate the Worry program can reliably produce good clinical outcomes that are sustained for at least 3 months post-treatment, and that the procedure is acceptable to consumers with GAD. A total of 80 minutes of staff time was required per participant using the Worry program, which compares favorably to the 8 to 16 hours of clinician contact usually required in face-to-face treatment, indicating this approach is cost-effective. These results also support recent evidence indicating that Internet-based treatment programs may be effectively administered by a non-clinician <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov6" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov7" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, when supervised by a clinician. Importantly, if the technician in the present study was concerned about a participant in their group they were able to &#x0201c;step-up&#x0201d; participants to the clinician, but did so with only 10&#x00025; of participants. This indicates that the majority found the intervention by the technician sufficient for their needs, and demonstrates a potential model for integrating clinician and technician support during iCBT programs.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Limitations</title><p>The relatively small sample size is one limitation of this study. The low completion rates of questionnaires at follow-up is another limitation, and analyses revealed that non-completers had elevated post-treatment scores on the measures of depression, psychological distress, and disability relative to completers, indicating that the follow-up results should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>An important potential limitation is the use of a delayed treatment control group rather than an attention-control placebo. This choice was grounded in concerns about the impact of raised expectations of symptom resolution in anxious participants placed in a placebo, attention-control condition. These concerns were heightened by the geographical spread of participants, who were from all around Australia, and hence unable to be reached by the investigators should additional help have been required.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This randomized controlled trial found no difference between a clinician- and technician-assisted Internet-based treatment program for GAD. Both conditions resulted in large effect sizes, clinically significant improvements, and high levels of acceptability, while a delayed treatment control group did not improve. These results were sustained at 3-month follow-up in the technician-assisted group, while the clinician-assisted group showed evidence of continued improvement. These findings are consistent with emerging evidence indicating that Internet-based treatment programs may be effectively administered by a non-clinician <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov6" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010942-Titov7" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, when supervised by a clinician. Furthermore, this model of implementation requires considerably less time than face-to-face treatment, and appears highly acceptable to people with GAD.
