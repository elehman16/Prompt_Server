Beneficial effects of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E2) on glucose homeostasis may be lost with neutering and thereby account for increased diabetes risk. To evaluate this, adult male neutered overweight cats (n=6) were given daily E2 (1.0 &#x003bc;g/kg) or vehicle (Vh; ethanol, 1.0&#x003bc;L/kg) in a single crossover trial of 14-day periods with a 7-day washout. The E2 and Vh were voluntarily ingested on food. The E2 dosage was determined in a pre-trial to significantly and transiently reduce food intake with no measurable change in plasma E2 concentration. During treatments, physical activity was assessed with collar-mounted accelerometers on days 9-11, and tests of intravenous insulin tolerance and intravenous glucose tolerance were conducted on days 13 and 14, respectively. Over the 14 days, E2 compared to Vh treatment reduced (p=0.03) food intake (- 22%) but not enough to significantly reduce body weight; activity counts were not significantly changed. With E2 compared to Vh treatment, the late-phase plasma insulin response of the glucose tolerance test was less (p=0.03) by 31%, while glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity indexes were not significantly changed. The results indicate that oral E2 at a dosage that moderately affects food intake may reduce insulin requirement for achieving glucose homeostasis in neutered male cats. Further investigation is needed to identify the mechanism underlying the E2 effect.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Nestl&#x000e9; Purina Endowed Program in Small Animal Nutrition, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.

It is estimated that 35.1% of cats over one year of age are either overweight or obese [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Risk factors for feline obesity include gender (males &#x0003e; females), reproductive status (neutered &#x0003e; intact), indoor confinement, and physical inactivity [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To date, the most commonly implicated risk factor is gonadectomy which is the single most important factor in cats [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Obesity appears to predispose this species to a variety of diseases including diabetes mellitus (DM), specifically in overweight neutered males [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Post-gonadectomy weight gain has been previously attributed to loss of inhibition of food intake by estrogens in both male and female cats [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that supplementation of a physiologically relevant dose of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E2) to gonadectomized cats results in a reduction in hyperphagia [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and is effective in the prevention of post-gonadectomy weight gain [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These studies uncovered the key role of gonadal E2 in the modulation of food intake in cats.</p><p>Substantial evidence also demonstrates that E2 has antidiabetic properties in humans [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and rodents [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] when ovarian production ceases, or is absent, by enhancing insulin sensitivity and &#x003b2;-cell function. Postmenopausal women are at risk of developing visceral obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 DM while ovariectomized rodents are more susceptible to hyperglycemia. In both of these models, symptoms can be reversed with exogenous E2 therapy.</p><p>It is also observed in rodent models that gonadectomy significantly reduces physical activity in both males and females and that supplementation with E2 recovers pre-neutering conditions [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Since physical inactivity is associated with feline DM [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and increased activity is recognized as a contributing factor in the prevention of type 2 DM in humans [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], it would be interesting to determine if E2 supplementation restores physical activity in cats back to pre-neuter conditions, particularly in those at increased risk of DM (obese neutered males).</p><p>Although ample data supports a beneficial role of E2 on glucose homeostasis and physical activity in various species, there is a paucity of information available in domestic cats. To our knowledge, no study to date has examined the impact of exogenous E2 on indices of glucose homeostasis or physical activity in at-risk cats. In the present study, we hypothesized that oral replacement of gonadal estrogen lost with neutering would increase insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and restore physical activity to pre-neuter conditions. Findings in support of this hypothesis may indicate a benefit for E2 in the management and prevention of feline diabetes, a condition of insulin resistance and diminished insulin secretion [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Approval for the study was acquired from the University of Missouri Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC).

Eight adult male neutered cats [2.3&#x02013;6.1 (median = 5.8) years] were randomly assigned to four groups of 2 cats each. Cats ranged in body weight from 4.44&#x02013;8.48 (median = 7.1) kg and were 1.5&#x02013;4.5 (median = 4.5) years post-neutering. For four successive periods of 14 days, three dosages of E2 (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 &#x003bc;g/kg) and vehicle (Vh, 1.0 &#x003bc;L/kg of ethanol) were given to each cat in a Latin-squared design with no intervening periods of washout. During the first 5 days of each treatment period, the cats voluntarily ingested E2 or Vh applied to a food kibble immediately before diet presentation. Food intake was determined daily. On day 6 of treatment periods, prior to diet presentation, approximately 14 hours following ingestion of E2 or Vh, jugular venous blood (6 mL) was collected by venipuncture and transferred to glass tubes containing potassium EDTA.

From the results of the E2 dose response trial, the dosage of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg/day significantly reduced <italic>ad libitum</italic> food intake but did not significantly alter plasma E2 levels, indicating that the regimen was not supraphysiological but also not emulating of the pre-gonadectomy condition. Intact compared to neutered male cats have approximately twice as great plasma E2 concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A lacking effect of oral E2 on E2 in plasma collected several hours later is not surprising because E2 is rapidly conjugated in cats as in other species [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>E2 Effects on Food Intake</title><p>At 1.0 &#x003bc;g/kg, E2 decreased <italic>ad libitum</italic> food intake by 22% per day (<xref rid="pone.0130696.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For reference, the dosage used was 10-fold greater than the subcutaneous dosage of E2 (~0.1 &#x003bc;g/kg/day) found to reduce food intake in overweight, <italic>ad libitum</italic>-fed neutered cats [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], not evoking signs of estrus in ovariectomized cats [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To our knowledge, the oral bioavailability of E2 in cats has not been reported. Nonetheless, it was expected to be low. Bioavailabilities of 4.3 and 10% are reported in rats and humans, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The decrement in food intake from the E2 dosage used to evaluate parameters of glucose homeostasis was within ranges observed in the dose response trial when oral dosage was 1 and 2 &#x003bc;g/kg/day (<xref rid="pone.0130696.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).</p><p>Although food intake was decreased by E2, there was no significant effect on body weight (<xref rid="pone.0130696.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Substantial weight loss was not a desired outcome because it could have confounded interpretation of the results. Specifically, overweight body condition in cats is known to affect glucose tolerance and indices of insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism by which E2 treatment reduced food intake was not apparent. In humans and in rodents, E2 has been shown to affect the potency of peripheral feedback signals for meal size, specifically with respect to cholecystokinin (CCK) [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. CCK is released from the small intestine in response to food intake and exerts a vagally-mediated satiating action which modulates meal size. Hence, a potentiating effect of E2 on CCK may have decreased food intake in the cats. Another speculation for the reduction in food intake is via a centrally mediated pathway. In ovariectomized rodent models, E2 overcomes arcuate leptin resistance, increases the secretion of anorectic neuropeptides (&#x003b1;-melanocyte-stimulating hormone), and decreases the secretion of orexigenic neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y and Agouti-related peptide) [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. While this pathway has not been elucidated in cats, estrogen target neurons have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and may be mediators of E2&#x02019;s anorectic function.</p><p>We were not expecting the magnitude of variation in food intake between subjects with E2 treatment, particularly with respect to body weight (<xref rid="pone.0130696.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Although E2 did have an effect on food intake in all cats, it would appear that the obese versus the overweight cats were more refractory to the appetite suppressive effects. In this trial, one fixed dose of E2 was used for each subject. It is possible that the pharmacokinetics of exogenous E2 are such that it partitions into peripheral fat deposits and thus a higher dose is required in more obese individuals. Since adiposity does appear to affect food intake, a future direction is to evaluate indices of glucose homeostasis with stratified groups of cats according to body condition. The variability in food intake with respect to body weight also may have been a reflection of decreased E2 sensitivity in the obese cats. Individual differences in sensitivity of food intake to the residual estradiol after neutering might account for the large variation in body condition observed among cats post-neutering.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>E2 Effects on Glucose Homeostasis</title><p>Contrary to our hypothesis, glucose tolerance was not improved with E2 treatment as indicated from the IVGTT variables, clearance half-time, rate of disappearance (k), and plasma glucose AUC (<xref rid="pone.0130696.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The early-phase insulin response (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;15 min</sub>) also was not affected by the treatment. In contrast, an unexpected and important finding was the late-phase insulin response (AUC<sub>60&#x02013;120min</sub>) being reduced with E2 treatment compared to the control (<xref rid="pone.0130696.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>E2 Effects on Insulin Sensitivity</title><p>An increase in the late-phase insulin response of the IVGTT (AUC<sub>60&#x02013;120</sub>) is observed when cats gain body weight in excess of ideal [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In accord with this, the AUC<sub>60&#x02013;120</sub> plasma insulin observations during the Vh treatments were positively correlated with body weight, which greatly differed among cats. Reduction in insulin sensitivity with weight gain in the non-diabetic is believed to account for an increased late-phase insulin response [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The present IVITT results support this belief.</p><p>Insulin sensitivity was measured as the fractional rate of glucose disappearance from plasma 15 minutes after IV insulin administration. This measure of insulin sensitivity was evaluated in lieu of other indicators because it directly measures a response to exogenously administered insulin, as is done with the more invasive measures of insulin sensitivity, the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (EHC) [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and some forms of the Bergman Minimal Model, frequently-sampled IVGTT [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In humans, the insulin sensitivity indicated by the IVITT significantly correlates with insulin sensitivity indicated by the EHC, a reputed &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; measure [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A similar validation of the IVITT insulin sensitivity index in cats is lacking. However, the presently determined k<sub><italic>ivitt</italic></sub> values correlated well with previously reported &#x0201c;measures&#x0201d; of insulin sensitivity in cats (<xref rid="pone.0130696.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Further, in the present study, insulin sensitivity indexes, <italic>k</italic>

The heaviest cats were the least insulin sensitive and the lightest cats were the most insulin sensitive as has been previously reported using different measures of insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Unexpectedly, the insulin sensitivity index (k<sub>ivitt</sub>) during E2 treatment was not significantly different from that during Vh treatment. This finding would appear to contrast with that seen in humans and in rodent models that lack endogenous E2 secretion (i.e. post-menopausal or ovariectomized). In these other species, E2 enhances insulin sensitivity, ameliorates insulin resistance, and has a protective effect against the development of type 2 DM [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is possible that a greater number of animals and\or a more sensitive measure of insulin sensitivity may have shown a significant effect of E2 at the dose presently used. A post-hoc analysis of our observations on k<sub>ivitt</sub> indicated that the experimental design was of sufficient power (&#x003b2; = 0.8) to detect a 25% difference in k<sub>ivitt</sub> with treatment (&#x003b1; = 0.05).</p><p>However, a high or parenteral dosage of E2 may be required to produce an effect on insulin sensitivity in neutered cats. The oral E2 dosage used did not significantly increase systemic venous E2 concentration. Physiological effects of exogenous E2 appear to vary with dosage. While not reporting on food intake, Michael and Scott [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] showed that by increasing subcutaneous E2 dosage, the latency between E2 administration and observation of estrus in cats decreases to a minimum. Cave et al. [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showed that the lowest effective subcutaneous dose of E2 to reduce food intake was not sufficient to cause vaginal cytological changes consistent with estrus nor obvious estrus behavior. Additional studies are required to evaluate the effects of route of administration and dosage of E2, within physiological bounds, on insulin sensitivity. When conducting such studies, variables not controlled in the present study should be considered. Research in rodents indicates effects of exogenous E2 may vary with the age of neutering, time of E2 initiation following neutering, and duration of E2 dosing after neutering [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Our finding of a decreased late-phase insulin response with no substantive effect on indices of glucose tolerance might be explained by an E2-mediated enhanced glucose effectiveness. Glucose effectiveness, which refers to the ability of glucose to enhance its own uptake and suppress endogenous production [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], was not evaluated in the present study. Additionally, the decreased insulin response with E2 treatment could have reflected reduced hepatic glucose production. Orally administered E2 can increase hepatic insulin sensitivity and insulin suppression of hepatic glucose production with no observable peripheral effect [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>E2 effects on Physical Activity</title><p>In this study, there was no significant effect of orally administered E2 on physical activity (<xref rid="pone.0130696.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).

We propose that a significant correlation between activity and body fat may have been detected if the cats had a uniform distribution in body fat.</p><p>In this study, physical activity was measured but not in lieu of energy expenditure. In ovariectomized mice, oral E2 administration decreases adiposity by increasing energy expenditure [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This effect of E2 is not known in cats. Here, we elected to evaluate physical activity by allowing daily social interaction with the opportunity for exercise. Decreased physical activity is a major risk factor in the development of feline DM [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and E2 treatment reputedly increases physical activity in rodent models [<xref rid="pone.0130696.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Measurement of energy expenditure would be useful for evaluating effects of E2 on energy homeostasis in cats and is therefore a worthy subject of future study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Exogenous E2 administered orally at a dosage of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg/day moderately reduced <italic>ad libitum</italic> food intake in overweight neutered male cats. The dosage was not supraphysiological nor emulating of the pre-gonadectomy condition as indicated from plasma E2 concentrations. The late-phase insulin response of the glucose tolerance test was reduced by approximately 1/3 with E2 treatment, and in accord with previous reports, the late-phase insulin response increased with body weight. Insulin sensitivity decreased with increasing body weight, also in accord with previous reports, but unlike in rodent models, insulin sensitivity was not significantly changed by E2 treatment. The E2 treatment had no significant effects on glucose tolerance and physical activity. We propose that oral E2 at the dose used may affect secretion or removal of insulin, and that it may enhance glucose disposal independent of insulin sensitivity. We suggest additional work in this feline model to determine if E2 increases glucose effectiveness and if increasing E2 dosage within a physiological range will increase insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and physical activity as observed in other species.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Kaoru Tsuruta for her technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0130696.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
