Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is defined as one episode of nausea or vomiting within the first 24 h of surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Overall incidence of PONV is in the range of 25&#x02013;30%, with severe intractable PONV in approximately 0.18% of all patients undergoing surgery.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Anesthetic factors contributing to PONV are opioids, anesthetic gases, and reversal of muscle relaxation with neostigmine in case of general anesthesia. The incidence of PONV is 10&#x02013;20% in regional anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The consequences of PONV include delay in oral intake leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, cardiac rhythm disturbances, and increased intracranial and intraocular tension. Aspiration of gastric contents in the perioperative period is also an important concern.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a leading cause of unexpected admission to hospital following planned day surgery and delay in discharge.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Additional oxygen reduces the incidence of PONV by preventing the subtle intestinal ischaemia caused by anesthesia or surgery.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, additional oxygen often fails to show its beneficial effect in low perfusion states. Preoperatively most patients are hypovolemic due to long overnight fasting and bowel preparation. Most of the studies used volume preloading with Hartman's solution or colloids[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] before induction of anesthesia and plasmalyte[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and hetastarch[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] for prevention of PONV. Results of these studies are mostly conflicting. Primary hypothesis behind the present study is to show the beneficial effect of intraoperative normal saline volume infusion in addition to fasting requirement for prevention of PONV without preloading before induction of anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After approval of institutional ethical committee, eighty ASA 1 and 2 adult patients of both sexes undergoing elective nonlaparoscopic surgeries (total mastectomy with axillary clearance, epigastric, and inguinal hernia repairs, open cholecystectomy, appendectomy) of 60&#x02013;120 min under general anesthesia were included in this double blind randomized trial. They were randomly allocated to either the high infusion group H (10 mL/kg) (<italic>n</italic>=40) or the low infusion group L (4 mL/kg) (<italic>n</italic>=40) using the Tippet random chart. The fluid infusion was in addition to the fasting requirement of the patients. Fasting requirement of fluid was calculated by 4-2-1 formula. The postoperative monitoring and the questioning were conducted by an anesthesiologist blinded to the intraoperative fluid regimen. Patients with Koivuranta's[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] score 1.95 or more were included in this study. Koivuranta's scoring system for PONV is an equation in which PONV = -2.21+.93g+0.82 h+0.59 ms+0.61 ns+0.75 d, where g = 1 for female and 0 for male, <italic>h</italic> = 1 if history of PONV is present and 0 if absent, ms = 1 if history of motion sickness present and 0 if absent, ns = 1 if nonsmoker and 0 if smoke and ds = duration of surgery over 60 min. Exclusion criteria were emergency surgery, patients on antiemetic medication and those with renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, and neurological dysfunctions.</p><p>An informed consent was obtained from all patients after explaining the risk involved and benefits of the study in their own language. In the operating room standard 5 leads electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure and pulse oxymetry were attached and baseline hemodynamic parameters were recorded. Two intravenous lines (16 G and 18 G) were secured in upper limbs and crystalloid (normal saline) was started for fasting requirement before the study fluid. Intravenous morphine 0.1 mg/kg was given for analgesia and anesthesia was induced with intravenous thiopentone 5 mg/kg and tracheal intubation was facilitated with intravenous vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (70:30). No propofol or antiemetic medication was given in intraoperative period. Intraoperative hypotension (decrease in mean arterial blood pressure by 20&#x02013;30% of preoperative value for more than 10 min duration) and blood loss greater than 10% of estimated blood volume were noted. Diclofenac 1 mg/kg was given at end of surgery for post operative analgesia. Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with intravenous neostigmine 50 mcg/kg and glycopyrrolate 10 mcg/kg. No opioid was given at end of surgery and in postanesthesia care unit (PACU). All patients were given supplemental oxygen [FiO<sub>2</sub> 0.5] in PACU by venture mask. Severity of PONV was assessed by 5-point verbal descriptive scale (VDS)[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in which 0 = no nausea, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, and 4 = unbearable nausea. Postoperatively sedation was assessed with McMillan[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] sedation scoring system (1 = alert, 2 = awake but calm, 3 = drowsy but responding to verbal or tactile stimulation and 4 = asleep). Ondansetron (4 mg i.v.) was given if the VDS score was 3 or more. This was given only after ruling out all other causes of PONV such as hypoxia, hypotension, hypovolemia etc. Statistical analysis was done by using the Mann Whitney U test and the t test. A <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>This study was done in a double blind, prospective randomized manner in 80 patients scheduled to undergo elective non laparoscopic surgeries under general anesthesia.

These include medications, perioperative hydration, and acupressure.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The various drugs used includes phenothiazines, serotonin receptor antagonists, butyrophenones, antihistamines, and glucocorticoids.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In this study it was planned to find out the effect of intraoperative supplemental normal saline on PONV. To demonstrate a statistically significant decrease in PONV, we planned the study in a population susceptible to PONV. Apfel,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Koivuranta,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Palazzo[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] use the scoring systems to identify such a population. These systems use the following as predictor variables: female gender, history of motion sickness or previous PONV, smoking, duration of surgery, and opioid use.</p><p>All three systems are of comparable accuracy. We used Koivuranta's system for its ease of use and accuracy.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] This system takes into consideration female gender, history of PONV, history of motion sickness, smoking, and duration of surgery over 60 min.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This study was conducted in patients undergoing elective surgeries, throughout the year, encompassing all four seasons.</p><p>A total of 40 patients were included in each group. The low volume group had a 72.5% incidence of vomiting while the high volume group had a 30% incidence only. The difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.0003). This result is in accordance with Magner <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] who studied 141 ASA I females with 10 and 30 mL/kg of crystalloids. They found that the incidence of vomiting was less in the crystalloid-30group as compared to the crystalloid-10group (8.6% <italic>vs</italic>. 25.7%). The incidence of vomiting in 10 mL/kg (group H) in this study is comparable to the incidence of the 10 mL/kg group of Magner's study, but hyperchloraemic acidosis, 6% decrease in functional residual capacity, and 10% decrease in diffusing capacity was recorded in Magner's study. Also excessive fluid administration may result in pulmonary edema, electrolyte imbalance, cerebral edema, and death.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The possibility of these adverse effects made us undertake the study with lower fluid volumes. The incidence of number of emetic episodic were also significantly more in the group receiving less fluid (<italic>P</italic>=0.00004). This may be because of the gut hypoperfusion.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Intraoperative gut hypoperfusion is a risk factor for postoperative nausea and vomiting that may be due to an increase in 5-HT <sub>3</sub> in the gut mucosa.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Plasma volume expansion is associated with maintenance of gut perfusion and reduction in postoperative morbidity including postoperative nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Causes of PONV can be central or peripheral. Central sensory stimuli are transmitted by the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), area postrema, and nucleus of the solitary tract to the vomiting center. The CTZ contains opioid and dopamine (D<sub>2</sub>) receptors which are emetogenic. Stimuli are relayed from the gut to the vomiting center via the vagus nerve that is a peripheral cause.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Use of opioids is associated with increased incidence of PONV.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Junger <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] showed that administration of nitrous oxide increased the risk of PONV more than two-folds. Incidence of PONV with the newer volatile anesthetics (isoflurane and sevoflurane) was similar (30%) in a study by Apfel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Neuromuscular blocking agents do not affect the incidence of PONV[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] but antagonism of residual neuromuscular block with neostigmine and atropine does result in increased emesis despite the antiemetic property of atropine.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>A number of investigators have shown that childhood after infancy and early adulthood are associated with an increased incidence of PONV.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The limitation of this study is that we could not analyze the effect of age as majority of patients were adults. BMI has not been proven to be a consistent risk factor for PONV.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Body weight was not a significant risk factor in this study.</p><p>Sedation scores were comparable between the two groups at all time intervals. This eliminated the possibility of the sedation causing a decreased incidence of vomiting. The PONV scores were significantly different at all time intervals between the two groups. The difference was maximal at the 2 h postoperative period. None of the patients in this study had any complications because of the fluid administration.</p><p>Koivuranta <italic>et al</italic>. found that ASA I patients were more predisposed to PONV compared to ASA III.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Including only ASA grade I and II patients is the limitation of this study. Also NPO period was found to be marginally significant in our study. This could have been a cause of the increased incidence of vomiting in the lower volume group. To find out the significance of the NPO period, either a larger sample should be taken for the study or the NPO duration should be similar for all the patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From the current study it was concluded that patients who received larger volume of crystalloid intraoperatively have lesser incidence of PONV. We found that the incidence of PONV and emetic episodes were less in patients who were given 10 mL/kg of normal saline intravenously compared to patients who received 4 mL/kg of normal saline.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
