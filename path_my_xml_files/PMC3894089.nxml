This can be achieved by plaque control, both mechanical and chemical. Mechanical plaque control, although appears simple, cannot be properly practiced by most individuals. Limitations of the brushing techniques is the inability to access interproximal areas and the need for additional aids like floss or an interdental brush to prevent plaque accumulation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] A systematic review of the effectiveness of self-performed mechanical plaque removal in adults with gingivitis concluded that the quality of the mechanical plaque control was not sufficiently effective in reducing gingivitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Moreover, mechanical plaque control concentrates primarily on the tooth surfaces, whereas microorganisms that accumulate on multiple soft tissue surfaces also serve as a source of bacteria for the colonization of tooth surfaces.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Introduction of chemical agents have taken care of the drawbacks of mechanical plaque control. The most popular agent till date in terms of efficacy and safety is Chlorhexidine (CHX). CHX is a water-soluble, cationic biguanide that binds to the negatively charged bacterial cell wall, altering the bacterial cell osmotic equilibrium. At low concentrations, CHX affects membrane integrity, but at high concentrations, cytoplasmic contents precipitate, resulting in cell death. It has a broad activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, facultative anaerobes and aerobes, yeast, and some lipid-enveloped viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] CHX is commercially available at a variety of concentrations (0.1%, 0.12% and 0.2%) and formulations (with and without alcohol).</p><p>Although it contains alcohol, which is beneficial as a dissolvent as well as an antiseptic, it can cause pain and can be carcinogenic, and cannot be used in patients where alcohol is unacceptable or contraindicated. The advent of alcohol free mouthrinses has overcome these disadvantages and many studies have shown their efficacy and lack of side effects.</p><p>A number of studies have been performed on the rinsing time and effective plaque inhibition of CHX mouthrinses. Keijser <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] showed that plaque inhibition by rinsing 15mL of 0.12% CHX for 30s was comparable to rinsing with 10mL of 0.2% for 60s. In another study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] no significant difference was observed in the level of plaque, irrespective of whether the subjects rinsed for 15, 30, or 60s with 0.2% CHX. A recent study by Van Strydonck <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] found that rinsing with 0.12% CHX (alcohol free) for 30s was not significantly different from rinsing with 0.2% CHX (alcohol base) for 60s. A study on optimal rinsing time for intraoral distribution of erythrosine-containing mouthwash showed that rinsing for 30s was sufficient for all plaque covered surfaces of the dentition to come in contact with the mouth wash.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>CHX is prescribed for both short- term and long- term use. The drawbacks of CHX include tooth staining and alteration in the taste perception, preventing long-term use. It is clear that better patient compliance is possible with shorter rinsing times. We set forth to determine whether rinsing times shorter than 30s could achieve adequate plaque inhibition by evaluating the intraoral spread of two commercially available CHX mouth rinses &#x02013; 0.1% CHX with alcohol(CHX+Alc) versus 0.2% CHX without alcohol(CHX-Alc).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was designed as a single blind, randomized two group parallel experiment using two different mouth rinses. A total of 30 dental students (15male and 15female), who attended the Department of Periodontics, Thai Moogambigai Dental College and Hospital, were recruited for the study. The study was planned with a sample size of 15 subjects, with a true difference of 0.06 and a standard deviation of 0.07 in the plaque index scale (Turesky modification of the Quigley&#x02013;Hein index) with 80% power and with an a error of 0.05 that could be observed. All the subjects were appraised about the product, and the purpose of the study, and oral instructions were given prior to the experimental period. Students without a minimum of five evaluable teeth per quadrant, with fixed or removable prostheses, extensive carious lesions, multiple cervical restorations, antibiotic or other medication consumption in the last two months that might interfere with oral hygiene, presence of periodontal problems, adverse reaction to CHX and the ones taking special diets were excluded from the study. The Ethical Committee of our university approved the study and written consent was obtained from all the participants.</p><p>In order to disclose the plaque, erythrosine-containing disclosing agent was added to both the mouthrinses. Alcohol-containing 0.1% CHX (Eludril;Win Medicare Pvt. Ltd, India.) was assigned as Group I and alcohol - free 0.2% CHX (Rexidin;Warren, Indoco Remedies Ltd,India.) as Group II. The participants were randomly allocated to Group I and Group II (15 in each group) and advised not to follow any form of plaque control for 72h to allow for free plaque accumulation on all the tooth surfaces. On their subsequent visit, Group I subjects were asked to rinse with 30mL of solution I(as per manufacturer's instructions) for 10 s, following which plaque was scored (Quigley hein plaque index[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] as modified by Turesky <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and further modified by Lobene <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]). Then, they were asked to rinse for another 10 s(total rinsing time of 20s), followed by plaque measurements. This was repeated for another 10s (total rinsing time of 30s) and the new plaque scores were noted. The Group II participants were asked to rinse with 10mL of solution II (as per manufacturer's guidelines) for three consecutive periods of 10s (rinsing time of 10, 20 and 30s) and plaque scores were calculated at the end of each rinsing session. At the end of the experiment, professional cleaning was done on all subjects to remove the remaining plaque and disclosing agent.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Mean plaque scores were calculated and was used as the primary outcome variable. Student's t-tests were performed to compare all the rinsing sessions within each group and also to compare the various rinsing times between the groups. Explorative analysis was carried out to calculate the mean plaque scores for the upper and lower jaws and the different tooth surfaces for both the groups. However, no statistical interpretation regarding significance was evaluated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows the comparison of mean values between the different time points in Group I (0.1% CHX+Alc). Comparison between 10 and 20 and,10 and 30s are statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001), but no significance was observed between 20 and 30s, whereas in Group II (0.2% CHX- Alc), comparison between all the time points are statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].

Moreover, for prolonged use, shorter rinsing times lesser than 60s are more likely to gain patient compliance. Van der Weijden <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] tested 15, 30,and 60s rinsing times on the level of plaque over a 72h non-brushing period, and no significant difference was observed in plaque levels in all the three periods.</p><p>The intention of our study was to compare the intraoral distribution of 0.1% CHX with alcohol with 0.2% CHX without alcohol at shorter rinsing times (10, 20 and 30s). Erythrosine was chosen for this study as it easily discloses plaque. Moreover, it has FDA approval and is readily available.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The primary outcome measure was intraoral distribution of both the mouthrinses at shorter rinsing times and the secondary outcome measure included comparison of the spread of mouthrinse on the vestibular and oral tooth surfaces.</p><p>The results show that intraoral distribution of both the groups at 10 and 30s is comparable but at 20s, it is statistically significant. In Group II (0.2% CHX-Alc), there is a statistically significant difference when the 10s rinsing session was compared with20 and 30s. This suggests that 10s is not sufficient for the mouthrinse to reach all the plaque-covered surfaces. Moreover, it is well understood that subsequent plaque scores obtained after each rinsing session represent a cumulative effect of mouthrinse in the mouth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Although, traditionally, it has been shown that rinsing for 60s with 10mL of 0.2% CHX is effective, our results show that 30s achieves good intraoral spread for plaque inhibition. This result also agrees with the results of Paraskevas <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] who showed that rinsing for 30s is sufficient in order for plaque-covered surfaces of the dentition to come in contact with the mouthrinse. In Group I (0.1% CHX+Alc), no statistical significance was noted between 20 and 30s. Therefore, it is clear that rinsing for 20s was sufficient to disclose the plaque-covered surfaces. Bonesvoll and Germo[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] showed that plaque inhibition by CHX is dose dependent and that similar plaque inhibitions can be achieved with larger volumes of lower concentration solutions. Therefore, it is possible that rinsing a larger volume (30mL) of solution has a better intraoral distribution than 10mL for the same time period. Keijser <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] showed that concentrations of 0.12% CHX appear as effective as 0.2% if the volume of the rinse was increased from 10 to 15mL, giving an 18 mg dose on each occasion. Similarly, we can assume that concentrations of 30 mL of 0.1% CHX with the 15mg dose appear as effective as 0.2%.</p><p>The explorative analysis shows that the amount of stained plaque on the lingual surfaces is less when compared with the vestibular surfaces in Group I. Our results are in accordance with older studies,(Ramsey <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>], Vander Weijden <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>], Claydon <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]), which showed the inability of the mouth wash to reach the lingual surfaces. However, in Group I, stained plaque on the lingual surfaces were greater than that on the vestibular surfaces. One possible explanation would be that the increased volume (30mL) of CHX was able to reach the lingual surfaces better than 10 or 15mL.</p><p>The addition of alcohol serves many purposes: as a vehicle, as an antiseptic, to stabilize certain active ingredients and also to improve the shelf-life of the product. Concerns linking oral cancer and alcohol-containing mouthrinses are high, although there is not much scientific evidence. The accepted concentration of alcohol content in CHX mouthrinses by theFDA is 11.6%. Although Eludril has 45% alcohol, when diluted to 30mL, it has only 7.4%. Non-alcohol-containing CHX have fewer side-effects, but are less-effective. Data regarding intraoral distribution of alcohol-containing and non-alcohol mouthrinses are unavailable, but one study has shown that both are effective in controlling plaque and reducing gingival inflammation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to have compared the intraoral spread of alcohol and non-alcohol-containing mouthrinses. Our study shows that (CHX+Alc) achieves better intraoral spread at 20 s than (CHX-Alc).</p><p>Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that rinsing for 30 s with 0.2% CHX- Alc (Rexidin) is enough for intraoral spread of the mouthrinse, whereas rinsing with 0.1% CHX + Alc (Eludril) achieves the same effect in 20s, for effective plaque inhibition, both of which will have a positive influence on patient compliance.
