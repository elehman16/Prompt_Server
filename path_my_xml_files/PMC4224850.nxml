AI438011 is an ongoing, Phase IIb, randomized, active-controlled trial investigating the safety, efficacy and dose&#x02013;response of BMS-663068 vs. atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) in treatment-experienced (TE), HIV-1-positive subjects. At Week 24, response rates across the BMS-663068 arms were consistent with ATV/r.</p></sec><sec id="st2_19530"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Antiretroviral TE subjects (exposure to &#x02265;1 antiretroviral for &#x02265;1 week) with susceptibility to all study drugs (including BMS-626529 IC<sub>50</sub> 100 nM) were randomized equally to four BMS-663068 arms (400 or 800 mg, BID; 600 or 1200 mg, QD) and a control arm (ATV/r 300/100 mg QD), with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) + raltegravir (RAL). The complete safety profile through Week 24 is reported.</p></sec><sec id="st3_19530"><title>Results</title><p>In total, 251 subjects were treated (BMS-663068, 200; ATV/r, 51). No BMS-663068-related adverse events (AEs) led to discontinuation. Grade 2&#x02013;4 drug-related AEs occurred in 17/200 (8.5%) subjects across the BMS-633068 arms; however, these events were mostly single instances and no dose-relationship was seen. Similarly, no noticeable trend for Grade 3&#x02013;4 laboratory abnormalities was seen and Grade 3&#x02013;4 hematologic changes and liver chemistry elevations were uncommon (neutropenia, 2.5%; AST/ALT elevations, 1% (<italic>n</italic>=196)). In the ATV/r arm, Grade 2&#x02013;4 drug-related AEs occurred in 14/51 (27.5%) subjects and were mostly secondary to gastrointestinal and/or hepatobiliary disorders. Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 13/200 (6.5%) and 5/51 (9.8%) subjects receiving BMS-663068 and ATV/r, respectively; most were secondary to infections and none were related to study drugs. The most common AE reported for BMS-663068 was headache (28/200, 14%), occurring in 5/51 (10%) subjects in the ATV/r arm; in the BMS-663068 arms, this was not dose-related. There were no deaths.</p></sec><sec id="st4_19530"><title>Conclusions</title><p>BMS-663068 was generally well tolerated across all arms, with no related SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation and no dose-related safety signals. There were no trends for Grade 2&#x02013;4 AEs or clinical laboratory abnormalities. These results support continued development of BMS-663068.</p></sec><sec id="st5_19530"><title>Note</title><p>Previously submitted at IDWeek, Philadelphia, PA, 8 October 2014.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
