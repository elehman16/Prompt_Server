Presently, from the available clinical trial data, we can inform patients that after 2&#x02005;years of treatment, they have a mean chance of gaining 7.6&#x02013;9.1 letters, a 30%&#x02013;40% chance of gaining &#x02265;3 lines of vision, and a &#x0223c;10% chance of losing &#x02265;3 lines of vision.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, it is difficult to identify upfront which patients will do well and which will fare poorly.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Currently, no validated models exist to help retina specialists predict how different subgroups will respond to treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Patients desire to know as much as possible about their prognosis upon diagnosis, as do physicians, hence, the interest in finding predictors of treatment outcomes with anti-VEGF therapy.</p><p>Herein, we report a new analysis from the HARBOR trial of ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, California, USA) in wAMD, which suggests that low-luminance visual acuity (LLVA) assessment at baseline may have utility in estimating a patient's potential for vision improvement with anti-VEGF monotherapy. We will refer to best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) assessed under optimal illumination as &#x02018;BCVA&#x02019; and to BCVA assessed under low luminance as &#x02018;LLVA&#x02019;. LLVA has been shown to be predictive of visual acuity (VA) loss in patients with geographic atrophy, the atrophic or &#x02018;dry&#x02019; form of late-stage AMD.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The objective was to investigate if the baseline relationship of LLVA to BCVA has any clinically meaningful correlation with treatment outcomes in patients with wAMD enrolled in HARBOR.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Our hypothesis was that a greater drop in vision under the &#x02018;stress&#x02019; of low-luminance conditions may be a manifestation of more advanced disease and, therefore, the magnitude of the gap between BCVA and LLVA at baseline may be a predictor of a wAMD patient's capacity for visual function improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>HARBOR (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00891735) was a 24-month, phase III, randomised, multicentre, double-masked, dose-response study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5&#x02005;mg monthly (n=275), 0.5&#x02005;mg as needed (PRN) (n=275), 2.0&#x02005;mg monthly (n=274) or 2.0&#x02005;mg PRN (n=273) in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients &#x02265;50&#x02005;years of age with subfoveal neovascular AMD and baseline BCVA of 20/40 to 20/320 (Snellen equivalent).

These outcomes remained consistent even when patients were stratified by baseline BCVA, demonstrating that this is not a result of patients gaining more vision simply because they started with poorer baseline vision and had more potential letters to gain&#x02014;their gains were a manifestation of the degree of the gap. Regardless of baseline vision, patients with the largest gap always performed the worst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJOPHTHALMOL2015307575F3">figure 3</xref>). Patients with the narrowest gap had the highest percentage of three-line and six-line vision gainers, while those with the widest gap had the highest percentage of three-line and six-line losses at months 12 and 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJOPHTHALMOL2015307575F4">figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Our hypothesis was that a greater drop in vision under low luminance may be a manifestation of more advanced wAMD disease associated with more limited capacity for VA improvement. In our study, a wider BCVA&#x02013;LLVA gap was associated with significantly lesser vision gains with treatment. It should be noted that although the patients with the widest baseline BCVA&#x02013;LLVA gap consistently gained the least number of ETDRS letters, these patients still had much better vision outcomes compared to the sham group from the MARINA study, in which patients lost on average nearly three lines of vision throughout 2&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Measuring the BCVA&#x02013;LLVA gap is straightforward and could potentially better characterise the wAMD patient population. Limitations of the HARBOR analysis are the lack of a comparison sham group and inclusion of only treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients. Additional data are needed to confirm if the BCVA&#x02013;LLVA gap is predictive of treatment response in previously treated patients.</p><p>The search for clinical biomarkers in wAMD has produced a number of important observations. Sunness and colleagues reported that in patients with geographic atrophy, the low-luminance deficit at baseline was a strong predictor of subsequent VA loss.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In wAMD, younger age, better baseline VA and smaller CNV lesions have a strong association with better final VA in response to anti-VEGF treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Patients with the &#x02018;T&#x02019; allele in tSNP rs3025000<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> or a darker iris colour<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> also tend to experience better visual outcomes with anti-VEGF therapy. Predictors for suboptimal response include diabetes mellitus,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> initial fibrovascular and serous pigment epithelial detachment,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> predominantly or minimally classic lesions,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and high-risk alleles in CFH, ARMS2 and VEGF-A.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> OCT studies have also revealed anatomic response factors, including photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment junction (IS/OS) status.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> While IS/OS and external limiting membrane (ELM) integrity have been shown to be correlated with final photoreceptor integrity in wAMD, they were not analysed in the HARBOR study.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In our study, patients with the largest BCVA&#x02013;LLVA gap appeared to have more advanced disease manifested by significantly larger CNV lesions<bold>,</bold> more subretinal fluid and more classic lesions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BJOPHTHALMOL2015307575TB1">table 1</xref>).</p><p>The slow increase in light sensitivity is called the dark-adaptation process and is related to the rate of regeneration of photopigments and to the intracellular concentration of calcium. However, we can only speculate about the nature of the molecular defect(s) underlying the striking correlation between the BCVA&#x02013;LLVA gap and BCVA gain in response to anti-VEGF treatment. Dark adaptation may be impaired very early in wAMD and may be a functional stressor to the photoreceptors. It has been previously demonstrated that fellow eyes in patients with wAMD with relatively slow foveal dark-adaptation rates were especially likely to develop subretinal neovascularisation.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Fellow eyes with normal VA of patients with unilateral wAMD tend to have foveal cones that are normal in number but function abnormally.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> It may be that as the disease progresses and photoreceptors become more compromised, dark adaptation becomes progressively impaired. Eyes with early wAMD and less photoreceptor damage may be expected to perform relatively better under low-luminance conditions and have a smaller gap.</p><p>In the HARBOR trial, LLVA was tested immediately after BCVA. Adaptation time was not prespecified in the protocol. Therefore one possibility is that the BCVA&#x02013;LLVA gap is a reflection of patients&#x02019; ability for rapid dark adaptation (first 10&#x02005;min). The early rapid phase of dark adaptation is cone mediated.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Our patients with the widest BCVA&#x02013;LLVA gap had the most subretinal fluid. The photoreceptors are expected to die when detachment separates them from the retinal pigment epithelium and the choriocapillaris, their source of oxygen and nutrients.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> It is likely that the smallest BCVA&#x02013;LLVA gap patients had healthier photoreceptors with greater potential for functional recovery, while patients with the widest BCVA&#x02013;LLVA gap may have had greater degrees of photoreceptor cell death making visual recovery much less likely. Patients with larger CNV lesions likely had more photoreceptor and ELM destruction and lower likelihood of structural and functional recovery.</p><p>Since all HARBOR patients had subfoveal wAMD, it is likely that a significant number of cone cells were already lost or in a state of distress. Therefore the BCVA&#x02013;LLVA gap could be a measure of the degree of foveal cone cell dysfunction in wAMD, which is also associated with SD-OCT qualitative pathologic structural abnormalities. Dark adaptation deteriorates with age.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In our analysis, there was no imbalance in age across the BCVA&#x02013;LLVA quartiles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BJOPHTHALMOL2015307575TB1">table 1</xref>), suggesting that the natural process of ageing did not drive the differences.</p><p>In summary, the difference between BCVA measured under standard and low-luminance conditions (BCVA&#x02013;LLVA gap) at baseline was a potent predictor of VA outcomes in patients with wAMD treated with ranibizumab enrolled in the HARBOR trial. The significance of our study is its demonstration that, in a large representative wAMD population, a relatively simple, inexpensive, and straightforward functional test, the measurement of the baseline BCVA&#x02013;LLVA gap, yields specific subgroup predictive capability with a high degree of statistical significance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Third-party writing assistance for this manuscript was provided by Grace H.
