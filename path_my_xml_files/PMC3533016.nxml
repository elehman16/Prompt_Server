Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is further hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>, which is considered to reflect the vitamin D status of an individual patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> The final activation to the active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>) requires 1-&#x003b1;-hydroxylase activity. This enzyme (also designated CYP27B1) is expressed in the kidney but also in many other cell-types, including epithelial and immune cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> The active vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>) binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which belongs to the nuclear receptor family. Active vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is only present in minute amounts in the circulation and local activation in target cells is crucial for vitamin D-mediated effects on the immune system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p><p>Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> are associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6 R7 R8">6&#x02013;8</xref> and respiratory tract infections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> The mechanism is not fully elucidated but vitamin D<sub>3</sub> has been shown to induce antimicrobial peptides in immune cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> In addition, active vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>) has broad anti-inflammatory effects on the adaptive immune system by shifting the T helper cell pool from a Th1/Th17-response to a Th2/Treg-dominated response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>

Results from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where the effects of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> on infections have been investigated (reviewed by Yamshchikov <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) are not conclusive and larger clinical trials are therefore warranted.</p><p>We designed a study to test the hypothesis that 4000&#x02005;IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> given daily to patients with antibody deficiency and frequent respiratory tract infections for 1&#x02005;year could prevent or ameliorate infections.

The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee and the Swedish Medical Product Agency and was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. The study was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> prior to inclusion of the first patient (NCT01131858). The EudraCT number is 2009-011758-16. The full protocol is available from the corresponding author upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size was based on the assumption that the intervention would reduce the number of days with symptoms from 42 (210 points) to 28&#x02005;days (140 points), that is, a reduction of the infectious burden by 30%. Given this assumption, a sample size of 60 patients per study group was predicted to provide the study 90% power at a significance level of p=0.02 (Student's t test). To compensate for predicted exclusion of participants, the groups were increased to include 70 patients per treatment arm. Importantly, the significance level of p=0.02 was chosen in the power calculation to ensure that a sufficient number of patients were recruited in order to avoid a type II error in the primary analysis. However, the conventional and widely accepted significance level of p=0.05 was used for statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients at the Immunodeficiency Unit, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden, were included between March and June 2010 by the study nurses (SH, ML and KJ). Inclusion criteria were age 18&#x02013;75&#x02005;years and an increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections; that is, &#x0003e;42&#x02005;days with symptoms from the respiratory tract during a 12-month period prior to study inclusion. Patients registered at the Immunodeficiency Unit are closely followed up with a diary of symptoms and antibiotic consumption. Thus, the patients are trained and used to apply such an instrument to assess their infectious status. Data from patients&#x02019; standard diary were used as an instrument in order to assess patients for eligibility, both via telephone and by the responsible physician (PB and ACN) prior to inclusion. Patients with selective IgA-deficiency (<italic>D80.2</italic>), IgG-subclass deficiency (<italic>D80.3</italic>) and common variable immune disorder (CVID, <italic>D83.0</italic>) as well as patients without a defined immunological diagnosis (<italic>D89.9</italic>) were included. Exclusion criteria were prophylactic treatment with antibiotics, history of hypercalcaemia or stones in the urinary tract, sarcoidosis, ongoing supplementation with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> exceeding 400&#x02005;IU/day, HIV-infection and pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Interventions</title><p>Patients were randomised to 12&#x02005;months&#x02019; treatment with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (Vigantol, 4000&#x02005;IU/day, Merck GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) or placebo oil. One drop contained 500&#x02005;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> or placebo oil (Miglyol oil, Merck GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) and the participants were asked to take eight drops daily. The participants had to mark their daily symptoms of infection in a diary, which was sent via regular mail to the study site every month. The following data were recorded: symptoms from the respiratory tract, ears and sinuses, treatment with antibiotics, numbers of bacterial cultures, times and reasons of visits to hospitals, frequency of travelling abroad and adherence to study drug.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was a composite infectious score, based on a daily patient-reported questionnaire and included five parameters: symptoms from the respiratory tract, ears and sinuses, malaise and use of antibiotics (see online supplementary figure S1), each parameter gave 1 point/day. The occurrence of x-ray verified pneumonia gave three additional points per day for a period of 7&#x02005;days. Thus, a pneumonia resulted in 3&#x000d7;7 points=21 extra points. Patients were specifically instructed to record only symptoms related to ongoing respiratory tract infections. Symptoms related to infections at other sites (urinary tract, wounds, etc) as well as non-infectious symptoms were reported as adverse events. Secondary outcomes were serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (at baseline and after 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x02005;months), numbers of bacterial cultures, microbiological findings and levels of antimicrobial peptides (LL-37 and HNP1-3) in nasal fluid (at baseline and after 6 and 12&#x02005;months). In addition, six post hoc genotype analyses were performed in all participants. Analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were carried out for VDR (Taq1 and Foq1), CYP27B1, CYP24A1, CYP2R1 and vitamin D binding protein (GC). Safety tests included plasma levels of creatine, calcium, phosphate and albumin, measured at baseline and after 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x02005;months. At inclusion, urine-HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) in women was measured and p-parathyroid hormone was measured in both genders. The results of the safety tests were reviewed by an independent and unblinded consultant physician. Two blinded physicians (PB and ACN) were responsible for inclusion and all medical visits to the study site (Immunodeficiency Unit, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomisation and statistical analysis</title><p>Participants were randomised to 12&#x02005;months&#x02019; treatment with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (Vigantol, 4000&#x02005;IU/day) or placebo oil. Block randomisation with a block size of ten was used to ascertain equal group sizes. Staff at Karolinska Trial Alliance was responsible for randomisation procedures. In the statistical analysis, continuous variables were compared using Mann-Whitney U test or linear regression and dichotomous variables by Fisher's exact test or logistic regression. Regressions of log-transformed infectious scores were performed both unadjusted (simple regression) and with adjustment for potential confounders (multiple regression).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical methods: primary analysis</title><p>The distribution of the infectious score was found to be skewed, thereby violating the normal assumption of the prespecified t test analysis. Hence, scores were log-transformed prior to analysis. Further, the randomisation had resulted in age distributions that were not entirely balanced between the two groups. Since there might be concerns that such imbalance could influence the results of the study, the original analysis plan was extended with a multivariable analysis adjusting for potential confounders. In this linear regression model based on log-transformed values of the primary outcome (the total infectious score) and its individual components, adjustment was made for age, gender, smoking, type of immune deficiency and significant comorbidities (respiratory or non-respiratory). Because of the transformation procedure, the adjusted effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is expressed as a ratio between the score in the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and the placebo group. In this multiplicative model, an effect size of 1 indicates identical outcome in the two study groups and statistically non-significant results are recognised by CIs encompassing the value 1.</p><p>To explore potential divergent effects on different organ systems, both adjusted and unadjusted analyses were repeated separately for each individual item of the infectious score. In addition, the temporal aspects of the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> effect were investigated by dividing the study period into four 90-day periods (starting on the first day of treatment) and repeating the analyses separately for each time period. &#x02018;Ear&#x02019; and &#x02018;sinus&#x02019; symptoms as well as &#x02018;antibiotic use&#x02019; occurred at low frequencies and for these entities normal distributions could not be achieved despite data transformation. Thus, the adjusted analyses of these individual items were based on multivariable logistic regression, after coding the symptom (or antibiotic therapy) as present or absent during the course of the study. However, this only applies to analysis of the individual items, and not to the primary analysis of the total infectious score, where all item scores were added as originally described.</p><p>Most postrandomisation exclusions were due to patients failing to fill out the symptoms diary. Hence, no intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis based on actual outcome data could be performed. However, the potential impact of dropouts was addressed in an ITT analysis based on multiple imputation of missing outcome data. In the imputation process, pooled estimates were derived from 100 datasets created by means of multivariate imputation by chained equations and predictive mean matching for the same covariates as in the adjusted per-protocol analysis.</p><p>Detailed descriptions of randomisation and blinding, sampling of nasal fluid, measurement of antimicrobial peptides, measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>, genotyping and statistical analyses of secondary outcomes are presented in the supplementary methods section.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline data</title><p>A total of 286 patients were first assessed for eligibility but 144 were not included because they did not fulfil all inclusion criteria; &#x0003c;42&#x02005;days with infection/year (n=35), lacked other inclusion criteria (n=42), or declined to participate (n=67). The remaining 142 patients were further screened and 140 patients were included in the study. Of these, 70 were randomised to vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation and 70 to placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012001663F1">figure 1</xref>). The groups did not differ with regard to gender, IgG replacement therapy, smoking, baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels, type of immune defect or comorbidities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001663TB1">table 1</xref>). Patients with subclass deficiency, selective IgA deficiency (sIgAD), CVID and patients without a defined immunological diagnosis (ND) but with &#x0003e;4 bacterial respiratory tract infections/year were included. IgG replacement therapy was most common in the CVID group (100%) and in the subclass deficiency group (63%), and also frequent in the other groups (ND, 54% and sIgAD, 38%, see online supplementary table S1). Patients allocated to the placebo group were slightly younger than patients in the treatment group (p=0.025, data not shown). During the course of the study, 16 patients left the study prematurely (8 patients from each study group) and consequently 124 patients were included in the main per-protocol analysis. Reasons for dropout included elevated parathyroid hormone (n=2), withdrawn consent (n=5), adverse events (n=1), prescription of vitamin D outside the study (n=1), failure to complete diary (n=4) or non-compliance to study medication (n=3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012001663F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2012001663F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study outline.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2012001663f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Primary endpoint: infectious score</title><p>One year of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> treatment was associated with a significantly reduced total infectious score both in the unadjusted (n=124, p=0.024; <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001663TB2">table 2</xref>) and in the adjusted analyses (n=124, p=0.040; <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001663TB2">table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012001663F2">figure 2</xref>A,B and see online supplementary table S2).

All point estimates favoured the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> group and a statistically significant effect was seen on both the total score and on the probability of receiving antibiotics (p&#x0003c;0.05). The effect on the infectious score was evident both in analysis per-protocol and according to ITT, and withstood adjustment for potential confounders. In addition, the number of bacterial cultures and microbiological findings was significantly reduced in the intervention group. These findings are potentially important and support that Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation may prevent respiratory tract infections and reduce antibiotic consumption, particularly in patients with hypogammaglobulinaemia or with an increased frequency of respiratory tract infections.</p><p>However, our study has several limitations: First, the choice of primary endpoint may be questioned since it relies solely on patient-reported information. To compensate for inherent problems with patient-reported data, the evaluation instrument was designed to cover many aspects of an infectious episode, including various symptoms as well as antibiotic consumption. Together the reported data formed an &#x02018;infectious score&#x02019;, which constituted the primary endpoint of the study. Similar composite scores have successfully been applied to different diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB-score<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), pneumonia (CURB-65<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) and bacterial meningitis (BMS-score<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Notably, vitamin D supplementation had a major effect on the odds of taking antibiotics during the study period (a reduction by 63.5%). In addition, the absolute number of days on antibiotics was reduced by 50% (from 33&#x02005;days in the placebo group to 16&#x02005;days in the intervention group), which was statistically significant both in the adjusted and unadjusted analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001663TB1">table 1</xref>). However, despite the relatively modest reduction for the other components of the primary endpoint the overall infectious score was significantly reduced&#x02014;mainly as a result of the large effect on the antibiotic parameter&#x02014;both in the unadjusted and in the adjusted analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001663TB1">table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012001663F2">figure 2</xref>). It is important to interpret the statistical significance in light of our power calculation, which was based on a significance level of p=0.02. In the power calculation, the significance level was reduced from 0.05 to 0.02 in order to increase the statistical power at the p=0.05 level. This approach was incorrect, and the targeted power (at the p=0.05 level) should instead have been increased without altering the p-value threshold. However, we have used the widely accepted significance level p=0.05 in the statistical analyses for both the primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. Another potential problem was that the patient population was very heterogeneous with regard to immune deficiency and concomitant diseases. We adjusted for these factors in the multivariable analyses of the primary endpoint, but the sample sizes in each subgroup were too small to draw any conclusions of effects in specific disease groups. However, a detailed post hoc analysis of the relation between immunological diagnosis, concomitant lung disease and the secondary endpoints &#x02018;taken bacterial cultures&#x02019;, &#x02018;positive bacterial&#x02019; cultures and &#x02018;microbiological findings&#x02019; was performed. There was a clear trend that vitamin D-treated patients with subclass deficiency and/or asthma produced fewer bacterial cultures, fewer positive cultures and fewer fungal cultures (see online supplementary tables S4 and S5 and figure S3). Although this analysis may lack precision by the small number of patients included, it could have clinical implications regarding target groups for vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation.</p><p>Nevertheless, our double-blind RCT has several strengths. For example, we chose a high daily dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> based on published calculations on metabolism and effects on immunity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Other RCTs using lower doses of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, 400&#x02013;2000&#x02005;IU/day, have mainly been negative with regard to the prevention of infections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> However, one study using 1200&#x02005;IU/day showed a significant reduction of influenza among school children in Japan.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> Notably, also studies using higher doses of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> have been negative. Martineau <italic>et al</italic> used 400&#x02005;000&#x02005;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> during 42&#x02005;days (9523&#x02005;IU/day) with the aim of shortening time to sputum conversion in tuberculosis. No significant effect on the primary endpoint could be observed in that study, except in a subgroup with the <italic>tt</italic> genotype in the VDR gene.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> A recent study investigated whether 100&#x02005;000&#x02005;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub>/month (3333&#x02005;IU/day) could reduce the incidence of COPD exacerbations. There was no significant effect on the primary endpoint, although a post hoc analysis revealed that patients with a low vitamin D<sub>3</sub> level at baseline had a significant effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></p><p>Importantly, our study is the first to utilise high daily doses for an extended period of one full year. Thus, we covered all four seasons, which was important in Sweden with a known seasonal variation in 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> Two previous RCTs were performed during the winter season&#x02014;when vitamin D levels are low&#x02014;but only during 4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> and 6&#x02005;months,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> respectively. Previous RCTs have been conducted during shorter periods; 42&#x02005;days,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> 6&#x02005;weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> and 12&#x02005;weeks,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> respectively. Interestingly, we observed a clear time-dependent effect suggesting that a long-term supplementation approach (&#x0003e;6&#x02005;months) may be necessary to affect immunity. To expand on the results of a previous study in healthy individuals where no difference between the intervention and placebo groups was observed,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> we chose a study population with frequent RTIs and at least 42&#x02005;days with infection during the year prior to inclusion. Notably, patients in the study represent a selected group of individuals with frequent RTI, although the immune disorders that they represent (sIgAD, IgG-subclass deficiency and patients with no defined immune disorder) are generally mild in character and dominated by mucosal RTIs. We also included a small number of CVID-patients, which can be considered to be a more severe immune disorder, but all these patients are treated with IgG replacement therapy and thus well controlled. Hence, the results from this study cannot directly be applied to the general healthy population. Nevertheless, the results provide solid support for additional interventional studies of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, especially in groups consuming large amounts of antibiotics.</p><p>The mechanism of the observed effects remains largely unknown. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> modulates the immune response at many levels, such as induction of AMPs, skewing of T-cells from Th1/Th17 to Tregs as well as general anti-inflammatory effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Here, we investigated the role of AMPs in nasal fluid. However, we could not detect any significant changes of LL-37 or HNP1-3 during the study period, but noted that placebo-treated patients tended to have higher levels of AMPs after 1&#x02005;year of treatment. This was paralleled by a shift of the microflora in the nasal compartment that could explain the unexpected finding of higher AMP-levels in the placebo group. Recently, it was shown that 1,25 (OH)<sub>2</sub>-vitamin D<sub>3</sub> induces both HNP1-3 and LL-37 in nasal fluid of healthy volunteers,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> supporting that LL-37 may indeed be induced in vivo. However, our study design did not allow such conclusions but rather support that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> affect mucosal immunity, leading to a shift of the microflora. Recently, we showed that the bacterial composition in nasal swabs is an important determinant of AMP-levels in nasal fluid.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></p><p>Given that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> induces LL-37 in epithelial cells and that LL-37 kills bacteria in vitro, we expected a reduction of the classical bacterial pathogens <italic>H influenza</italic>, <italic>M catharralis</italic> and <italic>S pneumonia</italic> in the intervention group. However, the frequency of these bacteria was not reduced but a reduction of <italic>S aureus</italic> and fungal species that often colonise the airways was observed. This could be explained by specific effects by vitamin D<sub>3</sub> on immunity against <italic>S aureus</italic>. In fact, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> induces human &#x003b2;-defensin-2 (HBD-2) with bactericidal activity against <italic>S aureus</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> A recent study showed that low vitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels were associated with an increased risk of being colonised by this bacterium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> Further, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> affects immunity against <italic>C albicans</italic>, which indicates direct effects of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> on human immunity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> Alternatively, it is possible that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> may have prevented symptomatic viral infections, which prompted patients to leave a bacterial sample from the airways. Interestingly, there is both mechanistic and clinical evidence that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> can prevent viral infections,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32 R33 R34">32&#x02013;34</xref> although we did not address this in the current study.</p><p>Notably, we observed a prominent increase in the serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>, which indicated good compliance and tolerability of the study drug. In fact, there was a trend towards adverse events being reported more often in the placebo group, suggesting that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> possibly could be efficient against other diseases, but this observation requires further studies. No clinically relevant changes of blood chemistry (calcium, phosphate, albumin or creatine) were observed. Despite few adverse events and high tolerability, 16 exclusions occurred during the study year. The main reason was problems to adhere to the protocol and 6/16 patients dropped out of the study after a few weeks. The rest failed to send in the diaries, did not leave blood for monitoring of safety parameters or did not take the study drug. One patient was excluded based on symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (facial paraesthesia). However, this patient was later confirmed to have been allocated to placebo.</p><p>In summary, we found that supplementation with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> reduced the total infectious score with 47 points per patient (23% reduction in the adjusted analysis) during the study year. The observed reduction was lower than the assumed reduction of 70 points per patient (predefined assumption: 210 points=&#x0003e;140 points; a reduction of 30%) that formed the basis for the power calculation. However, despite the predefined level of a reduction of infectious score by 30% as a clinically meaningful effect, we believe that effects lower than this also could be relevant for the individual patient. We base this line of reasoning on the fact that a reduction of 47 points per patient can be translated into 47&#x02005;days with cough (47 points), 23&#x02005;days with ear and sinus symptoms (23&#x000d7;2=46 points) or 9&#x02005;days with cough, sinus and ear symptoms together with malaise and antibiotics (9&#x000d7;5=45 points). In addition, our data indicate that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation reduces the odds of taking antibiotics by approximately 60% in patients with frequent respiratory tract infections. Thus, supplementation with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> could provide a novel strategy to reduce antibiotic use among high consumers and indirectly prevent the emerging epidemic of bacterial resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e276" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001663.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e277" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001663.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> PB designed the study, collected, analysed and interpreted data, wrote the paper.
