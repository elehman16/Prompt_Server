Antibiotics are a major component of treatment and are used both on a short or long-term basis. One aim of long-term or maintenance antibiotics is to reduce the frequency of acute pulmonary exacerbations and symptoms. However, there are few studies investigating the efficacy of long-term antibiotic use for CSLD and non-CF bronchiectasis among children. This study tests the hypothesis that azithromycin administered once a week as maintenance antibiotic treatment will reduce the rate of pulmonary exacerbations in Indigenous children with bronchiectasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>We are conducting a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial in Australia and New Zealand. Inclusion criteria are: Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, Maori or Pacific Island children aged 1 to 8&#x02009;years, diagnosed with bronchiectasis (or probable bronchiectasis) with no underlying disease identified (such as CF or primary immunodeficiency), and having had at least one episode of pulmonary exacerbation in the last 12&#x02009;months. After informed consent, children are randomised to receive either azithromycin (30&#x02009;mg/kg once a week) or placebo (once a week) for 12&#x02013;24&#x02009;months from study entry. Primary outcomes are the rate of pulmonary exacerbations and time to pulmonary exacerbation determined by review of patient medical records. Secondary outcomes include length and severity of pulmonary exacerbation episodes, changes in growth, school loss, respiratory symptoms, forced expiratory volume in 1-second (FEV<sub>1</sub>; for children &#x02265;6&#x02009;years), and sputum characteristics. Safety endpoints include serious adverse events. Antibiotic resistance in respiratory bacterial pathogens colonising the nasopharynx is monitored. Data derived from medical records and clinical assessments every 3 to 4&#x02009;months for up to 24&#x02009;months from study entry are recorded on standardised forms.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Should this trial demonstrate that azithromycin is efficacious in reducing the number of pulmonary exacerbations, it will provide a much-needed rationale for the use of long-term antibiotics in the medical management of bronchiectasis in Indigenous children.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12610000383066</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Azithromycin</kwd><kwd>Bronchiectasis</kwd><kwd>Child</kwd><kwd>Chronic suppurative lung disease</kwd><kwd>Indigenous health</kwd><kwd>Placebo</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary exacerbation</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Antibiotic resistance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Internationally, the burden of ill health from acute and chronic respiratory disease remains high in Indigenous populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. While childhood chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD), including bronchiectasis unrelated to underlying causes such as cystic fibrosis (CF) are much less common than a century ago, evidence is emerging of increasing prevalence in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These chronic pulmonary disorders remain important in low and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and within disadvantaged population groups in high-income nations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In these groups, bronchiectasis is associated with very high rates of childhood pneumonia and other acute respiratory infections (e.g. bronchiolitis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The prevalence of non-CF bronchiectasis among Indigenous children from remote communities in Australia is 1470/100,000 children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Equivalent rates for Maori and Pacific Island children in New Zealand and for Alaska Native children from the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta region are 63, 154 and 1400&#x02013;2000 per 100,000 children respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In contrast, the estimated prevalence rates of bronchiectasis amongst New Zealand children under 15&#x02009;years of age is 33 per 100,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Bronchiectasis is a disease characterized by abnormal irreversible bronchial dilatation, which is associated with chronic bacterial infection and inflammation. &#x02018;Symptoms&#x02019; include persistent &#x02018;moist&#x02019; cough, mucopurulent sputum, haemoptysis, and breathlessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The current &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; for diagnosis is confirmation by a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the chest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This investigation however, is not readily available in all settings. Bronchiectasis is considered within the spectrum of CSLD, which includes children with these same symptoms, but who lack HRCT scan evidence of bronchiectasis (either because of limited opportunity of testing or inability to meet the current HRCT scan adult criteria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Nonetheless, without treatment children with CSLD may continue to have persistent respiratory symptoms and progress to meet the radiological criteria for bronchiectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Treatment aims at resolving acute infection and/or controlling established infection and inflammation, thus improving symptoms, reducing frequency of acute pulmonary exacerbations, preserving respiratory tissue and lung function, optimising growth, and improving quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. As bacteria such as <italic>Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic> are believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of CSLD and bronchiectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] antibiotics are used to reduce the bacterial load and the associated lower airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Pulmonary exacerbations often require hospital-based treatment with intravenous antibiotics and intensive physiotherapy. Furthermore, severe pulmonary exacerbations are an independent risk factor for long-term lung function decline in children with bronchiectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Long-term use of antibiotics may provide a benefit by reducing exacerbations, but are not recommended currently as part of routine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A recent Cochrane Review of 10 randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) involving 959 children and adults with CF reported a modest improvement in pulmonary function measured as forced expiratory volume in 1-second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) after 6&#x02009;months of azithromycin, reduced pulmonary exacerbation rates and improved weight gains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Azithromycin was well tolerated and while it was associated with decreased <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> isolation rates in respiratory cultures, there was also a significant increase in macrolide resistance. In contrast, so far there are no published RCTs investigating the efficacy of long-term antibiotic use in children with non-CF bronchiectasis.</p><p>Following the methodological rigour outlined in the CONSORT statement, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] we describe the methods of our Bronchiectasis Interventional Study (BIS), a multicentre, double-blind, RCT examining the efficacy and safety of maintenance azithromycin treatment (30&#x02009;mg/kg once a week) versus placebo for 12&#x02013;24&#x02009;months in Indigenous children with non-CF bronchiectasis.</p><sec><title>Study aims</title><p>Our primary question is: among Indigenous children with bronchiectasis, can long-term (12&#x02013;24&#x02009;months) azithromycin treatment reduce the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations compared to placebo? Our secondary questions are: (i) does long-term azithromycin treatment reduce the length of hospitalised pulmonary exacerbations and severity of pulmonary exacerbations, improve growth, decrease school absenteeism, and improve respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function as measured by FEV<sub>1</sub> (&#x02265;6&#x02009;years), and sputum characteristics?

Every 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;months, each study participant is asked to attend a study clinic. In Australia, clinics are held at local community clinics in 13 Indigenous communities (5 in the northern region of the NT, 6 in central Australia, 2 in the Torres Strait). In New Zealand, clinics are held at the Starship Children&#x02019;s Health, Auckland City Hospital. Each subject receives at least 4 clinic reviews a year, including 2 by the study paediatrician and 2 by the research nurse.</p></sec><sec><title>Subject efficacy withdrawal criteria</title><p>The following intervention &#x02018;exit criteria&#x02019; (in case of &#x02018;treatment failure&#x02019;) are being used: the maximum numbers of pulmonary exacerbations allowed in any 12&#x02009;month period are either 6 episodes treated by the local clinic (as an outpatient) or 4 hospital admissions. Children meeting the exit criteria are withdrawn from the intervention study, but continue to be followed until the end of the trial period. In addition, the local clinician or local investigator is able to withdraw a participant at any time. Children withdrawn from the study will not be replaced. Children exiting the study due to excess exacerbations are offered to go onto open label medication until the end of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study medication</title><p>Azithromycin is purchased from Pfizer and rebottled by the Institute of Drug Technology (IDT, Melbourne). The placebo medication is also manufactured by IDT, Melbourne according to Australian standards and is similar in appearance, taste, smell and packaging to the active drug in order to maintain blinding during the study period. Prior to administering the trial medications, 9 mls of water is added to the bottle after piercing the aluminium foil making a total volume of 15 mls per bottle; 0.75 mls/kg (30&#x02009;mg/kg/week for azithromycin) are given once weekly (maximum of 15mls). Each bottle is used only once and it and the remaining medication are then discarded.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation, allocation and blinding</title><p>A computer generated permuted block design provided the randomisation sequences stratified by study site (Australia and New Zealand) and number of exacerbation episodes in the preceding 12&#x02009;months (1&#x02013;2 episodes vs. &#x02265;3 episodes; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). A computer generated 3 digit number was used as the randomisation identification number. A treatment code (A to F) was allocated to each randomisation number. Only the independent statistician and IDT knew the codes. An independent person at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR), Brisbane, Australia prepared individual envelopes labelled with the randomisation number and containing the corresponding treatment code inside. Allocation concealment was achieved by use of sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes. All treatment bottles are labelled identically for each child. Patients, their families, care providers and investigators collecting data are unaware of the treatment assigned to each child.</p></sec><sec><title>Administration of the study medication and compliance</title><p>In Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children included in the study predominantly live in small remote communities of 200 to 1000 people. Study medication is administered under direct supervision at the community clinics. At numerous communities, local community workers are employed to locate the children weekly and dispense study medication. They contact the study nurse weekly to advise on the details about medication adherence (children receiving medication and, if any, children are absent from the community), and any issues around administration such as vomiting, &#x0201c;spitting up&#x0201d; the medication, abdominal pain or diarrhoea.

Thus, the &#x02018;placebo&#x02019; group is expected to have 4 episodes involving hospital management during the 24-months of the trial intervention. Assuming the intervention reduces the number of pulmonary exacerbations leading to hospitalisation by 50% (from 4 to 2 episodes) and that the placebo group have a 15% reduction in hospitalised pulmonary exacerbations (from 4 to 3.4 episodes), then with 51 subjects in each group there is 95% power to detect an average difference of &#x02212;1.4 respiratory hospital admissions per subject over a 2&#x02009;year period between the intervention and placebo groups at the 5% level of significance. Importantly, these estimates used hospitalised exacerbation rates as a conservative estimate of total exacerbation rates (hospital management and those treated at the local clinic as outpatients). The sample size required to estimate the difference between the rate parameters of 2 Poisson distributions over 24&#x02009;months with 90% power was 34 observations from each sample (68 child-years at risk in each group)<bold>.</bold></p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data will be analysed using the statistical software package SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20) and presented in accordance with the CONSORT statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

Study end points experienced for each treatment group will be formally analyse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] on an "intention to treat" basis. Important potential confounders will be included in a secondary multivariate analysis. Basic descriptive summaries will be compiled for each treatment group. For continuous normally-distributed variables we will report means and compare groups using a <italic>t</italic>-test for independent samples. For non-normally-distributed data we will report medians and use non-parametric tests. If rates of exacerbation are consistent with a Poisson distribution, they will be assessed using Poisson regression. Categorical data will be analysed using the Chi-squared tests and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test (2-tailed), as appropriate. Time to first exacerbation will be assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression and graphically displayed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. In addition, Epi Info (version 3.5.3) will be utilised to calculate growth z-scores. Children will be classified as stunted or underweight if their enrolment &#x02018;height-for-age&#x02019; or &#x02018;weight-for-age&#x02019; z-scores are less than &#x02212;1.96, respectively, which indicate that the values are more than 2 standard deviations (SDs) below the corresponding population means.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Ethical approval has been obtained from the respective Human Ethics Committees of all participating institutions [Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Auckland District Health Board, the Northern Territories Department of Health and Community Services and Menzies School of Health Research, Central Australia Human Ethics Committee, and the Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Antibiotics are one of the main therapies used to treat bronchiectasis, both during acute pulmonary exacerbations, and in some patients as long-term maintenance treatment during the chronic stable phase. Based on Cole&#x02019;s &#x02018;vicious cycle&#x02019; model of the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] antibiotic treatments are recommended to reduce the bacterial load, which then decrease lower airway inflammation. Brief antibiotic interventions significantly improve airway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and systemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] inflammatory profiles, as well as improving QoL measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. For the chronic stable phase, cohort studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] support the use of prolonged antibiotics for reducing exacerbations and sputum purulence, but there are only very limited data from RCTs to justify this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>The rationale for choosing azithromycin includes its recognised antimicrobial effects, its putative <italic>in-vivo</italic> immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory actions, and its unique pharmacological properties, which suggest once weekly oral dosing (30&#x02013;40 hours half-life in children) may be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In non-CF bronchiectasis, a cohort study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and one short term RCT (6&#x02009;months) described improvement in lung function and reduction in pulmonary exacerbations when azithromycin was given to adults with bronchiectasis. In both studies, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] the exacerbation frequency rate while taking regular azithromycin was significantly reduced (count ratio 0.5-0.7). However, to date there are no RCTs beyond 6&#x02009;months and there are no studies of azithromycin in children with non-CF bronchiectasis.</p><p>The long half-life of azithromycin, allowing once weekly dosing is advantageous for adherence and even directly supervised administration, which is necessary for the feasibility and sustainability of long-term programmes involving maintenance antibiotic treatment in some settings. Any positive aspects of treatment must however be weighed against the possibility of increased antibiotic resistance amongst bacterial pathogens in the respiratory tract, particularly <italic>H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae</italic><italic>S. pyogenes</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The underlying mechanisms of macrolide resistance can confer either low or high-level resistance to individual members of this antibiotic class. Azithromycin is also associated with increased risk of resistance to other antibiotic classes, especially the beta-lactams, in respiratory bacterial flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. While resistance is problematic and treatment failure has been reported, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] macrolides still play an important role in managing many infectious diseases, including other respiratory infections, trachoma and sexually transmitted infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The current study is carefully monitoring antibiotic resistance in potential respiratory bacterial pathogens colonising the nasopharynx.</p><p>The reason for choosing pulmonary exacerbations as our primary outcome is two-fold. Firstly, in chronic respiratory disease (e.g. asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), pulmonary exacerbations are an important end point in clinical studies and most treatment strategies aim to reduce their frequency. Secondly, in a longitudinal cohort study in children with non-CF bronchiectasis, the only significant predictor of FEV<sub>1</sub> decline (over 3-yrs) was frequency of hospitalised exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. With each exacerbation, the FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted decreased significantly by 1.95% adjusted for time. In adults with bronchiectasis, the determinants of accelerated lung function decline are frequency of hospitalised exacerbations, increased systemic inflammatory markers and colonisation with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Increased mortality risk is also associated with the degree of lung function impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Thus interventions that can reduce pulmonary exacerbations are likely to be important for preventing future adult lung dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] in addition to reducing the economic and social costs associated with each episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Furthermore, recurrent exacerbations are one of the strongest predictors of poor QoL in adults with bronchiectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. This is consistent with data for asthma describing pulmonary exacerbations in childhood and adult asthma associated with accelerated FEV<sub>1</sub> decline in those not receiving preventative therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Thirdly, in children at this very young age respiratory exacerbations can be readily recorded, unlike some other outcome measures.</p><p>Strengths of our study include its randomised trial design, the inclusion of local community workers, and monitoring of adherence. This study is being undertaken in two very different settings: in Australia the study is being conducted mostly in remote, rural Indigenous communities with limited healthcare provision, while in New Zealand the study is being performed in a tertiary hospital in a large urban setting. The study design should help to reduce the potential limitation of heterogeneity in study settings by stratifying by site during randomisation and also by using standardised inclusion/exclusion criteria and data collection procedures and forms. Regular meetings between research personnel to discuss data collection issues and study progress should also help to ensure very good standardisation of the data collection procedures across study sites. The use of local community workers to aid recruitment, administer study medicine and address adherence directly will also assist in the successful conduct of the study. In Australia and New Zealand, study medication is administered to participants under direct supervision by either health clinic or study personnel, and the details about adherence and any issues around administration are carefully recorded on standard forms. This ensures good documentation of adherence with study medication.</p><p>A potential limitation of our study is that it is underpowered for small differences between groups. Nevertheless, even though our final enrolment of participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;89) was less than the calculated target (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;102), it still provides 90% power to detect statistically significant differences between the intervention and placebo groups.</p><p>Internationally, Indigenous children continue to have very high rates of chronic respiratory diseases, including bronchiectasis. If efficacious, a treatment regime of maintenance azithromycin to reduce the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations in Indigenous children with CSLD, including non-CF bronchiectasis is attractive as it is simple to administer It could substantially improve the prognosis of Indigenous children with bronchiectasis and would be a substantial advance in the treatment of these infants and children.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ABC, PCV, PSM, KG, PJT, CAB, IBM and PAB contributed to the study design.
